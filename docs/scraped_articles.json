          "text": "THE faceoff between the Senator Kabiru Marafa-led faction of the Zamfara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress and the National Secretariat, took a turn for the worse on Monday.\n\nThis followed a threat issued by the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee to expel Marafa and his supporters for alleged insubordination and indiscipline.\n\nThe threat was contained in a statement titled, \u2018APC didn\u2019t suspend ward congresses in Zamfara State\u2019, signed by the National Secretary of the CEONCPC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe Party urges Sen. Marafa and his cohorts not to reduce the political issues to a contest of personalities but submit to party supremacy and internal dispute resolution structures adequately provided for by the APC Constitution.\n\n\u201cAnything outside this amounts to insubordination and indiscipline and the APC constitution is very clear on this.\u201d\n\nArticle 21 (D) of the APC Constitution 2014 (As amended), empowers the party leadership to impose sanctions including expulsion on members depending on the gravity of their offence.\n\nAkpanudoedehe accused Marafa of making \u201cuninformed and misguided\u201d comments regarding the Zamfara State APC congresses.\n\nHe said, \u201cAfter, evaluation and consultations, the Committee, in a letter dated 10th November, 2021 was okayed to proceed with the conduct of the Zamfara State Ward Congresses on Saturday 13th, November 2021, which Sen. Marafa participated.\n\n\u201cThis had nothing to do with the 21 days\u2019 notice for the conduct of Wards, Local Government Areas and State Congresses in Zamfara State earlier sent to the Independent National Electoral Commission, which subsists.\u201d\n\nIn a statemen titled, \u201cNo grandstanding: Respond to issues raised by Senator Marafa against Buni,\u201d signed by the factional State Publicity Secretary, Bello Maradun, said, \u201cIn his courageous and issues-driven politics, Sen. Kabiru Marafa, raised pertinent points that undermined the legality of the APC National leadership under Mai-Mala Buni while equally providing the rationale for his APC-led faction to conduct a parallel congress.\n\n\u201cIt is interesting that the issues raised by Senator Marafa did not sit well with the so-called caretaker leadership of APC under Mai-Mala Buni.\n\n\u201cWe consider it imperative for Mai-Mala and his co-travelers on the road to perdition to what the famous boxing champion Muhammad Ali says \u201cBragging is when a man says what he can\u2019t do. I do what I say\u2019.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "* Launch Vaccine Access Programme in Abuja\n\nBy Joseph Erunke\n\nABUJA-AS increasing number of cervical cancer has become a thing of worry across the world,wives of former and current governors in the country have called on the World Health Organisation, WHO, pharmaceutical companies and policy makers in high income countries to prioritize girls\u2019 access to HPV vaccination through primary healthcare structures.\n\nThis came as they said it was \u201cpainfully unacceptable that millions of Nigerian and African adolescent girls do not have access to HPV vaccination through our primary healthcare structures.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO:Reps Member, Olododo Empowers 500 constituent members with tools worth over N300M\n\nThe governors\u2019 wives, operating under the aegis of First Ladies Against Cancer,FLAC,are set to launch a programme, tagged:\u201dFLAC Vaccine Access Programme\u201d,today in Abuja, today, the 16th of November, 2021.\n\nThe programme, according to a statement by the group, aims at not only increasing awareness but also driving demand, and most of all providing access to HPV vaccines in the country.\n\n\u201cIt remains painfully unacceptable that millions of Nigerian and African adolescent girls do not have access to HPV vaccination through our primary healthcare structures.\n\n\u201d We must place a demand on the pharmaceutical industry, WHO, policymakers in high income countries, and the African Union to prioritize our girls and address the drivers of this inequity.\n\n\u201cWe at FLAC will be at the forefront of this call to action as we launch the \u201cFLAC Vaccine Access Programme\u201d on the 16th of November, which aims\n\nto increase awareness, drive demand, and most of all provide access to HPV vaccines in our states,\u201dFLAC said.\n\nAccording to the group,\u201dOur vaccine access programme will catalyze access to HPV vaccine for families that can afford out of pocket payment in the immediate term and at the same time, advocating for inclusion of HPV vaccine\n\ninto routine immunization to cater for those that can\u2019t afford out of pocket payment.\u201d\n\nNoting that,\u201dIt has been 365 days since the launch of the Global Strategy to Accelerate the Elimination of Cervical Cancer by the World Health Organization\u201d, the group commended \u201cthe renewed commitment of all cervical cancer advocates in Nigeria, the Federal Ministry of Health,international and indigenous partners to deliver on the stated objectives of this strategy by 2030: To achieve 90% HPV vaccination coverage, 70% screening coverage, and 90% access to treatment for cervical pre-cancer and cancer.\u201d\n\nAccording to FLAC,\u201dIn Nigeria, cervical cancer is the 3rd most common form of cancer and 2nd most common among women.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt accounted for 9.7% of all malignancies in 2020, recording an estimated 12,075 new cases and 7,968 deaths annually.\n\n\u201cThese numbers tell the unfortunate reality of cervical cancer in Nigeria and\n\nmost African countries, a cancer that is largely preventable, treatable and can be eliminated.\n\n\u201cAs we emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic, the commitment of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to\n\ncancer care assures us that equitable access to quality services is achievable by 2030,\u201dit said.\n\nThe statement read further:\u201dAlbeit, we had hoped that at the time of this commemoration, HPV vaccines would be available on the nation\u2019s routine immunization schedule.\n\n\u201cGlobal supply chain challenges and inequalities of access have deferred this critical milestone in our elimination roadmap.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, we are glad to see that the federal government is delivering on interventions within its control like the Cancer Health Fund which has now\n\nincreased access to diagnostic and treatment services across the country through 6 tertiary cancer care centres evenly distributed across geopolitical zones.\u201d\n\nThe group said,\u201dWe will start this with a series of townhall meetings on cervical cancer prevention, screening and awareness through our community outreach programme.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese town hall events will be held in our individual states on the 17th of November 2021.\n\n\u201cOur continued partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO) and Clinton Health Access\n\nInitiative (CHAI) is delivering routine cervical cancer screening and treatment of precancerous lesions through public health facilities to 10,000 women following a scale-up of the CHAI led program to include Kebbi and Niger states.\n\n\u201cThis intervention approach is building the capacity of our health systems to sustain these services, we are grateful to the two state governments, as well as both organizations.\n\n\u201cIt is our prayer that we continue on this journey in the coming year to reach more women across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Global Cancer Observatory: GLOBOCAN 2020 Nigeria Population and Cancer Fact Sheets; 2020.\n\n\u201cWe call on global and national actors critical to delivering cervical cancer elimination to borrow from the positives of the COVID-19 pandemic response.\n\n\u201cWhen words translate into urgent actions, we have favourable outcomes.\n\n\u201d Accelerating the elimination of cervical cancer requires greater political will and\n\nglobal cooperation that will prioritize improved access to HPV vaccines for low and middle income countries.\n\n\u201cFLAC will continue to pay close attention to the implementation of the global strategy, offering our support to bring about the desired outcomes in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nRecall that First Ladies Against Cancer,FLAC,is a coalition of the spouses of current and former state governors of Nigeria working to address gaps in the cancer continuum of care; increasing awareness, facilitating access to screening and treatment services, and advocating for the implementation of policies that will deliver equitable access to quality cancer care services irrespective of where you are located in Nigeria.",

Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Oct. 19, 2020 inaugurated the Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate alleged cases of brutality and human rights violations perpetrated by the Police and operatives of the dissolved Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).\n\nThe panel was also saddled with the investigation of the alleged shootings that took place on Oct. 20, 2020, at the Lekki Tollgate.",

report read: \u201cThe atrocious maiming and killing of unarmed, helpless and unresisting protesters, while sitting on the floor and waving their Nigerian flags, while singing the National Anthem can be equated to a \u2018massacre\u2019 in context.\u201d\n\nIn page 295: \u201cIt was alleged and corroborated that the soldiers had their vans parked at the Lekki Toll Gate and removed as many bodies and corpses of the fallen protesters which they took away with their vans.\u201d\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cthe Nigerian Army was invited for intervention in the State and was deployed to Lekki Toll Gate on the 20th of October 2020.\n\n\u201cAt the Lekki Toll Gate, officers of the Nigerian Army shot, injured and killed unarmed helpless and defenseless protesters, without provocation or justification, while they were waving the Nigerian Flag and singing the National Anthem and the manner of assault and killing could, in context, be described as a massacre.\n\n\u201cThe Panel also found that the conduct of the Nigerian Army was exacerbated by its refusal to allow ambulances render medical assistance to victims who required such assistance.\n\n\u201cThe Army was also found not to have adhered to its own Rules of Engagement.\n\n\u201cThe Panel found that the Nigerian Police Force deployed its officers to the Lekki Toll Gate on the night of the 20th October, 2020 and between that night and the morning of the 21st of October, 2020, its officer shot at, assaulted and battered unarmed protesters, which led to injuries and deaths.\n\n\u201cThe police officers also tried to cover up their actions by picking up bullets.\n\n\u201cThe panel found that LCC hampered the panel\u2019s investigation by refusing to turn over some useful and vital information/evidence as requested by the Panel and the Forensic Expert engaged by the panel, even where such information and evidence was by the company\u2019s admission, available.\n\n\u201cIt manipulated the incomplete CCTV Video footage of the Lekki Toll Gate on the night of the 20th of October 2020, which it tendered before the Panel.\n\n\u201cThe Panel found that there was an invitation of the Nigerian Army to Lagos State made by the Lagos State Government through the Governor before the hierarchy of the Nigerian Army deployed its soldiers to the Lekki Toll Gate on the night of the 20th of October.\n\n\u201cThe Panel found that there was an attempt to cover up the Incident of the 20th of October by the cleaning of the Lekki Toll Gate and the failure to preserve the scene ahead of potential investigations.\n\n32 Recommendations\n\n\u201cUpon the above key findings amongst others, the Panel made a total of 32 Recommendations, which included but not limited to:\n\n\u201cHolistic Police Reforms covering welfare, training and proper equipping of Policemen and their working environment;\n\n\u201cSanctioning of the officers of the Nigerian Army and the Nigerian Police Force respectively who participated in shooting, injuring and killing of unarmed protestors at the Lekki Toll Gate on the 20 and 21st of October 2020;\n\n\u201cDevelopment of more robust engagement between the Youth and the Government;\n\n\u201cSetting up of a Standing Committee/Tribunal to deal with cases of Violation of Human Rights by security agencies and a trust fund to settle compensation awarded by such committee/tribunal;\n\n\u201cA public apology to ENDSARS protesters who were killed, injured and traumatized by the Incident of the 20th of October 2020;\n\n\u201cThe memorialization of the Lekki Toll Gate and the 20th of October going forward.\n\n\u201cThe recognition of Hospitals and Medical Doctors who played heroic roles following the Incident of the Lekki Toll Gate on the 20th of October 2020 thereby saving lives and minimizing the impact of the injuries suffered by the victims, most of which were on a pro-bono basis;\n\n\u201cThe Panel recommended various sums of compensation to victims of the Lekki Toll Gate Incident, which must be expeditious in order to accelerate the healing process.\n\n\u201cThe Panel recommended that any data that may have been generated over the years on the impunity of the Police across Nigeria be studied and deployed as early warning signs (EWS) mechanism.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Roberts said this in her address at a 2-day Service Innovation roundtable discussion organized for Heads of departments and divisions in charge of innovation, service wide, yesterday in Abuja.\n\nShe lamented that quality service delivery had been relegated in service, thus giving room for corruption, nepotism, abuse and lack of confidence in government.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cthe world that we live in is now described as vuca-volatile \u2013 uncertain, complex and ambiguous. The world we were born into no longer exist and a shift is no longer a choice.\u201d\n\nShe recalled that one of the eight pillars of Federal Civil Service Strategy and Implementation Plan (FCSSIP) 2017 -2020 was to improve service delivery through innovation with various activities, such as promotion of annual innovation challenge to cultivate ideas, development of entrepreneurship culture and commercial orientation, amongst staff.\n\nDr. Yemi-Esan expressed delight at past innovation competitions where women were among the top on the winners list. This further portrays the fact that inclusion of women in the public sector innovation leads to better outcomes she added.\n\nShe also highlighted some of the innovations in the Public Service to include the New Performance Management System (PMS) and the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) developed in conjunction with the African Initiative for Governance (AIG). This manual, according to the HOS, will enable seamless transition to Enterprise Content Management Solutions (ECMS) for effective communication service wide.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Permanent Secretary, Service Policies and Strategies Office, Dr. Emmanuel Meribole said the Nigerian civil service is geared towards a world class service for accelerated national development.\n\nFor the service to achieve this, some old traditions such as bureaucracy and greed must give way to new attitude as encapsulated in the Federal Civil Service Strategies and Implementation Plan 2021-2025 for an improved performance in the service.\n\nDr. Meribole further emphasized the need to employ creative ideas in solving old and emerging problems within the service.\n\nThe 2-day workshop was organized by the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation in conjunction with Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, KAS.",

          "text": "Top businesses, especially in the manufacturing and oil and gas sectors, are finding it difficult repaying dollar loans they took from banks when naira was stable, The Nation has learnt.\n\nThe naira has come under intense pressure in recent months, hitting N570 to a dollar at the parallel market before its gradual recovery with oil prices rising above $83 per barrel.\n\nThe borrowers are contending with a naira-dollar exchange rate mismatch between the time the dollar loans were taken and presently.\n\nOne of the key players in the oil and gas sector, Kola Adesina, said his company, Sahara Power Group, took dollar loans at a period when the naira was stronger, but faced a major crisis in a repayment following naira\u2019s fall against the dollar.\n\nHe said that banks are also reviewing loan pricing for risks and dealing with currency mismatch problems faced by many of their customers that borrowed in foreign currency.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAdesina spoke at the FBNQuest webinar held at the weekend with the theme \u2018Mobilising Onshore and Offshore Capital for Strategic Infrastructure Projects in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAccess to capital is challenging and difficult. Banks are reviewing pricing for risks and loans. We have secured cheap capital but suffered currency mismatch because of the loans we took in dollars. Revenue has not increased in line with exchange rate changes. \u201d\n\nThe Managing Director of Sahara Power Group said the company is, however, exploring traditional and non-traditional approaches in resolving the dollar loan challenge.\n\n\u201cWe are resilient. We did not expect the current naira volatility at the point of borrowing but we are sitting down and resolving it with the banks,\u201d Adesina added.\n\nA director at African Development Bank, Martin Orji, said Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) should work together to deploy cheap capital to Africa to support their continent\u2019s businesses.\n\nHe said there are legal frameworks that allow DFIs to collaborate and pull capital together to support businesses in the continent.\n\nDespite the challenges, the naira last week strengthened against the dollar on the unofficial market, appreciating to N560 from N563.5 at the previous week\u2019s close.\n\nThis followed rising crude oil prices and reduced demand for the greenback.\n\nTrading Desk Manager, AZA, global forex dealer, Murega Mungai, projects that given buoyant oil prices and the easing of dollar demand, the naira could hold steady in the coming week.\n\nHowever, the local currency has lost over 28 per cent of its value this year due to dollar scarcity and a decline in crude oil earnings.\n\nGlobal Chief Economist at Renaissance Capital, an investment bank focusing on emerging and frontier markets, Charlie Robertson noted that the Nigerian economy has been going through a rough patch since 2014 when the price of oil crashed.\n\nHe explained that a persistently high inflation rate means a persistently weak currency.\n\nAccording to him, using the Real Effective Exchange Rate methodology, an approach used to determine the value of a currency vis-\u00e0-vis a basket of other currencies based on the relative trade balance, the naira is overvalued \u201cby a good 20 to 30 percent\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf the central bank can get inflation to three percent and sticks there, then in 10 years the naira could be N400/N450 per dollar. So it\u2019s all about inflation and the central bank\u2019s success in fighting it,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Managing Director, Afrinvest West Africa Plc, Ike Chioke, believes the incorporation of a long-term diversified strategy in fiscal policy is required to cushion shocks in various segments of the economy.\n\nFor him, the persistent pressure on the naira could have been minimised if a counter fiscal policy had been developed, as the CBN cannot continue to defend the naira with foreign reserves.\n\n\u201cTo reduce this pressure, an inward-looking policy (tax incentives, infrastructure development, and production subsidy) should be emphasised to reduce the dependence on imported goods,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "From Noah Ebije, Kaduna and Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nKaduna-based Islamic Scholar, Ahmad Gumi, has built schools for herdsmen in Kaduna forest as part of measures to stop banditry and insecurity generally.\n\nHe said insecurity in the country, particularly banditry, could become a thing of the past as bandits were ready to drop their arms if education opportunities and other basic amenities are provided for Fulani herdsmen at the grassroots.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nHe stated this while on inspection tour of Sheikh Uthman Bin Fodio Centre, a school built by Sheikh Gumi funded Mosque Foundation Limited, at Kagarko Grazing Reserve near Kohoto Village in Kagarko Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nGumi said if the centre designed to educate the herdsmen is replicated everywhere in the country, Nigerians would live in peace, adding that, instead of spending billions on military hardware to fight bandits, Nigeria should spend such money on schools and teachers.\n\nThe Islamic scholar said he had spoken with bandits and they have expressed willingness to drop their arms and embrace peace, if their children could be given education and other social amenities.\n\n\u201cWhat motivated me to start this project was to solve the insecurity problem we have from the root because every crime has its perpetrators and every perpetrators are drawn from a pool so we want to go there and dry the pool and we found out that education is the best cure.\n\n\u201cIf they are educated, they will not be doing what they are doing. So, we say we must take education to the grassroots and we embarked on the project to also be an example for others, local governments, states and federal and rich individuals even cooperative societies to come together and make sure we are directed across the forest to know what we can do to carter for nomads; it does not cost much, very little and it will help to educate them and we will live peacefully with them.\n\n\u201cWhat we have here is centre containing six classrooms that can be used for primary, secondary schools and at various times, you can teach all categories at all times and the place will be engaged for 24 hours because the herdsmen usually take their cattle out by 10am and bring them back by dawn or sunset so they have two hours before they take their cattle away and we have two to three hours because we like to put some solar light so that they can read from 8 to 10 in the night so that the herder can go and come back.\n\n\u201cWe have schools, we have hospital and also showing them how to grind the foliage which they can use to feed their animals, some of them don\u2019t need to go out because those things are so cheap and farmers are throwing those things away. Soon, farmers will start charging for it. If we can duplicate this everywhere, Nigerians will live in peace.\u201d\n\nOn whether or not he said Nigeria will no longer exist if bandits are declared as terrorists, he said: \u201cIt is a quotation out of contest. I didn\u2019t say there will be no Nigeria, I said Islam recognises religious terrorism so if we allow the herdsmen to turn into religious fanatic and extremist, it will not be good for us as a nation.\n\n\u201cAbout 99 percent of the herdsmen are not into banditry but if you turn it into religious struggle, they will just go there committing crime, so it is not good to label them as terrorist because it will profile all herdsmen as terrorist because you are attaching it to herdsmen, you are not attaching it to an organisation and if you say herdsmen are terrorist Nigeria will have problem, the whole course will be on fire, the North, South and East will be on fire and nothing will remain of Nigeria if everywhere is on fire.\u201d\n\nGumi said though the construction of the centre is ongoing, the three tiers of government can come in and partner on training the herdsmen on how they can be economically viable. \u201cWe want Nigerians to know that the herdsman is the most peaceful. For those that have used banditry and criminality to express their grievances, we want them to know there is another way. We call on the three tiers of government, corporate organisations and public spirited individuals to support in bringing development to the grassroots,\u201d he said.\n\nIn their separate speeches, Fulani Chief of the community, Ardo Ahmed Tahiru, Imam Tafa Dahiru and Christian cleric in the community, Luka Mai Ungwar, commended Gumi for the gesture, stressing that the project has united the community and they are all full of joy.\n\nHowever, former president of Aka Ikenga, Chief Goddy Uwazuruike, has slammed Sheik Ahmad Gumi over his recent comment that providing schools for herdsmen and bandits will help curb insecurity in the country. He is of the opinion that Gumi should start exposing them instead of rehabilitating them, even as he added that such education is already provided for to the northerners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tomfoolery of the highest order, schools are regulated and organised by states and federal government\u2026where does his own stand? Is it a private school?\n\n\u201cHe knows the truth about the bandits, so once in a while, he wants to create a diversion from what is going on. Building a school for what? They have Islamic school, western education, I think he is looking for relevance in the society. I know there is nomadic schools. When Jonathan came, he elevated them,\u201d Uwazuruike said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

It is only in the urban centres that you get meters for free.\n\nBut even at this, consumers cannot have access to the meters because the demand is far more than the supply,\u2019\u2019.\n\nOlubiyo said the Federal Government will require over N500 billion to provide meters for unmetered Nigerians.\n\nHe lamented that all efforts to get the regulator to address this latest increase has been difficult, saying similar to past increases in electricity tariff, the regulator is always evasive.\n\nThe consumer rights activist said the operations of the regulator is opaque, saying most time they are never willing to engage the public or consumers on some of its policy decision.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

But all challenges are surmountable if both the public and private sectors collaborate,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further, he said, \u201cAs we implement, we must ensure that we create jobs and enhance revenues for all parties. We must leverage on one another\u2019s strengths to succeed.\u201d\n\nThe President also said business people must key into existing regional value chains or build new ones, either to extend operations into the higher value segments of their industries or to satisfy the area\u2019s rules of origin requirements.\n\nNoting that Free Trade must also be fair, Buhari said fairness can only be achieved when there is full compliance with regulations especially those relating to rules of origin.\n\n\u201cThe Intra-Africa Trade Fair is uniquely positioned to help in these areas,\u201d he added.\n\nCommenting on the benefits of the Trade Fair, Buhari said, \u201cThrough these gatherings, we will be laying a solid foundation for future business-to-business, business and government, and government to government co-operation.\u201d\n\nAssuring participants that Nigeria came to Durban in full force to actively participate in the trade fair and take full advantage of all the opportunities it provides.\n\nThe President, while assuring participants that Nigeria is open for business, said: \u201cWe have streamlined the country\u2019s participation under one-roof to enable you access all the information you need.\n\n\u201cAs many of you are aware, in the past five years, Nigeria has made significant strides towards the diversification of her economy from an oil revenue dependent country to a nation with diverse revenue sources.\n\n\u201cWe were able to achieve this by putting in place fiscal, monetary and trade policies that support investments and investors in key sectors such as Agriculture, Mining, Telecommunications and Digital Economy, Banking and Financial services, tourism, and manufacturing.\n\n\u201cWe also introduced reforms in key institutions as well as policies to fight corruption and ease the way of doing business in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe congratulated the African Union Commission, the AFCFTA Secretariat and the Africa Export Import Bank for their dedication and relentless effort in seeing this very worthy initiative become a reality.\n\nHe also commended the people of Durban for hosting this year\u2019s intra-African trade fair and expressed hope that it will witness milestone agreements among African businesses at this gathering.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Muhammadu Buhari\n\nYour Excellency, Mr. President, I wish to specifically thank you for inviting me to attend this programme. Let me at the outset, convey on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria and myself, our deepest condolences on the passing of the former president of South Africa, Mr. Frederik Willem de Klerk.\n\n2. Together with former President Mandela, they gave birth to a new South Africa. I send my condolences to his family and friends.\n\n3. \u200bToday is a great day for Africa as we start our collaborative journey towards collective economic prosperity through the African Continental Free Trade Area. I very much look forward to seeing more African products manufactured in Africa using African resources.\n\n4. Let me start by congratulating the African Union Commission, the AFCFTA Secretariat and the Africa Export Import Bank for their dedication and relentless effort in seeing this very worthy initiative become a reality.\n\n5. I, also commend the people of Durban for hosting this year\u2019s intra-African trade fair. I sincerely hope that we will witness milestone agreements among African businesses at this gathering.\n\n6. Through these gatherings, we will be laying a solid foundation for future business-to-business, business and government, and government to government co-operation.\n\n7. Most of Africa\u2019s existing challenges, whether security, economy or corruption, can be traced to our inability over the years to domesticate the production of our most basic requirements and provide jobs to our teeming and dynamic youth population.\n\n8. Under the African Continental Free Trade Area, we can double our intra-Africa trade by 2030, reduce our reliance on imports and therefore create more jobs within the continent.\n\n9. We cannot achieve this goal by talking alone. The implementation will be a difficult journey. But all challenges are surmountable if both the public and private sectors collaborate.\n\n10. On the public sector side, Governments must support local entrepreneurs to build scale and therefore improve productivity.\n\n11. This means providing incentives to encourage our businesses to formalise and comply with laid down regulations.\n\n12. Free Trade must also be Fair. And fairness can only be achieved when there is full compliance with regulations especially those relating to rules of origin.\n\n13. The AFCFTA is for \u201cmade-in-Africa\u201d products and services.\n\n15. Let me assure you that Nigeria has come to Durban in full force to actively participate in this very important trade fair and take full advantage of all the opportunities it provides.\n\n16. We have streamlined the country\u2019s participation under one-roof to enable you access all the information you need.\n\n17. As many of you are aware, in the past five years, Nigeria has made significant strides towards the diversification of her economy from an oil revenue dependent country to a nation with diverse revenue sources.\n\n18. We were able to achieve this by putting in place fiscal, monetary and trade policies that support investments and investors in key sectors such as Agriculture, Mining, Telecommunications and Digital Economy, Banking and Financial services, tourism, and manufacturing.\n\n19. \u200bWe also introduced reforms in key institutions as well as policies to fight corruption and ease the way of doing business in Nigeria.\n\n20. Ladies and Gentlemen, Nigeria is open for business.\n\n21. I wish you all a very successful trade fair.\n\nThank you all and God Bless Africa and its people.\n\n*Full text of the address by President Muhammadu Buhari at the opening ceremony of the Intra-African Trade Fair 2021 at Durban, South Africa on Monday, Novermber 15, 2021\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*From Saudi Arabia, France, now South Africa, president wooing investors\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nWith 559 days to the end of his tenure, a normally reticent President Muhammadu Buhari has come out of his shell, flying from one investment summit to another in aggressive pursuit of foreign investors.\n\nNigerians are currently seeing a different Buhari who is eager to document his achievements at every stop on his international investment drive.\n\nIn France last week, when he hosted Managing Director of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), Dr. Mohammed Al-Jasser, and Chief Executive Officer of Total Energies, Patrick Pouyanne, among other global CEOs, Buhari had said, \u201cWe need roads, rail, power, airports, housing, and that is what we have engaged ourselves with in the past six years.\n\n\u201cAnd our people are seeing the new developments. Relative to the resources available to us, we have not done badly.\n\n\u201cWhat we are so dependent on (crude oil) has lost a lot of energy. It is coming back gradually, and we are breathing a bit more with some confidence. But we expect greater cooperation from you.\u201d\n\nThe president has been on an unusually aggressive investment promotion push in the past three weeks, moving from Saudi Arabia, to France and, presently, South Africa, as he markets the country\u2019s business opportunities to global investors in the quest to attract foreign direct investments (FDIs).\n\nBuhari departed Paris, the French capital, at the weekend to join other African leaders in South Africa for the opening ceremony of the second Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF) 2021. The trade expo is expected to attract $40 billion investments to the continent. The president is attending the event on the special invitation of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nThe event, holding from today to November 21, is convened by the African Export-Import Bank (AFREXIM), in collaboration with the African Union Commission (AUC) and the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat.\n\nThe fair, with the theme, \u201cBuilding Bridges for a Successful AfCFTA,\u201d is aimed at boosting trade and investment across the African continent.\n\nIt also promises to create the enabling environment for businesses to thrive across the African continent; bring to fruition the lofty ideas behind the creation of AfCFTA by providing the platform to further identify and proffer solutions to challenges militating against intra-African trade; and generate market information needed to connect buyers and sellers throughout the continent.\n\nWhile in Paris, the president took part in a one-day Nigeria International Partnership Forum, with focus on, \u201cBeyond the Pandemic,\u201d as well as the Peace Forum, both of which afforded him the opportunity to market Nigeria to the world. These investment meetings came few days after the president returned from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he also participated in a three-day investment conference organised by the Future Investment Initiative Institute.\n\nIn France, top government officials as well as captains of industry in the country discussed business opportunities in Nigeria, with participants agreeing that the country needs massive infrastructure growth to have a seat among the world\u2019s industrialised nations.\n\nSome senior government functionaries and businessmen who took part in one of the panel discussions broadcast on Arise News Channel, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, included Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Power, Aliyu Abubakar; Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva; Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Ali Pantami; and Minister of State, Transportation, Gbemisola Saraki.\n\nOthers were Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari; Chairman, BUA Group and President of the France-Nigeria Business Council, Abdul Samad Rabiu; Founder, Zenith Bank Plc, Jim Ovia; Chief Executive, Oando, Wale Tinubu; and President, African Export-Import Bank, Dr Benedict Oramah.\n\nSamad, speaking at the Nigeria International Partnership Forum, tagged \u201cBeyond the Pandemic\u201d, explained that Nigeria sat atop billions of tonnes of mineral resources. For instance, he said, the country only produced 30 million tonnes of its five billion tonnes reserves.\n\nHe stated that although opportunities abounded in the country, the dearth of infrastructure remained a big problem, explaining, for instance, that transporting a container load of products from China to Lagos is cheaper than shipping the same items from Lagos to Kano.\n\nThe BUA chief executive argued that he shut down some of the company\u2019s production plants in the country because of the lack of power supply, noting that a lot of foreign investments would be required in the sector.\n\nSamad stated, \u201cWe are sitting on billions of tonnes of different mineral resources. If you look at limestone, the area that I represent, because I have plants in Nigeria, Nigeria is sitting on over 4-5 billion tonnes of limestone. Today, we are producing about 30 million tonnes of cement, that is a combination of all the companies that are in Nigeria and scattered all over the country.\u201d\n\nHe added that Nigeria was one of about 12 countries sitting on iron ore, gas, and coal, yet it remained the only country not producing steel and spent $2.5 billion annually importing the commodity.\n\nSamad said, \u201cYet, with $2.5 billion, you wi,ll be able to set up a plant of 1.5 to 2 million tonnes per annum, which means that with that amount of money that you spend annually importing steel, you will be able to set up a plant that will be processing steel forever and, therefore, won\u2019t need to spend that money every year.\n\n\u201cYou know, because without infrastructure, there is nothing you can do. Today, believe it or not, it is cheaper to transport a container from China to Lagos than to transport the container from Lagos to Kano. And that is the truth. Even though you know freight rates have gone up and that is because we do not have proper infrastructure at the ports.\n\n\u201cWe have only about three ports, so we need to improve on these areas. But all these things need finance. And unless, of course, we are able to get finance and be able to do these things, it will be very difficult.\u201d\n\nKyari stated that the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) presented another opportunity for Nigeria, stressing that the current high oil and gas prices are only a reflection of the imbalance between demand and supply.\n\nHe said, \u201cSupply is not meeting demand today. As we all may be aware, today, global demand is at levels above pre-COVID levels. It is about 100 million bpd.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Pantami stressed that Nigeria remained the economic gateway to West Africa, with over 200 million people. He said the rest of West Africa was just about the same population with Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the entire continent of Africa has a population of approximately 1.3 billion people,\u201d Pantami stated. He added, \u201cBeing in Nigeria, you are relatively at the centre. And you will have proximity to other parts of Africa, particularly when it comes to investing in Information and Communications Technology (ICT).\n\n\u201cAs we all know that the youth are the digital natives. They understand ICT better than any other category. In Nigeria, you will discover that the average age in our country is 18.1 years old. By implication, our population has been dominated by the youth and they are digital natives.\n\n\u201cIn addition, this makes Nigeria to be the 14th youngest country in the world, as it is today. So, these are some of the benefits we have in Nigeria, in addition to cheap labour, and many more and the cosmopolitan nature of the country.\u201d\n\nWhile underscoring the need for foreign investment, Ovia recalled that when the telecommunications industry began to grow in Nigeria, the then Econet brought its technology from Zimbabwe, a much smaller country, while MTN brought its own from South Africa. He lamented that today, while tele-density was 100 per cent, broadband technology deployments remained at 40 per cent, stressing that there\u2019s still tremendous opportunity in technology.\n\nOando boss, Tinubu stated that Nigeria had shown that it could be transparent in business, pointing that the open nature of the GSM bidding process in the early 2000s confirmed that Nigeria was capable of doing the right thing.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe had a very simple, transparent advertisement for GSM licences, in the newspapers and on the radio. You paid a $20 million deposit to bid for licence. Now, this is an environment, which always was chastised that it\u2019s a corrupt country, which nothing ever happens.\n\n\u201cWe had a licence, bid for it, we won, $285 million and a group of young people started a GSM company, which rolled out. Today, it is a 30 million, 40 million line company. We have 120 million active GSM lines in Nigeria and one of the highest tele-densities in the world. There is skill in Nigeria and there is a market.\u201d\n\nSpeaking also, President of Africaxim Bank, Oramah, argued that as long as Nigeria remained in the lower rungs of the value chain, it will never experience high economic growth.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo, what is the way out you may ask? I have no fresh insights to bring because we have discussed these same problems over and over again. But what we must do is begin to do what we always understand are the solutions.\n\n\u201cAnd I think the one clear way out is that we must begin to trade more with ourselves. In fact, I don\u2019t think we need a rocket scientist to give us a solution. The solution is that we must all start doing, instead of just talking about problems and solutions.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Declares loyalty to constitution, president\n\n*Neutralises 37 terrorists in Uba-Askira\u2019s reprisal\n\n*Fintiri mourns Gen. Zirkusu, other soldiers killed in Chibok\n\n*Ndume alleges ISWAP regrouping in Lake Chad\n\nDeji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Daji Sani in Yola\n\nThe country\u2019s military authorities declared at the weekend that the armed forces remained loyal to the constitution and President Muhammadu Buhari and, therefore, had no plans to overthrow his administration. They were reacting to reports claiming that the Defence Headquarters had warned soldiers against overthrowing Buhari.\n\nWhile dismissing claims that it issued such warning, the military said it did not require that caution because the loyalty of the officers and men to the constitution and the president was never in doubt.\n\nThe killing of the Commander, 28 Task Force Brigade, Chibok, Brigadier-General Dzarma Zirkushi, and three soldiers in an ambush in Uba-Askira, Borno State, weekend, also triggered a fierce response by the military, as troops battled and battered the terrorists, killing 37 of them.\n\nBut Adamawa State Governor, Hon. Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, expressed his condolences to the families and colleagues of Zirkusu and the three soldiers killed in the fight against insurgency in Chibok.\n\nMeanwhile, former Senate Leader, Ali Ndume, declared that the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) terrorists were currently regrouping in Lake Chad.\n\nDenying the coup report, the Defence Headquarters warned that it would deal decisively with any individual or group of persons out to tarnish the image of the military. It asked those it called mischief-makers to desist from dragging the military into partisanship.\n\nA statetment by Acting Director, Directorate of Defence, Media Operations (DDMO), Brig Gen Bernard Onyeuko, said, \u201cThe military high command hereby warns all mischief makers and their proxies not to draw the military into their engagements. The Armed Forces of Nigeria remains apolitical and would not hesitate to deal decisively with any person or group of persons that want to tarnish its image or draw it into partisan politics.\n\n\u201cThe Armed Forces of Nigeria remains loyal to President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, and also sworn to defend our democracy as well the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nArmy spokesman, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, in another statement, said, \u201cThe attention of the Defence Headquarters has been drawn to a misleading publication by an online newspaper, Naija News House, on Nigeria military warning politicians and officers against a coup which it credited to\n\n\u201cThe publication is a handiwork of mischief makers and enemies of the state. It is a deliberate and calculated attempt to mislead the general public aimed at causing disharmony in the polity.\n\n\u201cThe online newspaper manipulated with the intent of disinformation a previous message released in May 2021 by the then Director Defence Information, who is the current Army spokesperson. It is a malicious attempt to bring the military to disrepute. It is obvious that the online newspaper has its own sinister intention to cause confusion.\u201d\n\nNwachukwu said the report, titled \u201cDefence Headquarters warns soldiers against overthrowing Buhari\u2019s regime,\u201d was unfounded and the statement did not emanate from the Directorate of Army Public Relations headed by him.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIn any case, officers and soldiers of the Nigerian Army do not need to be \u2018warned against overthrowing Buhari\u2019s government\u2019 as their loyalty to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces has never been in doubt. The Nigerian Army is a reputable national and patriotic institution that has fully subordinated itself to civil authority, having stood unwaveringly in defence of the nation\u2019s democracy.\u201d\n\nThe statement further affirmed, \u201cThe Nigerian Army will continue to be steadfast in defending Nigeria\u2019s constitution and the much cherished democracy by providing aid to the civil authority, whenever it is called upon to so do.\u201d\n\nIt contended that the said publication, which was riddled with outrageous lies and fabrications claimed that the \u201cDefence Headquarters had denounced a call for the military to take over the reins of power. The online outlet went further to attribute its falsehood to Army Spokesman, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu.\n\n\u201cThe only reason why this grossly unprofessional and blatantly irresponsible report is receiving any attention is the attribution of the false statement to the Director, Army Public Relations, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu. The authors of the story must be the only news reporters, who do not know that Army Spokesman does not speak for the Defence Headquarters.\n\n\u201cHowever, for the sake of clarity and to keep the records straight, we wish to state that at no time did the Director, Army Public Relations, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu issue any statement on the subject matter. It is, therefore, a figment of their imagination, which did not in anyway emanate from Brig Gen Nwachukwu.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the military, on Friday, deployed three fighter jets, one Alpha jet and two A-29 Super Tucano attack aircraft as well as ground troops that engaged the insurgents in a fierce fire-fight that spilled over to Sunday morning.\n\nThe insurgents had in a reprisal attack over Friday\u2019s aerial bombardment of their positions and killing of their members, ambushed the commander, killing him and three other soldiers at Bungulwa village near Uba-Askira while on their way to reinforce troops.\n\nBut in a counter offensive, troops engaged the non-state actors, killing an ISWAP Commander and three insurgents.\n\nChief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Faruk Yahaya, following the development, directed troops to sustain the counter-offensive.\n\nA war update issued Saturday by Nigerian Army Headquarters said the army chief commiserated with the families and relations of the fallen heroes and directed the troops to continue the ferocious counter-offensive and hot pursuit to eliminate the remnants of the fleeing terrorists.\n\nIt was gathered that the Nigerian troops, which had tactically retreated, regrouped, reinforced and ambushed the ISWAP commander and eliminated his fighters at Uba-Askira.\n\nA military source confirmed that over 30 bodies of the insurgents decimated on Saturday were recovered yesterday though troops were still combing surrounding bushes for more bodies.\n\nIt was further gathered that nine gun trucks, an Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) and one Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) were destroyed while some other equipment were recovered.\n\n\u201cThis morning while we are still mopping the area, we have so far counted 37 corpses of the terrorists while one of their leaders, a commander, who was arrested for further investigation died in custody this morning. We also recovered dozens of sophisticated guns during the clearance operation,\u201d a security source said.\n\nReports indicated that normalcy had returned to Askira-Uba as the villagers hailed the proactive response of the military after the sudden invasion of their community.\n\nFintiri, in a press release by his press secretary, Mr Humwashi Wonosikou, yesterday, noted that he was saddened to hear how the insurgents launched an attack on an Army Base in Askira Uba Local Government area of Southern Borno. Fintiri commended the bravery of the Special Forces with the support of other troops, who repelled the attack by the insurgents.\n\nFintiri stated, \u201cGeneral Zirkusu and the three others were brave soldiers, who died in the line of duty while fighting terrorists.\n\n\u201cI want to take this opportunity to express my deepest sympathy and that of the government and people of Adamawa State to the families and loved ones of the fallen heros. I stand with you. Nigeria stands with you. I deeply appreciate the sacrifice made by your loved ones in defence of our democracy, our peace and our security.\u201d\n\nWhile urging the citizens to remember the families of the deceased in prayers at \u201cthis difficult time\u201d, Fintiri also urged their families, President Muhammadu Buhari and the Chief of Army Staff to take heart over the irreparable loss, knowing that their loved ones died in active service and paid the supreme sacrifice.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe will not be cowed by these cowards. Our armed forces will continue to fulfil our mission-defeating terror. Our Soldiers\u2019 blood will not be shed in vain.\u201d\n\nThe governor expressed confidence that the day was coming when Nigerians would look back at this moment in history and say, \u201cThank God there were courageous people willing to serve, because they laid the foundation for peace for generations to come.\n\n\u201cWe are on track to victory against evil. My thoughts and prayers go out to families of troops killed in war everyday, not just on the loss of these brave soldiers, but all who laid their lives in supreme sacrifice for the freedom of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNdume alerted that ISWAP members had begun to regroup in Lake Chad. However, he said he was optimistic that the Nigerian military had the capacity to tame as well as defeat the terrorists in the on-going onslaught against them.\n\nReacting to the killing of General Zirkusu and three soldiers, Ndume said the military had been informed about this and the Air Force were giving the necessary back up to fight the terrorists.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe ISWAP are regrouping around Borno North. That\u2019s Lake Chad axis. The military is aware and the Air Forces are providing surveillance in the area. It was a revenge mission.\u201d\n\nWhile condoling with the Army over the recent killings by insurgents, the chairman of Senate Committee on Army, stated that the killing was a revenge mission by ISWAP terrorists, who had of recent been victims of military operations in parts of Borno State.\n\nNdume stated, \u201cFor now, we will assume that it was an isolated case. But the intensity with which they came is worrisome. They came with more than 10 gun trucks. It was a revenge mission. The Army has been taking out key ISWAP commanders and they had their revenge.\n\n\u201cISWAP terrorists attacked a town there. They knew that the General was the major obstacle to their operation. They laid an ambush and rammed a bomb-ladened car into his vehicle. He was a gallant soldier. He took the fight to the terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe General\u2019s death has sent a panic to people in that area. I am aware that some people around that Chibok area have started thinking of relocating. Some want to go to Mubi and other places. We are trying to urge them to remain there. The insurgency is coming to an end.\n\n\u201cThis is not the end, but the beginning of the end of terrorists. I know that the Army has what it takes to take the fight to them. There is need to urge other security agencies to give the Army the needed support. We also need to urge vigilante groups to assist them.\n\n\u201cLast week, for instance, they abducted relatives of the Emir of Askira. They also abducted some passengers along that road. If the Army sustains the temple, we will win this insurgency. The equipment is arriving gradually. We are monitoring. As a committee, we will go and see what they have brought into the country. This is an improvement. The Army is very rapid in responding.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Lagos State Judicial Panel on #EndSARS has revealed the names of nine peaceful protesters who were shot dead by the Nigerian Army at the Lekki Tollgate last year.\n\nThe panel was inaugurated on October 19, 2020, to look into complaints of citizens against human rights abuses by the police.\n\nFollowing the incident at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020, the Terms of Reference of the panel was expanded to cover that incident.\n\nThe panel sat for well over one year and took testimonies of petitioners, witnesses, experts and lawyers.\n\nIn its report obtained by SaharaReporters on Monday, the panel listed names of nine people (all male) who were shot dead at the scene of the protest last year.\n\nTheir names are; Victor Sunday Ibanga; Abuta Solomon; Jide; Olalekan Abideen Ashafa; Olamilekan Ajasa; Kolade Salami; Folorunsho Olabisi; Kenechukwu Ugoh and Nathaniel Solomon.\n\nFour others: Abiodun Adesanya; Ifeanyi Nicholas Eji; Tola and Wisdom were missing and presumed dead.\n\nThe report noted that 39 other persons either sustained gunshot injuries, were assaulted or were victims of the stampede that occurred following the military invasion.\n\nThe panel further noted, \u201cThe atrocious maiming and killing of unarmed, helpless and unresisting protesters, while sitting on the floor and waving their Nigerian flags, while singing the National Anthem can be equated to a \u2018massacre\u2019 in context.\n\n\n\n\u201cA massacre has been defined as the killing of multiple individuals, which is considered to be morally unacceptable especially when perpetrated by political actors against defenceless victims.\u201d\u2014Wikipedia\n\n\u201cThe Panel considered whether what took place at the Lekki Toll Gate on the 20th October 2020 was a MASSACRE. According to the learned authors of Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, one of the meanings of MASSACRE is \u2018the act or instance of killing a number of usually helpless or unresisting human beings under circumstances of atrocity or cruelty.\u2019\n\n\u201cAgainst the above \u2018contextual\u2019 definitions, the Panel considered the following evidence before it: The EndSARS protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate were defenceless members of the civil populace, youth and young adults;\n\n\u201cBoth the Lagos State Government and indeed the Federal Government were well aware of their status, objectives and the nature of their protest;\n\nSee Also Breaking News BREAKING: #EndSARS: Lagos Panel Says Nigerian Army, Police Shot Live Bullets, Killed Lekki Tollgate Protesters While Singing National Anthem\n\n\u201cThe presence of protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate did not threaten the territorial integrity of Nigeria and could not be considered as a civil insurrection to warrant the intervention of the Nigerian Army; some top officials of the Lagos State Government met with the youths at the Lekki Toll Gate around 12-1 pm of October 20, 2020, seeking selected representatives to discuss an urgent matter with them with a view to persuading them to leave the Lekki Toll Gate; Officers and soldiers of 65 Batallion of the Nigerian Army, led by Lt. Col Bello, left their base with blank and live ammunitions to confront and disperse youths holding only their national flags, with live bullets;\n\n\u201dThe soldiers actually shot blank and live bullets directly and pointedly into the midst of the protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate, with the deliberate intention to assault, maim and kill;\n\n\u201cThe soldiers turned back ambulances that were invited to render first aid and assistance to the wounded protesters.\u201d\n\nThe panel further found, \u201cFrom the evidence of General A.I.Taiwo (Commander, 81 Military Intelligence Brigade, Nigerian Army, Victoria Island, Lagos) on pages 6, 7, 21, 22, the Panel finds that both blank and live bullets were fired by the Nigerian Army at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020, for the following reasons:\n\n\u201cApart from the military men in uniform, the Army left its base with vehicles, rifles and guns, which contained both live and blank bullets. General Taiwo admitted at page 22 that the Army went to the Lekki Toll Gate with live ammunition.\n\n\u201cAs of October 30, 2020, when the Panel visited the Lekki Toll Gate for its on the spot assessment, it was still able to recover two bullets shells which were duly analyzed by the forensic expert hired by the Panel, Sentinel, who is very familiar with weapons used by the Nigerian Army. These bullet shells were said to be the same as or similar to the ones normally used by the Nigerian Army and they were expended shells, meaning they were fired live at the Lekki Toll Gate.\n\n\u201cPetitioners and witnesses appeared before the Panel to give vivid accounts of shootings by the Army into the crowd of protesters. The Panel finds their testimonies credible being eyewitness accounts and would ascribe probative value to their testimony over that of General Taiwo who was not physically present at the Lekki Toll Gate.\n\n\u201cThe Panel finds as credible, the case of the EndSARS protesters that soldiers shot directly at protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020 as confirmed by Lagos State Ballistic Expert, Willie-Harry on page 244 that some video evidence indicate \u201c\u2026 instances where troops were seen to be re-arming their weapons before either discharging them to the air or purposely in the direction of the protesters ...\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Panel believes that the deliberate absence of officers of the Nigerian Army who were present at the Lekki Toll Gate and who were summoned by the Panel was a calculated attempt to conceal material evidence from the Panel and verily believes that their presence would have damaged the case of the Nigerian Army.\n\n\u201cThe Panel finds the evidence, presentation and report of the Ballistic Expert engaged by Lagos State as too general and unrelated to the specific evidence before the Panel on the Lekki Toll Gate Incident. The said report was based largely on extraneous materials that were not produced or tendered before the Panel in order to determine their source or relevance.\n\n\u201cThe witness admitted that he did not work with any document or video admitted before the Panel, he did not speak with any of the protesters or petitioners, the doctors or the pathologists or indeed any other relevant witness known to the Panel.\u201d\n\nOn injuries from Lekki Tollgate, the Panel \u201cfinds that the testimony of Dr Babajide Lawson of Reddington Hospital as to the nature of treatment offered victims of the Lekki Toll Gate Incident in relation to gunshot wounds which were high velocity \u2018entry and exit\u2019, all indicate injuries from military weapons, consistent with the bullet shells recovered by the Panel during its visit and the witnesses that testified before the Panel\u201d.\n\nIt also \u201cfinds corroboration of the case of gunshot wounds in the testimony of Dr. Aromolate Ayobami of Grandville Trauma Centre, where several victims of gunshot wounds were treated comprehensively and discharged.\n\n\u201cThe testimony of the EndSARS protesters, especially Miss Serah Ibrahim, Mr. Onileowo Legend, Miss Dabira Ayuku, Miss Kamsichukwu (all of whom were personally present at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20), as to the fact that the Army shot live bullets, video evidence of casualties, fatalities, etc, all lend credence to the fact that the Army shot at the protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20 2020 which resulted into deaths and other physical injuries.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Panel also found that the conduct of the Nigerian Army was exacerbated by its refusal to allow ambulances render medical assistance to victims who required such assistance. The Army was also found not to have adhered to its own Rules of Engagement.\n\n\u201cThe Panel found that the Nigerian Police Force deployed its officers to the Lekki Toll Gate on the night of the 20th October, 2020 and between that night and the morning of the 21st of October, 2020, its officer shot at, assaulted and battered unarmed protesters, which led to injuries and deaths. The police officers also tried to cover up their actions by picking up bullets.\n\n\u201cThe panel found that LCC hampered the panel's investigation by refusing to turn over some useful and vital information/evidence as requested by the Panel and the Forensic Expert engaged by the panel, even where such information and evidence was by the company's admission, available. It manipulated the incomplete CCTV Video footage of the Lekki Toll Gate on the night of the 20th of October 2020, which it tendered before the Panel.\n\n\u201cThe Panel found that there was an invitation of the Nigerian Army to Lagos State made by the Lagos State Government through the Governor before the hierarchy of the Nigerian Army deployed its soldiers to the Lekki Toll Gate on the night of the 20th of October.\n\n\u201cThe Panel found that there was an attempt to cover up the Incident of the 20th of October by the cleaning of the Lekki Toll Gate and the failure to preserve the scene ahead of potential investigations.\u201d",

          "text": "The family members of the late Vanguard Newspaper journalist, Tordue Salem, have said they don't believe the narrative put up by the Nigerian Police Force about that he was killed by a hit-and-run driver on October 13 in the Mabushi area of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\nThe family members added that there were loopholes and gaps in the account which the police presented, saying the security agency must address them as a matter of urgency and necessity.\n\n\n\nThe deceased\u2019s in-law, Dr. Jeffrey Kuraun, who spoke on behalf of the family, disclosed this on Monday in Abuja during a condolence visit by the members of House of Representatives press corps to the family.\n\nHe said the family was not convinced, while insisting that the police authorities must provide answers to nagging questions and ensure that justice was served.\n\nKuraun said the family would wait and allow the police to conclude their investigation though they have not had any formal brief from the police on the matter except the press conference where the purported hit-and-run driver was paraded.\n\nKuraun also urged the media personnel to be objective in their reportage and to focus more on investigative journalism to unravel the circumstances surrounding the untimely death of Tordue.\n\nHe said, \"Don't be in the category of people where someone will say, \"Let them talk after a while, everything will die down. Do investigative journalism in your own little space to unravel the certain things though you may not have the resources.\n\n\"As a family do we believe the story? No, we don't. It could be true but we don't. Why? Do more to clarify certain things. Formally we have not been informed. Maybe the formal information is the press conference and I respect that. We take that as formal information concerning this issue.\"\n\nHe said upon getting to the mortuary, they saw the body but they were not convinced it was his body though the body frame looked like him but the legs were completely gone, twisted and messed up.\n\n\u201cSo you don't even have the legs. He is a tall guy but I did not see that. I was trying to look at the face; I just need answers,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also expressed displeasure at the way Vanguard Newspapers broke the news of the death of Tordue without prior notice to the family.\n\nHe expressed regret that the police hurriedly announced at the press conference that the family had positively identified the body while they were on their way to the Wuse General Hospital mortuary.\n\nDuring the condolence visit, the journalists met with the wife of the deceased, Deve Salem; his five-year-old daughter, Avaana and Tordue's elder sister, Elizabeth Kuraun-Elder.\n\nThe family who could not control their emotions wept profusely while narrating the last moment they had with the journalist before he was declared missing and eventually died.\n\nEarlier in her remarks, the Press Corps Chairman, Grace Ike, said they came to commiserate with the family and to let them know that they were not alone.\n\nShe said, \"Tordue was indeed a friend, a brother and we know someday we will all meet. We are also looking forward to doing all we can as journalists and as his fellow brothers and sisters to ensure that relevant security agencies get justice for Tordue.\n\n\"For us, we are one family, we are still pained. We are hopeful that someday, justice for Tordue will come and we will not rest on our oars until justice for Tordue is served.\"",

          "text": "Digital media in Africa is growing fast: traditional media organisations are finding their way to the internet while digital-only media organisations are taking firm root. More Africans are online, they are spending more time on the internet and relying more on digital media more than ever. According to the Social Flagship Report April 2021, created by Global Web Index (GWI), four African countries cracked the top 10 rankings for social media usage based on time spent, as Nigeria ranked first at (3:46), followed by Kenya (3:33), South Africa (3:32) and Ghana.\n\nOn the latest edition of TechCabal Live\u2014a video interview series in partnership with the UK-Nigeria Tech Hub\u2014held on October 25, we sought to understand Africa\u2019s digital media landscape, its challenges and future, and so we spoke with the editors of two of Africa\u2019s top digital newsrooms\u2014Quartz Africa Editor, Ciku Kimeria; and Stears Business\u2019, Editor-in-Chief, Fadekemi Abiru.\n\nHow can digital media in Africa create a profitable business model?\n\nWhile it is normal to get excited about the different innovative news products in the continent\u2019s digital media landscape, Abiru explains that more media houses need to produce more information that helps people understand what is going on around them.\n\nIn Africa, online news is mostly free. Only a few digital news organisations have been able to monetise their digital content. But Abiru wants this to change. \u201cLet people understand that information is something worth paying for. There is a challenge of helping people understand that where there is value, revenue can also be generated.\u201d Abiru believes that value creation is enough reason for digital media in Africa to monetise their online content. She further explains that the concept of \u201ccontent worth paying for\u201d is why Netflix and Spotify operate subscription-based business models.\n\nAbiru believes that for African newsrooms to use the subscription model successfully, they must produce deep, original and insightful pieces that cannot be found elsewhere.\n\nAfrican newsrooms have a talent problem\n\nAbiru complained about a talent shortage and the challenge of retaining talent. Ciku also believes that Africa faces a talent problem but is hopeful that training would go a long way to solve it. She added, though, that it is easier to train good writers on technical skills but very hard to teach good writing.\n\nQuality of work coming from African newsrooms must improve\n\nSpeaking on the quality of journalistic work coming out of African newsrooms, Ciku believes that there is a huge gap between African and, say, American journalism. But she believes the fault isn\u2019t entirely the journalist\u2019s. She says there has been a drop in the quality of journalism schools in Kenya, her home country.\n\nAnother reason for this drop in the quality of journalism is the university system in Africa, where there are scandals of people paying for their degrees.\n\n\u201cNow, when you read what a journalist has written, there are so many typos and errors,\u201d she lamented.\n\nYet another problem Ciku highlighted was funding. She believes African journalists can do amazing work, but their budget is way smaller than that of global publications.\n\n\u201cIf a great investigative journalist wants to go into a project in a place that\u2019s not safe, and his organisation gives him little or no money to do so, you can understand how they will not come up with the same quality of work as a global media house.\u201d\n\nThe major cause of the funding problem, Ciku said, is the environment and not individual journalists.\n\nYou can watch the rest of the conversation below:\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Launched in 2019 by Cregital, a Lagos-based creative design agency, Disha Pages gave users the tools with which to build their own one-page websites from the comfort of their smartphones, without worrying about technicalities such as coding or sorting out a domain name.\n\nCredit: Disha (Medium)\n\nThe product was an instant hit and got considerable adoption among creators and gig workers. Unfortunately, by a little over a year after its launch\u2014at the peak of the pandemic\u2014the company announced that they were shutting down the product.\n\n\u201cHow can we help?\u201d\n\nAs soon as the announcement of the shutdown went up, the Disha team were inundated with calls and messages from baffled well wishers, all of them concerned and wondering what they could do to keep the platform alive. These early conversations were tepid, nothing was concrete\u2014until Flutterwave came into the picture offering a total buyout. The move by the payments giant, which earlier this year became a unicorn, is surprising as both companies operate in different spaces\u2014Flutterwave in payments and Disha in the creator industry. One wonders, then, what the play is here.\n\nIn a call with Flutterwave\u2019s head of product marketing, Onyedikachim Nwankwo, explained that while both companies may run different businesses, their company goals are aligned. \u201cFlutterwave is about creating endless possibilities for everyone, and Disha\u2019s goal of enabling creators achieve success and get paid for their work ties into Flutterwave\u2019s larger mission of helping small businesses thrive.\u201d\n\nNew look for Disha?\n\nIn a statement announcing the acquisition, Flutterwave says that the buyout will grow Disha\u2019s base by providing users with the ability to make, receive and withdraw money from their Disha accounts in over 150 currencies and 34 countries across the world. Despite the acquisition, however, Disha will remain an independent company. According to Nwankwo, \u201cIts original vision will be maintained.\u201d\n\nRufus Oyemade, Software and Architectural Lead at Flutterwave, states that Disha coming under the Flutterwave family means its vision will be explored farther than earlier imagined. \u201cBefore now, when users created a Disha page and linked to a Flutterwave payment link, they got taken off the Disha site. Now, with the acquisition, users can create and accept their payments, all in one place.\u201d\n\nFlutterwave has always played in the creator space, having supported arts events like ArtX Lagos. Now, as the digital world opens up to creators getting paid for their work through innovations such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the payments giant is well positioned to help creators on Disha access global markets and further grow the global creator economy, which is estimated to be worth $100 billion.\n\nFlutterwave became a unicorn in March after reaching a $1 billion valuation, and the company may be set to triple that value in the future to the tune of $3 billion by acquiring more funding.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Exclusive: Meta\u2019s VP MEA and Turkey on Facebook\u2019s transition into the metaverse",
          "text": "At the end of October, social media giant, Facebook, changed its company to Meta. The announcement was made in an hour-long video that explained the company\u2019s decision to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse.\n\nLeading that work in Africa is Derya Matras, Vice President (VP), Middle East, Africa (MEA) and Turkey, Meta.\n\nPrior to her appointment as VP in August, Matras was the Managing Director for the MEA and Turkey region. Before that, she was Country Director for Facebook in Turkey for four years. Derya holds a BSc in electronics engineering from Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey, and an MBA from Columbia Business School.\n\nOver email, Matras talked to TechCabal about Facebook\u2019s rebrand to Meta and how it plans to make money from the metaverse and deal with the challenges that come with building it.\n\nHow is the Metaverse better than Facebook in its current form?\n\nWhen Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world\u2014and we are not turning away from these existing products. Those experiences are going to form a crucial part of the future metaverse ecosystem. The Facebook app is still going to be called Facebook.\n\nThe name Meta is a clear link to our vision for the metaverse. However, the metaverse will exist, whether Meta is there or not. So, Meta means us moving beyond 2D screens towards immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality, to help build the next evolution in social technology. This is a natural evolution for our company as social media and technology evolves.\n\nWhat demographic is the metaverse targeting in Africa?\n\nGiven all that the metaverse has to offer, there\u2019s a lot at stake in making sure its possibilities are open to everyone and not just people from traditionally underrepresented groups. An inclusive metaverse benefits everyone.\n\nIs Facebook building the metaverse because it\u2019s best positioned to build something that\u2019s inevitable?\n\nIn recent decades, technology has given people the power to connect and express themselves more naturally. We started with websites, then we got phones with cameras, and then the internet became more visual and mobile. As connections got faster, video became a richer way to share experiences. If you look back over time, we\u2019ve gone from desktop to web to mobile; from text to photos to video. Now we are looking at what comes next. The metaverse will feel like a hybrid of today\u2019s online social experiences, sometimes expanded into three dimensions or projected into the physical world. It\u2019s the next evolution in a long line of social technologies, and it\u2019s ushering in a new chapter for our company.\n\nIn Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s letter, he mentioned that the \u201cmetaverse will not be created by one company\u201d. Does this mean there\u2019ll be other metaverses outside of Facebook\u2019s metaverse and that they can all exist side by side without Facebook trying to be the only metaverse out there?\n\nThe metaverse isn\u2019t a single product that one company can build. Its success depends on building robust interoperability across services, so different companies\u2019 experiences can work together. And it won\u2019t be built overnight. Many of these products will only be fully realised in the next 10-15 years. While that\u2019s frustrating for those of us eager to dive right in, it gives us time to ask difficult questions about how they should be built. We\u2019ll work with experts in government, industry and academia to think through issues and opportunities in the metaverse.\n\nWe also need to involve human and civil rights communities from the start to ensure these technologies are built in a way that\u2019s inclusive and empowering.\n\nAcross Africa, we\u2019re supporting Africa No Filter, Electric South and Imisi 3D to support creators who have been pushing the boundaries of digital storytelling using immersive technology to amplify African voices.\n\nIs there the potential for other applications and programmes to be built in the metaverse\u2014similar to the blockchain.\n\nWe are at the very start of this. A lot of the technology and infrastructure still needs to be built. It will take at least 5 to 10 years for this vision of the metaverse to come to life. This pace is going to be dictated less by business interests and more by technological realities. Infrastructure needs to be transformed with new technologies, hardware and cooling specifications to be able to support a robust service. And new hardware still needs to be built, including things like hologram displays, projectors, batteries, radios, custom silicon chips, cameras, speakers, and sensors to map the world around you and more.\n\nWhy should Facebook build this? Why not another company?\n\nThis was an important step for us to take on our journey, and as we evolve to Meta, we hope this will better reflect where we are going as a company. Like all businesses, we continue to innovate so that we can bring value to people\u2019s lives.\n\nWe are a social company with investments in technology, like VR; and the metaverse is the next frontier of virtual digital connection\u2014so it\u2019s a natural evolution for our business. But it\u2019s important to reiterate that Meta is neither going to build, own, or run the metaverse on its own. This isn\u2019t going to be a Meta product.\n\nBuilding this will be more like how the internet came about rather than how one app was launched. That\u2019s why we will be collaborating at every stage with other companies, developers, experts, and policymakers. Principles of privacy, safety, and security need to be built in from the start. If we have the principles right, then as a society, we will be better at tackling new challenges with these technologies as they arise.\n\nThe transition to communication via the metaverse will face some challenges considering that it\u2019s not just another app on the mobile phone. What challenges does Facebook expect to encounter in rolling out the metaverse in Africa?\n\nNew innovations bring new challenges, and there\u2019s lots we need to figure out. But that\u2019s why we\u2019re starting this conversation early. We have to be responsible in our approach, and we intend to do that in a number of ways:\n\nNo surprises: In the past, the speed with which new technologies have emerged has sometimes left policymakers and regulators playing catch-up. We don\u2019t want this to happen this time around. A core principle is going to be \u201cdon\u2019t surprise people\u201d. That\u2019s why we are having this conversation out in the open, way in advance of all these technologies being launched.\n\nCollaboration: Partnering with independent experts and organisations will be a crucial part of how we navigate future challenges. We have already launched a two-year $50 million investment in programmes and external research, collaborating with industry partners, civil rights groups, governments, non-profits, and academic institutions to get input as we build these technologies responsibly. This is alongside being a founding member of the XR Association (XRA), which is committed to helping build responsible XR, which includes virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and future immersive technology.\n\nBuilt-in: While we will need to continue to get better at anticipating risks, we won\u2019t be able to see around every corner. That\u2019s why the principles of privacy, safety, and security need to be built in from the start.\n\nFacebook plans to spend ~$10 billion this year on the metaverse project\u2014and even more in the coming years. How will the company make money from this?\n\nIt\u2019s very early, and our focus today is more around building the foundational pieces for the metaverse, like VR, and bringing more people into those experiences. We outlined a few areas during Connect where we think there is an opportunity around commerce. We want to help provide tools for creators and developers so they can build a meaningful business in the metaverse because we think digital commerce will become increasingly important.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that investing in the metaverse also means additional resources invested in issues like safety and security. For example, the $10 billion investment in Reality Labs that we have already announced will include spending on research to better understand how we can responsibly tackle safety and integrity challenges in the metaverse.\n\nAnd, just like the rest of the internet, we expect that free things in the metaverse would likely be powered by ads while there would also be paid experiences that are ad-free.\n\nThis is a very long-term vision. It\u2019s going to take investment over many years before the metaverse reaches scale.\n\nLately, fingers have been pointed at Facebook for inciting civil unrest in Africa and being ill-equipped to staff its Africa offices to properly regulate posts. How does Facebook plan to build the metaverse responsibly?\n\nEvery day, our teams have to balance protecting the ability of billions of people to express themselves openly with the need to keep our platform a safe and positive place. We continue to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content. To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.\n\nWe are on track to spend over $5 billion on safety and security in 2021 alone and have 40,000 people working on these issues, including 15,000 people who review content in more than 70 languages.\n\nHow we build is as important as what we build. And we will be collaborating at every stage\u2014with other companies, developers, experts and policymakers\u2014to make sure that what we build is good for the world.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Global startup, Healthlane, launches its world-class preventive healthcare facilities in Nigeria",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, Africa has been plagued with tough health challenges. With its healthcare system poorly developed, the life expectancy rate in the continent currently lies at 63 years for males and 66 years for females. Much lower than the global average of 71 for males and 73 for females.\n\nTo help tackle a part of this problem, Alain Nteff launched Giftedmom in 2012 and he pivoted the company in 2019 to become Healthlane. The startup now offers a wide range of services to Africans.\n\nIn September 2020, the company raised $2.4 million to expand its offerings, stating that it had some interesting moves in the works.\n\nOn Tuesday, November 9, 2021, Healthlane, announced its official launch in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorthy of note is the fact that the life expectancy in Nigeria is lower than the continental average with 59 to 63 years for males and females respectively, but that might soon be changing.\n\nAt an event hosted at the immaculate Healthlane office in Lekki, Lagos Nigeria, Alain Nteff, alongside key Healthlane executives and notable clients shared Healthlane\u2019s vision to use technology to improve healthcare in Nigeria and the benefits of the Healthlane experience.\n\nTo kickstart the event, Folu Olumideko, Head, Marketing and Communications gave a welcome speech highlighting the company\u2019s mission to simplify how people track and optimise their health.\n\nTaking up the baton, Healthlane founder and Managing Director, Alain Nteff thanked the team and the clients for the successful launch of the Healthlane app and its world-class healthcare technology to help people live longer and healthy lives.\n\n\u201cI remember in 2019 I knew preventive care was important, but I had no feasibility. No idea about the pricing, and sometimes when you meet the doctor, he asks you what symptoms you\u2019re having so he can prescribe a test. Comprehensive checkup was not really a thing at that time,\u201d he says.\n\nAlain also pointed out that most of those heavily affected by COVID-19 were those with pre-existing health conditions.\n\n\u201cBefore 2020, my mom fell sick regularly, and the hospital kept treating typhoid and malaria. I now realised that I had to take her for comprehensive checkups. In 2020, she was one of those that we lost from conditions that could have been prevented. And that was the turning point for us, and we said we need to make preventive care something big in the coming years.\u201d\n\nHe also states that before Healthlane, what we usually call healthcare is actually \u201csick care\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re sick, you go to the doctor, give them your symptoms, and they give you prescriptions. That\u2019s what sick care is,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cToday at Healthlane, we believe healthcare is about eating well, exercising, supplementing, having checkups, and immunising yourself. If we get this right, then we should be helping everyone live like 20 \u2013 30 years extra and not lose loved ones to preventable illnesses,\u201d he added.\n\nAlain announced that Healthlane has consulted with top health experts across the globe on what would be the right healthcare practices to help people live longer, and he excitedly revealed that the company has been able to execute this with the aid of technology.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve birthed a world-class lab on-site, and it reports that it has conducted over 70 tests. Apart from doing just tests, we also help identify ways to optimise what has been found or reverse a condition that has been found. We are also launching the Healthlane app which keeps records and implements healthcare plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, people are now comfortable accessing their medical records on their smartphones. They are more concerned about preventing themselves so they don\u2019t fall prey to certain diseases. We all know that if you are diabetic or hypertensive, you are more affected if you contract Covid-19 compared to someone who is relatively healthy. There is a growing trend of services being deployed through technology and that is where we have positioned ourselves,\u201d Nteff asserts.\n\nBuilding affordable healthcare\n\nBuilding on Alain\u2019s introduction, Dr Lincoln Saiki, one of Healthlane\u2019s in-house physicians, presented a live case study of an individual who looks seemingly healthy to the average observer but had hidden symptoms that could only be revealed through a comprehensive checkup like Healthlane\u2019s.\n\n\u201cAs of today, 1 in 17 Nigerians have diabetes, 1 in five Nigerians suffer from obesity, and 1 in 3 Nigerians have high blood pressure and hypertension. You might be wondering how it\u2019s possible to have 75 million Nigerians with hypertension, but it is one of the silent killers. People might have it for years without symptoms and only when it manifests in the form of strokes, heart attack, heart failure, or kidney failure. To date, it remains the largest cause of preventable deaths.\u201d Lincoln revealed.\n\nThe doctor explained that Healthlane provides up to 78 different tests, and the results are normally out in 45 minutes. The company also helps to create a feeding, supplement or exercising plan from the result of the test.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s a body analysis which shows parameters like age, weight, height, body fat among others.\n\nThis follows the Baseline checks which involves Heart Health, Diabetes check, Immunity, Kidney Health, Liver Health, Blood, Cancer check, Hormones, Bones and Minerals.\n\nFinally, the company creates a care plan using the insights from the test.\n\nHealthlane\u2019s product manager, Karen Onigbinde, explained that the Healthlane app, which is available on the Google and Apple app stores, makes it easy for people to make the lifestyle changes that are required for them to live long and healthy.\n\n\u201cWe have features that let you access your wellness checks, so you can schedule and pay for your wellness appointments, your vaccinations, and your supplements from the Google app. You can also track your health data, and also download them in case you want to consult a second opinion. You also manage your health with a care plan which contains those reminders that tell you to drink water, eat well, and exercise\u201d she detailed.\n\nKaren also revealed that Healthlane would be building a lot more features that will help people access healthier food or make it easier to get on the healthlane.\n\nTestimonials\n\nMost tellingly, one of Healthlane\u2019s clients, Buchi, a fitness expert who loved to keep fit and take care of his health decided to do a comprehensive check with Healthlane, and found out he had deficiencies he didn\u2019t know about. The company then went on to create a distinct healthcare plan to suit his needs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for you to say I work hard, I\u2019m fit, I don\u2019t have any medical issues, but you never know what\u2019s going on inside of you. I found that my Vitamin D was low, but I\u2019ve had an amazing experience with Healthlane to help adjust this issue.\n\nAnother client, Nadayar Enegesi, CEO of Eden Life also praised the Healthlane experience, pointing out that he had always been wary of hospitals and had never tried to do any check ups even when recommended.\n\n\u201cI was just amazed at the experience. There were about 78 tests that were run, and I really appreciated the detail that the solution went to educate me about what is going on in my body. We worked through the care plan and I got some supplements. I was also advised to change my diet to include more fruits and nuts,\u201d he briefly recounted.\n\nAre the services affordable?\n\nThe company offers a wide range of affordable wellness products for individuals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve signed up health insurance services providers like Hygeia HMO and Reliance HMO and anyone covered by them can access our healthcare services,\u201d said Damola Ajayi, Healthlane\u2019s head of Sales and Business Development.\n\nShe then revealed that there are three affordable pricing packages available.\n\nThere\u2019s the:\n\nWorld-class check where you do as much as 95 tests for just \u20a6135,000 ($325)\n\nExecutive check which is just \u20a649,000 ($149) for 69 checks\n\nPremium package which is just \u20a628,000 ($68) for 43 checks.\n\nThere are also corporate and HMO plans.\n\nShe also explained that Healthlane offers mobile labs for companies who want to test their employees at their offices.\n\nAddressing Techpoint Africa\u2019s inquiry at the Press Q&A session, Alain explained that Healthlane\u2019s services are already gaining traction with a good number of working professionals in Lagos, Nigeria, and he expects the company to gradually expand to other locations in the near future.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nNigeria\u2019s first online housing portal\n\nNITDA\u2019s Crackdown on data privacy abuse\n\nA handful of other news\n\nNigeria\u2019s first online housing portal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Alexander Trukhin on Unsplash\n\nOn Friday, November 12, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s federal government launched an online housing portal to begin the sale of houses under the National Housing Programme.\n\nThe total number of houses ready for inhabitation stands at 5000 in 34 states, including the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, although the projected number is 300,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouses listed on the portal are bungalows, condominiums, and semi-detached bungalows that cost between \u20a67 million ($17,067.68) and \u20a616.2 million ($39,499.49) and target low and middle-income earners. Bungalows are sold with accompanying land.\n\nAccording to Nairametrics, Babatunde Fashola, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Housing and Works, said, \u201cThis is the first time we have a platform that every Nigerian has access to. This provides an opportunity for all Nigerians to apply and ensure a fair process of allocation.\u201d\n\nPer Fashola, the portal is open to members of the public, adding that the online forms allowed for more openness, limited human interventions, and would hold the government more accountable.\n\nNaturally, I searched for houses on the portal, starting with Lagos State but soon hit a snag; no homes were listed in the state. According to Fashola, the Lagos State and Rivers State governments have not provided any land for the programme.\n\nOnline application is compulsory with a non-refundable application fee of \u20a610,000 ($24) with options to own outrightly, rent to own, or apply for a mortgage.\n\nClicking through the application portal, it appears a mostly online process with very little need for human intervention until the form is submitted. After this, the selection process becomes a bit vague but is said to be on a \u201cfirst-come, first-served basis.\u201d\n\nConsidering ongoing woes with international passport applications in Nigeria \u2014 a predominantly online process \u2014 should Nigerians be wary?\n\nCrackdown on data privacy abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: wuestenigel Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nThe National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) announced on Friday, November 12, 2021, its partnership with the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) to tackle data privacy abuse by money lending operators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSection 17(a) of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Act (FCCPA) 2019 empowers the FCCPC to administer and enforce every Nigerian law concerning competition and the protection of consumers.\n\nIf I was to create a poll, chances are several of our Nigerian readers might have received a text message informing them that a named person had defaulted on a loan, with a bunch of veiled and not so subtle threats attached.\n\nIn August 2021, Soko Lending Company, a Nigerian online lending platform, was slammed with a \u20a610 million ($24,277) fine by the NITDA for privacy invasion.\n\nAccording to Hadiza Umar, Head, Corporate Affairs and External Relations, NITDA, \u201cThe Agency has received over 40 petitions from members of the public on the personal data abuse of some lending companies.\n\n\u201cThe partnership with FCCPC will lead to a more robust and concerted regulatory approach which we believe would ensure that Nigerians get necessary reprieve from the illegal use of their personal data for money lending operations. The partnership would entail joint investigations, enforcement and possible prosecution.\u201d\n\nAt first glance, this seems to be a classic case of two heads is better than one, and I wonder if tales like these might finally become non-existent.\n\nA rundown of the news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Ugandan news: On Thursday, November 11, 2021, African fintech startup, Chipper Cash launched its Global Stocks Investing product which would enable Ugandans to buy shares in US companies for as low as $1 (Ush 3,500). This follows several interesting plays by the company in the last few months \u2014 expansion into the US, Twitter Tips integration, and most recently, a $150 million Series C extension early this month. Reminiscent of fintechs like Chaka, Risevest, Bamboo, and Trove, this is the country\u2019s first fractional stock investing platform. More Ugandan news: Zembo, a French startup with operations in Uganda, has announced a $3.4 million investment from Mobility 54 Investment SAS, DOB Equity and InfraCo Africa. Founded in 2018, the company sells electric motorcycles through a lease-to-own programme. South African insurtech, Root on Thursday, November 11, 2021, announced a $3 million funding with plans to expand the low-code platform into markets in Europe. Invenfin, Base Capital, Savannah Fund, P1 Ventures, Luno and FireID took part in the round. Founded in 2016 by Louw Hopley, the startup is helping businesses and developers launch insurance products faster with less coding. Sudan Internet woes: Sudan\u2019s Telecommunications and Post Regulatory Authority, on Thursday, November 11, 2021, issued a statement saying the Internet shutdown remains in force until further notice. This began on Monday, October 25, 2021, after news of an attempted coup began. Courts have ordered the restoration of Internet services twice \u2014 Tuesday, November 9, 2021, and Thursday, November 11, 2021.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nAncient Olympia to be digitally preserved.

          "title": "NCC alerts users as hackers target telcos",
          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has urged companies and individuals to update their safety measures as the telecommunication services industry is the primary focus of a group of hackers originating from Iran.\n\nThe hackers are known as Lyceum or Hexane, Siamesekitten, or Spirling. The hackers are reportedly targeting telecom providers, internet service providers (ISPs), and ministries of foreign affairs in Africa with upgraded malware in recent politically motivated attacks oriented in cyber espionage.\n\n\u201cThe NCC, as the operator of the telecom sector\u2019s cyber threat response centre (CSIRT), hereby reiterates its commitment to active surveillance and monitoring of cyber activities in the sector and will always keep stakeholders in Nigeria\u2019s telecommunications sector updated on potential threats within the cyber space. This is to ensure that the networks that deliver essential services are safe and that telecom consumers are protected from being victims of cyber-attacks,\u201d Ikechukwu Adinde, director public affairs, NCC, said.\n\nIn recent times, Ethiopia and Nigeria have seen an increase of 20 percent and 23 percent, respectively, and South Africa, an increase of 14 percent, while Kenya\u2019s number of attacks decreased by 13 percent.\n\nRead Also: How to Keep Your Cryptocurrency Safe from Hackers?\n\nhackers\n\n\u201cEven though the scourge of malware has always been of concern, the past 12 months have highlighted how hackers are refocusing their efforts to compromise consumer and corporate systems and gain access to critical data and information,\u201d noted Bethwel Opil, enterprise sales manager at Kaspersky.\n\nAccording to Gbolabo Awelewa, CTO/country manager, Infoprive Limited, \u201cLyceum APT Group is known for cyber espionage. With the use of backdoors created from custom-built malwares, the personal information of subscribers can be infiltrated from telecoms infrastructure. Personal information such as NIN, home address and contact details can be used to perform a spear-phishing attack on subscribers to further distribute the spread of the app\u2019s group malware and also target high profile subscribers.\u201d\n\nHe stated that people and security misconfiguration were the weakest links, as \u201cthe attack path utilised by Lyceum is known to be social engineering campaigns and the use of leak credentials to carry out credential stuffing as well as brute-forcing.\u201d\n\nAccording to an advisory issued by the Nigerian Computer Emergency Response Team (ngCERT), the probability and damage level of the new malware is very high.\n\nLyceum, which has been active since 2017, when they began campaigns against Middle Eastern oil and gas companies, but now appears to be focusing on telecom companies. A report by Accenture Cyber Threat Intelligence (ACTI) and Prevailion Adversarial Conterintelligence (PACT) published between July and October this year noted that Lyceum was spotted in attacks against ISPs and telecom organisations across Israel, Morocco, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cLyceum will likely continue to use the Shark and Milan backdoors, albeit with some modifications, as the group has likely been able to maintain footholds in victims\u2019 networks despite public disclosure of (indicators of compromise) associated with its operations,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nThe hackers\u2019 mode of operation begins with credential stuffing and brute-force attacks. So, once a victim\u2019s system is compromised, the attackers conduct surveillance on specific targets. In that mode, Lyceum will attempt to deploy two different kinds of malware: Shark and Milan (called together as \u2018James\u2019 by Kaspersky).\n\nThe two malwares are backdoors. Shark, a 32-bit executable written in C# and .NET, generates a configuration file for domain name system (DNS) tunnelling or Hypertet Transfer Protocol (HTTP) C2 communications; whereas Milan \u2013 a 32-bit Remote Access Trojan (RAT) retrieves data.\n\nBoth are able to communicate with the group\u2019s command-and-control (C2) servers. The advanced persistent threat (APT) maintains a C2 server network that connects to the group\u2019s backdoors, consisting of over 20 domains, including six that were previously not associated with the threat actors.\n\nThe hackers usually target individual accounts at companies of interest and once these are breached, they are used as springboards to launch spear-phishing attacks against high-profile executives in an organisation. The attackers not only steal subscribers and connected third-party companies\u2019 data, they can also use these industries to survey individuals of interest.\n\nThe NCC therefore listed seven measures that can help companies and subscribers stay safe. This include enabling a web application firewall to help detect and prevent attacks coming from web applications by inspecting HTTP traffic; install up-to-date antivirus programmes to help detect and prevent a wide range of malware, trojans, and viruses, which APT hackers will use to exploit your system; implement the use of instruction prevention systems that monitors network.\n\nOthers are create a secure sandboxing environment that allows a user to open and run untrusted programmes or codes without risking harm to the operating system; ensure the use of virtual private network (VPN) to prevent an easy opportunity for APT hackers to gain initial access to the company\u2019s network; and enable spam and malware protection for email applications, and educate employees on how to identify potentially malicious emails.\n\nA virtual private network, or VPN, is an encrypted connection over the internet from a device to a network. The encrypted connection helps ensure that sensitive data is safely transmitted. It prevents unauthorised people from eavesdropping on the traffic and allows the user to conduct work remotely. Many Nigerians in recent times have begun using VPNs as a measure to boycott a ban on Twitter services in the country.",
          "summary": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has urged companies and individuals to update their safety measures as the telecommunication services industry is the primary focus of a group of hackers originating from Iran.\nThe hackers are known as Lyceum or Hexane, Siamesekitten, or Spirling.\nThe hackers are reportedly targeting telecom providers, internet service providers (ISPs), and ministries of foreign affairs in Africa with upgraded malware in recent politically motivated attacks oriented in cyber espionage.\nLyceum, which has been active since 2017, when they began campaigns against Middle Eastern oil and gas companies, but now appears to be focusing on telecom companies.\nThe hackers usually target individual accounts at companies of interest and once these are breached, they are used as springboards to launch spear-phishing attacks against high-profile executives in an organisation.",

          "title": "Nigeria makes case for war risk insurance reduction",
          "text": "Nigeria has continued to press for the lifting of the War Risk Insurance (WRI) imposed on vessels delivering goods and merchandise to Nigeria due to fears of insecurity.\n\nThe management of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety (NIMASA) led by Bashir Jamoh (Director-General) is said to have launched series of moves and presentations across the globe for its removal.\n\nUbong Essien, the special assistant to the DG revealed in a media parley in Port Harcourt at the weekend that is causing serious inflation in Nigeria. He explained that goods coming to Nigeria carry very high and discriminatory fees that fuel inflation in Nigeria.\n\nRevealing how the NIMASA DG has gone to key maritime stations around the world to make case for WRI removal, the Essien said it is sad that this has persisted despite huge improvements in the security in Nigeria\u2019s waters.\n\nHe lamented thus: \u201cWe are all paying the price for it. When goods enter the country, the higher cost in shipping and insurance will drive the cost up.\n\n\u201cThe International Maritime Bureau (IMB) has admitted that the attacks have drastically dropped as never before in decades. What baffles the NIMASA management is why that though this reduction in attacks has been admitted by the IMB but the WRI is still in place. It\u2019s a punitive insurance measure. The DG has gone to three international meetings where he has been making demand and appeal for removal of War Risk Insurance.\u201d\n\nGiving vivid explanations on what Nigeria (NIMASA) did to bring down piracy, Essien said Nigeria flagged off the Deep Blue Project which is a security architecture in the waters. He said it is a collaboration of the Navy, Air Force, the Army and NIMASA as driver.\n\nHe revealed the workings thus: \u201cIt is a collaboration between the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Transportation. NIMASA is driving it as the realizing agency in terms of funding for acquisition of the assets.\n\n\u201cYou have three categories of assets, air, sea and land: In air asset category, we have two special mission helicopters and two aircraft. The helicopters handle surveillance but in the event of emergency, they can serve as intervention assets. NIMASA bears responsibility of safety of sea operations and thus uses the air assets to ensure this.\n\n\u201cIn sea assets, we have two special mission vessels that go to sea and can stay at one spot from time to time and watch out. There are fast-moving interception boats that can take about 16 armed agents each. They serve as MSU (Maritime Security Unit). They can be deployed in the event of an attack on any vessel at the nation\u2019s territorial waters or anywhere within its jurisdiction or permit. The vessels stay at sea and gather information via satellite and general surveillance and receive distress calls. They can deploy any number of fast boats to intervene.\n\n\u201cOn the Special Mission Vessels, there are helipads to launch choppers and receive them back. We have drones that go out for up to 16 hours to survey and share information.\n\nRead also: Senate moves to review hike in shipping fees\n\nOn land asset, he went on, there is the C4i Centre which is like the nerve centre of the entire operation. It is an IT environment that is driven by computers connected to satellite that brings information and intelligence. It runs an identification system of vessels. A drone can be sent to find out what is happening to a ship.\n\nAt the C4i, he said information is coming from air to sea to land through the C4i centre and this helps to decide which asset to dispatch to where.\n\nThere is the human element which he described as the maritime security unit comprising the Navy, Air Force, Army, the DSS (department of state security), and the Police. \u201cWe are working together. It is not a small set up. We are partners but NIMASA is the driver.\u201d\n\nOn the huge results which Nigeria expected to move the world into removing the high shipping fees imposed by the IMB, the DG\u2019s special assistant said the Deep Blue Project as a specialised security strategy yielding huge dividends, not only in reducing pirates\u2019 attacks but in the many arrests and recent convictions secured. With the latest 10 convictions and fines of N200,000 each by a federal high court sitting in Ikoyi for hijacking a merchant vessel, FV Hailufeng II, on May 15, 2020, the total number of convictions is 20. This is being achieved under the Suppression of Piracy and Other Maritime Offences (SPOMO) Act of 2019.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is the first time such feat has been recorded in Nigeria\u2019s waters. Before now, there were no strong legal instruments to hold the criminals or pirates. Now, Nigeria is becoming a model in the Gulf of Guinea in terms of security the nation\u2019s security architecture and model.\u201d\n\nHe said these accomplishments and many others have earned the DG the prestigious Zik Prize award in public policy and administration especially as Jamoh is on record for having positioned NIMASA for driving the maritime economy, delivered the Deep Blue Project, reducing pirate attacks to the lowest levels ever, created the Littoral States group to drive the Blue Economy, flagged off the training of 200 cadets, and many other initiatives so far in the past 14 months.\n\nHe mentioned another major accomplishment as the flag-off of removal of wrecks that have been there in the waterways for a long time. They constitute a potential danger to vessels as far as navigation is concerned. \u201cThe Minister of Transportation flagged this scheme off, and it is now ongoing. This way, NIMASA can fulfill one of its critical mandates in safety.\u201d\n\nHe mentioned the Shipping Development & Capacity Building where 200 cadets have been flagged off to some foreign countries to train to be world class seafarers, an area Nigeria has been lacking in global participation. It is gathered that what makes a maritime nation important is how many seafarers found in any ship at sea that come from that country. For, it was gathered, South Korea leads, with the likes of Malaysia giving hot pursuit. Nigeria seems nowhere in this, but the cadet flag-off scheme may be a starting point.\n\nHe also said the National Fleet Owners Development (NFOD) would soon be unveiled to enable Nigerian shipping magnets to own vessels and play big in the trade.\n\nHe talked about how the DG launched the Triple S policy as performance anchor and for assessment, hinging on security, safety and shipping development.\n\nHe stated that Maritime Security looks at safer seas so that Nigeria can be attractive, especially looking at what was happening in the Gulf of Guinea, the criminality in the place that was earning Nigeria a very negative reputation. So, the policy seeks solution to this.\n\nOn safety, he said this looks at the operational and environmental wellbeing of the area of jurisdiction. If a ship is going to sail, let\u2019s make sure that our shores are clear and safe.\n\nOn shipping viability policy, he said it is to give birth to productive shipping industry. His conviction is that without capacity, Nigeria as a maritime force cannot take advantage of all of her coastal world, the country cannot achieve the much-dreamt Blue Economy.\n\nHe revealed that NIMASA is working with Littoral States to create a Blue Economy where the states choose areas of advantage to participate in.\n\nNIMASA, he stated, is out to boost the economy of Littoral States: \u201cWe want to make fishing much more economical. Tourism is a sector waiting for action. Our aim is to galvanise the littoral states to participate in areas they have comparative advantage.\u201d\n\nHe also said NIMASA is helping in the mapping of environmental sensitivity. \u201cThis is one of the ways NIMASA is trying to boost the Blue Economy vision.\u201d\n\nThe plank of the Blue Economy is security in the maritime sector to allow entrepreneurs unlock many areas such as fishing, tourism, transportation, etc. \u201cWhat matters is that security has improved tremendously and this has been recognized by the IMB (International Maritime Bureau).\n\nHe urged states that are yet to key into the Littoral States Scheme to join and identify their areas of priority so that the partnership can reach them.",

          "title": "Lagos #EndSARS panel confirms massacre at Lekki TollGate [List of Victims]",
          "text": "The Lagos Judicial Panel on #EndSARS, has confirmed there was indeed a massacre of protesters at Lekki Toll Gate on 20 October 2020, contrary to official narrative debunking it.\n\nAccording to the finding of the panel, headed by Justice Okuwobi, the massacre was carried out by both the military and the police.\n\nThe finding by the panel knocked the bottom out of the position of Information Minister Lai Mohammed, who claimed there was no massacre at the Toll Gate.\n\nFirst of all, the panel questioned the deployment of soldiers to the Lekki Toll Gate as the protest there was peaceful, unlike the pockets of violence in the other parts of the city.\n\n\u201cThe deployment of the army to Lekki Toll Gate on 20/10/2020, in the absence of any reported violence was totally unwarranted\u201d, the panel found.\n\nUnlike official narrative of one or two persons dying at the tollgate, the panel confirmed 11 people dead and another four missing, but presumed dead, making a total of 15.\n\nIt listed the names of the dead casualties and the many injured.\n\nThe panel reported that the response to its Summons was hugely positive, as over 80% of those summoned honored the invitations, and gave evidence before the Panel, which assisted it greatly in unravelling the events of the 20th October 2020.\n\nThe protesters on their own attended the Panel\u2019s proceedings and presented evidence of what happened at the Lekki Toll Gate on the 20th of October, 2020.\n\nOn the part of the ENDSARS Protesters the Panel specifically considered the evidence of persons, who alleged that they were victims with injuries or death of their loved ones, which occurred during the Lekki Toll Gate Incident and the testimonies of those who were present and traumatized.\n\nSome gave accounts of what happened even though they had no physical injuries.\n\nThe evidence considered in this regard usually represented similar versions of the Lekki Toll Gate Incident as corroborated by other protesters, who were treated as Petitioners with Petitions arising from the Toll Gate Incident. Virtually all witnesses were cross examined by counsel to parties with opposing versions of Lekki Toll Gate Incident.\n\nPanel reached its findings and prepared its reports despite the evidence of the Nigerian Army, that was limited, as most of the officers who were summoned and who filed affidavits never appeared before the Panel.\n\nAt the conclusion of evidence of all relevant parties, key issues which called for determination and upon which the findings of the Panel were based are summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 Whether the Nigerian Army used live bullets on unarmed and defenseless protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate on 20th October 2020?\n\n\u2022 Whether the live bullets resulted in injuries or casualties on the part of the protesters?\n\n\u2022 Whether the Police was at the Toll Gate on the night of the 20th of October 2020 and the morning of the 21st of October 2020 and whether they shot at unarmed and defenseless protesters?\n\n\u2022 Whether the LCC played any role in the events of the night of the 20th of October2020?\n\n\u2022 Whether the Lagos State played any role in the Lekki Toll Gate Incident of the 20th ofOctober 2020.\n\nThe Panel thus made the following key findings:\n\n1. That the Nigerian Army was invited for intervention in the State and was deployed to Lekki Toll Gate on the 20th of October 2020. At the Lekki Toll Gate, officers of the Nigerian Army shot, injured and killed unarmed helpless and defenseless protesters, without provocation or justification, while they were waving the Nigerian Flag and singing the National Anthem and the manner of assault and killing could in context be described as a massacre. The Panel also found that the conduct of the Nigerian Army was exacerbated by its refusal to allow ambulances render medical assistance to victims who required such assistance. The Army was also found not to have adhered to its own Rules of Engagement.\n\n2. The Panel found that the Nigerian Police Force deployed its officers to the Lekki Toll Gate on the night of the 20th October, 2020 and between that night and the morning of the 21st of October, 2020, its officer shot at, assaulted and battered unarmed protesters, which led to injuries and deaths. The police officers also tried to cover up their actions by picking up bullets.\n\n3. The panel found that LCC hampered the panel\u2019s investigation by refusing to turn over some useful and vital information/evidence as requested by the Panel and the Forensic Expert engaged by the panel, even where such information and evidence was by the company\u2019s admission, available. It manipulated the incomplete CCTV Video footage of the Lekki Toll Gate on the night of the 20th of October 2020, which it tendered before the Panel.\n\n4. The Panel found that there was an invitation of the Nigerian Army to Lagos State made by the Lagos State Government through the Governor before the hierarchy of the Nigerian Army deployed its soldiers to the Lekki Toll Gate on the night of the 20th of October.\n\n5. The Panel found that there was an attempt to cover up the Incident of the 20th of October by the cleaning of the Lekki Toll Gate and the failure to preserve the scene ahead of potential investigations.\n\nUpon the above key findings amongst others, the Panel made a total of 32\n\nRecommendations, which included but not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Holistic Police Reforms covering welfare, training and proper equipping of Policemen and their working environment;\n\n\u2022 Sanctioning of the officers of the Nigerian Army and the Nigerian Police Force respectively who participated in shooting, injuring and killing of unarmed protestors at the Lekki Toll Gate on the 20 and 21st of October 2020;\n\n\u2022 Development of more robust engagement between the Youth and the Government;\n\n\u2022 Setting up of a Standing Committee/Tribunal to deal with cases of Violation of Human Rights by security agencies and a trust fund to settle compensation awarded by such committee/tribunal;\n\n\u2022 A public apology to ENDSARS protesters who were killed, injured and traumatized bythe Incident of the 20th of October 2020;\n\n\u2022 The memorialization of the Lekki Toll Gate and the 20th of October going forward\n\nAt the presentation of the report on Monday, Governor Sanwo-Olu promised\n\n1. To set up a Four-Man Committee led by the Honourable Attorney-General to prepare a White Paper for the purpose of implementing the findings and recommendations expressed in the report and to give it legal backing; and\n\n2. To send the report to the National Economic Council for implementation.\n\nRead the report here:JPI REPORT FOR LEKKI INCIDENT",

          "text": "US President Joe Biden signed his hard-fought $1 trillion infrastructure deal into law Monday before a bipartisan, celebratory crowd on the White House lawn, declaring that the new infusion of cash for roads, bridges, ports and more is going to make life \u201cchange for the better\u201d for the American people.\n\nBut prospects are tougher for further bipartisanship ahead of the 2022 midterm elections as Biden pivots back to more difficult negotiations over his broader $1.85 trillion social spending package.\n\nThe president hopes to use the infrastructure law to build back his popularity, which has taken a hit amid rising inflation and the inability to fully shake the public health and economic risks from COVID-19.\n\n\u201cMy message to the American people is this: America is moving again and your life is going to change for the better,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the bipartisan deal, the president had to choose between his promise of fostering national unity and a commitment to transformative change. The final measure whittled down much of his initial vision for infrastructure. Yet the administration hopes to sell the new law as a success that bridged partisan divides and will elevate the country with clean drinking water, high-speed internet and a shift away from fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cFolks, too often in Washington, the reason we didn\u2019t get things done is because we insisted on getting everything we want. Everything,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWith this law, we focused on getting things done. I ran for president because the only way to move our country forward in my view was through compromise and consensus.\u201d\n\nBiden will get outside Washington to sell the plan more broadly in coming days.\n\nHe intends go to New Hampshire on Tuesday to visit a bridge on the state\u2019s \u201cred list\u201d for repair, and he will go to Detroit on Wednesday for a stop at General Motors\u2019 electric vehicle assembly plant, while other officials also fan out across the country. The president went to the Port of Baltimore last week to highlight how the supply chain investments from the law could limit inflation and strengthen supply chains, a key concern of voters who are dealing with higher prices.\n\n\u201cWe see this as is an opportunity because we know that the president\u2019s agenda is quite popular,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday before the signing. The outreach to voters can move \u201cbeyond the legislative process to talk about how this is going to help them. And we\u2019re hoping that\u2019s going to have an impact.\u201d\n\nBiden held off on signing the hard-fought infrastructure deal after it passed on Nov. 5 until legislators would be back from a congressional recess and could join in a splashy bipartisan event. On Sunday night before the signing, the White House announced Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor, would help manage and coordinate the implementation of the infrastructure spending.\n\nThe gathering Monday on the White House lawn was uniquely upbeat with a brass band and peppy speeches, a contrast to the drama and tensions when the fate of the package was in doubt for several months. The speakers lauded the measure for creating jobs, combating inflation and responding to the needs of voters.\n\nOhio Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican who helped negotiate the package, celebrated Biden\u2019s willingness to jettison much of his initial proposal to help bring GOP lawmakers on board. Portman even credited former President Donald Trump for raising awareness about infrastructure, even though the loser of the 2020 election voiced intense opposition to the ultimate agreement.\n\n\u201cThis bipartisan support for this bill comes because it makes sense for our constituents, but the approach from the center out should be the norm, not the exception,\u201d Portman said.\n\nThe signing included governors and mayors of both parties and labor and business leaders. In addition to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the guest list included Republicans such as Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, New York Rep. Tom Reed, Alaska Rep. Don Young and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan.\n\nIn order to achieve a bipartisan deal, the president had to cut back his initial ambition to spend $2.3 trillion on infrastructure by more than half. The bill that becomes law on Monday in reality includes about $550 billion in new spending over 10 years, since some of the expenditures in the package were already planned.\n\nThe agreement ultimately got support from 19 Senate Republicans, including Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell. Thirteen House Republicans also voted for the infrastructure bill. An angry Trump issued a statement attacking \u201cOld Crow\u201d McConnell and other Republicans for cooperating on \u201ca terrible Democrat Socialist Infrastructure Plan.\u201d\n\nMcConnell said the country \u201cdesperately needs\u201d the new infrastructure money, but he skipped Monday\u2019s signing ceremony, telling WHAS radio in Louisville, Kentucky, that he had \u201cother things\u201d to do.\n\nHistorians, economists and engineers interviewed by The Associated Press welcomed Biden\u2019s efforts. But they stressed that $1 trillion was not nearly enough to overcome the government\u2019s failure for decades to maintain and upgrade the country\u2019s infrastructure. The politics essentially forced a trade-off in terms of potential impact not just on the climate but on the ability to outpace the rest of the world this century and remain the dominant economic power.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be sober here about what our infrastructure gap is in terms of a level of investment and go into this eyes wide open, that this is not going to solve our infrastructure problems across the nation,\u201d said David Van Slyke, dean of the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University.\n\nBiden also tried unsuccessfully to tie the infrastructure package to passage of a broader package of $1.85 trillion in proposed spending on families, health care and a shift to renewable energy that could help address climate change. That measure has yet to gain sufficient support from the narrow Democratic majorities in the Senate and House.\n\nBiden continues to work to appease Democratic skeptics of the broader package such as Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, while also holding on to the most liberal branches of his party. Pelosi said in remarks at the Monday bill signing that the separate package will pass \u201chopefully this week.\u201d\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz expressed concern during a Fox News interview Sunday that Republican support for the infrastructure law could ultimately lead Democrats to rally and back the second package\n\n\u201cThey gave Joe Biden a political win,\u201d Cruz said of his fellow Republicans. \u201cHe will now go across the country touting, look at this big bipartisan win. And that additional momentum, unfortunately, makes it more likely that they whip their Democrats into shape and pass some multitrillion-dollar spending bill on top of this.\u201d\n\nThe haggling over infrastructure has shown that Biden can still bring together Democrats and Republicans, even as tensions continue to mount over the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump who falsely believe that Biden was not legitimately elected president. Yet the result is a product that might not meet the existential threat of climate change or the transformative legacy of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose portrait hangs in Biden\u2019s Oval Office.\n\n\u201cYes, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is a big deal,\u201d said Peter Norton, a history professor in the University of Virginia\u2019s engineering department. \u201cBut the bill is not transformational, because most of it is more of the same.\u201d\n\nNorton compared the limited action on climate change to the start of World War II, when Roosevelt and Congress reoriented the entire U.S. economy after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Within two months, there was a ban on auto production. Dealerships had no new cars to sell for four years as factories focused on weapons and war materiel. To conserve fuel consumption, a national speed limit of 35 mph was introduced.\n\n\u201cThe emergency we face today warrants a comparable emergency response,\u201d Norton said.",

          "text": "The judicial panel set up by the Lagos government to probe cases of police brutality \u2014 including the Lekki shooting \u2014 says protesters were killed at the Lekki toll gate in what could be described in the as a \u201cmassacre\u201d.\n\nThe panel also says police officers attempted to cover up the shooting of protesters at the toll gate on October 20, 2020.\n\nOn the fateful day, in what appeared to be an attempt to disperse protesters, officers of the Nigerian Army stormed the Lekki toll gate and started shooting at peaceful protesters, some of who were waving flags and singing the national anthem.\n\nPolice officers were also said to have been present at the toll gate area as well.\n\nIn a report on its findings, which was submitted to the Lagos government on Monday, the panel said protesters were killed at the toll gate, adding that security operatives prevented ambulances from reaching injured demonstrators.\n\n\u201cAt the Lekki toll gate, officers of the Nigerian Army shot, injured and killed unarmed helpless and defenceless protesters, without provocation or justification, while they were waving the Nigerian Flag and singing the National Anthem and the manner of assault and killing could in context be described as a massacre,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cThe Panel also found that the conduct of the Nigerian Army was exacerbated by its refusal to allow ambulances render medical assistance to victims who required such assistance. The Army was also found not to have adhered to its own Rules of Engagement.\n\n\u201cThe Panel found that the Nigerian Police Force deployed its officers to the Lekki Toll Gate on the night of the 20th October, 2020 and between that night and the morning of the 21st of October, 2020, its officers shot at, assaulted and battered unarmed protesters, which led to injuries and deaths.\u201d\n\nOver the past year, the panel has heard petitions on police brutality and has also investigated the contentious Lekki toll gate incident.\n\nThe panel said the attack on protesters resulted in injuries and deaths.\n\nAccording to the panel\u2019s report, police officers tried to cover up their actions by picking up bullets.\n\n\u201cThe panel found that the Nigerian Police Force deployed its officers to the Lekki toll gate on the night of the 20th October, 2020 and between that night and the morning of the 21st of October, 2020, its officer shot at, assaulted and battered unarmed protesters, which led to injuries and deaths,\u201d the report reads.\n\nThe report also said, \u201cThe atrocious maiming and killing of unarmed, helpless and unresisting protesters, while sitting on the floor and waving their Nigerian flags, while singing the National Anthem can be equated to a \u2018massacre\u2019 in context.\u201d\n\nThe report continued, \u201cIt was alleged and corroborated that the soldiers had their vans parked at the Lekki toll gate and removed as many bodies and corpses of the fallen protesters which they took away with their vans.\n\n\u201cThe police officers also tried to cover up their actions by picking up bullets.\u201d\n\nThe panel said the Lekki Concession Company (LCC) refused to provide vital evidence that would have aided its investigation.\n\nLCC was also accused of manipulating the CCTV footage presented to the panel during its sitting.\n\n\u201cThe panel found that LCC hampered the panel\u2019s investigation by refusing to turn over some useful and vital information/evidence as requested by the panel and the forensic expert engaged by the panel, even where such information and evidence was by the company\u2019s admission, available,\u201d the report reads.\n\n\u201cIt manipulated the incomplete CCTV Video footage of the Lekki tollgate on the night of the 20th of October 2020, which it tendered before the panel.\u201d\n\nAccording to the panel, the cleaning of the Lekki tollgate after the incident and failure to preserve the scene ahead of potential investigations proves there was a cover-up attempt.\n\nThe panel recommended the sanctioning of the officers of the army and police who participated in the \u201cshooting, injuring and killing of unarmed protestors\u201d.\n\nThe panel also recommended a public apology to #EndSARS protesters who were killed, injured, and traumatised by the incident.\n\nDemola Ojo",
