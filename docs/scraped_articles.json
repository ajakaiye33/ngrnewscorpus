          "text": "THE leader of the Lagos4Lagos Movement, Mr Olajide Adediran, popularly known as Jandor, has formally declared his interest to contest the Lagos State governorship election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party in 2023.\n\nAdediran, who defected from the All Progressives Congress to join the PDP, made the declaration on Thursday during an event attended by party members and supporters in Ikeja GRA.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn the process of my journey and being in that corridor of power as a consultant to the office of the governor of Lagos State, my eyes were opened to a lot of things and I asked myself, \u2018Is this how things will continue?\u2019 The year 2011 was the first time that I sat down and came to the realisation that an heir has been made a servant because the detractors have sat on his father\u2019s inheritance, yet he was seeing what was happening around him.\n\n\u201cI said the only way we can resolve this unfair dominance in Lagos is by seizing that executive power. And it was clear to us that for us to see that power in the APC, we would first have to commit the first unpardonable sin. There is a sin one must not commit as a party member of the APC and that sin applies whether you are a politician or public office holder or appointee.\n\n\u201cWithin that circle, you must not have a structure, and I say it again, no politician in Lagos within that party, either serving or anything, that can put forth his own personal structure. Only one man must have a structure and the moment he puts that up, you are going nowhere.\n\n\u201cWe committed that unpardonable sin by making sure we put up a structure which they know could wrest the power away from them. They said we were not many, but we proved them wrong. Then we came to the conclusion that we needed to break that place, reduce their own number and join it to another party that was doing fairly well in the state, and that is how we took the PDP as our home.\u201d\n\nAdediran added that if he won the ticket, he would work together with other aspirants and not make it a one-man affair.\n\nHe added, \u201cI am aware that there are others also aspiring for the governorship of Lagos State, and some of them have been saying if we win the ticket, we will make it a whole party affair, but the truth is, I will not do this.\n\n\u201cWe will need to work together with all these other people even when I win; they should also tell us what they will do so we can win. For example, only eight Lagos4Lagos aspirants out of 40 are contesting for the House of Assembly and four out of 24 are contesting for the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cIf I eventually win, they can be the deputy or commissioners and fill other positions in the ministries and parastatals. There are 24 ministries in Lagos State and there are over 100 parastatals, is it possible for us alone to occupy them? No. Anyone of them who can be a Director-General or Executive Director, we will accept them.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "THE Kaduna State Government has clarified that there was no herder\u2019s settlement razed in Kurdan community in Zango-Kataf following the Sunday night\u2019s killing of no fewer than 37 people in Agban Kagoro.\n\nOn Wednesday, while giving an update on the security situation in Southern Kaduna, the state Commissioner for Infernal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan had said hoodlums attacked and burnt down two herders\u2019 settlements in Zaria and Kurdan in Zango-Kataf.\n\nBut on Thursday, the commissioner in another statement, recanted, saying that no settlement was burnt in the community as reported by security agencies.\n\nThe commissioner said, \u201cThe Kaduna State Government has received a formal complaint from Kurdan community of Zangon Kataf Local Government, stating that no settlement was burnt in the community as reported by security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe complaint was submitted by Warrant Officer Danjuma Yaro (retd.), President of the Community\u2019s Development Association.\n\n\u201cThe information was conveyed to security agencies for further checks and it was found to be an oversight; residents of the household deserted the location following tension in the general area, but the settlement was not burnt.\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies while confirming the oversight on Kurdan community, have already submitted pictorial and video records of locations torched by hoodlums, excluding Kurdan community.\n\n\u201cIt is important to further clarify that in no instance did security agencies confirm complicity of members of the community, as is being peddled in some quarters to deliberately personalize the oversight.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the state government has relaxed the 24-hour curfew imposed on Kaura and Jema\u2019a Local Government areas of the state following Sunday night\u2019s killing of no fewer than 37 people in Agban Kagoro.\n\nThe killings at Agban Kagoro in Kaura LGA sparked off protests on Monday, forcing the state government to slam a 24-hour curfew on the two councils \u2013 Jema\u2019a and Kaura, for fear of escalation of violence in the areas.\n\nBut Aruwan, in another statement Thursday evening, announced the relaxation of the curfew from 6pm to 6am.\n\nAccording to him, the decision to relax the curfew was reached after a review of the security situation presented by security agencies at a peace engagement.\n\n\u201cBy this development, there will be movement in the areas from 6am to 6pm, while the curfew is to be observed from 6pm to 6am daily.\n\n\u201cThe government wishes to reiterate that the initial declaration of the 24-hour curfew was to avert escalation of violence. Monitoring of the situation will continue. Should security assessments necessitate it, the government will not hesitate to revert to a 24-hour curfew,\u201d the commissioner added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Defence Headquarters said it has intensified efforts in order to bring those behind the recent attacks in Southern Kaduna to book.\n\nSpeaking during a briefing in Abuja on Thursday, the Director, Defence Media Operations, Brig. Gen. Bernard Onyeuko, disclosed that serious operations had commenced in Southern Kaduna, assuring all that those behind the attacks would be fished out.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe troops of Operations Thunder Strike and Whirl Punch, who operate within the area, have been on top of the game.\n\n\u201cBefore long, those criminals would be brought to book. We are already carrying out serious operations within those areas.\u201d\n\nOnyeuko, also said between March 10 and 24, airstrikes killed key members of Islamic State of West African Province in Borno.\n\n\u201cTroops carried out air interdictions on March 15 around Lake Chad and Tumbuns, close to Wulgo in Marte area of Borno. During the airstrikes, key members of Islamic State of West African Province were neutralised,\u201d he added.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

However, PHC service delivery has been enhanced by the federal government with the injection of Basic Healthcare Provision Fund, and also with improvement in immunization coverage and use of Information Communication Technology (ICT) to track service, supply chain and upgrade data quality. Our COVID-19 response praised by both World Health Organization and the United Nations; but much more needs to be done, cost effectively to make Health services available, acceptable, accessible and affordable to 90% of citizens, even at the grassroots,\u201dhe added.\n\nEhanire said,\u201dRevitalizing Primary Health Care Centres is central to this initiative and key to Mr President\u2019s health agenda and Ministry of Health\u2019s effort to reposition PHCs to deliver quality healthcare service irrespective of location,\u201dadding:\u201d This is the first step in reversing poor health indices, improving citizen quality of life and economic productivity.\u201d\n\nNoting also thet,\u201dNigeria\u2019s health system is a shared responsibility by federal, state and local governments\u201d,he said:\u201dIn practice, however, it is assumed that primary healthcare is a local government responsibility, Secondary care, a responsibility of state governments and tertiary, of the federal government.\u201d\n\n\u201d The lack of clarity does not allow each tier to stay in their presumed area of work. State governments prefer building tertiary hospitals in the capital city, while federal has to develop PHCs.\n\nHe lamented the neglect of investment in primary health centres in rural areas.\n\n\u201cThe low Investment in PHCs does not take us towards achieving Universal Health Coverage, neither will huge hospitals in the city, which only serve the needs of the majority city dwellers.\n\n\u201cThe poor cannot even afford transport fare to the city. Meanwhile, surrounding General Hospitals and Primary healthcare centers are not functional,\u201dhe said.\n\nA\u00e7cording to him,\u201dA shift of attention to face the actual problems at a fraction of the cost of giant hospitals, is what is now needed\u201d, adding:\u201dOne simple PHC infrastructure per Ward, one doctor, if available, trained nurses and birth attendants, worthy staff quarters, water borehole, solar powered lighting, a secure perimeter fence and essential medicines and health commodities supply, are all that rural and suburban PHCs need, to bring universal health coverage within reach.\u201d\n\nThe minister,who said:\u201dOur 10-year country-specific PHC transformation strategy is based on a 4-point agenda and in line with best standards\u201d,said\u201d Our call is to re-build a sustainable primary care system, offering services that meet citizen needs, through the course of a life time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am therefore, calling on all and sundry to support and pursue this agenda: a minimum one PHC per ward revitalization, starting now,\u201dhe appealed.\n\nThe Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, NPHCDA, Dr. Faisal Shuaib, speaking at the event with the theme:\u201cRe-imagining Primary Health Care in Nigeria\u201d, said that Nigeria has a four point PHC agenda to implement.\n\nThe four-point agenda,he said,\u201dis about implementing strategies that work and also thinking about those strategies that will drive more service delivery and revilitalisation of our primary health care sectors in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201d Everybody here today has a part to play in changing the current state of our primary health cares. Now is the time for us to talk and deliver solutions that will radically transform the PHCs in Nigeria,\u201dShuaib added.2",

Senator Chris Ekpenyong, a serving senator, who was indisposed sent his goodwill and solidarity message through Senator Eyakenyi.\n\nAddressing the Caucus, Pastor Eno thanked the lawmakers for their support and solidarity, stating that his emergence as the preferred successor is nothing but a product of God\u2019s grace and not his political strength and know-how.\n\n\u201cI am humbled by the calibre of people here.

You are speaking for the people. Today, we stand at a threshold of history.

Olayinka Dada while addressing the media was quoted as saying \u201cAs you can see, Nigerians in all corners of the nation embraced a new beginning with their huge participation at the NNPP congresses because they are tired of the lies and corrupt nature of the characters in the two dominant political parties, the APC and the PDP\u201d. The people have shown that 2023 elections is theirs to decide by the decorous manner with which the Congress was conducted.\n\nThey loudly signaled to the corrupt leaders running Nigeria aground that they are ready to uproot them from political leadership.\n\nHon. Dada particularly praised Ekiti State members of the NNPP for adopting the consensus method in electing her leaders saying it shows they already have a clear direction different from claims to leadership by entitlement. From the lowest to the highest level of governance, our party shall contest for available offices with capable hands to save the nation from dwindling.\n\nHon. Dada said, \u201cgone are the days when Nigerians were divided on the basis of tribal, ethnic and primordial sentiments, we can no longer accept the political scavengers parading themselves for themselves at the detriment of our collective development\u201d.\n\nA new Nigeria is possible, and you have seen Ekiti people demonstrating by coming out en-mass for these congresses.\n\nHe charged officers of the party elected at Ward, Local Government and State levels to work hard in unseating the political parties he described as predators, the people\u2019s woes- APC and PDP.\n\nIn 2023, let us all change the destiny of our country. Let us enthrone capable leaders that can rebuild the ruins caused by these political scavengers. Only our party, the NNPP can guarantee that hope and that begins with your election as officers of our great party. Therefore, I urge you all to see leadership as a tool of effecting real change, of development and welfare. He commended the outgone Chairman Prince Ade-Ajayi for his understanding, cooperation, support and for making harmonisation of old and new members possible.\n\nAmongst the newly elected officers of the NNPP is Alh.

          "text": "\u2022Your days are numbered, minister tells saboteurs\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday deployed the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari as well as the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor to assess the level of oil theft in the Niger Delta.\n\nThe development followed public outrage against the massive stealing of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil, which had hobbled the country\u2019s ability to meet the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, had on Monday lamented the unprecedented rate of oil theft recorded in recent times and its debilitating effect on government revenue and accretion to reserves.\n\nThe governor\u2019s comment came a day after THISDAY reported similar concerns expressed by the Co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Seplat Energy Plc, Mr. Austin Avuru, who called for a state of emergency in the Nigerian oil and gas sector.\n\nHe revealed that up to 80 per cent of oil pumped in the country, particularly in the East, is stolen.\n\nAvuru spoke a few days after a businessman and Chairman Heirs Holdings, Mr. Tony Elumelu, also bemoaned the worsening state of the industry, stressing that about 95 per cent of oil production does not get to the terminal.\n\nEarlier, Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company (AEEPCO), operators of the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL) pipeline, had threatened to exit the facility due to incessant vandalism, perennial sabotage and outright theft.\n\nHowever, at the group\u2019s first ports of call in Port Harcourt, Rivers state, Delta and Bayelsa states yesterday, Sylva who described the perpetrators as criminals, said the deployment of top stakeholders by Buhari was to underscore the importance of the situation.\n\n\u201cWe have come because of the activities of these criminals. The government and the country can no longer afford these activities and that\u2019s why we are here. I don\u2019t want to say much, but we are going now, the CDS, myself and the operating companies and the GMD, we are going to overfly and see for ourselves what\u2019s happening.\n\n\u201cAnd then I can assure you that within the next few days, operations will start in earnest and we are very sure that we are going to be victorious in a few months.\n\n\u201cThe problem of security has come to the attention of the president and Mr. President has directed myself and the CDS and the GMD to ensure that this problem is handled once and for all,\u201d the minister said.\n\nAccording to Sylva, there are three elements to the solution to the extant problem, including the communities, as in his words, \u201cthese people involved in the illegal activities are not ghosts.\u201d\n\nSylva argued that since the perpetrators are from communities, the host communities need to be involved in finding a lasting solution to the menace.\n\n\u201cThe security too must be involved because you are the law enforcement arm of government and of course we also as part of government we must be involved and then the third arm, are the operating companies.\n\n\u201cAll the elements are complete now. We are here as government, the operating companies are here and of course we are going to the communities. So, I believe that finally, this problem will be resolved.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to stop it because we can ill afford the continuation of the insecurity in the oil industry. So I want to let everybody know that these criminals have their days numbered.\n\n\u201cWe are here to ensure that this problem is finally resolved and to reclaim this industry for the country because this country has lost so much from the activities of these criminals and the government and country can no longer afford these activities and that\u2019s why we are here,\u201d he maintained.\n\nIn his comments, Kyari stated that the government had concluded plans to move against oil bunkering, pipeline vandalism and illegal activities threatening the country\u2019s oil sector.\n\nKyari noted that the government would leave no stone unturned to arrest the increasing spate of oil theft and destruction of the environment which had cost the country foreign exchange earnings.\n\nThe team which visited various sites where illegal oil refineries were being carried out, he said, was on a mission to ensure that illegal oil refining and theft of crude oil was halted.\n\nAt Ibaa which is in Emeoha Local Government of the state, Kyari and the team ordered the destruction of several illegal sites.\n\nSpeaking with journalists at Ibaa, Kyari said the country could no longer afford to see her oil illegally exploited and stolen. He pointed out that the strategy being adopted would finally arrest the situation.\n\nHe commended the security team in the effort to stop denying the country the much needed resources for economic development.\n\nThe NNPC GMD warned that stakeholders are not being left out in the quest to find a lasting solution, adding that the Navy were also on top of the situation, assuring that the task of destroying illegal oil refinery will not stop until the problem is resolved.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "In an email circular that went out from Bento Africa\u2019s board of directors to the company\u2019s customers and partners on Wednesday evening, the board announced that Ebun Okubanjo will be taking \u201csome time off\u201d and handing over all people-related decisions to his co-founder and COO, Chidozie Okonkwo. Chidozie will lead people operations alongside the company\u2019s country directors.\n\nBento\u2019s board\u2019s decision comes a few days after TechCabal exposed the harrowing experiences of ex-employees of payroll startup Bento Africa and how Okubanjo had allegedly been the orchestrator of that through direct and indirect bullying, verbal abuse, and threats to employees.\n\nIn their email to Bento\u2019s customers and clients, the board condemned Ebun\u2019s initial reaction to the story, especially his tweets attacking the credibility of publication TechCabal.\n\n\u201cAs professional Investors and Operators, we were aghast at the defensive and escalatory first tweets of Ebun on the matter, which we quickly moved against. Our responsibility and charter is to the Company, not the founders we invest in,\u201d the board said in an email sent to all Bento employees, past and present.\n\nFurthermore, the board said that while Okubanjo is taking a back seat with immediate effect, an internal investigation into Bento\u2019s workplace culture has begun. It also announced that it would be reviewing Bento Africa\u2019s internal management practices and processes.\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing the HR and People practices and guidelines at Bento and will work with HR consultants and the company\u2019s in-house team to make sure that it is reflective of human values that drive sustainable performance,\u201d said the board in the email.\n\nThe board claimed to have \u201c\u2026ensured that the current team is safe and free to speak freely. We voided any NDA\u2019s that may have been in place and instructed Management to let the Team know they were free to speak to any journalist that contacted them.\u201d TechCabal reached out to current Bento Africa employees who confirmed that they had been granted permission to speak freely without worrying about consequences.\n\n\u201cI think not restricting us from talking to journalists and cancelling our NDAs is the right thing to do,\u201d said one of the 3 employees TechCabal reached out to for the expose.\u201d\n\nOkubanjo also published a personal apology to current and past employees of the company via his Medium page. In the post titled From ebun. With Love, Okubanjo admits to encouraging a work culture of \u201clong workdays and weeks\u201d and apologised for his abusive outbursts. He also confirmed the board\u2019s decision to appoint Chidozie to lead people operations at the company.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Okubanjo writes. \u201cI have some work to do here and there is a lot of room for growth. It will [sic] be a lie if I say this is a switch I can make overnight, I would [sic] need to learn how to balance passion with empathy. I will step away from all people decisions in the company. Chidozie will take over along with our new Head of People \u2014 Her arrival could not have been more timely. The country leads will also be instrumental in helping shape a more humane people policy.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to repair broken bridges, the CEO also encouraged former and current employees who have \u201cfelt that fire that burns [sic] so hot when we are in the thick of it\u201d to reach out to him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in support of the way Ebun handled the situation, and we\u2019re currently running an internal investigation to quantify the scale of the damages his actions have brought to employees and the business,\u201d said board member and CEO at Zedcrest, Adedayo Hamza. \u201cWe\u2019re open to speaking to anyone about this process.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Tyranny in the workplace: The chaotic culture of Bento Africa",
          "text": "\u201cBento took everything from me\u2014my sense of humanity, sanity, confidence, and trust,\u201d Pascal*, an ex-sales executive at Nigerian payroll startup Bento Africa, said about his time working there. \u201cWe worked around the clock. Ebun [CEO and co-founder of the company] would send you messages by 2 AM and expect a response asap. No rest. We went to bed every night praying our jobs would still be there when we woke up the next morning.\u201d\n\nOn March 18, 2021, Pascal\u2019s prayer, which had seemed to work for over a year, stopped working. He was abruptly fired from his job. He fell into a depressive state, and everything stopped making sense. He stopped going out, and his relationships with friends and family suffered. Even though he said working at Bento for over a year had been torture, it was all he had at the time.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng) is the brainchild of Ebun Okubanjo and Chidozie Okonkwo, his friend, business partner, and Bento\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO). Headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria, Bento provides payroll management software to 900 businesses, including Hygeia, Paystack, Kobo360, Branch, and LORI Systems.\n\nOkubanjo and Okonkwo built, and still run, multiple businesses together. While both co-founders flock together, they aren\u2019t quite of the same feather. All ex-employees who spoke to us described Okubanjo as fire and Okonkwo as neither water nor fire; Okonkwo simply remains in the background, silent and rarely engaged in the company\u2019s day-to-day operations. These ex-employees therefore believe that Okonkwo\u2019s attitude outsources all authority to Okubanjo and enables his toxicity.\n\nIn Okubanjo\u2019s termination email to Pascal, he was fired because of a \u201clack of cultural fit and poor performance\u201d. But Pascal wondered: \u201cHow could I have been culturally unfit and incompetent after working for you for over a year? Why did it take you that long to clock my incompetence?\u201d\n\nOkubanjo\u2019s email terminating Pascal\u2019s contract\n\nThe termination letter\n\nHe said, despite the daily verbal assaults he endured in the hands of Okubanjo, all he wanted to do was to be the best salesperson in the company and make his employer proud. He hadn\u2019t done much work in sales prior to Bento, so he put in the work. Within 5 months, according to him, he had the second-highest number of clients on their sheets at the time. He closed some of the biggest clients\u2014some of them with over 1,000 employees and a monthly payroll worth \u20a615\u2013\u20a620 million (~$47,000).\n\nDespite his achievements, however, Pascal did not succeed in making his boss proud. \u201cThere was no free day from Ebun\u2019s verbal abuse. If he wasn\u2019t calling me a useless person, he was threatening to beat me up,\u201d Pascal said. At some point, while recounting his experience to TechCabal, he paused to catch his breath.\n\nPascal described his time at Bento as the darkest period of his life.\n\nPascal narrated how employees would weep during the sales team\u2019s check-in call at 8 AM every weekday. Okubanjo harshly criticised their work and threatened to fire them all at these meetings.\n\nEzekiel*, who had worked with the company\u2019s growth marketing team, shared his experience with TechCabal. He had joined one of the sales calls and heard Okubanjo calling them \u201cpussies and deadweights\u201d. He also heard Okubanjo tell the team that they smelled. \u201cEven though he never attacked me personally,\u201d Ezekiel said, \u201cI always wondered how anybody could go through that every morning and remain sane.\u201d\n\nBento Africa\u2019s cofounders: Ebun Okubanjo (left) and Chidozie Okonkwo (right)\n\nEx-employees also revealed gaps in Bento\u2019s employment contract, specifically where leave days and time off were concerned. Okubanjo promised employees that they could take time off when they needed it, but Bola*, another ex-employee from the company\u2019s sales team, dispelled that promise as a myth.\n\n\u201cI can count on one hand how many people took leave during my stay there. Ebun said breaks are for pussies and fuckers, and whoever takes time out of the office for a whole week is a weak member of the team and not needed in the organisation,\u201d said Bola.\n\n\u201cEbun scarred me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have spent money on therapy, yet, I still suffer from anxiety.\u201d\n\nIn her early days at the startup, Bola asked a lot of people to come work with her at Bento. At that time, she was ignorant of Okubanjo\u2019s \u201cterrifying personality\u201d. \u201cHad I known about it, I wouldn\u2019t have asked anybody to join Bento. Now, when a prospective Bento employee reaches out to me, I just tell them to run!\u201d\n\nAccording to the sources we spoke to, Okubanjo rarely welcomed alternative opinions and monopolised making key business decisions; the punishment for criticising his ideas was immediate termination of employment. For a number of Bento ex-employees, termination simply entailed deactivated Slack accounts and emails.\n\nTinu*, who had been poached from another company to come join Bento, woke up one day and found out she\u2019d been fired and logged out of her Slack and work email. She\u2019d only been with the company as Communication Lead for less than 3 weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was a nerve-wracking experience and the worst 5 months of my adult life,\u201d said Amaka*, who was excited to join a tech startup in Nigeria after finishing her studies in the US. She was fired after enduring Okubanjo\u2019s insults and unwarranted comments about her body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a plus-size woman and Okubanjo would always have opinions about my dressing. He once told me to stop wearing dresses, that I need to wear jackets, trouser and suit all the time (presumably to cover my breast) after his girlfriend Alice commented that she liked my breast. What did I wear? Regular dresses that even my mother approved of.\u201d\n\nAmaka likened the day she was fired to a scene out of a movie. \u201cWe were on a sales call, and Ebun kept saying I wasted company resources while bringing in zero value.\u201d Okubanjo accused her of charging her personal Bolt ride on the company\u2019s debit card, unaware that Amaka had stopped using the card entirely and even ran the company\u2019s errands with her own car.\n\nFollowing Okubanjo\u2019s accusation, Amaka asked that the card be audited to ascertain whether she had indeed been wasting the company\u2019s money. Okubanjo checked the card and discovered that she hadn\u2019t been using the card for personal expenses. Rather than apologise to her, he changed tack and started accusing her of not working.\n\n\u201cHe called me useless and told me to f*ck off from the call. Next thing I knew, my colleagues were texting to inform me that he\u2019d fired me after I dropped off the call.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, when Kunle*, a lead engineer who worked for the company for over 2 years, was fired last November, he only found out about it when he couldn\u2019t access his Slack and work email the next morning. \u201cEbun fired me because he felt like I was trying to wrest authority from him,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo announcing on the company\u2019s slack after firing Kunle\n\n\u201cLeave Ebun, that man can literally kill you and brag about it. He\u2019s that vindictive,\u201d Ezekiel had mentioned while speaking to TechCabal. Ada*, another ex-staff, had also specifically declined to speak to us because she was worried about her safety, fearing that her former employer, could hurt her.\n\nIn the images above, Okubanjo referred to himself as Marlo Stanfield on Bento\u2019s Slack. Who is that, you may ask?\n\nMarlo Stanfield is a fictional character on the HBO television drama The Wire. He is a young, ambitious, intelligent, and ruthless gangster. In the drama series, Stanfield demanded unconditional respect, which superseded all other concerns. He was murderously narcissistic, and frequently ordered the deaths of those who disrespected or undermined him. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked him number 2 on their list of \u201c40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\u201d.\n\nThe day before Kunle was fired, the company\u2019s CTO Lede Adeniyi was on leave, so Kunle stepped up to lead the engineering team. Kunle recalled that one of the account executives had told him that a customer wanted a feature that was not in Bento\u2019s product roadmap for the year. Kunle said he explained to the executive that the company had prioritised other fixes and features for the year and would include the requested feature on their first sprint in 2022. He, however, suggested that if the customer wanted the feature added quickly, he could talk to Okubanjo.\n\n\u201cI referred the executive to Ebun because Ebun had already accused me, previously, of setting priorities behind him. But even that was a crime,\u201d said Kunle. The executive went to Okubanjo with their request, as Kunle had suggested, and all hell broke loose.\n\n\u201cI remember how Ebun came to shout at me: \u2018Hey motherfucker, what did you say to a customer about their ask?\u2019 He shut me up before I could even answer and called me names, which was normal. I was his usual point of reference whenever he wanted to benchmark weaknesses and redundancy in the team. Imagine being disrespected in front of your team members every day.\u201d\n\nNow, before the November firing, Okubanjo had fired Kunle once before. It happened on a trip to Ghana. Kunle had asked Okubanjo to stop calling him a monkey. Okubanjo responded to that by firing him on the spot. \u201cHe told me to find my way back to Nigeria, and that he didn\u2019t care how I did it.\u201d But then, he called Kunle after a few hours to give him his job back, knowing he needed him to sort out the business operations they had come for in Ghana.\n\nOn November 22, when Okunbanjo fired Kunle for the second and final time, he refused to pay his November salary and severance pay. Kunle reached out to Adeniyi, the CTO, to help him speak to Okubanjo about his owed payments, but Adeniyi couldn\u2019t do anything about it. \u201cYou know Ebun does what he wants,\u201d Kunle recalled Adeniyi saying to him.\n\nWhen TechCabal reached out to Adeniyi for comment on the incident, he confirmed Kunle\u2019s report: \u201cYes, Kunle asked me to follow up with Ebun, which I did, and Ebun promised to pay him.\u201d It\u2019s been 4 months now and Okubanjo still hasn\u2019t paid Kunle.\n\nBut after Kunle got fired, it seemed his former boss wasn\u2019t done with him.\n\n\u201cLast month, just when my mental health was getting back in shape, Ebun popped up on my LinkedIn, offering me my old job back,\u201d Kunle said. \u201cI declined. Such effrontery! No form of apology. I haven\u2019t found a new job yet because I\u2019m scared of working in another Nigerian startup.\u201d\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo reached out to Kunle* 4 months after to offer him his job back\n\nKunle claimed that Ebun sacked his friend John*, a former member of Bento\u2019s design team, because John was talking a lot about web3 on social media. Okubanjo accused John of finding Bento \u201cless interesting\u201d. TechCabal reached out to John through Kunle but he hasn\u2019t replied.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give Okubanjo notice period when you\u2019re leaving the company. He\u2019d fire you and tell you off,\u201d Ezekiel said. \u201cWhen Ebun fires you, he tells you to watch how he\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t get a job anywhere else in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nTare Johnson, Bento\u2019s ex-accountant and financial analyst, believes this was why he couldn\u2019t find a job for 6 months after leaving Bento in August 2020. When Johnson joined Bento in February 2020, his contract stated that he was coming in to lead the finance team. He would later find out that there was no team, and that he would be leading himself while reporting to a \u201cnarcissistic boss\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was basically the only one handling all the company\u2019s finances. I was also doing clerical jobs and running errands like a personal assistant, which was confusing and not even remotely close to my job description,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cMy initial thought was, \u2018It\u2019s a startup and things move around a lot.\u2019 But I was wrong. This place was designed to break employees. Ebun abused me verbally, which is standard behaviour for him with employees. He\u2019d call me a motherfucker, dullard, and every vulgar word in the dictionary. He even insulted my family.\u201d\n\nJohnson, running a one-man finance team, was stuck in a mess he hadn\u2019t bargained for. The pandemic lockdown hit barely a month after he got the job, locking him into the job at a time when companies were laying people off and not hiring. So he stuck around and took all the verbal abuse Okubanjo hurled at him. After 5 months, he figured he was coping, until an event on Monday, August 17, 2020 made him resign without notice.\n\nThe WhatsApp conversation between Johnson and Okubanjo\n\nThat Monday, Johnson\u2014like he had done every morning\u2014shared the company\u2019s daily bank statements to Okubanjo and Okonkwo on WhatsApp. Upon receiving them, Okubanjo replied with: \u201cBro, are you drunk???\u201d Johnson thought he must have made a mistake somewhere on the statements, so he quickly double-checked before re-sharing the statements with Bento\u2019s founding team. Okubanjo was still not satisfied with the statements. Apparently, some recent transaction hadn\u2019t reflected yet in the company\u2019s account at the time Johnson compiled the statement; there was no way Johnson could have included it in his report. But Okubanjo, \u201cin his usual fashion\u201d, asked Johnson to fix the spreadsheet or he\u2019d fire him. Finally fed up, Johnson resigned with a simple message: \u201cNo need, I quit\u201d and exited the WhatsApp group. An hour later, he sent in his resignation letter.\n\nFor Johnson, joining Bento Africa was \u201ca bad idea\u201d and leaving \u201cthe best thing he\u2019d ever done for himself\u201d.\n\nWhy were Okubanjo\u2019s red flags ignored?\n\nSome of the ex-employees said Okubanjo\u2019s ruthless leadership style was obvious from the first day they met him. \u201cThe day I met him for my interview, he told me he could read poverty all over my face,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cOn the first day we met,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cI witnessed an altercation that ended with Ebun threatening to punch a stranger in the face.\u201d\n\nAmaka, on her part, said she recognised Okubanjo from a video that had gone viral a year before, where he was in a heated argument with a female customer of Fitness Central, a gym he co-founded with Okonkwo. In the video, Okunbanjo\u2019s threatening personality was evident and on full-display.\n\nSo, why did these former Bento staff accept to work for the company after seeing these red flags from the CEO?\n\n\u201cI felt bad, but what could I do? I needed the job. I was just coming off the HNG Internship,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cThe money was good, for someone who hadn\u2019t even done the mandatory, one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC),\u201d said Amaka.\n\n\u201cI had already stayed about 7 months without a job, after NYSC, and was even planning to go back home [which is outside Lagos] when the job came. So, it was my best option at the time,\u201d said Adanma*, a former employee of the company.\n\nCulture shock after leaving Bento\n\nFormer employees who spoke to TechCabal confessed to experiencing culture shock at their subsequent jobs.\n\nAdanma \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe it when my current boss asked for my opinion on things. \u201cFor the first few months [at my current job], I was too scared to voice an opinion at meetings, for fear of being called stupid.\u201d\n\nBola \u201cwas surprised when my current boss said switching off Slack notifications is good to reduce anxiety, and that we should all try it.\u201d\n\nAccording to McKinsey, hundreds of experiments show that encounters with rude, insulting, and demeaning people undermine workers\u2019 performance, including their decision-making skills, productivity, creativity, and willingness to work harder and help coworkers.\n\nOkubanjo often claims that Bento is \u201ca mission and not a company\u201d hence his iron-fist leadership.\n\nBento is still toxic\n\nThree current Bento employees contacted by TechCabal were diplomatic about their responses, but they agreed that everything this publication has unearthed about Bento Africa\u2019s work culture \u201cis not false\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne minute it\u2019s silence; the next it\u2019s chaos. It\u2019s unstable here, and the pressure is too much,\u201d one of them said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really bothered,\u201d the second employee said. \u201cMy former place of work was also toxic, so I\u2019m kinda used to it. At this point, I think all startups are the same.\u201d\n\nThe third employee wouldn\u2019t \u201cdeny that Bento can be toxic for some people but not in my personal experience. We work very hard, and we play harder. Most people on the team love their jobs. It\u2019s not for everyone, really.\u201d\n\nWhile several ex-Bento employees agree that the company has a great and important product, they believe both founders in charge of the startup are unfit for their roles. The company\u2019s Glassdoor reviews tell more stories of its unconducive work culture.\n\nIn December last year, Bento expanded into Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with plans to set up operations in 6 other markets\u2014Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Angola, and Ethiopia\u2014by the end of this year. The company also leveraged the influence of music veteran and record label boss Don Jazzy to push a campaign supporting the African entrepreneurship spirit\u2014a campaign that arguably boosted its pan-African brand equity. These strides mean that the company is growing to a stage where its apparent lack of structure, process, and attention to employee welfare can no longer be ignored.\n\nTechCabal reached out to Okubanjo and Okonkwo for comments. Okonkwo didn\u2019t respond, but Okubanjo did. In his response, he called our then-developing story \u201cfiction\u201d and posted our email request to Twitter, claiming our article was a \u201chit job\u201d. He has followed his tweets with a series of abusive personal messages to members of the TechCabal team.\n\nEbun Okubanjo posted our email request on Twitter, he has since deleted the tweet.\n\nWhile Johnson, Bola, Amaka, Kunle, Ezekiel, Adanma, and others still scared to speak up have licked their wounds and moved on, Pascal\u2019s family refuses to let the abuse he suffered at Bento slide. They have sued Okubanjo. \u201cI just want him to rescind the lies he told in the termination email to me, I have all the evidence to prove he lied,\u201d Pascal said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: * Besides Tare Johnson who specifically asked not to be anonymous, other names have been changed to protect the identities of those involved. Furthermore, two current members of Big Cabal Media\u2019s team were former employees at Bento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng).\n\nUpdate: Amaka\u2019s account on Okubanjo\u2019s comment about her dressing was updated at 12:30 AM on March 22, 2020.\n\nUpdate: Tangerine Africa was removed from the Bento\u2019s client lists because the company said they have only provided insurance to Bento clients in the past, but never been a client themselves.

          "title": "Big Cabal Media raises $2.3m to expand its compelling line of digital products",
          "text": "Over decades, the news media landscape has changed dramatically. Checking for news online\u2014whether through Google, social network sites, major newspapers, or local media websites\u2014has become ubiquitous. The widespread use of smartphones also means the latest developments around the world are delivered to people instantaneously.\n\nWhile digital media has connected people in ways never before possible, enabling users to remain informed and maintain relationships across time and distance, companies in the space have attracted a paltry amount of funding. In 2021, venture capital invested $115 million in digital media globally, a tenth of the $1.1billion it funded in 2015, but not much came to Africa. Digital newsrooms in Africa are more likely to receive story grants than business funding, with a few exceptions.\n\nToday, one of such exceptions, Big Cabal Media (BCM), a leading African digital media company, has announced a $2.3 million Seed funding round, emphasising its commitment to keep building exciting and authoritative media products and brands. The new investment round saw participation from existing investors: Unicorn Capital Partners and Future Africa. New investors such as Mac Venture Capital and Luminate participated.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to support Big Cabal Media at a pivotal moment. Independent tech media like BCM are key pillars of society,\u201d said Abdul Noormohamed, Vice-president Africa at Luminate. \u201cAt Luminate, we are convinced that these digital media disruptors will continue to create engaging content and thereby contribute to the political and societal change we all want to see.\u201d\n\nPrior to this funding, with just over $600,000 raised in funding, BCM has grown to become one of the most exciting media and tech businesses in Africa. Its two major publications, TechCabal and Zikoko, reach over 30 million people monthly across platforms, with over 170,000 newsletter subscribers, and a 225% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2018 and 2021.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Bankole Oluwafemi, TechCabal started as a deliberate effort to cover the burgeoning Nigerian tech ecosystem. While the publication started out focusing just on the Nigerian startup space, it soon expanded its coverage to all of Africa. The publication covers startup fundraises, product launches, expansions, regulatory tussles, and stories of various players in the digital economy.\n\nA year after TechCabal launched Seyi Taylor joined the company as co-founder and CEO, while Oluwafemi continued in his role as Editor-in-Chief. They continued to expand TechCabal\u2019s coverage and scale up its operations. In 2016, the duo decided to try something different with the launch of Zikoko, a publication many likened to Buzzfeed at the time of its birth. Zikoko has grown from mostly publishing listicles and quizzes to sharing important stories on every aspect of Nigerians\u2019 lives, earning it \u201cNigeria\u2019s most viral publisher\u201d tagline.\n\nTwo years after the launch of Zikoko, Tomiwa Aladekomo joined the company, taking over as CEO. Aladekomo is an experienced media and marketing professional, who has worked in a range of businesses across different sectors in both North America and Africa.\n\nOver the next four years, Aladekomo focused on diversifying the company\u2019s revenue streams. BCM had derived its income mostly through native advertising, but Aladekomo oversaw the build-out of an extensive suite of advertising products across publications. The company built out a substantial events business; launched the Cabal Creative content studio, which has served multiple Fortune 500 clients ranging from Google to Coca-Cola; and launched TC Insights, a digital economy consultancy business.\n\nUnder Aladekomo\u2019s leadership, BCM has also embarked on ambitious projects like Jollof Road, an 80-day adventurous road trip across all mainland countries in West Africa; and Tech Women Lagos, a multi-sensory exhibition of 50 women in the Lagos technology ecosystem from different backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI joined BCM in 2018, brought on some really talented people, and we immediately kickstarted a period of experimentation,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cOur experiments encompassed editorial content and approaches, monetisation and even company culture.\u201d\n\nTomiwa Aladekomo, CEO of Big Cabal Media\n\nNine years after its launch, BCM which started as a tech blog has morphed into a media powerhouse. Its two publications, TechCabal and Zikoko are experts at creating content that hits the cultural nerve. They go beyond covering the scenes to creating agenda-setting editorial content, projects, and events. Cabal Creative and TC Insights are also supporting hundreds of companies within Africa.\n\nThe company also boasts of a laudable alumni network, which includes Odunayo Eweniyi, CEO and co-founder of Fintech startup Piggyvest and First Check, a female-led, female-focused, angel fund and investor community; Osarumen Osamuyi, Partner Manager at Meta; Jola Ayeye, scriptwriter and co-host of the I Said What I Said (ISWIS) podcast\u2014one of the most listened to podcasts in Africa\u2014and a host of others. An indication of its investment in its employees.\n\n\u201cFrom documented reports and experience, too, very few people who work for media organisations are offered a competitive salary and we\u2019d like to be the exception to the norm,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cThe BCM model has been tested and proven. In 2021, we quadrupled our 2020 revenue, and over the last 4 years our CAGR is 225%.\u201d\n\nWith this new funding, BCM plans to develop its product serving, staff, and audience. \u201cWe are expanding our video production by exploring docuseries and short films,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cWe will be transforming our studio into a community hub for creatives, and introducing 3 new tech products, including the Zikoko app and Zikoko Memes 2.0, which first launched in 2020. We will also be building out new audiences while offering competitive wages.\u201d\n\nIn the past 5 years, some notable fundraises by African digital media companies include Nigerian media company Stears Business\u2019 $600,000 seed round in 2020 and Ghana\u2019s OMG Digital $1.1m seed funding in 2017. BCM\u2019s progress over the years and recent fundraise is a noteworthy example of the possibilities and opportunities in Africa\u2019s digital media sector.\n\nOf the reported $4.3\u2013$5 billion raised by African startups in 2021 whereby fintech received 53\u201363% of the volume, digital media companies are one of many sectors that have traditionally been overlooked in the conversation of tangible ventures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to enter this chapter with Big Cabal Media, as we fully believe in its massive potential for further success, scale and global impact,\u201d said Marlon Nichols, co-Founder and Managing General Partner at MaC Venture Capital. \u201cInvesting in Africa\u2019s booming digital media sector aligns perfectly with MaC\u2019s mission of supporting exceptional entrepreneurs building valuable technology companies that leverage shifts in cultural trends and behaviours. I have no doubt that BCM will seize this unique opportunity to continue leading conversations in culture and helping digital consumers access the information that matters most to them.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing its success in the agricultural sector with technology that addresses market access and other challenges for Nigerian farmers, Tingo Mobile Plc, on Tuesday, March 22, 2022, announced a new platform, TingoPay Super app, to address end-user challenges in Nigeria.\n\nTingoPay is an all-in-one financial solution application designed to address challenges for Small and Medium Scale Businesses (SMEs) and, by extension, all bank customers with smartphones. The Super app will address the issue of limited payment options for users.\n\nAt a press conference, Ayoade Alao, the company\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO), stated that the \u201csingle bold step would revolutionise financial technology in Nigeria by providing a single window.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith our technology, we connect millions of farmers through their various cooperative societies, allowing them to access markets both locally and globally from the comfort of their own homes,\u201d he said.\n\nConsequently, farmers have unlimited access and market information, and their concerns about infrastructural challenges, time and product waste are completely alleviated.\n\nAccording to the company, it provides its users with customised smartphones to assist them in accessing the app in order to make this process easier and to assist these farmers.\n\nTingo Mobile plans to work with Motorola to provide new Defy rugged Motorola smartphones to users who do not currently own one. In addition, users can pay off the cost of the smartphone over a period of 24 to 36 months.\n\nAccording to the COO, since the CBN implemented its cashless policy in 2007, the policy has seen significant improvement, with implementation in various sectors and various SMEs popping up and channeling their businesses toward facilitating policy adoption.\n\nMoreover, the company claims that TingoPay will completely remove the users\u2019 stress of entering into a banking relationship because the app can resolve all banking challenges, including loans. They affirm to have gone so far as to help businesses manage their day-to-day challenges, though users will need a commercial bank account.\n\nTingoPay is an upgraded version of Nwassa\n\nLaunched in January 2019, Nwassa is a comprehensive platform that aims to connect every player in the agriculture value chain. The platform enables farmers to sell large quantities of farm produce to buyers both within and outside of Africa.\n\nAll farmers need to do with Nwassa, which can be considered a spin-off of Tingo\u2019s agricultural activities over the years, is list their produce and ensure it is ready. Tingo and its partners, on the other hand, handle every other aspect of the company\u2019s operations, from logistics to payment and warehousing.\n\nTingoPay, on the other hand, is open to everyone, not just farmers.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb3 is perhaps one of the biggest buzzwords frequently used in the crypto world.\n\nCrypto evangelists have thrown it around to signify an era where the Internet becomes decentralised, and every user owns a portion of everything that exists on the Internet.\n\nHowever, Web3 might not be all it\u2019s cracked up to be. This article by The Verge details how the Web3 concept could be a ploy by VCs and investors to recoup their investments earlier rather than wait several years.\n\nThey do this by getting the startup to create tokens. While the success of the Web3 company depends on many real-life factors, the token, however, could reach incredible highs with the right amount of hype.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen these tokens are created, a sizable portion is given to the VCs who simply wait for it to blow and cash out afterwards. This dark side of Web3 became famous last year when Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, referred to it as \u201ca marketing buzzword.\u201d Do you agree? You can shoot me a reply and tell me how you feel.\n\nInterestingly, we\u2019re discussing something crypto-related today. Here\u2019s today\u2019s spread:\n\nLegalising and regulating crypto\n\nYouTube\u2019s plan to stream TV shows for free\n\nLegalising and regulating crypto\n\nWhile the crypto market has not seen bull runs that send the entire crypto community in a frenzy since Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high of $65,000, it has not been devoid of significant updates.\n\nAn example is Ukraine\u2019s decision to make digital currencies into legal tender and the US\u2019 regulatory plans.\n\nBoth events are a watershed moment for cryptocurrencies as this means institutional investors and governments are recognising it as a tool for major financial transformation.\n\nHowever, the events can also be tied to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war that has seen Ukraine raise $54 million in crypto donations in one week.\n\nTo know more about Ukraine\u2019s crypto donations and their effect on the market, please read here: Russia-Ukraine War: What $54m in crypto donations could mean for the global crypto market\n\nSome people believe that the executive order on crypto by the US was borne out of fears that Russia might use it to circumvent sanctions. According to Bitcoin.com, the President of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christine Lagarde, said that cryptocurrencies are a threat, and Russia is certainly using them to avoid sanctions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, believes it\u2019s not possible and gives reasons.

Yes, but if you\u2019re willing to see ads.\n\nAccording to a blog post, YouTube now has up to 4,000 TV series episodes available on the platform. However, they are still only available to users in the US.\n\nThe video-sharing platform did not mention if this feature would be available in other regions, but it will be interesting to see how it competes with pay TV services like MultiChoice-owned DStv and GOtv.\n\nYouTube already has a massive audience: According to Statista, YouTube had 1.8 billion users globally in 2021 and 23.01% \u2014 415 million \u2014 come from Africa.\n\nDStv, on the other hand, grew its number of active subscribers in Africa to 20.9 million in 2021.\n\nPer YouTube\u2019s blog post, more people are opting to watch videos on the big screen, and the move to add TV shows to their options is perfect timing.\n\nUnlike pay TV, where you have to flip through channels to see what\u2019s on, YouTube said it\u2019ll add streamlined navigation and menus that will make it easy to find airing TV shows.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nMaine island library wants your banned books.

          "title": "CBN\u2019s exchange rate policy has made naira largely stable \u2013 Emefiele",
          "text": "Mr. Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), has said the policies adopted by the apex bank to manage exchange rate have helped in keeping the naira largely stable despite the challenges imposed by fall in crude oil prices, among others.\n\nEmefiele who made the remark while delivering his keynote address on Thursday at the 32nd Seminar for Finance Correspondents & Business Editors held in Akure, Ondo State, noted that today, banks are able to meet the demands of their customers seeking forex for SMEs, school fees, medical and PTAs.\n\nThe CBN governor who spoke on the theme, \u201cExchange Rate Management And Economic Diversification In Nigeria,\u201d noted that in Nigeria, as a developing economy, approach to monetary policy must incorporate context, saying that this is done by innovating around the use of available instruments.\n\nThe governor explained that his assumption of office in 2014 coincided with the period of plunge in crude oil prices, which put the country under stress and led to economic recession, but working with fiscal authorities, the bank was able to manage the situation.\n\n\u201cBeing a developing economy, our approach to monetary policy must incorporate context. We do this by innovating around the use of available instruments,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\n\u201cWe understand that monetary policy must coordinate well with fiscal policy towards addressing the numerous developmental challenges our nation faces. Fortunately, the enabling statute envisages this and empowers us to intervene where and when necessary. Under my watch, the Bank has done this through various development finance initiatives. And with the benefit of hindsight now, we can safely say that the outcomes have so far justified our approach.\n\n\u201cAs you may recall, by June 2014 when I assumed office, the price of crude oil had substantially softened. Geo-political tensions were widespread and discussions around policy normalization, post Global Economic and Financial Crisis (GEFC), filled the air, causing acute capital flow reversals especially in emerging markets like Nigeria. Our external reserves had fallen from a peak of US$62b in 2008 to US$37b. Also, due to the sharp drop in crude oil prices, the nation experienced a sharp drop in monthly foreign earnings from about US$3.2 billion to less than US$1.0billion.\n\n\u201cThese adverse conditions eventually plunged the economy into a recession for the first time in about a quarter of a century. The media space was suffused with news about the depletion of the country\u2019s foreign reserves and the depreciation of the Naira. That tough period called for bold and innovative decisions to be taken and we did not shy away from doing what we considered to be in the best interest of our beloved country.\n\n\u201d Let me also remind us of the commitment I made while unveiling my vision for the CBN. It is on record that I had pledged to build a Central Bank that is professional, apolitical and people focused. My mission was and still is, to bequeath a Central Bank that focuses on building a resilient financial system that can serve the growth and development needs of our beloved country, Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor us, the CBN was to act as a financial catalyst by targeting strategic sectors that could create jobs on a mass scale and reduce the country\u2019s import bills. To solve the immediate and long-term economic challenges of the country, we needed to create an enabling environment with appropriate incentives to empower innovative entrepreneurs to drive growth and development.\n\n\u201cTowards containing inflation and cushioning the impact of the drop in the supply of foreign exchange in the economy, not only did we tighten the monetary policy stance over a period, we also introduced demand management approaches to conserve our reserves and support the domestic production of certain goods. The Bank encouraged manufacturers to consider local options in sourcing for raw materials by restricting access to FX on some items. Four of these items alone, at the time, constituted over =N=I Trillion of the country\u2019s annual import Bills.\n\n\u201d In addition to these measures, the Bank also established an Investors and Exporters Window (I&E), to allow for purchase and sale of FX at prevailing market rate. Furthermore, we ensured the liberalization of the Foreign Exchange Market through the operationalization of the \u201cRevised Guidelines for the Operation of Nigerian Inter-bank Foreign Exchange Market\u201d in June 2016. The guidelines introduced the Naira-settled Foreign Exchange Futures Market.\n\n\u201cOther measures taken by the CBN include: partnership with commercial banks to go after Nigerians who falsely bought dollars under the pretense of traveling abroad and ended up roundtripping. The Central Bank of Nigeria had also sanctioned Bureau De Change (BDC) operators for illegal forex trading and discontinued the sale of forex to the Bureau operators in Nigeria. In addition, licensing of new BDCs was suspended. The CBN also introduced the \u2018Naira 4 Dollar Scheme\u2019 to encourage diaspora remittances.\n\n\u201cAs a result of our demand management policy, the naira has remained largely stable at the I & E window, particularly since the discontinuation of FX allocation to Bureau De Change operators along with the convergence between the CBN and NAFEX rates. Banks are now able to meet the demands of their customers seeking forex for SMEs, school fees, medical and PTAs.\n\n\u201cOur current account deficit has narrowed significantly due to a surplus position in the goods account. The surplus position in the goods account is occasioned by a reduction in imports, increase in crude oil and gas export receipts, and improvement in remittances. Remittance inflows has been supported by our \u2018Naira for Dollar\u2019 scheme, and we have seen a surge in remittance inflows. In our sustained effort to reduce foreign exchange demand pressure and facilitate investment, the CBN, on April 27, 2018, signed a 3-year bilateral currency swap agreement of US$2.5 billion, equivalent to \u00a515.0 billion or N720.0 billion with the Peoples Bank of China (PBoC.) It is heartening to note that these policies are yielding positive results in terms of meeting genuine demand for foreign exchange and exchange rate stability.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, as part of its long-term strategy for strengthening the Nigerian economy, the Central Bank established specific initiatives to resolve the underlying factors acting as challenges to long-term GDP growth and economic productivity. Measures were deployed to increase credit allocations to pivotal productive sectors of the economy at reasonable interest rates. This is with a view to diversifying the base of the economy, stimulating output, creating jobs and significantly reducing import bills.\n\n\u201cFurther to our conviction that the banking sector must pay attention to providing long-term finance for infrastructure development in the country, InfraCorp has been established by the Central Bank of Nigeria in partnership with African Finance Corporation and the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority. InfraCorp would enable the use of mostly private capital to support infrastructure investment that will have a multiplier effect on growth across critical sectors.\n\n\u201cWithin the CBN, our methods (especially in the management of financial system liquidity, FX market and development financing initiatives) have been able to optimally balance the delicate objectives of price stability and real output growth. In our desire to create jobs and diversify the economy away from crude oil, we have established numerous intervention programmes, such as Anchor Borrowers Programmes (ABP), Commercial Agricultural Credit Scheme (CACS), Creative Industry Financing Initiative (CIFI), MSMEDF, CBN Agribusiness, Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AgSMEIS) and the Real Sector Support Facility (RSSF), among others with remarkable success in accelerating growth of the economy and reducing poverty across the country.\n\n\u201cOnly recently, in consultation with the Banking Community, the CBN announced the Bankers\u2019 Committee \u201cRT200 FX Programme\u201d, which stands for the \u201cRace to US$200 billion in FX Repatriation\u201d. The RT200 FX Programme is a set of policies, plans and programmes for non-oil exports that will enable us to attain our lofty yet attainable goal of US$200 billion in FX repatriation, exclusively from non-oil exports, over the next 3-5 years. The RT200 FX Programme has the following five (5) key anchors:\n\n\u25aa Value-Adding Exports Facility\n\n\u25aa Non-Oil Commodities Expansion Facility\n\n\u25aa Non-Oil FX Rebate Scheme\n\n\u25aa Dedicated Non-Oil Export Terminal\n\n\u25aa Biannual Non-Oil Export Summit\n\n\u201cPAVE \u2013 Produce, Add Value and Export (PAVE), is expected to make Nigerians consume what they produce, add value to it, and even export the surplus. It is an initiative akin to South-East Asia\u2019s much referenced export-led industrialization policy which changed the economic fortunes of countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. PAVE is designed to be the key for fast-tracking a bucket of substitutes to Crude oil export. It encourages backward integration for the local production of select items.\n\n\u201cCovid-19 pandemic is one of the biggest crises that has faced mankind in recent history. The pandemic impacted economies, and disrupted business activities globally. Expectedly, Nigeria like most commodity-dependent countries was not spared the deleterious impact of the pandemic, given our dependence on crude oil export as a major source of revenue and foreign exchange. It is to mitigate against future severe consequences of shocks beyond our control that we must all join hands to ensure the success of PAVE. It is a clarion call to patriotism.\n\n\u201cDespite the headwinds associated with the pandemic, the Central Bank has worked very hard to ensure that Nigeria remains a vibrant economy with a diversified mix of opportunities across sectors such as ICT, Manufacturing, Solid Minerals, Trade and Agriculture. Notwithstanding these modest achievements, we cannot afford to rest on our oars as the work is far from over.\u201d",

          "text": "2023 election isn\u2019t the most pressing and urgent need Nigeria has today. Saving the country through a consensual restructuring of the polity, is the most urgent need.\n\nFor the next several months, struggle for political power, relevance and dominance of the political space, will rule the airwaves, media space, our souls and spirit and even our sociocultural world.\n\nParty congresses, primaries, candidates, and election of friends, allies and relatives will occupy our every breath, world and activities. Political power at the state and federal level certainly ensures patronage flow our way.\n\nOur dreams are taken care of. We are stupendously empowered by our political friends and associates in power and we cross over to the billionaire club, where we eat well, party well and travel all over the world in first class.\n\nAn opportunity to sustain our lavish lifestyle and maintain a stranglehold on the polity and ensure we are covered; covered as we milk the country dry, covered from prosecution as we align with the power base. Covered as we live our dream life.\n\nPresently, nocturnal meetings, fierce rivalry, betrayal, decamping and high wire intrigue of all shades rule. Scheming and plotting for power dominates our consciousness for the next eleven months.\n\nFolks husbanding huge war chests in safe Bank vaults abroad, surreptitiously ferry in the hard currency in tranches to fight the elections. Cash flows around. Excitement fills the air. All kinds of amorphous and hardly existent groups and organisations are hurriedly formed to issue press releases and also pay solidarity visits up and down.\n\nOaths of allegiance and loyalty are demanded and taken at shrines, deities and occultic temples and alters everywhere. The entire contractor class and elite club are totally embroiled and fully emeshed in the rat race for power amongst the political class.\n\nEveryone\u2019s blinded by the greed for power. Nothing seems to matter anymore. The air is thick with the frenzy and romantic aroma of the struggle for power every four years. Nobody is interested in anything else. Greed for political power, gives birth to pretension that all is well with Naija and truth is despised.\n\nThe appealing narrative that the election or empowerment of your friend or ally, will automatically bring about good times and great times, dominates the air.\n\nAny one with a contrary opinion seem insane. Greed for power, pretense that all is well, slowly metamorphoses to hatred of the truth. The bitter and unwelcome truth that all is not well with our land.\n\nThe truth irritates us. We have so much gotten used to living the lie that we seem to find the irrevocable truth uncomfortable, even offensive.\n\nA psychological hangover from the era of military regimes threw up a false narrative and unhelpful culture that Naija is better managed the way we unwittingly shaped her and that inspiring for greatness could mean OVERREACHING.\n\nThat correcting our past errors, is \u201crisky\u201d and unimportant. That we should continue to crawl and creep and drag on all fours. And by and by, somehow we will transform into a great nation.\n\nThis state of mind, perpetuated by our leaders for much too long, have regrettably held us down, postponed the inevitable and neccesary awakening and led to unhelpful procrastination of rebuilding our land along the lines of the needful trajectory towards true greatness.\n\nBy lying to ourselves consistently that nothing is wrong with our structure, the fallouts from the retrogresive unitary structure, only got worse with time.\n\nForty million idle able bodied young folks, backlog of pension and gratuities and even regular salaries owed citizens of several states by indolent state governments solely dependent on monthly federal allocations to function. Overburdened central Government overloaded with duties it evidently cannot efficiently and effectively handle. Uncontrolled sleaze as a result of an unwieldy centralized structure. Misgovernance, nepotism, dichotomy, marginalisation, sectarianism, ethnic and religious bigotry, sectionalism, exclusion and failure of leadership, as a result of mediocrity and prebendalism.\n\nEconomic melt down and crises of all sorts. The list is endless.\n\nThe fallouts from the weak unhelpful unitary structure grew in folds and included but not limited to, very corrupt and hopelessly manipulated electoral process, lack of interest amongst citizens, loss of faith in the system, discontent, bitterness, and agitations of all kinds. Insurgency, banditry, secessionist agitation and emergence of armed militias.\n\nAll the troubles tied to one thing: the inadequacies of the unitary structure bequeathed the country by the military.\n\nFrom the Aburi accord in Ghana in January 1967, to the General Abacha constitutional conference of 1995, to the President Obasanjo\u2019s National Conference of 2005, and the President Jonathan\u2019s Confab of 2014, the reality of agreeing on an all inclusive basis of nationhood remain undebatable.\n\nThe reality of the great need to collectively agree on a fair, just structure anchored on devolution of powers and true federalism, remain unassailable.\n\nSince NADECO boldly demanded more than twenty five years ago, for a consensual reconstruction of the polity to enthrone equity and fairness, carrying every section along, the troubles afflicting the land, has only gotten worse.\n\nBlindly jostling for political power under same crippling unitary system where all our fault lines are bleeding, while pretending that all is well, is pretension and hatred of the truth of an unfair kind.\n\nPretending that piecemeal constitutional amendments will serve same purpose restructuring of the country would, is plain self deceit of a disturbing streak.\n\nLabelling those calling for the right thing to be done as trouble makers, while applauding those resisting the restructuring of the country, as great patriotic heroes, is pathetic and regrettable.\n\nSingle mindedly pursuing political power through 2023 elections, without worrying about the self-evident structural defects troubling the land and how to effect neccesary adjustments needed to heal the land, is like dancing for entertainment whilst one\u2019s home is burning.\n\nNigeria should be peacefully and consensually restructured before the elections eleven months away. Pretense that all is well with the country, is only inspired by an unhealthy greed for power and hatred of the truth.\n\nRestructuring Nigeria is the most urgent and pressing need.\n\nEvangelist Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko is the founder of Igbo Youth Movement (IYM) and secretary of Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA).\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari Thursday in Abuja urged leaders and members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to channel their energies into improving fortunes of the party in the forthcoming elections, and avoid squabbling that easily distract and create disharmony.\n\nReceiving APC National Assembly leadership at the State House, the President, in a statement by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, reminded members of the proximity of the election dates set by INEC, admonishing that positions should be harmonized with a bigger picture of winning elections and providing good governance.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, the National Convention of our party, which we have committed to, is holding on the 26th March, 2022. And we cannot afford to do anything that will jeopardize the chances of the party in the 2023 General Elections. The limited time frame of the INEC time table does not permit us any room for delay or further squabbling. We must therefore in the light of this reality consistently keep our eyes on the ball and refuse any distraction.\n\n\u201cA critical segment of our national democratic process is the National Assembly. Being representatives of our people from all over the country, the National Assembly especially the 9th Assembly has exhibited commitment to a peaceful democratic process in its conduct and utmost maturity in its relationship with other arms of government. I commend you, the leadership for this success.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cDistinguished Senators and Honorable Members, we have an obligation to conduct the upcoming convention in a manner that not only fortifies the unity of our party but also improves the prospects of our electoral fortunes in the 2023 general elections. You have an important role to play in ensuring that this happens,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari told the lawmakers that a zoning template was produced and adopted by the party after wide consultations in order to ensure that the leadership was reflective of the diversity in unity while representing various dynamic interests.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that we adhere to that template,\u2019\u2019 he noted, adding:\n\n\u201cThe time available to us is limited and I therefore enjoin you to collaborate with the various stakeholders within and outside your respective states and zones to agree to work together and harmoniously in electing into the allotted positions appropriately, as stipulated in the provided template. This will not only produce a smooth process and limit friction but will enhance the image of the party positively and strengthen our over-all position of dominance in the political space.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President said he met with the governors and the party national chairmanship aspirants yesterday, Wednesday, to reiterate the need to go into the convention with a united front.\n\n\u201cIt is the same reason why I invited you today,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cWe should all do our part to ensure the success of this convention. This will fortify us for the campaigns ahead of us.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe APC lawmakers were led to the meeting by the Senate President, Ahmad Ibrahim Lawal and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nSpeaking to State House correspondents after the meeting , Senate President Ahmed Lawan, said the meeting of the Principal Officers of the Assembly which was at the instance of President Buhari, is to ensure a rancour free convention as well as remain focused in delivering development projects to the people.\n\nHe explained that the President emphasized the need for party members to be united ahead of the exercise, adding that it was a very important convention for the party.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said \u201cThis is not what we\u2019re used to in the legislature. But now that we are confronted with this question of what we discussed with Mr. President. Mr. President, our leader of the party, the All Progressives, Congress in the country, and beyond, invited the principal officers of the APC to hold today\u2019s meeting with us.\n\n\u201cMr. President, emphasized the need for us, in the APC to be united, always act as a family, to ensure that we remain focused. We have the leadership of Nigeria today at the national level and of course, we have many states, about 22 states, under the leadership of the APC.\n\nWe have 22 states and then control of the federal government that requires that APC as a political party remains very focus, energetic, and purposeful, as it has always been, and ensure that we maintain the trajectory of development for our country. Because that is trust Nigerians gave us in 2015 and renewed that, in 2019.\n\n\u201cMr. President also emphasized the need for us to ensure that we have a successful convention on the 26th of this month, March. This convention, by way of emphasis is a very important convention for us in the APC, and by the grace of God, through our processes and procedures, at different levels of the party, the convention would be a very successful one and very peaceful one.\n\n\u201cWe hope that would have achieved so much consensus in selecting and electing the officers for this party so that when we go into the convention, most of the officers would be for affirmation or confirmation.\u201d\n\nLawan also spoke about the achievements of the Nineth National Assembly that is also dominated by the APC.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is very important to also emphasize here, that the nineth National Assembly has been a very stable National Assembly, it has been a very productive National Assembly. And we have remained very united in the two chambers, as APC senators and members of the House of Representatives. And we have remained in very good partnership with our other political friends who are in different political parties.\n\nWe have the PDP, and of course, APGA in the Senate, and I believe that they might have even more minority parties in the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cBut our colleagues, in the PDP, for example, have worked with us to ensure that the national interest is always supreme in our consideration. And we thank God that today, by the grace of God, the ninth National Assembly, has done so much in the area of legislation. We have achieved so many firsts in the area of legislation and broke so many jinxes, passed legislations that defied passage. And by the grace of God, Mr. President, has assented to almost all those bills, all those legislations that matter for the development of this country.\n\n\u201cFinally, I want to say that this meeting with Mr. President has given us more energy. We believe that there is a father, at least in our party, there is a president who will ensure that once there disagreements he is able to call everybody to order and ensure that the family continues to remain united and that is what we have been able to achieve over the years.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to be very partisan. But of course, when you have a father in the family and a mother, then you\u2019re likely to have a stable family. And when you have only one or none in the family, you are not likely to be successful, the family is likely to be disunited, and that is what other political parties probably are facing.\n\n\u201cAnd I want to add here, finally, to say that we are committed to ensuring that this political party does not only have a successful convention, but a very successful, peaceful and safe electioneering campaigns during 2022/2023 general campaigns and the general elections, by the grace of God, we\u2019ll see Nigerians voting once again, for APC, because we have so far done so much in the areas that matter for the people of this country.\n\nBut that is not to say that we are not facing some challenges we are, but we are squaring up to ensure that we deal with those challenges.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker of the Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, described the meeting as a productive one, saying the whole idea is to encourage all stakeholders to unite and have a peaceful and very successful convention.\n\nAccording to him \u201cthis meeting was a productive one. As many of you are aware of the President in the last couple of days his been having meetings with stakeholders towards the convention that is coming up on Saturday. And the whole idea is to encourage all stakeholders to unite, have a common front, and have a peaceful rancour free and successful convention. That\u2019s what that meeting was about the long and short of it, and to make sure everybody\u2019s on the same page, in terms of being united in terms of candidates.\n\nAnd we all know that in conventions such as this, where you have almost 5000, delegates, and many more. You have to be well organized. You have to be freed up to be fair to everybody. And that\u2019s what he charged obviously, like any leader would.\n\n\u201cWe have a couple more days, people are coming in from all the states of the Federation. Abuja is gonna be a agog with activities, with excitement, with electricity. And in all of that, pomp and pageantry, we must make sure that what we come out of on Sunday morning, so to speak, is a happy to united party. That\u2019s what this meeting was about. And we already, we are charge, we\u2019re ready to go.\u201d\n\nAsked if the party has arrived at consensus for the position of the chairman of APC and what would happen to those who spent their money to buy the forms, Lawan said they were not in the position to answer.\n\nHe said: \u201cWell, I think that question shouldn\u2019t be put to us because we\u2019re not the party. But because you asked and we are in your territory we\u2019ll make some effort to say something to it.\n\n\u201cThe essence of this engagements is for the party to achieve consensus, and consensus is a process. It doesn\u2019t just happen like that. So I believe that before we go into the convention square on Saturday, by the grace of God, we would have a lot of consensus reached and maybe the sort of document that we call or refer to as unity list, that is bringing all the agreed positions where consensus have been achieved in the various sections or geopolitical zones of the country.\n\n\u201cOnly yesterday (Wednesday) we had a meeting of the Northeast, and we have achieved consensus, and other zones are either about to conclude or will conclude before the end of tomorrow, Friday. But by Saturday, I think the answers will all be there for everybody to see.\n\n\u201cSo on the issue of why allow other people to buy forms. I think democracy does not prevent anybody from buying forms, what democracy does is to provide opportunity for everyone having some guiding principles. If a position is zoned until a consensus is reached, everybody who thinks he or she has something to offer can go and buy the form and also throw his or her hat into the ring.\u201d\n\nSome of the principal officers in the delegation from the Senate were, Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, Senator Abdullahi Yahaya, Senate Leader, Ajayi Boroffice Deputy Senate Leader, Chief Whip Orji Uzor Kalu, Deputy Chief Whip, Sabi Abdullahi\n\nFor the House of Representatives\n\nDeputy Speaker, Idris Wase, Alhassan Ado Dogowa \u2013 Majority Leader, Mohammed Tahir Monguno- Chief Whip, Hon Nkeiruka Onyejeocha Deputy Chief Whip among others.",

          "text": "Former President, Olusegun Obasanjo has warned African leaders not to manipulate the system to go beyond their constitutional term limits, as this would only plunge their nations into avoidable crises.\n\nThe former president spoke virtually at a strategy meeting held in Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nObasanjo, towards the tail end of his government, attempted a third term agenda by instigating an amendment of the constitution for his agenda in 2006, but the National Assembly defeated the idea.\n\nObasanjo called for a proactive strategy to forestall political crises in the region, adding that early warning signs should be leveraged to prevent degeneration of tenuous situations.\n\nHis words: \u201cI believe that we need a proactive strategy and a reactive strategy. When we open our eyes we can see what is going on in most cases. We know what the end will be and we fold our hands until the inevitable happens, then we start shedding crocodile tears.\u201d\n\nHe added that elected leaders should not manipulate the system to go beyond their constitutional term limits to avoid plunging their nations into avoidable crises.\n\nChairman of the Goodluck Jonathan Foundation and convener of the forum, Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan in his opening speech expressed concern over the recurring military intervention in West Africa, adding that the forum is poised to actively engage key stakeholders to stem the tide of regression of democracy in the sub-region.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe sustainability of democracy in West Africa is key to resolving many of our challenges. I, therefore, appeal to all our leaders across our nations to make democracy work for the interest of all citizens.\n\n\u201cThis is why we need to continually advocate for the strengthening of our democratic institutions. Strong institutions are the pillars for the sustenance of our democracy and the development of our nations.\n\nJonathan also clarified that the forum was set up to complement the efforts of Governments and international organizations in the bid to promote peace and good governance in the sub-region.\n\nHe said further: \u201cAs stakeholders, we must therefore help in this regard and fashion out the best approach towards the strengthening of our political systems.\n\n\u201cLet me re-emphasize the point that is often made that for democracy to endure, it must yield basic public goods to its citizens. These include economic development, good social services, freedom, justice, peace and security.\n\n\u201cThis underscores the place of good governance in our discourse of democracy. Democracy loses its meaning if it does not guarantee the economic status and social security of the citizens.\n\n\u201cToday, we must interrogate some fundamental issues such as recurring military intervention, democracy and good governance, peace and security, economic development as well as human trafficking in our sub-region.\n\nFormer President of Sierra Leone Ernest Bai Koroma in his remarks noted that the region was \u201cexperiencing a reversal in gains made over the decades, stressing that the forum should come up with proposals that would address our situation. \u201c\n\nSimilarly, former Prime Minister of Senegal, Aminata Toure in her address stressed the need to focus on the prevention of election-related violence and charged the forum to set up a task force that would follow up on elections to prevent electoral violence.\n\n\u201cMost of the time we have a standoff between the government and the opposition and the civil society is not really equipped enough to handle these issues. Let\u2019s build a network of conflict prevention. We need a network of people that can alert and signal on potential issues and talk about our problems before our problems deteriorate.\u201c\n\nFormer Prime Minister Burkina Faso Kadr\u00e9 D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Ou\u00e9draogo called on ECOWAS to be more visible in the management of political crises, stating that such a disposition would improve the credibility of ECOWAS.",

And for his wisdom and his ability as a man. He is not a tribalistic man. And also at the same time, he is not biased in his religious affiliation.\n\n\u201cThat prompted our hearts to pray and to call on God so that God will give us the right leader to lead this nation.\u201d\n\nIn similar vein, one of the clerics and Lead Pastor of Fountain of Praise, Bishop Lawrence Ungene, said Tinubu has the requirements to lead Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe came together to pray for a person by the name Tinubu Bola Ahmed who has a trajectory records of leading this nation.\n\n\u201cNow, the reason for us to come to pray is that the will of God be achieved.

          "text": "With some 24 hours to the national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja, stakeholders have been advised to avoid any squabble that could jeopardise the party\u2019s chances in the 2023 general elections.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari gave the admonition Thursday while receiving the National Assembly lawmakers elected on the APC platform at the State House.\n\nHe reminded them that the proximity of the election dates set by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) would not allow for any acrimony that could constitute a cog in the wheel of the party\u2019s progress.\n\nBuhari said all positions should be harmonized with a bigger picture of winning elections and providing good governance.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, the National Convention of our party, which we have committed to, is holding on the 26th March, 2022. And we cannot afford to do anything that will jeopardize the chances of the party in the 2023 General Elections. The limited time frame of the INEC time table does not permit us any room for delay or further squabbling. We must therefore in the light of this reality consistently keep our eyes on the ball and refuse any distraction.\n\n\u201cA critical segment of our national democratic process is the National Assembly. Being representatives of our people from all over the country, the National Assembly especially the 9th Assembly has exhibited commitment to a peaceful democratic process in its conduct and utmost maturity in its relationship with other arms of government. I commend you, the leadership for this success.\n\n\u201cDistinguished Senators and Honorable Members, we have an obligation to conduct the upcoming convention in a manner that not only fortifies the unity of our party but also improves the prospects of our electoral fortunes in the 2023 general elections. You have an important role to play in ensuring that this happens,\u201d he said.\n\nZoning\n\nOn sharing of party offices based on zoning, President Buhari told the lawmakers that a zoning template was produced and adopted by the party after wide consultations in order to ensure the leadership was reflective of the diversity in unity while representing various dynamic interests.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that we adhere to that template,\u201d he noted, adding: \u201cThe time available to us is limited and I therefore enjoin you to collaborate with the various stakeholders within and outside your respective states and zones to agree to work together and harmoniously in electing into the allotted positions appropriately, as stipulated in the provided template. This will not only produce a smooth process and limit friction but will enhance the image of the party positively and strengthen our over-all position of dominance in the political space.\u201d\n\nThe president said he met with the governors and the party national chairmanship aspirants Wednesday to reiterate the need to go into the convention with a united front.\n\n\u201cIt is the same reason why I invited you today. We should all do our part to ensure the success of this convention. This will fortify us for the campaigns ahead of us,\u201d he further said.\n\nThe APC lawmakers were led to the meeting by Senate President Ahmad Ibrahim Lawal and Speaker House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nConsensus best \u2013 Sule\n\nIn a related development, Nasarawa state Governor Abdullahi Sule has said consensus remains the best way if the ruling party is to fully prepare ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe governor, who is also chairman publicity sub-committee of the convention, also cited the need for unity and a peaceful national convention as reasons President Buhari and governors on the platform of the party opted for consensus.\n\nAddressing newsmen at the party\u2019s national secretariat Thursday in Abuja, Governor Sule said the APC governors were now more united and would go into the convention as one united family.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cAs I mentioned earlier, we have been driven towards a consensus arrangement so that we can have a very peaceful convention after which most of the political activities will begin which will lead to the success of the party at most of the elections that we are going to have next year by the grace of God.\n\n\u201cWe also want to inform you that the major caucuses of this party, we have been meeting in order to discuss most of the grey areas and resolve them and so far again so good all the governors had been inspired yesterday (Wednesday).\n\n\u201cWe actually had a meeting with Mr. President where some grey areas were resolved and the governors are now united more than you can ever think. We are going as a united front into this convention.\n\n\u201cWe also look forward actually to a convention that is going to signify our unity and our strength as we come together to face the election next year.\u201d\n\nPolicy conference\n\nMeanwhile, a policy conference tagged \u201cConsolidating Democracy: Scorecard, impact and the road ahead\u201d is slated for Friday (today).\n\nSecretary of the Pre-Convention Committee and Director General Nigeria Orientation Agency Dr. Garba Abari said this in Abuja Thursday.\n\nHe said the overall objective of the conference was to position APC thought leaders and sector experts to deliberate on its current and future policy direction of the party.\n\nHe said the conference would also provide a reform agenda which the party would drive over the next phase of its administration building on the current achievements, including the outcomes for state and local governments.\n\nAbari said the conference would further seek to address various segments around governance, economy and social environment with the aim to re-enkindle investors\u2019 confidence in the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe specific objectives, he said, include; \u201creview the performance of APC-controlled national and sub-national governments, analyse introspective pathways towards mapping the future to bridge the gaps and unlock the productive potential of the country, discuss the approaches required towards achieving an inclusive and coherent policy trajectory for the party in government and harmonise a sustainable implementation agenda with the implementation framework as a follow-up to existing plans, policies, programmes and projects.\n\n\u201cThe APC Policy Conference will be structured into different panel discussions that will focus on core thematic areas as follows: economy, governance, and human development. This will enable resource persons and participants to create a central spine that holds the party\u2019s development agenda since 2015.\u201d\n\nAmong the expected participants include; President Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmad, Speaker House of Representatives Gbajabiamila , chairman and members of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC). governors, among others.",

          "text": "The Senate Wednesday resolved to appeal the judgement delivered by the Federal High Court Umuahia last week Friday against Section 84(12) of the 2022 Electoral Act, just as the federal government commenced the process of deleting the section.\n\nThe Bill was recently assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAnd upon assenting the Bill, the president immediately requested that the said clause which bordered on resignation of political appointees of public office holders within a specified period if they wish to participate in primary election of their respective political parties, be expunged from the Act on grounds that it negated provisions of the Nigerian Constitution.\n\nThe judgement\n\nBut in a judgement, Justice Evelyn Anyadike held that the section of the Act was \u201cunconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever and ought to be struck down as it cannot stand when it is in violation of the clear provisions of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the court ordered the Attorney General of the Federation Abubakar Malami (SAN) to \u201cforthwith delete the said Subsection 12 of Section 84 from the body of the Electoral Act.\u201d\n\nPlanned appeal\n\nBut the Senate, on the strength of a motion sponsored by Senator George Sekibo (PDP Rivers East) and 80 others, faulted the ruling and resolved to appeal against it.\n\nThe resolution of the Senate reads: \u201cSenate accordingly resolved to appeal the judgement in suit marked FHC/UM/ CS/26/2022 for the court to set aside the judgement as it was reached without due consideration of the constitutional interpretation in section 318 of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\u201d\n\nSekibo, as main sponsor of the motion, had in his lead debate, said section 84(12) nullified by the court, states that \u201cno political appointee at any level shall be voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or Congress of any political party for the purpose of nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nHe argued further that political appointees provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act referred to were neither civil servants nor public servants captured by relevant provisions of the Constitution in the 30 days grace of resignation before election.\n\nThe section, he explained, was not inconsistent with sections 66(1) (f), 107(1) (f), 137(1) (g) and 182(1) (g) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended.\n\nThe Deputy Whip of the Senate, Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi (APC Niger North), seconded the motion.\n\nBut Senate President Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, in a move to water down the prayer on appeal, suggested that the matter should be forwarded to the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters.\n\nSenator Gabriel Suswam (PDP Benue North East), however countered by saying \u201csince the prayer on appeal is a direct one, it should be adopted by the Senate.\u201d\n\nThereafter, Senate President Lawan put the prayer of the motion for voice votes with majority of the lawmakers voting in favour of appealing the judgement.\n\nHowever, as observed from the list of senators who co-sponsored the motion, none of the three from Katsina state, the president\u2019s home state, joined in the motion.\n\nOther senators whose names were not included in the list of co-sponsorship of the motion were the Deputy President of the Senate Ovie Omo-Agege, Senate Leader Yahaya Abdullahi, Senate Whip Orji Uzor Kalu and Senator Oluremi Tinubu from Lagos Central among others.\n\nReps too\u2026\n\nAlso, the House of Representatives Wednesday resolved to appeal the judgement.\n\nThe lawmakers resolved that the National Assembly would file a complaint to the National Judicial Council (NJC) against the judge who gave the judgement, as it considered the judgement as amounting to gross misconduct.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House, while condemning the Abia High Court judgement, also faulted attempts at hurriedly deleting the contentious section, even when the National Assembly was not joined in the suit.\n\n\n\nThe development was fallout of a motion raised under personal privileges by Hon. Sada Soli, who argued that the decision of the court was akin to usurping the constitutional powers of the parliament to make laws.\n\n\n\nIn their separate submissions, Majority Leader of the House, Ado Doguwa and the Chief Whip, Muhammed Tahir Monguno, insisted the legislature is the only institution of government under democracy that has the rights of law making, wondering why an issue which originated from Abuja was filed in Abia state.\n\n\n\nIn his ruling, Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila said he cannot allow anyone to rubbish the institution of legislature, even though he absolved President Buhari of any blame in all of this.\n\nHe said the president merely relied on the legal advice from his aides on the matter, calling on Malami to tarry a while and not to usurp the role of the National Assembly, by foreclosing the right of appeal.\n\nDeleting in progress \u2013 Malami\n\nMeanwhile, AGF Malamihas said the process of deleting the controversial section as ordered by the court, had commenced.\n\nThe minister said this while fielding questions from State House correspondents at the end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting Wednesday.\n\n\u201cMy clear response arising there-from, is the fact that truly there exists a court judgment. By the judgment, the court directed the Office of the Attorney General to take the necessary steps to delete the provision, which in essence implies that the provision should not form part of our laws.\n\n\u201cWhether it has been deleted, or has not been deleted, is indeed a function of agencies of government and associated relevant parastatals. But the true position of it in that respect, is the fact that government printers, and indeed Law Reform Commission among others, that are responsible for the codification and gazetting of our laws, are working naturally, hand in hand with the Office of the Attorney General for the purpose of ensuring that what goes into our laws are indeed in line with the provision of the law.\n\n\u201cSo, what I am saying in essence, it is indeed a work in progress against the background of the fact that the Law Reform Commission is involved statutorily, which is a parastatal under the Office of the Attorney General, is a party to the process of codification.\n\n\u201cThe government printers, which is saddled with the responsibility of gazetting our laws on the request of the Office of the Attorney General is equally involved. And above all, as you rightly stated, the possibility of an appeal is equally there. So, what I am saying in effect is deletion of section 84 Subsection 12 is a work in progress and is being considered as such,\u201d he said.",

His giant strides in Kogi is because he has intelligent women in the right places. He can repeat the same at the national level,\u201d she said.\n\nZonal Woman Leader, South East, of the All Progressives Congress, Lolo Josephine Chukwu, who also led other party women in the zone to the rally, agreed with all the speakers, urging Nigerian women to rally round Governor Bello.\n\nThe Governor of Kogi State is a leading contender for the office of the President in 2023.",

          "text": "RelatedStories No Content Available\n\nAhead of the ECOWAS Extraordinary summit in Ghana on Friday, a West African Court has ordered the suspension of some punitive sanctions imposed on Mali by the eight-nation West African Economic and Monetary Union with the French acronym UEMOA.\n\nUEOMA members, comprising mainly former French colonies in West Africal also belong to the 15-nation regional ECOWAS bloc.\n\nThe group uses the common currency, CFA franc, which is tied to the French Treasury.\n\nThe members belong to the Central Bank of West Africa, BCEAO, based in Dakar, Senegal.\n\nThe group met on January 9 in Accra before an ECOWAS summit to suspend Mali and impose sweeping financial sanctions on the country.\n\nECOWAS subsequently imposed its own sanctions.\n\nThis was after Mali\u2019s Col Assimi Goita-led military dominated interim government delayed its earlier transition programme.\n\nAn official of the UEMOA Court told journalists on Thursday that the suspension order would be followed by \u201cdetails\u201d of the legal decision.\n\nThe ruling followed suits filed by the Goita-led junta, which described the UEMOA sanctions as \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nWhile ECOWAS sanctions might be different, Thursday\u2019s court ruling could impact decision/s of Friday\u2019s ECOWAS summit, which is expected to review the regional sanctions against Mali and also consider possible compromise on the country\u2019s transition timetable.\n\nFormer Nigeria President Goodluck Jonathan, the ECOWAS Mediator on the Mali crisis ended his latest mission to Bamako this week without any agreement on the transition programme.\n\nIn a climbdown from its earlier tough stance, ECOWAS has invited Goita to the Accra meeting, with developments in Guinea and Burkina Faso also on the summit agenda.\n\nMali, Guinea and Burkina Faso are under military rule in a resurgence of coups and regression of democracy in West Africa.\n\nIt is unclear if Goita would attend the Accra summit in person, given the palpable security concerns and mutual mistrust.\n\nA man who attempted to kill Goita with a knife in July 2021, reportedly died in custody during interrogation, according to the government.\n\nAuthorities in Mali have accused ECOWAS of acting the script of former colonial power France, amid strained diplomatic relations between Paris and Bamako.\n\nFrance is pulling out its forces fighting Islamic insurgency from Mali after accusing the Goita regime of contracting the Russian private security agency Wagner for military support.\n\nIn apparent retaliation, Mali has expelled the French Ambassador from Bamako and also ordered French media groups RFI and France24 out of Mali.\n\nCritics have accused ECOWAS of inconsistency and ineffectiveness in dealing with threats to democracy in the region, including dubious alteration of national constitutions, electoral frauds and human rights violations, which are partly responsible for political instability and military incursions in politics in some member States.\n\nAlso, while the memberships of the three military-controlled States have been suspended, it is believed that the sanctions against Mali are disproportionate.\n\nThe military in Guinea has yet to officially announce a transition timetable, while those in Burkina Faso only made public a thee-year transition programme on Tuesday.\n\nECOWAS, which will be 47 in May, with a good track record in conflict prevention, management and resolution, now faces a tough integrity and existential test on the political crises in Mali and other troubled member States.",

The new installments will be located in Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and Bulgaria.\n\nJosep Borrell, the European Union\u2019s top diplomat, said on March 24 that Russia is stalling in talks on a cease-fire in Ukraine and won\u2019t take the discussions seriously until it has reached its goals.\n\nA senior U.S. defense official said on March 23 that Moscow\u2019s ground forces appear to be setting up defensive positions 15 to 20 kilometers outside Kyiv as they make little to no progress toward the city center.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said in some areas east of Kyiv, Ukrainian troops appear to have pushed the Russians farther away.\n\nIn an interview with Spain\u2019s TVE broadcast on March 24, Borrell said Russian President Vladimir Putin has his eyes on surrounding the Black Sea coast to the border with Moldova in order to isolate Ukraine from the water.\n\n\u201cRight now, Russia doesn\u2019t want to sit and negotiate anything. What it wants is to occupy the ground,\u201d Borrell said. \u201cIt wants to negotiate in earnest only when it has secured a position of strength.\u201d\n\nBiden is scheduled to give a news conference after the March 24 meetings, then head to Poland for talks with leaders in that country, which has taken on the bulk of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the fighting.\n\nThe UN General Assembly is preparing to meet on March 24 to discuss the war in Ukraine and a draft humanitarian resolution written by Kyiv.

Security Council resolutions, and a reversal of the moratorium on ICBM launches, which North Korea had promised to the international community\u201d.\n\nAccording to South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, the latest North Korean missile was launched from near Sunan, where Pyongyang\u2019s international airport is located.\n\nEarlier this month, analysis of satellite images suggested that construction activity at North Korea\u2019s nuclear testing ground had resumed, nearly four years after leader Kim Jong Un declared the facility had been closed.",
