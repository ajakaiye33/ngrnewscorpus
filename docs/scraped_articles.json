          "title": "Why more older men are suffering from urinary tract infections \u2013Expert",
          "text": "Amarachi Okeh\n\nA medical expert has urged older men to take better care of their prostate health to prevent other health complications.\n\nThe expert, a Professor of Surgery, Kehinde Tijani, noted that the poor state of prostate health is a major reason for the increasing incidence of urinary tract infections among older men.\n\nRecall that it was recently reported that 75-year-old former president of the US, Bill Clinton was hospitalised at the University of California, Irvine Medical Centre, due to a urinary tract infection.\n\nAccording to reports, an aide to the former president confirmed that he had a urological infection that spread to his bloodstream but was on the mend.\n\nRecall also that after a few days at the hospital, Clinton was discharged and, in a video, said, he was on the road to recovery.\n\nThough UTIs are more common in women, Tijani, who is also a consultant urologist, said men also suffer from this infection.\n\nAccording to the consultant urologist, while cases of UTI are rare among young men, it is quite prevalent in men from 50 years of age. This, he said, is due to the state of the prostate.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, Professor Tijani said, \u201cUTI is more common in women than men because the urethra is closer to the anus in women than in men. So, because most UTIs usually come from the anus, that is the major thing. But, yes, men have it but it is not common.\n\n\u201cIt becomes more common in men as they become elderly from the 50s and 60s because of the prostate but generally young men rarely have it unless there is an underlying cause.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the reason why older men are prone to UTIs is because of the inability of urine to flow freely through the prostate.\n\nUsing an analogy, the professor said, \u201cIf you have a gutter that is flowing very well, things will not grow in it but if the gutter is stationary and something blocks it, things will start growing in that gutter. That is the same thing with the urinary tract in men.\n\n\u201cSo, when they have a prostate enlargement that is slowing down the urine or there\u2019s any problem that is slowing down the urine, this may lead to urinary tract infection.\n\n\u201cThat is the reason why, as men get older, their prostate starts getting enlarged and the release of the urine becomes slower, then they are more prone to UTIs.\u201d\n\nHe noted that UTI can be easily treated with an antibiotic, stressing however that it is very important to find and treat the cause of the infection first.\n\nSpeaking on the symptoms that may indicate the presence of UTI in a man, Tijani said the commonest ones are feverish feeling, burning sensation, and frequency in urination.\n\nHe added that some people may see pus, while others may also see blood.\n\nHe however warned that once a man sees blood in his urine, it is a sign of a more serious issue, noting that such a person must urgently seek medical attention.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nChild health and nutrition experts have urged breastfeeding mothers to eat any food they want, noting that consuming okro and snails will not cause drooling in babies.\n\nThe experts said it has become necessary to discourage cultures prohibiting the consumption of snails and okro by breastfeeding mothers, stressing that there is no scientific evidence to back the claim that the nutritious foods make babies drool saliva or cause other health issues.\n\nAccording to the experts, the nutritional value and composition of breast milk are regulated by the nutritional status of the mother.\n\nOne of the experts, and a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Paediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Dr. Beatrice Ezenwa, told PUNCH HealthWise in an exclusive interview that breastfeeding mothers need to eat a nutritious and well-balanced diet.\n\nDr. Ezenwa who is also a Consultant Neonatologist/ Paediatrician with the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba said nursing mothers should eat in moderation and avoid what they noticed consistently do not agree with their babies or themselves.\n\nThe neonatologist said, \u201cIn general, a breastfeeding mother can eat any food. No food is off-limit because a woman is breastfeeding.\n\n\u201cThe key point is to eat a balanced diet and eat in moderation. Having said that, each baby is different and may react differently to certain foods eaten by the mother which comes out in the breast milk in terms of nutrients and flavor.\n\n\u201cSome babies can be very fussy and cranky when their mothers eat very spicy foods. Other babies become sleepy or have disorganised sleep patterns when their mothers consume too much of certain other foods such as alcohol and caffeine.\n\n\u201cIn some cultures in Nigeria, breastfeeding mothers are prohibited from eating certain nutritious foods such as snails, okro, etc because it will make the baby drool saliva.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile others encourage the consumption of more harmful ones such as excessive alcohol intake like palm wine in the name of helping the breast milk to flow. These myths are unfounded and the practices are not good, so should be discouraged,\u201d she added.\n\nOn the myths about certain foods that mothers consume during breastfeeding that make their babies have constipation, the paediatrician said it is not common for exclusively breastfeeding infants to be constipated.\n\nDr. Ezenwa explained, \u201cBreast milk is considered a natural laxative because of the easily digestible nutrients it contains.\n\n\u201cThere are many other reasons a baby may be gassy that have nothing to do with the foods the mother has eaten.\n\n\u201cSome people believe falsely that eating hot and spicy foods or acidic foods such as citrus fruit and tomatoes may cause \u2018gassiness\u2019 in babies, but these are not proven.\n\n\u201cUnless you can see a direct relationship between specific foods and the same reaction in the baby every time, there is no need to limit your diet.\u201d\n\nThe child health expert further stated that it is untrue that consuming egusi soup, fruits, and vegetables during breastfeeding makes babies prone to stooling.\n\nAccording to her, this is not proven, saying, \u201cI can safely say, it is not true.\u201d\n\nShe, however, said, \u201cA breastfed baby may have an allergy or sensitivity reaction after the mother consumes certain foods or drinks (for example cow\u2019s milk allergy, wheat, corn, eggs, nuts, and fish).\n\n\u201cThis does not mean that every baby whose mother consumed these foods will have diarrhoea.\n\n\u201cPeople react differently to things. If a breastfeeding baby consistently has diarrhea each time a mother consumes a certain food he should be taken to a hospital for proper evaluation.\u201d\n\nThe neonatologist advised breastfeeding mothers to eat a well-balanced diet.\n\n\u201cEat in moderation and avoid what you notice consistently do not agree with your baby or yourself.\n\n\u201cYou also need to eat all types of food common in your culture or environment to help your child develop the taste bud for that food.\n\n\u201cSome flavors infants are exposed to through breast milk can influence their food preferences as they grow up,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso speaking with our correspondent, Assistant Chief Dietician, Ajeromi General Hospital, Ajegunle, Lagos, Olusola Malomo, said, \u201cCultural beliefs and practices can markedly influence a woman\u2019s pregnancy and childbirth experiences, and may shape a woman\u2019s mothering behaviour.\n\n\u201cDietary intake before and during pregnancy and throughout the lactation period is often influenced by cultural beliefs and practices,\u201d Malomo said.\n\nSpeaking on some foods that are avoided by pregnant women on the ground of cultural beliefs, the dietician said, \u201cIn a recent scientific study, approximately 37 per cent of respondents avoided some foods in pregnancy due to food taboos.\n\n\u201cSnail and grasscutter meat were the commonly avoided foods in pregnancy, while eggs were commonly withheld from children under two years old.\n\n\u201cSome respondents believed that eating snail and grasscutter meat makes a child sluggish and labour difficult respectively; while some say that starting egg early for a child could predispose them to steal later in life.\u201d\n\nCharting the way forward, the dietician called for women\u2019s empowerment and education.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "His appointment of lralepo, an affront to our tradition, may disrupt peace\n\nI\u2019m only consenting authority for appointing Chiefs, Olus, Baales , Olojas \u2015 Deji of Akureland\n\nDayo Johnson \u2013 Akure\n\nDeji of Akureland\n\nThe crisis over the appointment of Prince Gbenga Adeyeye as the lralepo of lsinkan by the Deji of Akureland, Oba Aladetoyinbo Aladelusi deepened weekend as the Princes and Princesses in the community asked governor Rotimi Akeredolu to call the monarch to order to avoid the disruption of existing peace in the state capital.\n\nRecall that two Princes have been laying claim to the chieftaincy stool.\n\nOba Aladelusi appointed Prince Adeyeye while the Princes and Princesses selected Gbenga Ojo after an election in the state capital.\n\nThe Deji of Akureland insisted that \u201cthe appointment of the new Iralepo of Isikan, therefore, remains the prerogative of the Deji as no other person or institution(s) could exercise such either directly or through proxies.\n\nBut rising from a meeting in Akure the Princes and Princess, speaking through their head, the Olori Omowas, Prince Durojaye Ariyo said that they have been prevailing \u201con the youths who have planned to protest the appointment by the Deji which they consider as an insult to the community.\n\nAriyo also described the action of the monarch \u201cas an affront on their tradition and heritage and an insult to the Ondo State government.\n\n\u201clt amounts to overstepping of boundaries which is capable of truncating the peace being enjoyed in the state capital.\n\nHe pointed out that the action of the Deji was alien to the custom and traditions of Isinkan people.\n\nPrince Ariyo said the selection processes to the throne followed due process and in line with the provisions of chiefs\u2019 law of Ondo State 1984 as amended.\n\n\u201cThe recognition of Iralepo as a Traditional Stool is, in fact, in conformity with the same Supreme Court judgment that the Deji is bandying about.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court judgement only affirmed the Court of Appeal judgement which states clearly that the only authority to decide the status of Iralepo as an Oba is the Ondo State Executive Council.\n\n\u201cThe Deji and his fellow travellers should make an enquiry to the government on the decision of the Ondo State Executive Council because the Iralepo of Isinkan has been duly approved as a recognized Obaship Chieftaincy by the Council.\n\n\u201cThat Supreme Court judgement has, therefore, been fully cured.\u201d\n\nAriyo reaffirmed that the selection of Oba Olugbenga Ojo followed due process.\n\n\u201cWe presented five aspirants to the kingmakers for the vacant stool. The Kingmakers thereafter sought approval from Ondo State government through the Akure South local government for the selection process. Approval was duly granted on the 11th of October, 2021.\n\n\u201cThis led to the final selection process on the 21st of October, 2021 held at Saint Thomas\u2019s event centre, Isinkan, supervised by the secretary to Akure South Local government, Hon. Gbenga Fasua and under the watchful eyes of security personnel.\n\n\u201cDuring the exercise, Prince Olugbenga Ojo defeated other contestants including Gbenga Henry Adeyeye to emerge the Iralepo.\n\n\u201cAll the contestants signed a memorandum of understanding and peace accord, shook hands and promised to support the winner.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were surprised to read from the media the following day that the person who came second with four votes, Gbenga Henry Adeyeye had been appointed as \u201cHigh Chief Iralepo\u201d by the Deji. This can be nothing but desperation!\n\n\u201cThe position of \u201cHigh Chief Iralepo\u201d is strange to us and unknown to Isikan. We could have waved it aside but for posterity, we choose to set the record straight.\n\n\u201cSo, after following due process, we consider any other appointment or installation of Iralepo outside that of the one elected in Isikan by the people of Isikan as an affront to constituted authority.\n\n\u201cWe will also like to put a lie to the media report that we \u2013 in the Iralepo royal family recommended Adeyeye to the Deji. That is a blatant lie from the pit of hell! We did not. We only recommended five aspirants including him to Isinkan Kingmakers for consideration.\u201d\n\nAriyo added that the community prevailed on the youths who had planned to protest the purported appointment by the Deji which they consider as an insult to the community.\n\nHe, therefore, enjoined the State government to call the Deji to order so that peace being enjoyed in the state capital is not truncated.\n\nContacted, the Press Secretary to the Monarch, Michael Adeyeye, said that \u201cthe appointment of Adeyeye was based on favourable consideration and the unanimous decision of Aruwolasi Iralepo family of Isikan in Akure.\u201d\n\nAccording to him \u201cWe wish to state emphatically without any iota of contradictions that there is no crisis on the installation of new Iralepo of Isikan as the Deji remains the only appointing and consenting authority for the appointment of Minor Chiefs, Olus, Baales and Olojas in all Akure Land.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to clarify that the new Iralepo of Isikan was installed as a Quarter Chief and the Head of Isikan Community in Akure and not a traditional ruler.\n\nHe urged the general public to disregard the move by some individuals who want to make it look as if there is a crisis.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

John Joseph Hayab, Vice President of CAN( 19 Northern States and FCT) and chairman of Kaduna State chapter, said in a statement, titled \u2018\u2019Attack on Kaduna \u2013 Abuja rail track, a final onslaught by bandits\u2019, that bandits in Kaduna had become very strong and daring to government and security agents.\n\n\u201cThank God Governor El-Rufai himself has called on the Federal Government to declare bandits as terrorists so that our security forces can kill them. This shows further that the era of denials and playing politics with insecurity is coming to an end.\n\n\u201cUnless we maintain a firm position against those tormenting our citizens, these bandits will not let us have peace.\n\n\u201cNow that the bandits are destroying rail lines, what else have they not done to confirm they are terrorists and enemies of the state?\n\n\u201cOur government should act decisively now before it will be too late.\u2019\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the Northern State Council of Ansar-ud-Deen Society of Nigeria has asked the Federal Government to expose sponsors of banditry in Nigeria.\n\nThe Secretary, Ansar-ud-Deen Society, Northern States Council, Alhaji Isiaq Sanni, made the call in Kaduna at the weekend, as the Society and Yoruba community paid tributes to their late Chairman and President, Alhaji Liadi Adeyinka Olapade, who died penultimate Saturday.\n\nSpeaking at the 8th-Day Fidau prayer organized in honour of late Alhaji Olapade, the Ansar-ud-Deen Secretary said the deceased lived, worked and died in advocacy for a united and secured Nigeria through promotion of citizens\u2019 education.\n\nHe said: \u201cAlhaji Liadi Olapade was a philanthropist, the little things we have seen have shown that he is well loved. He did very well for Ansar-ud-Deen Society and humanity at large.\n\n\u201cDue to his passion for religion and education of citizens, which he used to say is the best way to fight insecurity, he accepted the nomination and represented the Northern States Council of Ansar-ud-Deen very well on the board of our University, Summit University.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that today, insecurity that Olapade fought for persists.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we are calling on government to put in more effort to the fight against banditry and other security challenges, because their current effort is not enough to address the challenges.\n\n\u201cGovernment should tell us those behind banditry, those sponsoring insecurity, to let us know those who don\u2019t want our dear country to progress, those who don\u2019t like the government.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn his remarks, the guest speaker and missioner of Ansar-ud-Deen Society, Northern states Council, Alhaji Muyideen Ajani Bello, who was represented by the Chief Imam of Ansar-ud-Deen Society, Zaria, Alhaji Tajudeen Akewusekisa, urged Muslims to prepare for their exit from life.\n\n\u201cWe should all be careful and prepare for our exit because many good people have gone. Alhaji Olapade was one of the major donors and supporters of Summit University, Offa. He was very diligent in supporting da\u2019awah,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President, Osun Indigenes Association and Public Relations Officer, PRO, Yoruba Community in Kaduna State, Alhaji Yunus Ajao Muibi, said Nigerian youth should emulate late Alhaji Olapade.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are here because of Alhaji Liadi Olapade who died about eight days ago, we are here to pray for him.\n\n\u201cIf Alhaji Olapade could hold six or seven leadership positions successfully, then the youth of today need to emulate him\n\n\u201cHe was an icon, a bridge builder.

This manifested in the display of hunger for pure entertainment at the just concluded annual music and art event, Felabration.\n\nThe new Afrika Shrine Ikeja, Lagos, venue of the show was filled to the brim, with people who cut across ages, status, culture, tribe and race, rushing in before 6 pm, scheduled time for commencement of the grand finale last Sunday.\n\nHeld in honour of Nigeria\u2019s late Afrobeat king, Fela Anikulapo-Kuti (Abami Eda), the 2021 Felabration themed, \u201cViva Nigeria Viva Africa\u201d enjoyed the sponsorship of Fearless energy drink, the premium brand of Rite Foods.\n\nThe week-long annual festival of music and art featuring a line-up of captivating activities, held between October 11th and 17th 2021.\n\nFounded in 1998 by the legend\u2019s eldest daughter, Yeni Anikulapo-Kuti in celebration of the life and times of her father, Felabration 2021, recorded a huge success in spite of the hard times Nigerians have been subjected to by the bad government.\n\nThe festival ended in grand style, with a posthumous award of the Fearless Man of Africa by Fearless energy drink. The posthumous award to Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, as Africa\u2019s foremost talent with positive energy, a creative genius, intentionally different and a premium quality brand that resonates the value chain of the Fearless energy brand, was proof that Fela remains an important personality in Africa as well as across the globe due to his legacy in the music space and, as an activist.\n\nFela was a most Fearless man; in ideas, performance, courage and leadership as well as a megastar whose style of music continues to influence talents all over the world.\n\nThe award, designed with a touch of aesthetics, portrays what the music icon represented; a fearless political activist whose major aim was to ensure a better Nigeria.\n\nFela fearlessly serenaded his fans with songs like \u201cSuffering and Smiling,\u201d \u201cSorrow, Tears and Blood,\u201d and \u201cUnknown Soldier\u201d as a form of political resistance against oppressive and dictatorial rule. There are also songs against inhuman acts against Africans like \u201cColonial Mentality,\u201d \u201cTeacher Don\u2019t Teach Me Nonsense,\u201d \u201dMr. Follow Follow\u201d, among others. Through this music, he created a cultural crossroad that other parts of the world could connect with, against tyranny, for a better society.\n\n\u201cLate Fela deserves honour for the impact he made in the music industry, having fought a good cause for the people through his songs\u201d, Seleem Adegunwa Managing Director of Rite Foods, began saying, during the presentation of the award to Fela.\n\nHe noted that the music legend resonates with what Fearless stands for, positive energy, courage, leadership, and can-do spirit that comes with Fela\u2019s creativity and leadership quality, his pursuit for a better Nigeria and Africa in general.\n\nPresenting the award amidst a standing ovation and thunderous applause to the Founder of Felabration, Yeni Anikulapo-Kuti, and Kunle Anikulapo-Kuti, Rite Foods Brand Manager, Boluwatife Adedugbe, said the Fearless posthumous award signifies the importance attached to the life and times of the Afrobeat megastar. She affirmed that the outstanding performance by the music legend that impacted Nigeria and Africa, could not go unrecognized, hence, the \u2018Fearless\u2019 recognition award.\n\nReceiving the award, Yeni, who was thrilled with the attractive symbol that signified his father\u2019s greatness in his music genre and his giant stride in bringing about social change through it, expressed appreciation for the important recognition of her father\u2019s effort, stressing that the award was the best thing that has ever happened since the inception of the Felabration.\n\n\u201cThis award is significant because it is from a leading brand that has been promoting human and economic development, especially in the entertainment industry, which is a burgeoning sector of Nigeria\u2019s economy\u201d, she said.\n\nShe further eulogized the sponsor of the award for also refreshing participants at the event with its first-rate Fearless energy brands. Similarly, Femi Anikulapo-Kuti, Fela\u2019s eldest son, an Afrobeat musician, commended \u201cthe Fearless energy drink brand of Rite Foods for sponsoring this year\u2019s Felabration as talented artistes were energized; a condition which manifested in the electrifying performances they put up at the musical shows of the event.\n\nWhile upcoming singers owned the stage at the very beginning of the entertaining fiesta anchored by one of Nigeria\u2019s best comedians, Olufemi Fagade, popularly known as Omo baba, the mother of all performances at the grand finale, was concerted by music star, D\u2019Banj. He brought down the roof with one of his hit songs, \u201cTop of the World\u201d, engaging his audience in a demonstration of diverse scintillating dance moves.\n\nOther exciting activities included an Arts competition, Afrobics dance competition, schools\u2019 debate with the topic \u201cCovid 19 is a Blessing\u201d, and a symposium themed, \u201cThe National Question Evolution or Devolution\u201d, with Femi Falana (SAN), as the moderator/chairman.",

Also, FG\u2019s 2022 deficit of N6.26 trillion represents 3.39% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP, which is above the 3% threshold set in Section 12(1) of the 2007 Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA).\u201d",

          "text": "The Chairman of Boripe North Local Council Development Authority, Oyebode Samson Oyewole, has frowned at the quit notice issued by Alhaji Kadiri Adepoju, the landlord of the property the council uses as its temporary secretariat.\n\nThis is as he described the decision of the landlord as both shameful and not in conformity with the Yoruba traditional standard.\n\nOyewole made his dissatisfaction known in a statement issued and signed by his Press Secretary, Wasiu Adebayo, which was made available to journalists in Osogbo, the state capital, on Monday.\n\nIn his reaction, the council boss alleged that the landlord, Alhaji Kadiri\u2019s action was capable of bringing the good reputation of the Iree Community down.\n\nHe revealed that initially, negotiation to release the property for the use of government officials was entered into between the leadership of Iree Progressive Association and the landlord.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cMind you, it is a common knowledge that before Iree community was privileged to have this LCDA situated at Iree township, a stiff competition was being experienced amongst the communities that make up the Council Area, in which Iree town is one of them.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the agitation and eagerness by the individual community to get this LCDA for its own town had influenced well to do people from each community to donate property freely for the take-off of the Local Council, if it were to be located within their community.\n\n\u201cThat is the first basis upon which this property was released by Alhaji Kadiri to the leadership of Iree Progressive Association.\n\n\u201cIn this light, it is crystal clear that the issue of whether the building would be offered for renting or not didn\u2019t arise at all. It was in the absence of those who negotiated for this property in the first instance that the owner began to engage with Council Authority on renting.\n\n\u201cThen, the agreement reached between the Authority and the Landlord was that one million naira (N1,000,000) shall be paid annually to him, of which one million naira was paid between 2018/2019 as rent, while another seven hundred thousand naira was also paid between 2019/2020.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the Local Council Authority was not aware there was no such arrangement before securing the building for government use.\u201d\n\nHe also disclosed that all over the state, it was common knowledge that the buildings used for the LCDAs created across the state were donated free of charge by the people so as to enable the councils to take off smoothly before they could build their own secretariat.\n\nHe added that Boripe North was paying annually only that the narrative changed a few months after the expiration of the tenure of the immediate past political office holders at the local government and local council development authorities across the states.\n\nOsun local council gets quit notice over rent\n\nHe argued that the leaders of Iree Progressive Association had summoned the landlord for a meeting to remind him that it was the association that took his property for use when they heard he was taking such action.\n\nOyewole explained that the association and its leaders told him that he should have come to them when he decided to offer the property up for rentage adding that he would have entered into negotiation with the association which handed over the property to the management of the LCDA.\n\nThe statement continued that, \u201cOn this premise, it has become a known fact that the previous years\u2019 payments made by the Council Authority on this rent are strange to the community leaders, for it doesn\u2019t support the circumstance which warranted the release of the property for use in the beginning.\n\n\u201cAside from these explicit explanations, at first, it is really a dent on the image of Iree Community to see an acclaimed son of the soil choosing to bring down the town, in the name of claiming rents from the Council Authority. If he doesn\u2019t know, we have to tell him; intention to bring the activities of the Local Council to a halt is the same as demeaning the entire Iree community. It\u2019s absolute madness!\n\n\u201cIn simple terms, this landlord could have taken a queue from others who donated their apartments freely for the formation of LCDAs across the state for the benefits of their communities. He ought to have understood that these donors have made good history, and their golden footpath will forever be indelible for upcoming generations to reap its benefit.\n\n\u201cTo crown it all, the action taken by Alhaji Kadiri, owner of the apartments being used as Boripe North LCDA Secretariat, by sending a quit notice to the Authority of the Local Council, as a result of his claim that he has been owed some months rent arrears, is disgraceful, shameful, irrational and strange to acceptable Yoruba ethical practice. And if he has any right claim, we enjoin him to channel it to the leadership of Iree Progressive Association which negotiated the occupancy of the said property with him initially.\n\n\u201cBesides, hiding under the allegation that the council environment is being misused was quite unfortunate. It was nothing but outright lies, as the council has always ensured the cleanliness of the temporary secretariat from time to time.\u201d\n\nRecall that the landlord, Adepoju had issued a quit notice through his counsel, Dr. D. A. Ariyoosu, to the LCDA over a N1,000,000.00 outstanding rent and electricity bill.\n\nAlso contained in the notice was that if the LCDA failed to pay the rent or move out, they will face legal action.\n\nThe property was given out on rent in 2016 at the creation of the LCDA by the administration of former Governor, Rauf Aregbesola.\n\nIt was learnt that the property was given cheaply to the LCDA by the owner on the agreement that it will maintain the property and pay electricity bills but disagreement arose when the owner, Alhaji Adepoju accused them of not taking care of the property.\n\nAlso, the Chairman, Oyewole had earlier denied the existence of the notice but later acknowledged it.",

          "text": "The Interim Administrator, Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP), Col. Milland Dixon Dikio (rtd) has raised the alarm of an emerging wave of militancy in the Niger Delta fuelled by substance abuse among youths in the region.\n\nDikio, who spoke when he paid a visit to the Chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig.-Gen. Muhammad Buba Marwa (rtd), in Abuja said urgent steps should be taken to curb the emerging threat.\n\nDikio, in a statement signed on Monday and sent to DAILY POST by his Special Adviser on Media, Mr. Nneotaobase Egbe, said that the partnership between NDLEA and PAP would drastically reduce cases of drug abuse and reposition the minds of the youths for more productive ventures to sustain the peace and development in the region.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have a unique challenge in the Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP) that of managing ex-militants; we call them ex-agitators. We want to take active measures to not only manage the present ex-agitators but to pre-empt and stop the pipeline that leads to deviant behaviour and militancy.\n\n\u201cIt goes without saying that some of these people get their motivation by using or abusing substances, so we want to key into what you are doing on the arrest side and learn what we can do on the prevention side\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks, Marwa promised that the NDLEA would partner with PAP to curb the intake of hard drugs and other banned substances by youths in the Niger Delta.\n\nHe decried the wave of drug-induced crime in the country, especially among youths noting that the collaboration between PAP and his agency would focus on sensitisation and counselling programmes as a major preventive measure to curb the menace.\n\nBuhari renews Dikio\u2019s appointment as Amnesty Programme Administrator\n\nWhile identifying poverty as the main cause of drug abuse in Nigeria, the NDLEA boss explained that criminals used drugs to embolden themselves before embarking on any criminal activity.\n\nMarwa (rtd), who used the opportunity to reel out some alarming drug statistics in the country, also lauded the willingness and commitment of Dikio to make the Niger Delta a drug-free zone.\n\nHe said 80 per cent of drug users in the country only required counselling, adding that records corroborated by a United Nation\u2019s study showed that in Nigeria, one in seven persons between ages 23 to 64 abused drugs.\n\nHe said: \u201d We have also found that the students, bandits, kidnappers, rapists, down the line youths, militants, use drugs and we will be very happy to collaborate with the Amnesty Programme.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to wait for people to become drug addicts first; the majority have not used drugs, others have tasted but are not addicted to it. The ex-agitators are also normal human beings that will like to marry and raise families.\n\n\u201cThe advice we give that will deal with the drug problem is to find some source of income for them through skills acquisition and if it is affordable, some kind of wage structure\u201d.",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nThe Federal Government, yesterday, warned it would no longer tolorate the attacks on custodial facilities across the country saying enough is enough.\n\nThe warning came against the backdrop of last Friday\u2019s attack on the Medium Security Custodial Centre in Abolongo, Oyo State and previous attacks on custodial faciliteis in Owerri, Benin and Kabba in Imo, Edo and Kogi states respectively.\n\nMinister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, who deplored the attacks when he visited the Abolongo custodial centre, yesterday, said they were not just random happenings but premeditated, planned and coordinated crimes designed to make Nigeria unsafe and ridicule the government.\n\n\u201cWe are going after every single inmate that escaped from custody. We shall hunt them to the ends of the earth. All the security agencies in the country are on their trail. We shall not rest nor tire until we bring the last one in, dead or alive. Let me assure Nigerians of the safety of their lives and property. Our custodial facilities are safe and we are putting extra safety measures in place in light of the observed pattern of the external attacks we have seen, to prevent any such occurrence in the future.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\n\u201cI am assuring Nigerians that the Federal Government will pursue not just those who attacked our facility, but those who have escaped lawful custody. The attack was unconscionable. I commend officers of the Nigeria Correctional Service and other members of sister security agencies, who provided perimeter security for our facility for fighting gallantly and holding the fort before the attackers were able to gain access to the awaiting trial section of the facility. However, those who escaped are already being pursued. Some have been rearrested, many more will still be captured,\u201d the minister said.\n\nThe attack on the Oyo facility was launched by gunmen around 10pm last Friday with a total of 837 out of the 907 inmates held in the facility freed by the gunmen. One soldier, one Amotekun operative and one inmate lost their lives during the gun duel, while many sustained varying degrees of injury.\n\nGovernor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State; Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III and 5the state Commissioner of Police, Ngozi Onadeko had also visited the facility.\n\nMakinde who described the attack as shocking said close circuit television cameras (CCTV) would be installed as part of surveillance and security measures on the facility.\n\n\u201cInvestigation is still ongoing. We cannot say precisely whether this is an isolated event, or is the beginning of a wider issue that we have to deal with. But whatever the case is, we have made an assessment here, we have taken some immediate decisions. We have asked that the road to this place be graded immediately. We are going to position cameras here and we will link them to our security situation room, not just here, but all other correctional facilities in the state. We are also making a list of critical state assets that we need to monitor. I have also asked that the entrance and exit points to the state be monitored,\u201d he said.\n\nResponding to question on high profile inmates escaping from the facility, Makinde said: \u201cPeople are very quick to start talking about conspiracy theory. Investigation is still on. Yes, there are high profile inmates that are held in this facility. But they are not the people that they are carrying their rumour. So, I will appeal again that we should be calm. We have challenges around the country. We have insurgency, we have banditry. But we can only deal with those issues when we have the people in alignment to what the leadership is doing. We should believe that the leadership will tell them the exact situation of things at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nAlaafin of Oyo, said attack on the facility was shocking.\n\n\u201cMay God end such. This place is for those who are acting against the law and all what the government is doing to make things good, so that they can be kept away and reformed before coming back into the society as better people. But, the situation where they had to bring guns and explosives here to destroy the place is so shocking to us and painful. All those who died and injured, may God forgive them their sins and heal those in the hospital. The people of the town should be calm and wait for what the government will do. I am sure that the government will react positively and this incident will be a thing of the past. By the grace of God, we will never witness this type of devastation again in this town.\u201d\n\nThe number of inmates that have been recaptured had risen to 378, while 460 are still at large, said Adams Ongaji, officer in charge of the custodial centre. It was gathered that the repair of damaged items at the centre had begun on Sunday.\n\nIt was, however, learnt that only two soldiers and three armed guards were on ground when gunmen with sophisticated weapons attacked the facility. \u201cThe the gunmen did not only overpower the five security personnel, they successfully took away three inmates that were remanded at the centre in connection with bank robbery,\u201d a source said.\n\nDeputy Controller-General, Operations, of NCS, Abuja, Mohammed Tukur, cleared the air on the speculations that the gunmen came to rescue the alleged territorial warlord and kidnapping kingpin on Ibarapa axis of the state, Iskilu Wakili, saying Wakili was not held at the centre. He said the suspected serial killer of Akinyele Local Government Area of the state, Sunday Sodipe was not also held at the facility.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Rescuing Nigeria from abandoned road projects",
          "text": "Although the infrastructure deficit in Nigeria is alarming generally, the state of the roads in the country is particularly shameful. Dilapidated and abandoned, the crater-infested federal roads litter every region of Nigeria. The situation has reached a point where we must find long-lasting solutions to the problem.\n\nThe list of the bad federal roads is long. They are spread across the country. Contracts for the rehabilitation of many of these roads have been awarded, but poor funding has stalled work on them. The contracts for the rehabilitation of Makera-Kontagora-Yauri and Bida-Lapai-Lambatta Roads, for instance, were reportedly awarded in 2013 and 2018 respectively. Until date, they are not yet completed.\n\nPart of the problem is that money appropriated for roads is too paltry. Also, when money is appropriated, it is not fully released. Last year, the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, alluded to this fact when she said: \u201cYou will see a road that costs, maybe, N5 billion, and you will see a provision for N100 million, N200 million or N300 million. Of course, the project will never finish. After two years, the contractor comes back and asks for variation, and the amount keeps growing.\u201d\n\nThis is the case with the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway. According to the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Works, Abubakar Kabir, the contract for the rehabilitation of the road was awarded to the tune of N32 billion. So far, he said, only about N5 billion was certified to date approximating to about 19 per cent completion. The lawmaker lamented that in the 2022 budget, the provision for that road was less than N300 million.\n\nBesides, Kabir said the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing allocated only N280 billion to road infrastructure in the 2022 budget. This is against the reported N640 billion outstanding certificates to contractors. In 2020, the Federal Government allocated N169.88billion for construction and rehabilitation of roads. This is less than the N280.44billion budgeted for the same purpose in 2019. In 2021, the approved sum for the rehabilitation of roads was over N117billion. How can we move forward this way?\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nIt has been observed that money appropriated for roads is usually too small to do any meaningful job. In the 2022 budget, there are provisions for execution of roads, with appropriation of N35 million for one kilometre. With the level of inflation and high cost of construction materials, there is no solid one kilometre of road work that can be done with N35 million. In such situation, what may happen at best is the contractor grading the road and settling officials of the Ministry of Works to look the other way. Such situation is rampant in relation to road rehabilitation and construction. Most times, a road contractor contends with party patronage, bribing ministry officials and settling communities before embarking on road projects. With paltry allocation, this helps to ensure that these road projects are not executed.\n\nEven when they are completed, some of these roads are not strong enough to withstand the volume of traffic on them. Due to the fact that the railway infrastructure is not fully developed yet, overloaded tankers and trucks put great pressure on these roads and often lead to their total damage. The other day, a section of the Onitsha-Owerri Road completely collapsed to the chagrin of many of the road users.\n\nThe state of our roads contributes largely to the rate of accident and insecurity in Nigeria. Recently, the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) said 5,320 road crashes and 2,471 deaths were recorded nationwide between January and June 2021 alone. No fewer than 15,882 people sustained various injuries. The worst is that bandits often lay ambush and waylay their victims on bad portions of these roads. This is not salutary at all.\n\nBad roads also affect prices of commodities. Farmers labour to bring food items to the market. Transporters take cognizance of the wear and tear of their vehicles occasioned by bad roads and increase transport fares. This invariably translates into higher prices for goods and services.\n\nOne way or the other, bad roads also affect investment. It may have contributed to the decline in our Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) because no investor wants to invest in an atmosphere of poor infrastructure. Some of them who dared to invest have had to endure the misfortune of fallen containers, broken down vehicles and associated problems.\n\nCritical problems demand drastic solutions. In saner countries, the state of our roads and other infrastructure would have elicited serious uproar and litigation. Nigerians are so used to poor governance that nothing moves them anymore. Surprisingly, the two chambers of the National Assembly rose in condemnation of these bad roads recently. The House of Representatives lamented that an estimated 6,000 kilometres of roads had been damaged by torrential rainfall across the country. The Senate asked the Federal Government to declare a state of emergency on federal roads and improve the funding for their maintenance. It urged the Federal Ministry of Finance to release adequate funds to the Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA) to enable it to carry out emergency repairs on all the federal roads. It had earlier urged the government to consider emergency intervention fund of N300 billion for critical roads in Niger State linking economic corridors in the North and South. Niger State\u2019s 2,263km of federal roads is the longest of the national federal road network of 36,000km.\n\nWe think that with the interest the National Assembly has shown in state of roads, it could go a step further by taking decisive measures to tackle the problem. At present, the National Assembly is working on the 2022 budget. We suggest that the federal lawmakers should look at appropriation for roads critically. The issue of paltry allocation should be dealt with. Where it is obvious that proposed allocation cannot do the job, the National Assembly could increase the budget sum or merge allocations. The National Assembly should also, in its oversight function, ensure that roads so awarded must not only be executed but also properly done.\n\nNo doubt, good roads ginger development. Hence, the Federal Ministry of Works must be alive to its responsibilities. It is obvious that the ministry cannot fully handle the rehabilitation of all the road networks in Nigeria. The Road Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme, an initiative of the Federal Government, is a noble idea. The scheme allows the private sector to construct roads in exchange for a tax credit. Through this scheme, Dangote Nigeria Plc did a good job on the Oshodi-Apapa Expressway in Lagos.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has promised to begin the rehabilitation of 16 roads in some parts of the country to the tune of N621 billion. This followed the recent suspension of the planned strike by the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG). NUPENG had, earlier this month, threatened that its tanker drivers would go on strike as a result of the deplorable state of the country\u2019s highways. But the management of the NNPC, after a meeting with NUPENG, resolved to rehabilitate some critical roads through the Road Infrastructure Tax Credit scheme. This is in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing and the Federal Inland Revenue Service. More of this partnership should be encouraged.\n\nAbove all, if we must make any appreciable progress in the area of road construction and rehabilitation, there must be a substantial increase in the allocation to the Ministry of Works and Housing. The ministry, on its part, must consider road rehabilitation a priority and allocate appreciable sum of its budget to it. After a road is completed, the Federal Government may consider erecting tollgate on it to generate income for its regular rehabilitation. As the Finance Minister, Ahmed, recently advocated, taking one or two projects at a time and completing it before going to the next one is the best thing to do.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo has warned the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to desist from pitting the Yoruba against the Igbo living in Lagos by playing ethnic card.\n\nMalami had, at a press conference last Friday, accused leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, of instigating the attack on the palace of the Oba of Lagos, Rilwan Akiolu and several other destructions in Lagos during the October 2020 EndSARS protest by the youths.\n\nThe apex Igbo sociocultural body described the remarks by the AGF as very inelegant, imprudent, malicious, treacherous and fallacious. It also said the allegation that the IPOB vandalised and looted the palace of the Oba of Lagos and burnt over 150 buses at the Lagos bus terminal was mere ethnic cards simply intended to play up the Yoruba against the Igbo.\n\nA statement by National Publicity Secretary, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Alex Ogbonnia, wondered how Malami would be dragging Kanu and IPOB into the attack on the Oba\u2019s palace when some 15 suspects had been arrested by the police and none of them were Igbo.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\n\u201cThe police brought 15 suspects before a Lagos State Magistrate Court sitting at Ogba, in the Ikeja magisterial district, with charges bordering on theft and felony. The court documents with the charge number CR/MISC/ES/L/002020 revealed that all the suspects charged by the Nigeria Police are Messrs Eniafe Olawale, Gbenga Ajayi, Lamidi Rafiu, Oladunmoye Ayodeji, Soliu Tajudeen, Ahmed Olayinka, Samuel Damilola, Wasiu Grewa, Habib Salit, Nurudeen Yusuf, Safiu Quadri Lekan, Afolabi lukuman and Yusuf Babalola,\u201d Ogbonnia said.\n\nHe said the Ohanaeze and IPOB were united against the orchestrated marginalisation of the Igbo in the Nigeria federation, stating that their point of divergence is while the former believes the Igbo ingenuity will find full expression in a restructured Nigeria, the latter appears to be tired of the age-long marginalisation of the Igbo in a country they have sacrificed so much to build.\n\nOgbonnia said IPOB members are children of Ohanaeze, adding any unwarranted attack on the pro-Biafra group is an attack on the entire Igbo.\n\nAccording to the Ohanaeze, the bond between the Yoruba and the Igbo is strong, inseparable and beyond Malami\u2019s narrow machinations.\n\n\u201cMalami should know that the Yoruba do not spill the Igbo blood and vice versa. The likes of Colonel Adekunle Fajuyi, who chose the supreme price instead of betraying an Igbo in the person of General Johnson Thomas Umunnakwe Aguiyi Ironsi, have replicated across board in millions. Perhaps, Malami does not know the historic role played by the current Oba of Lagos, as a police officer, for the return from exile of Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, the Ikemba Nnewi in 1982.\n\n\u201cMalami should know that the Igbo-Yoruba relation has given rise to several high profile intermarriages with bubbling grown up children and grand-children. More of the above sources of unity and inter-ethnic solidarity were accentuated when the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, George Obiozor, paid a courtesy visit to the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, in his Lagos Office.\n\n\u201cMalami should know that the internet world has left him behind. All his game-plans are crude and anachronistic. The Malami sinister motives of heaping all criminalities in Nigeria on IPOB or the Igbo, including the crimes where arrests have been made and the known culprits already arraigned is most unethical, unprofessional and unbefitting of his office.\n\n\u201cSome other crimes that Malami ascribes to IPOB are still under investigation and arrests so far made are not linked to IPOB. The Malami perversions are very strange to law and, indeed, a new dimension in Nigerian justice delivery system.\n\n\u201cMalami card is to paint the South East as a terrorist zone, to prepare a ground for the use of the newly acquired American Super Tucano Fighter Jets in the zone. Malami should be reminded that the very condition for the sale and release of the jets to Nigeria by the USA is that they will be used strictly to fight the Boko Haram terrorists in the North East and incessant banditry in the North West.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, Malami is playing god by believing that the 2023 is the end of the world and is plotting hard against the Igbo interest.

Yet they do so, because for so long, under previous administrations, whether military or democratic, tough decisions have been ducked, and challenges never fully met \u2013 with the effect of abetting these dangers and allowing them all to fester and grow.\n\n\u201cToday, all four threats are being fought concurrently and it is only this President\u2019s administration which has finally had the will and determination to confront them.\u201d\n\nThe statement further outlined efforts by the Buhari administration to solve the problems that remained unattended to by past military and civilian governments in the country.\n\nThe Presidency stressed that the present administration since it came into power in May, 2015, had remained resolute and would do everything possible to ensure that the identified threats become history by the time President Buhari finishes his tenure in May, 2023.\n\nIt added: \u201cThe Buhari administration has sought to push back terrorism which has been a threat for more than two decades since the first emergence of Boko Haram. It is only the Buhari administration that has now sought to intervene against the kidnapping and banditry that has been a simmering threat for far longer. It is only this President\u2019s government which has taken on IPOB, the violent terrorist group which bombs police stations and offices of security agencies, while also threatening those who break their Monday-sit-ins whilst claiming the mantle of forebears who half a century ago fought a civil war.\n\n\u201cAnd it is only the Buhari leadership which has sought \u2013 ever, in over one hundred years \u2013 to identify the root causes of the herder-farmer clashes and find durable solutions.\n\n\u201cThe forms may have altered, and the threats posed by each may have waxed and waned, but what has been constant is that administration after administration since independence \u2013 whether military or democratic \u2013 none sought to fully address these threats to Nigeria as President Buhari\u2019s government does now.\n\n\u201cToday, the military is engaged in almost all the states of Nigeria because the President has insisted upon addressing these decade-after-decade-long issues during his time in office.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cIn the north, Boko Haram members \u2013 many of whom now fight under the breakaway banner of Islamic State\u2019s West Africa Province (ISWAP) \u2013 have been pushed back. At the start of the President\u2019s tenure, Boko Haram was launching attacks across the majority of the country \u2013 including in southern states and Lagos.\n\n\u201cToday they are cornered and confined along with their ISWAP compatriots in our country\u2019s outermost fringes of the border, unable to spread further.\n\n\u201cIn the south-east, IPOB \u2013 which the Economist rightly describes as \u201cdelusional\u201d \u2013 the arrest and present trial of the terrorist leader of the group is the beginning of its demise.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s administration is redoubling efforts to have IPOB rightfully designated as a terrorist group by our allies outside of Nigeria \u2013 an act which will collapse their ability to transact gains from crime and extortion in foreign currencies.\n\n\u201cIt is important to remind The Economist and the global media that this group\u2019s aggression and widespread presence on social media does not reflect their public support, for which they have none: all elected governors, all elected politicians and all elected state assemblies in the south-east \u2013 which IPOB claim to be part of their fantasy kingdom \u2013 reject them completely.\n\n\u201cThe only government of Nigeria which has ever sought a solution to the centuries-old herder-farmer disputes of the central belt is President Buhari\u2019s administration. The federal ranches programme, launched shortly after the president\u2019s re-election is the first of its kind \u2013 and it is working: during the last 12 months clashes have significantly reduced.\n\n\u201cThe government now calls on state governors to have the imagination to join forces with the federal administration and expand this programme by making available state lands for those interested, now that its effectiveness has been demonstrated.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, it stated that: \u201cThe Economist opinionated and reported on banditry and kidnapping in the north-west. While this has been simmering for generations, it is the newest of the organised threats Nigeria faces to her stability. But this too the Economist inaccurately described: \u201cbandits\u201d who have the resources and technology to shoot down a military fighter jet are not bandits at all \u2013 but rather highly organised crime syndicates with huge resources and weaponry.\n\n\u201cYet they are essentially no different to Boko Haram in this regard who are now cornered. It will take time, but the president is unwavering in his determination to collapse this challenge to public order.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*As senior lawyer pushes for higher taxation of wealthy Nigerians\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nRivers State Governor, Mr. Nyesom Wike, said at the weekend that the state was not at war with the federal government or any of its agencies. The clarification followed insinuations in some quarters about hostility between the two tiers of government in the wake of the legal dispute over who is authorised to collect Value Added Tax (VAT) in the state.\n\nWike made the explanation at a public lecture on \u201cTaxing Powers in a Federal System.\u201d He said Rivers and the federal government were coequals because they derived their life from the constitution.\n\nThe public lecture was organised in commemoration of the 60th birthday of Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr. Ahmed Raji.\n\nWike was represented at the occasion by the Rivers State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Professor Zacheus Adangor.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cI have heard a lot of comments been made that we are fighting federal government. There is no desire or any intention of the Rivers State government to fight the federal government, but you must remember that in a federal system, the states are not houseboys of the federal government.\n\n\u201cThe principle of coequality is fundamental to federal arrangement, that principle leads to the principle of autonomy, autonomy leads you to fiscal autonomy and fiscal autonomy leads you to fiscal federalism, and when you put all the principles together, what it means is that each level of government, whether federal or state, is coequal because none derives its life from the other.\n\n\u201cThey both derive their life from the constitution because they have coequality and every level of government is entitled to have access to sufficient revenue so that they can carry out its own responsibility without subordinating its will to that of a superior authority.\n\n\u201cThat is the fundamental aspect of fiscal federalism and until we get it, we will continue this journey of talking and talking without result. But I think that the court has a role to play, the court can lay this crisis and controversy to rest when it makes a pronouncement.\u201d\n\nWike explained that the taxing system being sought was one that would ensure homogenisation, adding that what operates today is not what was agreed upon at the constitutional conference.\n\n\u201cCan we say that the federal government has the power to impose and collect those taxes that the court struck down in Port Harcourt?\u201d Wike queried.\n\n\u201cCertainly not, and so for me, we need to resolve this issue through the courts and that is what Rivers State has opted to do and we encourage as many states as possible to join us in this new revival of the Nigerian federal arrangement so that we can lay some of these issues to rest,\u201d the governor added.\n\nThe celebrant, Raji, used the occasion to call on the Nigerian government to immediately introduce a new tax policy known as \u201cWealth Tax,\u201d that would make very rich Nigerians pay tax that would be used to cater for the downtrodden in the country. He said the policy, if introduced and implemented, would make rich Nigerians to contribute meaningfully to government\u2019s purse to bridge the gap between the affluent and super poor in the nation.\n\nAccording to Raji, \u201cIt is a fact that the downturn in Nigeria\u2019s economy are having harsh and devastating effects on the poor majority Nigerians. The wide disparity between the rich and the poor should be of grave concern to patriotic Nigerians and the way out must be found.\n\n\u201cThe gap between the rich and the poor is so much and so offensive that it can lead to breakdown of law and order in any moment.\n\n\u201cIt is in the interest of justice that the super-rich should shed part of their stupendous wealth to cater for the downtrodden masses before it is too late.\u201d\n\nThe senior lawyer said he opted to use the public lecture to mark his birthday so as to use it to draw attention to some burning issues and challenges that deserve public attention, rather than engage in mere merry making.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

As a mitigating factor, the SDO considered the respondent\u2019s limited cooperation with investigators, noting that the respondent produced documents and agreed to be interviewed but did not accept responsibility for the misconduct.\u201d\n\nAlso mentioned in the report is a Nigerian firm, Juckon Construction and Allied Services Nigeria Limited, debarred for corrupt practices for three years. Referred to under Sanctions Case No 649, it was disclosed that the firm made improper payment to a public official.\n\nThe report read, \u201cThe SDO determined that the respondent, a Nigerian firm, engaged in corrupt practice by making an improper payment to a public official in connection with the award and/or execution of two waste management and refuse collection contracts under a state employment and expenditure project in Nigeria. The SDO imposed on the respondent a debarment with the conditional release for a minimum period of four years.\u201d\n\nAnother individual, Okafor Glory, was debarred for fraudulent practices for four years, while the firm involved, Unique Concept Enterprises, was debarred for five years for same reason.\n\nThe matter which involved Glory and the firm, Unique Concept Enterprises, was presented under Sanctions Case No 691.\n\nIt read in part, \u201cThe SDO determined that the respondents, a Nigerian firm and a Nigerian citizen, engaged in fraudulent practices by submitting false documents in connection with two refuse collection and disposal contracts under a state employment and expenditure project in Nigeria. In particular, the SDO found that: (i) the corporate respondent submitted a falsified income tax clearance certificate in its bids for the contracts; and (ii) both respondents submitted a falsified advance payment guarantee in connection with the execution of one of the contracts.\n\n\u201cThe SDO imposed on the corporate respondent a debarment with conditional release for a minimum period of five years. On the individual respondent, the SDO imposed a debarment with conditional release for a minimum period of four years.\n\n\u201cAs aggravating factors, the SDO considered that (i) the corporate respondent engaged in a repeated pattern of misconduct, and (ii) the individual respondent was the managing director of the corporate respondent.\u201d\n\nAnother Nigerian firm, Asbeco Nigeria Limited, was debarred for five years for corrupt practices.\n\nThe matter which involved Asbeco Nigeria was presented under Sanctions Case No 675.\n\nIt read in part, \u201cThe SDO determined that the respondent, a Nigerian firm, engaged in corrupt practices in connection with an erosion control contract under an erosion and watershed management project in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, the SDO found that the respondent (i) made a payment of N2m (approximately $12,000) to the project\u2019s engineer to influence his actions in connection with the procurement and/or execution of the contract, and (ii) made a facilitation payment of N50,000 (approximately $160) to the project\u2019s cashier to influence her actions in connection with the execution of the same contract.\n\n\u201cThe SDO imposed on the respondent a debarment with conditional release for a minimum period of five years. In determining this sanction, the SDO considered as aggravating factors the respondent\u2019s (i) engagement in a repeated pattern of corrupt activity and (ii) interference with INT\u2019s investigation, noting in particular that the respondent engaged in acts intended to materially impede the exercise of the Bank\u2019s contractual audit rights.\u201d\n\nBased on the World Bank\u2019s Sanctions Board Decision, A.G. Vision Construction Nigeria Limited, was debarred for fraudulent practices and collusive practices for four years and six months.\n\nApart from the firms and individuals mentioned, there are some firms that were debarred by other multilateral organisations under cross-debarment, which makes them debarred by the World Bank.\n\nSangtech International Services Limited, Sangar & Associates (Nigeria) Limited, Mashad Integrated And Investment Co Limited, and Medniza Global Merchants Limited were debarred by the AfDB two years under cross-debarment recognised by the World Bank.\n\nALG Global Concept Nigeria Limited, Abuharaira Labaran Gero, Qualitrends Global Solutions Nigeria Limited, and Maxicare Company Nigeria Limited were debarred by the AfDB for three years under cross-debarment recognised by the World Bank.\n\nIn his opening remark in the report, the World Bank Group\u2019s David Malpass, stated that the bank had granted over $157 billion to assist developing countries, as he emphasised the need for integrity and transparency standards in public finance.\n\n\u201cSince the beginning of the global pandemic, the World Bank Group has deployed more than $157 billion in critical assistance to developing countries. The crisis has required us to be rapid and innovative in mobilising this historic support.\n\n\u201cYet, for these resources to have the needed development impact on the hundreds of millions of people who live in extreme poverty, we must ensure that resources are used efficiently, effectively, and for their intended purposes. And that means remaining vigilant to the scourge of corruption and ensuring that we promote the highest integrity and transparency standards in public finance,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further highlighted some of the consequences of corruption.\n\nMalpass said, \u201cThe negative impacts of corruption on lives and livelihoods are well known. Corruption diverts scarce development dollars from the people who need them most and corrodes the systems and services that are integral for reducing extreme poverty.\n\n\u201cEntrenched corruption also comes with greater economic costs for countries, as it distorts public expenditures and leads to inefficient allocations of financing away from productive investments toward rent-seeking activities. And corruption increases the costs of doing business and deters foreign investors from entering new markets.\n\n\u201cAs the world moves toward recovering from the pandemic\u2019s damaging impacts, these costs can also restrict the private sector, which plays an important role in revitalizing economic growth and development in our client countries,\u201d he added.",

We agreed if their children and women are also killed, they are guilty by association or collateral damage, so also the bandits may think the same way. It\u2019s right for vigilantes to lynch Fulanis herdsmen or anyone that looks like them by profiling but wrong for the herdsmen to ransack villages in retribution. They are pushed to believe it is an existential war and in war, ethics are thrown to the winds.\n\n\u201cYet again, the only helpful part that is against Bandits is that no other than them are attracted to join them in the NW because of its ethnic tinge and coloration. However, the moment they are termed Terrorist \u2013 Islamic for that matter, the direct foreign Jihadist movements will set in in force. And many teaming unemployed youths may find it palatable and attractive. Shouting \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 plus AK47 against a \u2018secular\u2019 immoral society where impunity reigns are the magnet for extremists and downtrodden \u2013 the majority of our youth. Already these deadly terrorist groups are fighting for the soul of these bandits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis will give criminality a spiritual cover and remove the stigma of discrediting them with such crimes since now they are fighting a \u2018Jihad\u2019 as they will claim. In such a situation, does the larger society -as it is- has the moral high ground to fight back? This is the most probable consequence, the price of which is not worth it. Nothing stops the kinetic actions from going on without the controversy of semantics.\n\n\u201cNE is already and is still devastated by this madness for over 12 years. If we allow, terror, to set in into these raw na\u00efve unexposed bandits, NW will be in ruins sooner than later. Already IPOB are destroying SE, and Igboho has set the ball of confusion rolling in SW. For those who want to destroy the NW, it\u2019s a good recipe. Turn bandits into religious zealots. Tell me, what then remains of Nigeria?\u201d\n\nGumi said he has started to get bandits out of their \u201cmisadventure\u201d but unfortunately, he has had few helpers and a \u201cmountain of antagonists\u201d.",

          "title": "Kenyans have a poor saving culture and Koa wants to change that",
          "text": "Kenyans don\u2019t save.\n\nDespite being the third-largest economy in sub-Saharan Africa and East Africa\u2019s financial and commercial hub, Kenya has a savings rate of 12%, the lowest in East Africa\u2014way below Africa\u2019s average of 17%.\n\nThere are many factors this problem is attributed to: high spending appetite among young Kenyans, high cost of living, especially in urban areas, and black tax. There\u2019s also an outright lack of motivation to save.\n\nThis is a big problem two pan-African tech operators Delila Kidanu and Alexis Roman are tackling through Koa, the digital saving platform they co-founded.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKoa founding story\n\nThe story of Koa can be traced back to MEST Africa as it\u2019s the first place the two co-founders met and worked. But the idea to start a company together hadn\u2019t been born yet. They were only heavily involved in MEST\u2019s mission, which is to incubate and help scale African entrepreneurs and startups, and were exposed to a lot of people and the process of building solutions for African problems.\n\nKidanu was born in Ethiopia, moved to Kenya as a child and lived there until she went to the UK to study international relations and business. She then moved to Sweden for a master\u2019s degree in innovation management and entrepreneurship. She proceeded to work with an NGO in Germany to drive policies around global education before she moved back to Kenya to consult for international companies looking to set up shops in East Africa. After doing that for a while, she joined MEST Africa.\n\nRoman, on the other hand, was born in Paris but moved to Togo as a child where he stayed and schooled until he moved to Canada to study economics and finance. He started a business after school but later decided to go work in a traditional financial institution, which he called a mistake that came with lots of needed experience. He moved back to Africa to join MEST Africa in Ghana.\n\nAfter leaving MEST Africa, the duo forayed into different businesses but kept in touch and would always meet up whenever they were in the same city. Early 2020, they became colleagues again and started working as startup scouts for an early-fund venture capital, Microtraction.\n\nKoa co-founders\n\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time in Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya. Both Delilah and I saw the popularity of digital saving products in Nigeria, like PiggyVest and Cowrywise, and how they were serving a real need for customers. But when we looked beyond Nigeria, as a market, we felt like there was a significant gap in other countries,\u201d Koa\u2019s CEO Roman told TechCabal.\n\nThey went ahead to speak to thousands of people in Kenya and discovered that 60% of the people relied on inefficient Informal Saving Groups and Cooperatives to save and access financial products. It became more obvious that lack of seamless saving option is another big factor aiding the problem. So they started deliberating about solving the problem the same way PiggyVest and Cowrywise are doing in Nigeria.\n\nIn December 2020, they finally founded Koa with Bubunyo Nyavor, their old colleague from MEST. The platform went into beta in April and was launched to the public in June.\n\nThe platform makes it easy for users to set personal saving goals towards a particular expenses like paying school fee, buying a new phones, cars or even marriage. The app nudge users\u2019 by sending them daily, weekly or monthly reminders to deposit into the goals they set. Koa also makes it easy for users to track their progress so that they won\u2019t slack or help them back on track when they do.\n\nKoa is playing in a tough market and so is investing heavily in educational content that exposes its users to the importance of savings, especially in creating generational wealth. So far, according to Kidanu, the platform already has 6,000 users and has received a deposit of 8,314,500 KES ($75,000) since its launch.\n\nA few weeks ago, the company pitched at the TechCrunch battlefield as one of the only two African startups that made the cut and was the only African startup that made it to top-five. Both co-founders said it was a great learning curve for them and another validation that their product is essential in solving this real-life problem.\n\nIncentive: make more money while saving\n\nIt\u2019s not only difficult for Kenyans to save; they also struggle with investing. So, Koa is killing two birds with one stone by holding its users\u2019 money in a money market through a partnership with Britam, an asset manager in the Kenyan market.\n\nOn Koa, users earn up to 10% interest on their money annually, depending on market conditions. They also earn interest daily, which is good because they see their money grow in real time. This strategy has helped to cement the gospel of building wealth through saving and passive investing.\n\n\u201cOur partner has different types of funds. For us, we needed to be able to tap into a lower risk investment so that we don\u2019t lose our customer base that is a bit more risk-averse. So we opted to work with Britam to invest in their money market fund,\u201d Kidanu said on why they choose such investment and the reality of their promised ROI.\n\nIn fintech, customer trust is key. Once you hack that, scaling becomes a lot less harder. It\u2019s evident in the way savings platforms like PiggyVest transparently communicate with their users and how much loyalty their users have for them. So are Koa users aware that their money is being invested in a money market?\n\n\u201cCustomer trust is very important to us, and we communicate with our customers in terms of where their money is, who our partner is, why we chose them, and how their fund flow works. We only make the investment passive because we want to ensure a seamless experience for our users who are new to this,\u201d Kidanu added.\n\nMaking money for a company whose major mission is to first help people who, before now, wouldn\u2019t even think of saving money and building wealth can be tricky because charging customers directly can end up driving them away. They don\u2019t think of the money they could make but the little that\u2019s being asked of them. So how does Koa make money as a business?\n\n\u201cWe make money when we get a commission from our asset management partner on funds invested. So we didn\u2019t want a situation where we\u2019d have to charge our customers directly for the service. We want them to enjoy the service for free,\u201d Roman said.\n\nThe founders said they\u2019ve raised a pre-seed institutional investment. On the back of the raised funds and their seed round, which closes soon, Kidanu and Roman also plan to scale fast and expand to neighbouring countries like Tanzania and Uganda that have the same saving problem.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "Baxi acquisition deal sees MFS Africa expand footprint into Nigeria",
          "text": "In a deal subject to approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria, MFS Africa has signed an agreement to acquire Capricorn Digital, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest digital solutions and distribution companies with a 90,000-strong agent network across the country, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nAs the largest fintech interoperability hub in Africa, MFS Africa connects banks, telcos, and money transfer operators across over 35 countries via a single integration point. Paga, MTN mobile money, Ecobank, and Safaricom are among the operators integrated on the hub, with an estimated 320 million mobile money customers interacting across various digital wallets without transaction fees associated with switching platforms.\n\nCapricorn, under its SME-focused brand, Baxi, operates an ecosystem of digital payment services. Its solution is built to help Nigerians with everyday payment needs; including utility bill payments, airtime purchases, pay-TV and data subscriptions, withdrawals, and money transfers. The company delivers these services through its retail network of agents and merchants in some of the remotest locations across Nigeria, and via its BaxiBox POS, BaxiPay, Baxi MPoS Device, and BaxiRIMS products.\n\nThe 100% cash acquisition, MFS Africa\u2019s third in five years, sees the pan-African payments giant expand into Africa\u2019s largest economy, where its presence to date has been limited given the country\u2019s small number of mobile wallets. Capricorn will be called MFS Africa but its core product, Baxi, retains its name.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBoth parties declined to disclose the value of the deal but on a call with TechCabal, Capricorn Founder and CEO, Degbola Abudu, said the deal is the second-largest of its kind in Nigeria\u2019s fintech space, behind the $200 million Stripe paid for Paystack last year.\n\nMFS Africa was founded in 2009 by Dare Okoudjou, a Beninese national, while Nigeria-born Abudu started Capricorn in 2014, with Folu Majekodunmi. The acquisition creates a larger, more versatile company that fuses interoperability between money operators and a super-agent network reaching the mass market.\n\nA pan-African march\n\nMFS Africa\u2019s big vision is to have a presence in all 54 African countries, serving 500 million people and millions of small businesses, according to Okoudjou.\n\n\u201cIf you have a phone or POS, it should be enough to transact with the rest of Africa and the world,\u201d he tells TechCabal. \u201cWe\u2019re building the foremost, currency-agnostic, real-time hub for payments on the continent, to enable people transfer money the way they can call each other.\u201d\n\nOften, MFS Africa\u2019s continental expansion plan has involved partnering with money operators and making minority investments in other fintech companies across Africa, as in the case of Julaya, Maviance, and Numida.\n\nHowever, Okoudjou explains that the company opts for full acquisition when both parties consider that more effective for achieving their shared long-term ambitions.\n\nDare Okoudjou, MFS Africa founder and CEO (left) and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Baxi.\n\nWhy an acquisition?\n\nSimilar to Beyonic, a Ugandan fintech startup MFS Africa bought in June 2020 also for an undisclosed amount, acquisition talks with Capricorn evolved from a minority investment to a full buyout.\n\n\u201cThe more we spoke with Dee, the more we realised what we could achieve with a full acquisition instead of being only investors in which case there could be misaligned incentives.\u201d\n\nOkoudjou further explains that the need to \u201cbolster our presence in Nigeria\u201d given its unique market features\u2014the prevalence of offline payment touchpoints over mobile-first transactions\u2014drove MFS Africa\u2019s interest in Capricorn.\n\n\u201cIn other markets, one or two partnerships with mobile money operators could see us reach 60% of digital payment users in the country,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, mobile money isn\u2019t that widely adopted in Nigeria. Instead, agent networks such as Capricorn\u2019s have grown rapidly.\u201d\n\nWhile MFS Africa can service SMEs online through Beyonic, for instance, Baxi enables the company to reach offline merchants in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nFor Abudu, the future of the mobile payments landscape in Africa is a game of few, where consolidation is the way forward, and attempting to scale alone would require more capital expenditure and a longer time to execute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to partner with a company that brings a real pan-African presence and we see synergies across our operations. They offer a wide range of value-added products and services like cross-border payments while we have access to SMEs in Nigeria, one of the biggest markets in Africa,\u201d he says. \u201cWe believe that we\u2019ve barely scratched the market\u2019s potential. The deal brings many things that allow us to grow very quickly.\u201d\n\nFollowing the acquisition\u2019s close, MFS Africa will build Baxi into a key node on its digital payment network, allowing customers to make cross-border payments to and from Nigeria, similar to what it\u2019s done with mobile money operators across Africa. MFS Africa will also expand Baxi\u2019s proposition for offline SMEs to select markets within its footprint.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to build a large business with relatively small capital but now we want to be able to compete, not just in Nigeria but also across Africa,\u201d Abudu says. \u201cThe deal with MFS Africa gives us leverage to take Baxi and the model that\u2019s been so successful in Nigeria to other African countries.\u201d\n\nMFS Africa plans to engage with Nigeria\u2019s central bank and other regulators to seek any other additional licenses needed to operate its full-service offerings\u2014such as remittance, micro-lending, insurance\u2014while also exploring commercial partnerships in the country.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Editi Effiong: father, writer, producer and tech bro",
          "text": "Editi Effiong\u2019s genius is quiet yet obvious at the same time. He\u2019s a multifaceted creator, builder and thinker\u2014unafraid to tackle the impossible without doubt. From setting up Anakle, a Nigeria-based digital marketing agency, 10 years ago to transitioning into film-making a few years later, Editi has established himself as one of the leading entrepreneurs of his generation. When asked how he would define himself, he responded with, \u201cI\u2019m a father, writer, producer, and tech bro.\n\nThe big picture: Editi Effiong is not your average guy\n\nMany people know Editi Effiong as the brains behind Anakle. Some others might know him for the films he made through his production company, Anakle Films or might have stumbled across him after his involvement in the post-#ENDSARS judicial hearing panel in 2020. Editi attended and documented the daily proceedings, sharing videos, photos and commentaries on his Twitter page. His dedication to reporting on how Lagos State investigated the unforgettable event that took place on October 20 last year, garnered him respect, admiration and a flock of new followers and cheerleaders.\n\nAnakle Films\u2019 theatrical releases, Up North and The Setup, were acquired by Netflix in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Up North, which was based on a story written by Editi, is best described as one of Nollywood\u2019s most adventurous films. Up North did two things successfully: It brought some versatility to Nollywood, Nigeria\u2019s behemoth movie industry; and heralded the arrival of a different Editi. He was no longer just the CEO of a well-respected digital agency with a client list that most marketing agencies would love to get their hands on\u2014Wikipedia, Flutterwave, Glo, to name a few\u2014he was now a film producer and writer who took his craft seriously.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi at a filming location in Northern Nigeria\n\nThe Set Up pulled us in a different direction. In this film, there are no adventures or lush, green fields. But there\u2019s suspense and the dirty underworld of crime. Anakle Films distributed The Set Up with legendary film-maker, Niyi Akinmolayan, sitting on the director\u2019s chair.\n\nEditi displayed his writing chops in his most recent short film, Fishbone, released in May 2020. Fishbone, written and directed by Effiong himself, unearths the terrifying business of counterfeit drugs and how it strips our society of its ability to show love and compassion. Fishbone is a deliberately revealing film; it shows us snapshots of Effiong\u2019s mind and showcases his directorial ingenuity.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with TechCabal, Editi opens up about his childhood, the complexity that is his mind, building Anakle, being a father, and his decision to become a full-time film-maker and writer.\n\nAnakle and the race to get businesses online\n\nEven though Editi is eager to hand over the CEO reins to Anakle\u2019s COO, Munachi \u201cMuna\u201d Nwoke-Ekpo, and purposefully step into his role as founder and CEO of Anakle Films, I was compelled to kick off the interview with questions about Anakle\u2019s beginnings.\n\nIn 2011, digital marketing didn\u2019t have as much clout as it does now. It is hard to imagine a world that didn\u2019t exist with numerous digital and social media platforms. Our current economic climate demands that entrepreneurs move their businesses online and acquire a new crop of customers who are obsessed with social media and consumer technology. In conversation, Editi is a masterful storyteller who uses transparency and humour to pull his listeners in. At no point during our chat did he leave me feeling confused or unimpressed.\n\nKoromone Koroye: What inspired you to start Anakle? What did you see and understand about digital marketing that most people didn\u2019t back in 2011?\n\nEditi Effiong: Back in 2011, we had a slide that predicted that internet penetration would deepen in five years. We also predicted that more than five million Nigerians would be on the internet and that that number would eventually rise to 30 million by 2016. Back then, mobile penetration wasn\u2019t that great and Blackberry phones were still a thing. My business partner, Abass, would charge business owners \u20a650,000 to help them run digital marketing campaigns. And that 50K came with a money-back guarantee: if we weren\u2019t able to successfully promote their brands, they got their money back without any hassles. I mean, how on earth does someone believe that the internet can help you sell more? But we saw that there was a market online and we bet big on what we saw.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: According to the Digital 2021 report, there were an estimated 104 million internet users in Nigeria in January this year. Additionally, internet penetration stood at 50% and 33 million Nigerians with active social media accounts, within that same period.\n\nDo you remember Anakle\u2019s first major campaign?\n\nEditi: In 2010, we ran Interswitch\u2019s first digital campaign. We did this whole flash animation video to push Interswitch\u2019s anti-fraud campaign. I designed the flash. In the early stages of Anakle\u2019s business, I was in charge of execution and Abass handled business operations. So, in this flash animated campaign, if someone emails you for your password or PIN, you don\u2019t give them because Interswitch would never ask you for your PIN or personal information. It was a really great campaign at that time. I mean now, we might take a simple campaign like that for granted; but 12 years ago, building and executing a campaign like that was a phenomenal experience for us and the brands we served during that period.\n\nHow did businesses relate with social media back when Anakle started out?\n\nEditi: \u200b\u200bThe first bank to get on social media was GTB (Guaranty Trust Bank) followed by Diamond Bank. We worked on a project with them and they had their brand assets burned onto a CD. Yes, CDs were a thing back then. But, anyway, they opted for the CD route because they didn\u2019t want anyone to distribute their assets to other sources or agencies. So I picked up Diamond Bank\u2019s CD on a Tuesday and started working on it straight till Thursday. And Thursday happened to be my wedding day.\n\nWoah. You did client work on your wedding day?\n\nEditi: Yes! I was out in the foyer of the hotel room working on this project until I got called into the hall to say my vows and, you know, get married. So I put down my laptop, you know, went and got married and came back and continued working even through my honeymoon. And to think that this was only the second bank that we helped build a Facebook app and get them on social media. Diamond Bank was the second bank in Nigeria to go down the digital marketing route.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, there was a huge opportunity to help businesses get online. And one of the things Anakle was trying to do was help smaller businesses improve brand visibility by getting them acquainted with the internet. We didn\u2019t just target the big brands and enterprise businesses, especially in the beginning. Anakle saw the future of digital marketing and built a business out of it. Our mission was to help businesses grow into the online space, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nAt what point did you realise that Anakle had fulfilled its mission, or at least a part of it?\n\nEditi: There have been many moments. In 2017 we did a very successful campaign with Wikipedia. And that campaign was a forerunner to what became Anakle films. That campaign counted as a major milestone for us. There\u2019s also the part we played in hiring and training people who were new to the digital marketing space. For most of them, Anakle was their first job out of school, and now, most of them are running their own successful companies and projects. You know, making money and growing a company are necessary targets, but I\u2019ve always been more excited about mentoring people and helping them grow in the industry and become better versions of themselves even outside of the work they do at Anakle or anywhere else.\n\nIf our business no longer inspired the people who walked through its doors, then we have failed at our mission. So I get really excited when I see consistent growth in the people who walk through our doors; they come in, grow and become more than they thought they could be before they joined the company.\n\nWhat were Anakle\u2019s hiring values in the beginning? And did those values change after the business grew and garnered success?\n\nEditi: We were looking for people who had the \u2018Anakle spirit\u2019, which is a certain level of fearlessness. We wanted people who could work without fear. I didn\u2019t care too much about CVs and cover letters. We were looking for people who could challenge us; people who could look at the universe as it is and ultimately try to bend it. Because when people are able to challenge the status quo and say, \u201cI can take that on\u201d, then they can create a fire campaign for Sterling Bank or any other enterprise client.\n\nEditi Effiong\n\nHow did you delight Anakle\u2019s early employees?\n\nEditi: I\u2019ll be honest: Back then, we couldn\u2019t compete with Nigerian banks and their salary offerings and other benefits. so we ended up designing a workplace that was exciting. We wanted young people to feel excited about working for us and working out of our office. The Anakle office became our recruitment tool and it was so inspiring to hear people say they wanted to work with us, especially after visiting our office.\n\nNew beginnings: Anakle Films and the road to becoming a director, screenwriter, and producer\n\nKoromone: Moving swiftly along from building Anakle to setting up Anakle films\u2014\n\nEditi: Thank God!\n\nWhen did you know you were ready to make the move?\n\nEditi: Money! I had the money to make that leap of faith into Anakle Films.\n\nSo, how did it feel making that transition from running Anakle to leading the charge at Anakle films? Especially knowing that you were going to put a lot of time and effort into building out Anakle Films\u2019 brand?\n\nEditi: I think the biggest factor there is having a team that can do its job\u2014big props to Munachi. If you\u2019ve never heard of Muna, he\u2019s the best COO in the business. He\u2019s quiet but hard-working and has been with me for 11 years. Muna has done an amazing job at running the business at a group level, and having him around has been extremely helpful and instrumental. I recently received and turned down a global leadership position at a global company\u2014a fantastic offer with great pay\u2014but I turned it down because I wanted the freedom to wake up and do what I love doing or to not do something I hate doing. There\u2019s a madness to having that freedom that works for me. And I think I owe a lot of that to Muna. He gave me the courage to step out of Anakle.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi directing a film at a location in Nigeria\n\nTell us about your history and relationship with writing\n\nEditi: This isn\u2019t common knowledge, but I didn\u2019t start writing today. I\u2019ve been writing my entire life. I was also an avid reader when I was younger. My father studied literature and linguistics, so there were a lot of books around the house. I write almost every day and have written almost every day for my entire life. And when I cannot put into words things I want to say, I end up writing them down. I have hardly ever gotten in trouble for writing because I\u2019m able to articulate my thoughts without ambiguity. Wow! I just used a big word.\n\nMy move to Anakle Films is my way of preparing for retirement. I want to retire as a writer. My entire life is run by writing and this is the direction it is headed now. Anakle Films is my excuse to write; it gives me a reason to write, create and build something from the ground up. As you can imagine, there\u2019s a lot of craziness and madness around the work, but I love it.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Ambiguity is a situation or statement that is unclear because it can be understood in more than one way. [Source: Cambridge dictionary]\n\nEditi on documenting justice for #EndSars victims and survivors and finding his voice again\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: A few months after the #ENDSARS massacre, Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu set up a nine-person Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate allegations of police brutality perpetuated by the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Lagos State. This part of my conversation with Editi struck a raw nerve for the both of us, especially for Editi who had to restrain his emotions while he answered my questions. I think it takes a lot of courage to document the truth in the midst of pain and grief.\n\nKoromone: Let\u2019s pivot and talk about 2020. How did you find yourself involved in the #EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry that sat in Lagos? A number of people don\u2019t know this, but you were shooting a film during that period.\n\nEditi: Yes, I was. When I couldn\u2019t attend sessions, I was on set. When I was a kid, I used to stutter. And, you know, I managed it through my teenage years until it went away. After October 2020, my stutter returned. I stutter a lot these days, especially when I\u2019m dealing with difficult situations. So if you pay attention when I speak, you will hear how slow and deliberate I am with my words. I speak slowly to avoid stuttering, and everytime I think about what went down during #EndSars, it messes up my speech.\n\nThe night of the shootings, I could hear the gunshots. And I was going to drive out there because our people were bleeding and needed help, but my wife said, \u201cNo, you cannot go. It is too dangerous.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t go, and that night, I couldn\u2019t speak at all. For hours, I could not say a word. Anytime I tried to say a word, something came up from inside me and blocked off my speech. And since then, I\u2019ve been managing a very bad stutter that comes and goes\u2014but mostly only comes when I\u2019m dealing with difficult subjects. And in the days following October 20, I felt nothing but numbness. Going to those panel sessions was kind of a metaphor for trying to find my voice again.\n\nFor a few weeks following the shootings, I couldn\u2019t speak properly, and writing about the sessions was my way of speaking and reconnecting with the voice I had lost.\n\nShare this article\n\nKoromone Koroye | Author",

          "title": "Who\u2019s afraid of crypto-salaries?",
          "text": "Like most Nigerian workers, Kola*, at his former job, used to be paid his salary in the country\u2019s official currency: the naira\u2014until he started working at a fintech company registered outside Nigeria. Now he gets paid in USD Coin (USDC), a Stablecoin tethered to the US dollar. With this switch in his salary\u2019s currency, Kola was offered a juicy opportunity to exit a quagmire many young Nigerians find themselves in: they make more money than their parents did but in a currency that has fallen so low their paycheck doesn\u2019t reflect in their purchasing power.\n\nNigeria, like many African countries, grapples with currency risk. Back in 2015, its current president, Muhammadu Buhari, campaigned on a promise to increase the value of the naira. But since the start of his presidency, the country\u2019s currency has plunged badly because demand for the dollar continues to outstrip supply. This plunge in the value of the naira has been majorly fueled by Nigeria importing more goods than it exports. With declining oil prices forcing the Nigerian government to devalue its official currency twice in the past year, and by roughly 35% over the past five years, the resultant inflation has thrown over 7 million people into poverty in 2020 alone, according to the World Bank.\n\nSince saving in naira is a dead plan, more Nigerians now save their earnings in foreign currencies. Data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) revealed that Nigeria had a total domiciliary account balance of \u20a66.566 trillion as of March 2021, and when this figure is converted to dollars at the official rate of \u20a6410 per dollar, it translates to about $16 billion.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nVolatile naira drives Nigerians to digital currencies\n\nNigeria\u2019s weak currency has pushed its citizens into saving their money in foreign currencies, for wealth and value preservation. But even this is in limbo because uncertainties rule the country\u2019s financial regulatory climate. Nigeria\u2019s CBN has a long history of clamping down on individuals, groups and companies it suspects of being responsible for the slump in the value of the naira. Out of nowhere, the CBN banned the sale of foreign currencies to bureau de change operators\u2014also called the parallel or black market\u2014in the country, accusing them of creating an artificial foreign exchange scarcity. It also threatened to go after abokiFX, a website that collates the black market foreign exchange rates daily, asserting that there is only one acceptable exchange rate: the Investors\u2019 and Exporters\u2019 FX Window.\n\nThis has made a lot of people apprehensive, especially those with funds in their domiciliary accounts. Their fears were heightened after Ibrahim Obanikoro, a member of parliament, suggested in a tweet that the CBN close all domiciliary accounts for the next year.\n\nIn addition to saving in foreign currencies, Nigerians have turned to cryptocurrencies\u2014digital currencies that are out of the reach of federal government control.\n\nThis newfound hunger for cryptocurrency has seen Nigeria emerge as the leading country, per capita, for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption in the world, according to a report by Statista\u2014despite government crackdown. In fact, the African continent has been the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency in the world. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 billion worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. For context, sub-Saharan Africa received an estimated $48 billion worth of remittances in 2019, about half of which went to Nigeria, according to a Brookings Institute study. Between July 2019 and June 2020, the volume of cryptocurrencies sent to Africa from outside the continent was the highest of all regions Chainalysis studied. With 96% of the crypto value coming from outside the continent, this suggests that more Africans are receiving remittances via crypto.\n\nDigital money is the future of finance\n\nIn February this year, the CBN placed a ban on cryptocurrency in the country when it directed banks to close the accounts of persons or entities involved in cryptocurrency transactions. At the time, the Nigerian apex bank claimed that cryptocurrencies and digital currencies were largely used in terrorism financing and money laundering, citing the anonymity of their transactions.\n\nBut months after that, the government, seeing it couldn\u2019t quench the fire of cryptocurrency in the country, bet on digital money as the future by launching a central bank digital currency (CBDCs) named eNaira and nicknamed \u201cProject Giant\u201d.\n\nDigital money like cryptocurrencies, CBDCs and Stablecoins will play a significant role in the future of financial services. Cryptocurrency is gaining worldwide acceptance; Stablecoin, a peculiar type of cryptocurrency, has been labelled the \u201cfuture of money\u201d by the Harvard Business Review; and all these are in direct competition with CBDCs.\n\nRest of World reported on how Stablecoins have found a use case in volatile markets like Nigeria, where CBN\u2019s regulations force Nigerians to spend limited amounts of US dollars via their dollar cards each month. In order to bypass this limitation, Nigerians have switched to using Stablecoins to make their payments.\n\nStablecoins, such as the Tether (USDT), Binance USD (BUSD) and USD Coin (USDC) are a form of cryptocurrency pegged to a traditional asset like the US dollar or gold. In sub-Saharan Africa, Stablecoin remittances can be up to 20 times cheaper than traditional money transfers. USDT and USDC transfer fees are often as low as 0\u20131%. Paxful, a leading cryptocurrency trading platform in the country, declares that 1.5 million Nigerian users, representing about 5% of the platform\u2019s trading volume, use USDT, the most popular Stablecoin.\n\nThere is a growing adoption of Stablecoins like $DAI, $USDT, $BUSD and $USDC in Nigeria. Unlike such cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are notorious for their volatility, Stablecoin, like CBDCs, is a non-interest coin. Stablecoins have seen rapid growth this year, with USDC, the second-largest Stablecoin in the world, reaching a market capitalisation of over $30 billion.\n\nSalary alert\u2026but in crypto\n\nJust like Olaf Carlson-Wee, Coinbase\u2019s first employee who was paid entirely in Bitcoin, as far back as 2013, for three years, Nigerians also want to be paid in crypto.\n\nEarlier this year, in July, Timi Ajiboye, CEO and CTO of Helicarrier (formerly Buycoins), announced that the company\u2019s employees would now be paid in USDC. Twitter went agog, with many presenting themselves to Ajiboye for employment at his company.\n\nIn a process Kola describes as \u201cseamless\u201d when he receives his salary in USDC, he converts to naira only the amount he plans to spend for the week. \u201cI don\u2019t withdraw my full salary at once because you never know what the exchange rate will be tomorrow. So, even if waiting would add \u20a6500 to my salary, I\u2019d rather wait than withdraw all at once and have the naira in my account drop in value between when I withdraw it and when I spend it.\u201d\n\nKola says he can convert his crypto, using his company\u2019s product, a cryptocurrency trading app, within two hours. He is unbothered by persistent news around the steady drop of the naira. He isn\u2019t completely insulated from the naira crash, though, as a Nigerian living in Nigeria. But, he notes: \u201cAt least my salary\u2019s value isn\u2019t dropping as fast as it would have if I was earning in naira.\u201d\n\nA colleague of Kola\u2019s, Deji*, who receives his base pay and benefits in USDC as well, reveals that all employees were kept in the loop right from when the company decided that that was the route it would take regarding employee compensation. As a fintech company, there was no need to convince anyone on the team about how Stablecoins would protect them from the steady fall of the naira.\n\nThe problem with crypto-salaries\n\nAt Kola\u2019s company, individual contract staff, who make up a majority of its workers, are responsible for remitting their taxes. To help the employee with this process, an internal document containing information on tax and pension calculations and payments has been circulated around the company. This is the company battling the challenge that comes with paying employees in crypto, as legal barriers in many countries prevent this. Some of the barriers include the non-recognition of cryptocurrency as a legal tender and the challenge of calculating taxes when employees are paid in cryptocurrency.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019s still risky to pay employees in crypto in the US because the currency is recognised by the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) as a property and not a legal tender. A piece of legislation, the Fair Labour Standards Act\u2014a major custodian of employee rights\u2014backs this position. The act states that employees must be paid in \u201ccash or negotiable instrument payable at par\u201d.\n\nWhile legal systems around the world need more time to develop regulations that cater for crypto adoption, US-based Coinbase announced last week that it is launching a new direct deposit service, \u201cGet paid in crypto,\u201d that will let nearly anyone in the US receive all or part of their wages in cryptocurrencies. There are high hopes for the success of this rollout because if even a fraction of Coinbase\u2019s millions of US customers sign up, the service will contribute, in no small way, to making crypto mainstream in the broader American workforce.\n\nSome countries are already making progress with creating laws that define the payment of workers in cryptocurrency. For example, since 2019, New Zealand has made it legal to receive salaries in cryptocurrency and be taxed accordingly.\n\nBut in Nigeria, paying employees in crypto remains illegal. Nigeria\u2019s primary legislation on the relationship between an employer and employees, the Nigerian Labour Act\u2014established in 2004\u2014renders any contract where part or all of a worker\u2019s wages is made payable in another manner apart from legal tender illegal, null and void.\n\nDespite these legal constraints, Nigerian employers in technology startups continue to make smart moves to create value for their employees and the move towards remunerating employees in crypto is one that\u2019s unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\n*Names have been changed.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nSultan Quadri | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I spoke with Charles Isidi \u2014 a growth marketing expert and digital media and marketing communications professional \u2014 over the phone, both of us stuttering to varying degrees as we discussed stuttering, words from a 2001 R&B song came back to me.\n\nWithout bogging you down with details, the chorus goes, \u201cI can tell you\u2019re lying, because when you\u2019re replying, stutter, stutters, stutter, stutters.\u201d\n\nLovers of R&B know that in the rest of the song, Joseph Lewis Thomas, known mononymously as Joe, suspected his partner was cheating on him. Yes, he smelt cologne. Yes, she didn\u2019t pick up when he called. But, his strongest point was that she stuttered when answering his questions about her whereabouts.\n\nAnd therein lies a major misconception: people stutter when they are lying. Twenty-one years later, the chorus of that song still forms the basis of many people\u2019s interactions with stutterers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone with a slight stutter, I\u2019d be irked if people conclude I\u2019m fibbing because I can\u2019t get my words out coherently or quickly enough (for them). And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone.\n\nSadly, being branded a liar because of a stutter is just one of the issues we stutterers face.\n\nStuttering in a tech-enabled world\n\nOne can be forgiven for thinking that there is a tech solution somewhere that does away with stuttering. Stuttering has no known cure, and the best technology can currently do is what therapy does \u2014 treat or manage the condition like other speech defects.\n\nPeople can get the most out of treatment if they address stuttering early enough \u2014 preferably as children. Treatment at any age seeks to improve speech fluency while simultaneously building the stutterer\u2019s confidence, thus helping them participate in school, work, and social settings.\n\nExpectedly, tech interventions exist, with many applications \u2014 Balbus Speech, Smarty Ears, and Stamurai (I like this name), to mention a few \u2014 for smartphones and tablets to help people with stuttering.\n\nStamurai, for instance, is a mobile app available on Google Play Store and the App Store. With the app, people learn and practice speech therapy exercises for stuttering. The best result they can get, however, is improved speech control.\n\nIn a world where social media is the go-to for content, many creators generate content from people\u2019s challenges for their jokes. Mildly put, this is insensitive and hurtful, and Charles strongly believes that people should be kinder to not only stutterers but everyone dealing with a disability.\n\nNumbers don\u2019t lie\n\nAccording to The Stuttering Foundation, stuttering affects 1% of the world\u2019s population; depending on what global population you accept, that\u2019s 78 or 79 million people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer a paper on the International Stuttering Association website titled, Increasing Stuttering Awareness in Africa, 11% of children in Africa \u2014 nearly 6.5 million \u2014 of pre-school age (between 2 and 5 years of age) stutter. About 20% or 1.3 million of these children are at the risk of developing chronic stuttering in adult life, and approximately one million school-age children and over ten million adults stutter in Africa.\n\nScience trumps mythology\n\nAcross Africa, traditional beliefs about stuttering abound, varying from one location to the next.\n\nIn South Africa, for instance, stuttering is believed to result from leaving a baby out in the rain, failing to inform ancestors of imminent childbirth, emotional trauma, and tickling a baby too much, among others.\n\nThe remedies for stuttering in these circles border on the hilarious, from standing in front of a mirror and speaking to oneself, to eating a fruit pecked by a bird, and maintaining correct posture, to mention a few.\n\nThankfully, science has provided clarity \u2014 for those ready to accept it \u2014 about the causes of stuttering.\n\nAccording to DoSomething.org, stuttering (or stammering, if you will) is a speech disorder that breaks up a speaker\u2019s flow of speech. A biological and neurological condition, it is caused by one or more of four possible triggers, the first being genetics, and the others, child development, the make-up of the brain, and family dynamics.\n\nFor some reason, stuttering is more common in boys than girls. Consequently, it tends to persist into adulthood more often in boys.\n\nOngoing research shows that people who stutter appear to process speech and language differently than those who don\u2019t. And while children with speech problems or developmental delays are more likely to stutter, strokes and traumatic brain injuries can also contribute to stuttering in adults.\n\nIt would be remiss of me to proceed without stating that proponents of traditional African ideologies about stuttering are right about emotional trauma having an impact; however, they\u2019d probably struggle to explain how. But science has shown that families with fast-paced lifestyles, high expectations, and emotional trauma often have stutterers.\n\nBeyond words; into the mind\n\nOther physical senses somewhat compensate for the loss of any sense, and so the blind, for instance, have keener senses of smell and hearing.\n\nPeople who struggle to speak often fill the vocal expression gap with writing, artwork, and other predominantly non-vocal forms of communication. Mostly, however, writing does it.\n\nFun fact: Isaac Newton stuttered throughout his life.\n\nFor Charles, who has stuttered for as long as he can remember, writing as early as seven has been a valuable alternative to sharing his experiences and documenting his thoughts.\n\nSpeaking about misconceptions he\u2019s had to deal with, he said, \u201cGrowing up in a country like Nigeria where people don\u2019t approach stuttering from a scientific point of view, you either get pity from people, or they assume you have anger issues.\u201d\n\nChioma, a recent mass communications graduate, shares Charles\u2019 thoughts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learnt over time that I\u2019m okay; there\u2019s nothing incredibly wrong with me.\u201d\n\nPutting it succinctly, Charles said, \u201cstutterers are simply audibly different from other people, and that shouldn\u2019t be an indictment on capability or anything else for that matter,\u201d and with the right support systems in place from people, workspaces, and other social touchpoints, they can control their stutters, but even more, feel safe to be someone who stutters.\n\n\u201cHaving understanding parents helped me a lot; they shielded me from people who had the worst to say about me. The support of my extended relatives was also a good thing,\u201d he continued.\n\nAnother misconception people have is that stutterers bottle things up and are impatient. So they are often encouraged to speak up.\n\nHolders of the belief that stutterers don\u2019t know what they want to say often complete their sentences for them, suggesting words and phrases that they think express the thoughts in the speakers\u2019 minds. Interestingly, they are not always right, and Charles couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, my parents never completed my sentences; they were always patient enough for me to get my words out. But in my experience as an adult, people try to finish my sentences or, as they think they\u2019re doing, help me out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfair to do this because you\u2019re more or less saying \u2018I\u2019m helping you because you\u2019re incapable of doing this on your own,\u2019 and that\u2019s not true. All that\u2019s required of listeners is a bit of patience.\u201d\n\nResearch by Leila Cherif and other members of the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Hedi Chaker Hospital and University of Sfax, Tunisia, shows that \u201cstuttering children (SC) are perceived negatively by peers and are rejected by peers more often than children who do not stutter. SC are often exposed to negative social experiences with both their peers and families such [as] teasing and bullying. These problems interfere negatively with self-esteem (SE) development and anxiety levels.\u201d\n\nConsequently, stutterers\u2019 personalities are shaped by their experiences and interactions with people wherever they go.\n\n\u201cStuttering has shaped my personality; I\u2019m reserved, and I don\u2019t say anything around strangers unless it\u2019s necessary because I don\u2019t like being asked to repeat myself. It\u2019s hard to express my feelings, so, rather than talk, I write down my thoughts,\u201d Chioma submitted.\n\nBeing sensitive to the issues people face is a no-brainer, yes? Unfortunately, it isn\u2019t in some circles.\n\nA very Nigerian challenge is comedians joking about people\u2019s speech difficulties, such that rather than being given room for expression, they become the butt of jokes.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the comedians; the audiences who find these jokes funny are the people with whom stutterers have to interact daily during their commutes, at work, at home, everywhere.\n\nRegardless of what they say, no one likes to be laughed at. So I was not surprised at how emphatically Chioma responded when asked if she would be open to trying out something to help with her stuttering.\n\n\u201cABSOLUTELY, I would like to speak without it looking like I have hot yam in my mouth.\u201d\n\nCharles, however, had different thoughts.\n\n\u201cA philosophy in support circles is do not do anything for anyone that they are capable of doing for themselves, it\u2019s a form of theft of people\u2019s responsibilities.\n\n\u201cAt this point in my life, having a speech defect is an important structure around which my life is built. I won\u2019t exactly say that taking that away is wrong. Stuttering or any disability adds to a person\u2019s humanity in a sense, and I don\u2019t know what kind of world we would have if we cannot feel the way others feel.\n\n\u201cTo take away a disability from someone who has likely lived this way all their lives is to level the playing field for them knowing that they didn\u2019t start the race at the same time. And I think that\u2019s unfair.\n\n\u201cInstead of taking it away with tech or medical intervention, I\u2019d rather create a world where people are kinder to those who function differently from how people typically act.\u201d\n\nInternational Stuttering Awareness Day (ISAD), or International Stammering Awareness Day, is a day set aside to raise awareness of the issues faced by millions of people who stutter or stammer. It is celebrated annually on October 22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecious Mogoli Website I love love and a little peace and quiet.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In 2021, over 1 million people registered to take the Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) exams in Nigeria. This is a compulsory test that determines qualification for entrance into a Nigerian university. But, it continues.\n\nAfter JAMB, students undergo another test from their chosen universities. These processes are one-off. If they don\u2019t pass, most young people have to reapply the following year. Some schools have the direct entry option but with the same level of uncertainty\u2014the ones who can leave the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis cycle thrives because of low spending power, lack of options, and the tendency to acknowledge skill or relevance based on a university degree. This lack of degree options and the scarcity of developers is what TalentQL is looking to solve with AltSchool.\n\nFounded by Adewale Yusuf, Opeyemi Awoyemi, and Akintunde Sultan, TalentQL launched in November 2020 as a talent pipeline to connect developers with jobs. On Thursday, October 21, 2021, AltSchool was launched.\n\nWhat is AltSchool? It is a 9-month mentorship and upskilling program to train entry-level developers. Open to everyone above age 16, no technical background is required. Participants receive a diploma in Software Engineering and a three-month internship opportunity upon completion.\n\nThere\u2019s more: TalentQL launches AltSchool Africa to train entry level tech talent for free\n\nSo you care about your privacy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Visual Content Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nUnder the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) 2019, all citizens have several rights over their personal data.

With two decades of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) experience, Toyin Akintayo acutely understands this struggle. And with the help of his team, he decided to build BIZ301 to help entrepreneurs digitise small businesses operations.\n\nThink of a platform that manages expenses and budgets, invoices, employee and payroll management, helpdesk, and facility management applications.

On Thursday, October 21, 2021, Brass, a Nigerian digital bank, announced $1.7 million in funding to aid their growth across Africa. The raise saw participation from US-based early-stage investors, Hustle Funds, Acuity Ventures, Ventures Platform, and Uncovered Fund.\n\nProminent ecosystem individuals like Flutterwave\u2019s Co-founder, Olugbenga \u2018GB\u2019 Agboola, and Paystack\u2019s Co-founder, Ezra Olubi, also participated in this round.\n\nWhat does Brass do? Sola Akindolu, ex-Head of Products at Nigerian fintech, Kudi, and Emmanuel Okeke, ex-Engineering Manager at Paystack, launched Brass in July 2020 to provide SMEs with banking services and help business owners have control over their money operations.\n\nCurrently, the platform provides SMEs with various services, including payroll and expense management, credit and payment services, and API support.\n\nBrass has reportedly served thousands of businesses from schools to restaurants and malls, with a customer portfolio that includes platforms like Mono and Eden.\n\nThey claim to have disbursed $2 million in credit via their crediting platform, Brass Capital, which is still in the Beta phase.\n\nWhere are the funds going? With this raise, the startup is looking to scale and improve upon its products. Already, they have completed incorporation in Kenya and are looking to do the same in South Africa. By 2022, they want to launch in both countries fully.\n\nThe big picture is to develop innovative products that offer all-inclusive banking solutions in Africa.\n\nNeobanks spree? With the number of Business to Customers (B2C), and Business to Business (B2B) neobanks like PayHippo, Prospa, and Sparkle already offering similar services, one wonders what makes Brass different. Per TechCrunch, Akindolu shares that the company\u2019s focus is financial operations and cash flow support for SMEs.\n\nIn case you missed it on Techpoint Africa\n\nTechpoint Awards 2021: Nominate your favourite startups, influencers, and investors.

          "title": "IHS Towers: How a bad bet on GSM became a $7bn company",
          "text": "Issam Darwish, the founder/CEO of IHS Towers, was all smiles following the successful listing of his company on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, October 14, but it was not always that way.\n\nHe could hardly have summoned the same smile in 1999 when his first bet on Nigeria\u2019s telecoms sector fell through.\n\nCelia Motophone Limited, a communications company he was brought from Lebanon to lead as deputy managing director at the time, was among the companies granted licences to provide GSM network services in Nigeria by General Abdulsalam Abubakar, the then Military Head of State who was pushing to deregulate the Nigerian telecoms sector.\n\nOut of the six companies that got the licences, only Motophone and Communications Investment Limited (CIL) were firmly on the ground. Both were however unable to secure the needed interconnection with NITEL, the only national gateway carrier. Motophone also had an image problem: it was connected to the Gilbert Chagouri family that was very close to the late military dictator, General Sani Abacha.\n\nIt was not a surprise then when President Olusegun Obasanjo, who led the democratic dispensation in Nigeria from 1999, described the licensing exercise as fraudulent, revoked the licences, and introduced the telecommunication policy that empowered the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to reorganise, auction, and issue fresh licences to successful companies.\n\nDarwish, 27 years old at the time, and his company Motophone were again shortlisted among the seven contenders for the new licensing regime. The other contenders were United Telesys, Reliance Telecoms, CIL, MTS, NITEL, and MTN. Motophone was eventually disqualified after a series of court orders and allegations by NCC that the company may have manipulated its way to the first licence. The NCC removed the rights of Motophone before the auction. Eventually, five companies were shortlisted for the four GSM licences.\n\nRead Also: IHS bucks trend, opts for sole listing in New York\n\nDown on his luck but undaunted, the young Lebanese entrepreneur decided to place his bet in a different segment of the nascent telecoms industry \u2013 building and operating towers.\n\nThat new bet proved to be genius. By listing on the New York Stock Exchange in chase of a valuation of $7 billion, IHS Towers has not only become the largest tower company in Africa it is also now more valuable than MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa both of which got the GSM licences.\n\nThe making of IHS Towers\n\nPrior to the emergence of IHS Towers, telecoms services in Nigeria under NITEL had suffered due to scarcity of base stations. The national carrier not only monopolised the market, but it also installed and operated the base stations. As of 1995, there were only 3,000 lines and three base stations in Lagos State. Between 1995 and 1999, the total number of connected fixed lines grew rapidly to about 550,000 while cellular lines were 40,000.\n\nDespite international initiatives and worthy objectives, Nigeria, with a population of over 120 million at the time, had in the year 2000 one of the lowest teledensity rates in the world at 0.38 percent.\n\nIt was also a period when the county\u2019s peers in Africa were beginning to take deregulation seriously and getting results for initiating the process.\n\nHence, in the late 1990s some African countries, such as Ghana, Uganda, and Zimbabwe, started issuing new cellular telephony licences. This led to dramatic increases in teledensities.\n\nFor example, the number of cellular subscribers in Zimbabwe increased from 20,000 to 150,000 in the 12 months before August 1999, whereas the number of fixed lines hovered around 250,000 over the same period. In Uganda the number of mobile subscribers overtook the number of fixed lines in July 1999, less than 10 months after MTN Uganda (the largest cellular operator in the country) started competing against MSI-Celtel.\n\nImportantly, the GSM licences went hand-in-hand with base tower increases. One report claimed that Darwish\u2019s company Motophone had installed towers in five Nigerian cities within seven months before having its licence revoked by the government.\n\nIn 2001, the same year MTN and Econet were granted their GSM licences, Issam Darwish together with his brother Mohamad Darwish and a friend William Saad founded IHS. IHS Holding Limited was however incorporated in the Republic of Mauritius under the Mauritian Companies Act 2001 as a private limited liability company. At the time, it was the only privately owned tower company in Nigeria.\n\nRunning IHS Towers\n\nIn the beginning, IHS Towers was building towers from scratch and operating them for telecom operators. While this proved to be a lucrative market for IHS, a lack of cooperation (and an excess of capital) meant many providers like MTN built their own towers without the proper planning to manage them.\n\nHence, despite being the only company providing exclusive tower services, IHS had to compete with the same operators it was seeking to serve.\n\nThe company soon realised there was more to gain from partnering and taking over existing towers than installing new ones.\n\nOperating a cell tower in a power-challenged country like Nigeria is a tug of war. Due to the unreliability of electricity, each cell tower requires two generators to keep it running for 24 hours plus a battery to serve as a backup. The company should also be able to guarantee diesel oil that feeds the generators.\n\nAlthough it was short on cash compared to the GSM providers, IHS had an advantage in that it was able to solve these problems from the beginning. Today, it is constantly seeking new innovation to further improve efficiency.\n\n\u201cThe energy situation in Nigeria hasn\u2019t changed much in 20 years, but we have learned new tactics,\u201d Darwish said in an interview this year.\n\n\u201cWe now use solar energy, smart batteries, and even wind; we are even testing a Tesla battery,\u201d Darwish said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2008 and the financial crisis that Darwish was able to convince the telecom operators in Nigeria of the value of cooperation. Before then, the company had in 2004 launched the Managed Services Operations for MNO-owned Towers with services including maintenance, security, and power supply.\n\nIn 2009, IHS began owning towers and leasing space to mobile network operators (MNOs) in Nigeria and launched its collocation operators through which it leased space to other MNOs. The big moments arrived when it sealed a deal to acquire MTN\u2019s tower assets. In 2014, IHS acquired a total of 10,966 towers out of which 4,154 came from MTN Nigeria and 2,116 towers from 9Mobile. It further acquired 4,696 towers from MTN Nigeria in 2015.\n\nRoad to IPO\n\n\u201cCongrats to longtime IFC client IHS Towers, the biggest operator of mobile phone towers in Africa, on its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange,\u201d tweeted Stephanies von Friedeburg, VP, Operations at the International Finance Corporation (IFC) on the day IHS finally rang the bell and went live on the global exchange at a price $17.65 per share.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge step for IHS in getting more communities across the continent connected. A proud moment for a great African company.\u201d\n\nApart from realising it needed collaboration to break the operational barriers in the telecom sector in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa, IHS also knew it needed unlimited access to liquidity to be able to provide the quality of service it was aiming for and control a sizable share of the market in Nigeria and Africa.\n\nShortly after increasing its tower portfolio in Nigeria, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Cameroon through acquisition, IHS completed a $2 billion equity round from investors such as IFC, Ecobank, Standard Chartered, and Investec. Darwish had said a substantial part of the money would go towards paying for its acquisitions, while the remainder would be spent on boosting its infrastructure in the five countries it operates in.\n\nDarwish had predicted that Africa could need 200,000 to 300,000 mobile towers with Nigeria alone needing 40,000 over a period of 10 years to meet the demand for broadband. This would require IHS raising more debt as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThings keep growing and evolving for us so we may come back to the market very soon,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2018, IHS, together with its shareholders including Goldman Sachs Group, Wendel, and MTN Group approached the New York Stock Exchange seeking to raise $1 billion at a valuation of $10 billion. The plan was postponed with reports citing the proximity of the 2019 general elections in Nigeria and the outcome of the sale of 9Mobile, a customer of IHS.\n\nWhile it waited, in 2019 the company refinanced outstanding debt of its Nigerian operations (approximately $1.8bn), including issuing $1.3 billion of new senior notes, as well as new senior credit facilities, resulting in a more simplified debt capital structure, extended maturities, and lower cost of debt. As of 2019, IHS had raised more than $5.5 billion in funding.\n\nIn terms of assets, IHS accounts for 16,522 towers of the 37,625 towers in Nigeria, representing almost 50 percent of the total in the market as of June 2021. It is also the number one tower provider in five markets where it operates in Africa and ranks fourth in the world.\n\nIHS goes public\n\nThe listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) went live at a share price of $17.65 for 1.6 million shares, or 16.0 percent below the IPO price, to value the company at about $5.8 billion. The stock has traded within a range of $16.83 to $18.48 since then.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased with the successful listing of IHS Towers, the fourth largest tower company globally.\n\n\u2018The listing gives MTN Group a strong liquidity platform that will support the Group\u2019s strategy of accelerating growth in its African markets, Ralph Mupita, MTN Group president/CEO, said\n\nApart from being the biggest customer of IHS, MTN owns a stake of 29 percent in the tower company. Following the listing, MTN now holds 85,176,719 ordinary shares.",

          "text": "Issam Darwish, the founder/CEO of IHS Towers, was all smiles following the successful listing of his company on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, October 14, but it was not always that way.\n\nHe could hardly have summoned the same smile in 1999 when his first bet on Nigeria\u2019s telecoms sector fell through.\n\nCelia Motophone Limited, a communications company he was brought from Lebanon to lead as deputy managing director at the time, was among the companies granted licences to provide GSM network services in Nigeria by General Abdulsalam Abubakar, the then Military Head of State who was pushing to deregulate the Nigerian telecoms sector.\n\nOut of the six companies that got the licences, only Motophone and Communications Investment Limited (CIL) were firmly on the ground. Both were however unable to secure the needed interconnection with NITEL, the only national gateway carrier. Motophone also had an image problem: it was connected to the Gilbert Chagouri family that was very close to the late military dictator, General Sani Abacha.\n\nIt was not a surprise then when President Olusegun Obasanjo, who led the democratic dispensation in Nigeria from 1999, described the licensing exercise as fraudulent, revoked the licences, and introduced the telecommunication policy that empowered the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to reorganise, auction, and issue fresh licences to successful companies.\n\nDarwish, 27 years old at the time, and his company Motophone were again shortlisted among the seven contenders for the new licensing regime. The other contenders were United Telesys, Reliance Telecoms, CIL, MTS, NITEL, and MTN. Motophone was eventually disqualified after a series of court orders and allegations by NCC that the company may have manipulated its way to the first licence. The NCC removed the rights of Motophone before the auction. Eventually, five companies were shortlisted for the four GSM licences.\n\nRead Also: IHS bucks trend, opts for sole listing in New York\n\nDown on his luck but undaunted, the young Lebanese entrepreneur decided to place his bet in a different segment of the nascent telecoms industry \u2013 building and operating towers.\n\nThat new bet proved to be genius. By listing on the New York Stock Exchange in chase of a valuation of $7 billion, IHS Towers has not only become the largest tower company in Africa it is also now more valuable than MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa both of which got the GSM licences.\n\nThe making of IHS Towers\n\nPrior to the emergence of IHS Towers, telecoms services in Nigeria under NITEL had suffered due to scarcity of base stations. The national carrier not only monopolised the market, but it also installed and operated the base stations. As of 1995, there were only 3,000 lines and three base stations in Lagos State. Between 1995 and 1999, the total number of connected fixed lines grew rapidly to about 550,000 while cellular lines were 40,000.\n\nDespite international initiatives and worthy objectives, Nigeria, with a population of over 120 million at the time, had in the year 2000 one of the lowest teledensity rates in the world at 0.38 percent.\n\nIt was also a period when the county\u2019s peers in Africa were beginning to take deregulation seriously and getting results for initiating the process.\n\nHence, in the late 1990s some African countries, such as Ghana, Uganda, and Zimbabwe, started issuing new cellular telephony licences. This led to dramatic increases in teledensities.\n\nFor example, the number of cellular subscribers in Zimbabwe increased from 20,000 to 150,000 in the 12 months before August 1999, whereas the number of fixed lines hovered around 250,000 over the same period. In Uganda the number of mobile subscribers overtook the number of fixed lines in July 1999, less than 10 months after MTN Uganda (the largest cellular operator in the country) started competing against MSI-Celtel.\n\nImportantly, the GSM licences went hand-in-hand with base tower increases. One report claimed that Darwish\u2019s company Motophone had installed towers in five Nigerian cities within seven months before having its licence revoked by the government.\n\nIn 2001, the same year MTN and Econet were granted their GSM licences, Issam Darwish together with his brother Mohamad Darwish and a friend William Saad founded IHS. IHS Holding Limited was however incorporated in the Republic of Mauritius under the Mauritian Companies Act 2001 as a private limited liability company. At the time, it was the only privately owned tower company in Nigeria.\n\nRunning IHS Towers\n\nIn the beginning, IHS Towers was building towers from scratch and operating them for telecom operators. While this proved to be a lucrative market for IHS, a lack of cooperation (and an excess of capital) meant many providers like MTN built their own towers without the proper planning to manage them.\n\nHence, despite being the only company providing exclusive tower services, IHS had to compete with the same operators it was seeking to serve.\n\nThe company soon realised there was more to gain from partnering and taking over existing towers than installing new ones.\n\nOperating a cell tower in a power-challenged country like Nigeria is a tug of war. Due to the unreliability of electricity, each cell tower requires two generators to keep it running for 24 hours plus a battery to serve as a backup. The company should also be able to guarantee diesel oil that feeds the generators.\n\nAlthough it was short on cash compared to the GSM providers, IHS had an advantage in that it was able to solve these problems from the beginning. Today, it is constantly seeking new innovation to further improve efficiency.\n\n\u201cThe energy situation in Nigeria hasn\u2019t changed much in 20 years, but we have learned new tactics,\u201d Darwish said in an interview this year.\n\n\u201cWe now use solar energy, smart batteries, and even wind; we are even testing a Tesla battery,\u201d Darwish said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2008 and the financial crisis that Darwish was able to convince the telecom operators in Nigeria of the value of cooperation. Before then, the company had in 2004 launched the Managed Services Operations for MNO-owned Towers with services including maintenance, security, and power supply.\n\nIn 2009, IHS began owning towers and leasing space to mobile network operators (MNOs) in Nigeria and launched its collocation operators through which it leased space to other MNOs. The big moments arrived when it sealed a deal to acquire MTN\u2019s tower assets. In 2014, IHS acquired a total of 10,966 towers out of which 4,154 came from MTN Nigeria and 2,116 towers from 9Mobile. It further acquired 4,696 towers from MTN Nigeria in 2015.\n\nRoad to IPO\n\n\u201cCongrats to longtime IFC client IHS Towers, the biggest operator of mobile phone towers in Africa, on its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange,\u201d tweeted Stephanies von Friedeburg, VP, Operations at the International Finance Corporation (IFC) on the day IHS finally rang the bell and went live on the global exchange at a price $17.65 per share.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge step for IHS in getting more communities across the continent connected. A proud moment for a great African company.\u201d\n\nApart from realising it needed collaboration to break the operational barriers in the telecom sector in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa, IHS also knew it needed unlimited access to liquidity to be able to provide the quality of service it was aiming for and control a sizable share of the market in Nigeria and Africa.\n\nShortly after increasing its tower portfolio in Nigeria, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Cameroon through acquisition, IHS completed a $2 billion equity round from investors such as IFC, Ecobank, Standard Chartered, and Investec. Darwish had said a substantial part of the money would go towards paying for its acquisitions, while the remainder would be spent on boosting its infrastructure in the five countries it operates in.\n\nDarwish had predicted that Africa could need 200,000 to 300,000 mobile towers with Nigeria alone needing 40,000 over a period of 10 years to meet the demand for broadband. This would require IHS raising more debt as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThings keep growing and evolving for us so we may come back to the market very soon,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2018, IHS, together with its shareholders including Goldman Sachs Group, Wendel, and MTN Group approached the New York Stock Exchange seeking to raise $1 billion at a valuation of $10 billion. The plan was postponed with reports citing the proximity of the 2019 general elections in Nigeria and the outcome of the sale of 9Mobile, a customer of IHS.\n\nWhile it waited, in 2019 the company refinanced outstanding debt of its Nigerian operations (approximately $1.8bn), including issuing $1.3 billion of new senior notes, as well as new senior credit facilities, resulting in a more simplified debt capital structure, extended maturities, and lower cost of debt. As of 2019, IHS had raised more than $5.5 billion in funding.\n\nIn terms of assets, IHS accounts for 16,522 towers of the 37,625 towers in Nigeria, representing almost 50 percent of the total in the market as of June 2021. It is also the number one tower provider in five markets where it operates in Africa and ranks fourth in the world.\n\nIHS goes public\n\nThe listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) went live at a share price of $17.65 for 1.6 million shares, or 16.0 percent below the IPO price, to value the company at about $5.8 billion. The stock has traded within a range of $16.83 to $18.48 since then.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased with the successful listing of IHS Towers, the fourth largest tower company globally.\n\n\u2018The listing gives MTN Group a strong liquidity platform that will support the Group\u2019s strategy of accelerating growth in its African markets, Ralph Mupita, MTN Group president/CEO, said\n\nApart from being the biggest customer of IHS, MTN owns a stake of 29 percent in the tower company. Following the listing, MTN now holds 85,176,719 ordinary shares.",

          "text": "The horizons of Nigeria\u2019s towns and villages have transformed dramatically over the past 20 years with the appearance and expansion of telecom towers; 30 to 70-meter-high structures that inundate peaks and heights across the country.\n\nThe record growth of the Nigerian telecom industry cannot be divorced from a robust telecom tower infrastructure which has played a pivotal role in bridging the digital divide and facilitating pervasive mobile connectivity. The tower industry in Nigeria has laid a strong foundation of growth for the telecom sector and has supported the sector in keeping pace with the fast-paced technology advancements.\n\nIHS has been one of the pioneers in infrastructure sharing, helping telecom operators to roll out services in record times, and enhancing national spread of signalling.\n\nThe dynamics of the Nigerian tower operator industry are, for the most part, similar to those of the established U.S. tower industry. Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) typically prefer to outsource their passive network components because it significantly reduces their capital costs and helps manage their operating costs.\n\nShavik Ghosh, writing for the \u2018Mint\u2019 noted, \u201c\u2026telecom towers are a lot like real estate, everything depends on the location. Land must be acquired at the exact coordinates where the tower is needed. After the telco has decided on a location, the coordinates are given to the towerco, which checks to see if there are any other towers in the area that can be used. To cut costs, towercos rent the land for a tower on a long-term lease. That brings the challenge of dealing with landlords, which can be something of an ordeal, according to an executive in charge of operations and management (O&M) for one of the independent tower companies, who did not want to be named\u201d.\n\nRead Also: IHS listing seen as investment magnate for Nigeria\u2019s telecom sector\n\nMNOs in the country have had a long history of outsourcing various telecommunications infrastructure needs to independent telecommunications infrastructure providers, including the building of new towers since 2001. Managed services have been in place since 2006. Shortly thereafter, the MNOs began sharing passive infrastructure and independent tower companies started to provide long-term leased services.\n\nIn 2011, MNOs started entering into bilateral agreements to co-locate on each other\u2019s sites. For MNOs, co-location offers a much more cost-effective and faster alternative to building new towers. Independent tower infrastructure operators have met the increasingly large demands of MNOs as they have aggressively pursued new subscribers.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, IHS, which owns 45 percent of the total towers in Nigeria and is the largest telecommunications infrastructure provider in the market with 68 percent of the independent market towers, acquired tower portfolios from 9 Mobile and MTN Nigeria while Airtel Nigeria sold its towers to American Tower Corporation.\n\n\u201cThe IHS mission is to provide telecommunications infrastructure to mobile network operators in Africa that enables the widest, most efficient and reliable networks, supporting the economic development of the region. We are constantly developing new, efficient and effective technologies and rolling out passive networks to make that happen,\u201d says Sam Darwish, CEO of telecoms company IHS Towers, which has raised more than $5.5 billion in funding.\n\nFounded in Nigeria in 2001, IHS Towers\u2019 business model is relatively straightforward: The company buys mobile towers from telecom companies, or builds them itself, then leases them back to the operators. The company now has operations in Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Rwanda and Zambia.\n\nOpportunities\n\nMany MNOs across Africa are selling off their tower assets. This trend, brought on by a strong imperative to cut network deployment and operating costs, is expected to intensify in the future.\n\nThe infrastructural challenges for MNOs in Africa are two fold; to cost-effectively power their existing network and expand network coverage to the population currently without access to mobile communications infrastructure.\n\nThe opportunities inherent in this for tower companies are immense.\n\nWith IHS in the lead, Nigeria has been one of the forerunners in passive infrastructure sharing, which is now a world-wide phenomenon. The \u201ctowerco\u201d business model opened significant gains; from rapid market expansion and faster time to market, to opex and capex efficiencies, and offloading capex burden from telecom operators.\n\nPlenty of new opportunities, as noted in a 2020 Ernst & Young (EY) are arising for tower companies to shift their attention from a macro tower focused business, towards new business models hinged on fibre, small cells, data centres, Wi-Fi, smart cities and beyond.\n\nAdvancing the capex to opex model, towercos, said the report \u201ccan venture into data centres and edge computing (micro data centres) play. As the economy grows, low hanging revenue opportunities can come from capitalizing the real estate rights with the infrastructure providers \u2013 opening growth avenues in advertisements, electric vehicles infrastructure, security solutions and traffic control among others\u201d.\n\nIn addition, says EY, while there is broad consensus that 5G will drive up the total cost of network ownership, given the massively increased densification of urban areas and the resulting heightened requirements for fibre deployment, infrastructure providers are better positioned to support the industry\u2019s need for fibre rollout and small cell densification.\n\nFurthermore, opportunities are awash for HIS to strengthen its local market and dominate offshore markets especially in the areas of building, operating and maintaining Internet of Things (IoT) network, and serving as a neutral host Wi-Fi provider.\n\nMonetising existing assets is a significant opportunity for towercos in the country. Towercos can expand their service portfolio beyond tower based real estate and include provisioning other services on their tower sites. With distributed, power backed, and increasingly fiberized sites, towercos can explore revenue streams that exploit this dispersed real estate advantage. A potential business stream includes setting up of edge computing on tower sites by deploying micro data centres near the network edge. With steady power supply and ready backhaul, tower sites can support edge data centres closer to the user, reducing the need to send backhaul data traffic to a centralized hub.\n\nThe location advantage of towercos also renders them fit for serving as storage, warehousing and delivery centres for various businesses. With availability of power and air-conditioning, even perishable goods storage can be explored as a business stream. Tower structures can also be monetized for out-of-home advertising, with placement of billboards on towers/monopoles. Another service proposition beyond vertical real estate is the provisioning of primary and backup power. As towercos have significant expertise in managing energy assets, they are well-positioned to provide power-as-a-service. With the advent of electric vehicles, towercos can play an important role in this upcoming opportunity and unlock a new revenue stream. The availability of reliable power and possession of distributed sites makes towercos well-suited to provide EV charging infrastructure\n\nChallenges\n\nNigeria needs towers and lots of them. Perhaps, the biggest local and immediate challenge is in the maintenance of towers and tower sites: the rising cost of fuel and the need to be environmentally responsible, as well as reassuring the public that its structures are not health hazards can be a sticking point for the towercos.\n\nTowers have a significant carbon footprint and this has been a sore point between the Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC) and the National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA).\n\nEase of doing business remains a major concern for all in the country and across large parts of the continent. Dealing with construction permits, poor access to electricity, multiple taxation and enforcement of contracts are key concerns that need to be addressed for faster infrastructure rollouts. To expedite the creation of robust telecom infrastructure and to fulfil, it is important that ease of doing business is treated as a priority.",

          "text": "The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has said it would no longer condone any illegal or irregular admission conducted by any tertiary institution, warning candidates to desist from accepting admissions offered by the institutions without going through the JAMB\u2019s Central Admission Processing System (CAPS).\n\nThe examination body gave the warning in an advisory issued to the heads of the various tertiary institutions, which was also published in its weekly bulletin.\n\nThis was a follow-up to an earlier threat of sanctions issued by the minister of education, Adamu Adamu, over what was described as the recalcitrance of some heads of institutions who allegedly continued to flout the ministerial directive on the subject.\n\nJAMB\u2019s latest advisory\n\nJAMB\u2019s advisory as captured in the bulletin reads in part; \u201cThe advisory further made it clear that the new hardline position taken by the Board was informed by the quantum of applications received for candidates for condonement of illegal admissions popularly known by candidates as \u2018Regularisation\u2019 adding that such ignoble acts would no longer be tolerated by the Board.\n\n\u201cThe advisory further reiterated that all applications for admissions to First Degree, National Diploma, National Innovation Diploma and the Nigeria Certificate in Education into Full-Time, Distance Learning, Part-Time, Outreach, Sandwich, etc., must be processed ONLY through the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB).\u201d\n\nJAMB said institutions that may still be involved \u201cin advertising or selling \u201capplication forms\u201d for admissions into the programmes listed above were advised to desist forthwith.\u201d\n\nThe advisory, therefore, urges the concerned institutions to encourage their candidates to apply to their programmes through the examination body, noting that duplication of application forms is also not allowed.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, candidates are to ensure that any admission issued to them by any institution is routed through the Board even before considering accepting such offers,\u201d JAMB said.\n\nMinister\u2019s earlier decision\n\nWhile taking part in the 2021 admission policy meeting on August 31, in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital, the education minister accused some institutions of flouting the government\u2019s directive.\n\nMr Adamu, who was represented by the permanent secretary in the ministry, Sonny Echono, said appropriate sanctions would be meted against defaulting institutions and their leaderships.\n\nMr Echono, who chaired the meeting on behalf of the minister, noted that the actions of the institutions usually alter the country\u2019s statistics of admitted candidates and those not admitted annually.\n\nHe said; \u201cIt is in furtherance of the goal of safeguarding the integrity of the admission process that all institutions were told that admission made outside the Central Admissions Processing System (CAPS) is unacceptable to the system.\n\n\u201cIt is saddening that despite the clear directives at previous policy meetings some institutions still illegally admitted candidates outside CAPS. I consider such an act as a direct affront on the system and appropriate sanctions shall be applied to those found to have been involved in such a disruptive act. Similarly, any institution that issued admission letters to candidates outside CAPS will be punished for such gross indiscipline and fraud.\u201d\n\nStatistics of illegal admissions\n\nAccording to the minister, a total of 255,928 illegal admissions were conducted by various institutions in 2015 for the 2014 academic sessions while the figure stood at 190,407 in 2016 for the 2015 academic calendar.\n\nHowever, following what he described as a series of engagements with relevant stakeholders, the minister said there was a sharp decline in the figure in 2017, saying the country recorded only 43,852 illegal admission figures for the 2016 academic session.\n\nHowever, JAMB said it never believed some institutions would still continue to go through the backdoor to offer admissions to candidates, saying the essence of harmonisation was to ensure correct statistics for better planning and that it guarantees that every qualified candidate secures admission at the right time.\n\nConsequences\n\nMeanwhile, JAMB has said part of the consequences awaiting the candidates who fall victim of illegal admissions is that they would not be able to participate in the mandatory National Youth Service Scheme.\n\nThe programme, which is coordinated by the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), is mandatory for qualified holders of first degree certificates and Higher National Diploma (HND) certificates who are not yet above 30 years of age.\n\nThe NYSC certificate is part of requirements for job opportunities in Nigeria and political appointees are also expected to either produce the certificate of participation or an exception, which is granted based on the condition of age.\n\nThe advisory added that; \u201cThe Board would not succumb to pressure from any quarter to clear any candidate for the NYSC or other essential needs if he/she had accepted any admission from any institution which did not follow laid-down regulations as emphasised above.\n\n\u201cThe Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) and the three Regulatory Agencies: (National Universities Commission (NUC), National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) and National Commission for Colleges of Education (NCCE) will ensure that all tertiary institutions comply with this policy directive. Other professional regulatory agencies are also expected to play critical roles in sanitising the process.\u201d\n\nJAMB also seeks streamlining of academic standards and that durations of all non-full time studies must be maintained as approved by the regulatory agencies, noting that such programmes should not run for less than 150 per cent of the equivalence of full time studies.\n\n\u201cInstitutions which desire to place advertisement to source for candidates can do so but they have to advise potential candidates, beginning from those who sat the current UTME (or DE candidates), to change to or pick these institutions as First (1st) Choice rather than the tortuous route of requesting candidates to purchase another application form. This, the advisory noted, would prevent the issue of double registration.\u201d",

          "title": "Anambra 2021: APGA battles to save Ojukwu\u2019s legacy",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nAs the Anambra State electorate heads to the poll next week, November 6, to elect a new governor \u2013 a successor to the incumbent chief executive, Willie Obiano \u2013 the state\u2019s ruling party, the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), is in a make or break battle, fighting not only to retain a state it has governed for nearly two decades, but more importantly, for its very survival.\n\nThough not etched in the consciousness of many, when Anambra voters step out to vote on Saturday, they will inadvertently be deciding the fate of a political platform that has, over the years, stood as the only outstanding legacy of late Biafra leader, Chief Chukwuemeka Odimegwu Ojukwu; a man widely regarded as the eternal leader of his people.\n\nAPGA, with former Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Prof Charles Soludo, as its candidate, goes into the election as one of the favourites \u2013 in what is largely a three horse race involving the party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), which has Mr. Valentine Ozigbo as candidate and the country\u2019s ruling party, All Progressive Congress (APC), with Senator Andy Uba as candidate \u2013 but more than ever before the APGA faces a hovering possibility of not retaining a state it has had from 2006 when the state\u2019s former governor, Mr. Peter Obi reclaimed his 2003 mandate initially awarded to Chris Ngige of the PDP. And unable to hold another state in the region, losing Anambra would simply mean a slide into oblivion.\n\nIt\u2019s a possibility not lost on the APGA candidate, Soludo himself. Speaking on Tuesday during a campaign at Akpo community in Aguata LGA of the state, he noted that losing the election would simply be the end of the party.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to lose this election, because if we lose, it will be the end of APGA,\u201d Soludo said. \u201cSo, we need to work together and make sure we win this election to survive and carry on the legacy of the party.\n\n\u201cThis is why I have come to you, to appeal to our traditional rulers, community leaders, president-generals, women and youths to vote for APGA.\u201d\n\nThe prognosis, for a party that once embodied the aspiration of the Igbo nation, is foreboding. Last week\u2019s defection to the APC, of Dr. Nkem Okeke, the state\u2019s deputy governor, capped a wave of defections from APGA to the country\u2019s ruling party ahead of the polls.\n\nOkeke\u2019s defection, perhaps more than anything else, spoke to the degeneration of a party that has since lost its essence, and presently exists, many say, in a vacuum. Before him was Sunday Umeoduagu, erstwhile APGA Board of Trustee member who also pitted tent with the ruling party few days ago. Six members of the state assembly, have also left for the APC, as the ruling\u2019s party\u2019s camp continues to expand ahead of the election.\n\nThe APC and its candidate, Uba, are looking poised to cause an upset at APGA\u2019s expense, as a combination of factors, including crisis in APGA, possible voter apathy and likely deployment of federal might are catalysizing in their favour.\n\nUba has continued to mobilise youths of the state for spirited online campaigns. Yet, he is not the only threat. Ozigbo and PDP are very much in the game. Indeed, for many, a free and fair contest will largely be a two-horse race between APGA and the PDP.\n\nBut elections are hardly fair in Nigeria, and Anambra polls, with swelling threats of violence, may be anything but free. And this is where APGA\u2019s main headache will come from.\n\n\u201cIf election holds and people go out to vote, Andy Uba cannot win,\u201d said Chidi Nwafor, political observer and business owner based in Awka. \u201cIf there is an election, APGA or PDP will win. Uba cannot win. APC is not liked here, and Uba is very unpopular, even in his home town, forget social media propaganda.\n\n\u201cBut as it stands, people will not come out to vote, and that will enable him to use federal might to rig the election. They might repeat what they did in Imo State. But unlike Imo, they may not wait to go to court, they may take the state by force and ask you to go to court.\u201d\n\nThe threat of violence is very real. Attacks on politicians, prominent figures and the facilities of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), by gunmen whose stated objective is to ensure that the election doesn\u2019t hold, in line with the position of separatist group, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has put everyone on the edge.\n\n\u201cAPGA has not been able to campaign because of the violence. The party has not been able to campaign in up to three local governments. Everyone is afraid,\u201d Nwafor said. \u201cPeople will not come out to vote, unless IPOB declares that the election should hold. Otherwise, they would be too afraid to go out to vote.\u201d\n\nAPGA\u2019s predicament is in three-fold: The party has, on account of merchantile posture of successive leadership, departed from its original mandate of being a rallying point for Ndigbo, to become like most other political platforms, a place where positions went to highest bidders. The consequent of which is the alienation of many who had invested their emotions to it, including the Southeast street which initially saw it, especially with Ojukwu as a leading figure, as a platform for the rekindling of Biafra spirit.\n\nOjukwu\u2019s death in 2011, was the turning point. The party no longer had a natural leader. Peter Obi, its first governor, could not step into his shoes. His successor, Obiano, has proved to be much worse. His inspiring performance as governor is one of the major cases against APGA going into the polls. But the party\u2019s major headache will come from the boycott campaign being mounted by proponents of Biafra, notably the Mazi Nnamdi Kanu led IPOB.\n\nIt\u2019s an abiding irony that a political platform that rose to relative prominence in 2003, on the back pro Biafra sentiment, inspired by Emeka Ojukwu, now faces real threat of oblivion courtesy of same pro-Biafra sentiment, inspired this time, by Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nUnlike Ojukwu, who after leading the Biafra war, subsequently favoured political participation, Kanu is mounting boycott campaign as a strategy to achieve secession. It\u2019s difficult to see any logic in the strategy, and in any case, with President Muhammadu Buhari determined to ensure that the election takes place despite the enveloping violence \u2013 a commitment he further restated last week when he gave security agencies marching orders to deploy as much force as necessary to ensure that the election holds \u2013 it may indeed hold as scheduled. Regardless, the inevitable outcome will be historic low voter turnout, which could be APGA\u2019s major undoing.\n\nIPOB commands street following in Anambra and elsewhere in the Southeast, and the continued insistence by its foot soldiers on no election is sure to discourage many from participating in the process, but even more so is the ensuing violence, which is certain to scare people away from the polls and create an atmosphere for possible manipulation of the poll.\n\n\u201cThe fewer the voters on election day, the worse for APGA and the PDP, which have no federal might to deploy,\u201d said Chidi Anthony, lawyer and political commentator. \u201cThe violence being perpetrated by these gunmen will scare people away from voting. That is very obvious. What will then likely happen is that APC will use that as an opportunity to manipulate the outcome.\u201d\n\nAPGA has also continued to be it\u2019s own worst enemy, battling unending internal leadership crisis. Last week\u2019s Supreme Court ruling that affirmed Soludo as candidate and Chief Victor Oye as national chairman, has put an end, in the interim, to what has been months bitter squabble between the duo\u2019s camp and that of Jude Okeke, which produced Hon. Chukwuma Umeoji as governorship candidate, but it\u2019s unlikely to be the end.\n\nAs hinted at earlier, APGA\u2019s problem takes root from its derailing from the core fundamental objective that birthed it. Obvious from recent political events is that, perhaps as many political watchers have pointed out, APGA has lost its soul, and the recurrent crisis is only an indication that the party is heading towards an inglorious end.\n\nWhen the party emerged in the political arena ahead of the 2003 general election, it was basically the Igbo response to their perceived marginalisation in the Nigerian polity. The party, with the late Chief Ojukwu as its face, represented, for the average Igbo, a political identity. One could say, APGA drew its strength from the Igbo emotional attachment to it.\n\n\u201cThe strong desire to found a national political party based on Igbo initiative motivated me to rally a few associates on the platform of Igboezue Cultural Association which I founded in 1991 with the Motto: \u201cOnye aghala nwanne ya,\u201d (let\u2019s be our brothers\u2019 keepers) to embark on the mission of forming a political party,\u201d recalled Chief Okorie, the party\u2019s original founder and its first National Chairman.\n\nOkorie perhaps foresaw that the possibility of an Igbo quest for power in a national political party did not exist, a fact further validated by the travails of the late former Vice President, Dr. Alex Ekwueme in the PDP. UPGA, the original name of the party, transmuted to APGA in 2003 with Ojukwu as its founding figure.\n\nWith Ojukwu, APGA, in many people\u2019s reckoning, filled a void in the Igbo political consciousness which the PDP despite being the dominant political party in the Igbo country, could not fill. The generality of the people identified with it. In some ways, it was a response to the Alliance for Democracy in the South west and the All Nigeria Peoples Party in the North.\n\nBut things went down, gradually, after Ojukwu. Chief Obiano, as Anambra governor and leader of the party, not only stood on the party\u2019s platform to back Buhari, perceived by many Igbo to have taken Igbo marginalisation to a whole new level, but also rained verbal abuses on Ohanaeze leadership for endorsing Buhari\u2019s opponent, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar of the PDP, who coincidentally, had Peter Obi, his predecessor as vice presidential candidate ahead of 2019 election.\n\n\u201cAPGA lost its essence the moment the party was hijacked some years ago by people who didn\u2019t share in the vision for which it was founded. It is as a result of that derailment that took place about 16 years ago, in 2004. APGA was founded in 2002 and by December 2004, they had already launched an attack against the founder, myself,\u201d said Chief Okorie.\n\n\u201cWe remained in court for eight years. As a result, the party never grew beyond Anambra State. Any in-road it made into any state, it quickly returned back to Anambra State. It entered Imo, but couldn\u2019t stay there and so on and so forth. So, it was a gradual process that has almost resulted in outright decimation of the party. It\u2019s not a damage that was done just in one day.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget that after I produced Chief Odumegwu Ojukwu as presidential candidate, APGA never produced any other presidential candidate of Igbo extraction from that time till now. And one of the reasons for founding it was to give the Igbo man an opportunity to be involved in the contest for the highest office in the land.\u201d\n\nObiano could well be APGA\u2019s last governor. A possibility that would mark an unfortunate end to party. And for many, it will be to his credit. The governor is indeed linked with possible defection to the APC in the coming months.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame that the party is being destroyed in the face of Obiano. As the leader of the party, the party is completely being destroyed,\u201d Prof Max Nduaguibe, a former chieftain of the party in Abia noted.\n\n\u201cObi left the party after his governorship and went to PDP. He left the party more or less intact for Obiano.\n\n\u201cThe merchants who took over the party with Obiano decided to use it to make money. And they have made sufficient money from Imo people, from Abia people, even from Anambra people. You can see that they once even denied the wife of Ojukwu ticket.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, with Dr. Alex Otti as candidate, APGA came whiskers away from taking Abia State, but again failed, largely on account of lack of commitment by its leadership. Otti has since abandoned the platform for the APC.\n\n\u201cThe essence of APGA is almost getting lost because of avarice,\u201d said Barr Bob Okey Okoroji, a chieftain of the party who aspired to Lagos governorship through its platform told BusinessesHallmark after the last polls.\n\n\u201cThe focus and the desire by some individuals in leadership position both at the national and state levels, is to make money. Therefore, they relegate to the background, those fundamental principles on which the party was founded.\n\n\u201cI do understand too, that their leadership is not going to be forever. They will be there for a while and maybe those who share the vision of the founding fathers will get into leadership and bring the party to where it should be. The party\u2019s performance in Imo is also not very encouraging because of the primary elections.\u201d\n\nDr. Oye, regardless, insisted all is well with the party and they were, \u201cdetermined not to be distracted by miscreants who are being used by opposition politicians to cause disaffection in APGA.\u201d",
          "summary": "It\u2019s a possibility not lost on the APGA candidate, Soludo himself.\nIndeed, for many, a free and fair contest will largely be a two-horse race between APGA and the PDP.\n\u201cIf there is an election, APGA or PDP will win.\nWith Ojukwu, APGA, in many people\u2019s reckoning, filled a void in the Igbo political consciousness which the PDP despite being the dominant political party in the Igbo country, could not fill.\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget that after I produced Chief Odumegwu Ojukwu as presidential candidate, APGA never produced any other presidential candidate of Igbo extraction from that time till now.",

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThe board of FBN Holdings Plc (FBNH) may soon witness an adjustment to reflect a major change in the ownership structure of the holding company for First Bank of Nigeria Limited (FBN).\n\nThe Group (FBNH) in a statement issued on the Nigerian Exchange Limited\u2019s portal on Saturday put an end to a raging controversy when it announced that the Chairman of Calvados Global Services Limited, Mr Femi Otedola, had acquired substantial shareholding in the company.\n\nThe statement, signed by the company secretary, Mr Seyi Kosoko said, \u201cWe refer to our communication to the market dated, October 22, 2021 on the above subject wherein we stated that we would inform the public of any substantial acquisition, upon receipt of notification from the shareholder.\n\n\u201cThis morning, October 23, 2021, FBN Holdings Plc received a notification from APT Securities and Funds Limited, that their client, Mr Otedola Olufemi Peter, and his nominee, Calvados Global Services Limited have acquired a total of 1,818,551,625 units of shares from the company\u2019s issued share capital of 35,895,292,791.\n\n\u201cBased on the foregoing, the equity stake of Mr Otedola Olufemi Peter and his nominee in the company is now 5.07 per cent.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, FBNH had denied media reports that Otedola had acquired a significant shareholding in the company. The Group in a statement signed by Kosoko, and filed with the Nigerian Exchange Limited on Friday, said it had not received any notification of such acquisitions.\n\nIt had said, \u201cThe attention of FBN Holdings Plc has been drawn to media reports today (Friday) that a certain individual has acquired significant shareholding interest in FBN Holdings Plc.\n\n\u201cAs a listed company, the shares of FBN Holdings are publicly traded, and sale and acquisition of shares is expected in the normal course of business. We operate in a regulated environment, which requires notification of significant shareholding by shareholders to the company, where shares are held in different vehicles, further to which the company will notify the regulators and the public as appropriate.\n\n\u201cThe company is yet to receive any notification from the individual mentioned in the media report, of such acquisitions.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition of a significant shareholding in the FBN Holdings (FBNH) Plc, by Otedola had sparked controversy among stakeholders, with FBNH denying official knowledge of the transaction.\n\nIt was even more so with the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) describing the development as a speculation since, according to it, neither the bank nor the NGX Reguation has notified the Exchange of such deal.\n\nAggressive mop-up\n\nOtedola in a series of secondary market transactions and negotiated deals was confirmed to have acquired more than five per cent equity stake in FBNH. Nigerian capital market rules set a threshold of five per cent for \u201cmaterial\u201d or significant shareholding, which must be disclosed to the regulatory authorities and the board of the affected company.\n\nFBNH currently has a total outstanding shareholding of 39.5 billion units and a market capitalization of N423.5 billion (over a billion dollars assuming official exchange rate). According to the 2020 FY report of the bank, 40 shareholders owned 31.03% of the bank while no individual shareholder held more than 5% of the bank.\n\nIt is believed that Otedola now owns over 5% of the bank through his proxies and investing vehicles,, thereby setting himself up to be the single largest shareholder of the bank.\n\nSources conversant with happenings and dealers at the stock market confirmed that business mogul might have acquired more than two billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each in FBNH in a series of secondary transactions that heightened with a major cross deal two weeks ago.\n\nFor instance, Otedola was believed to be the proxy buyer in a N7.57 billion cross deal at the NGX on October 07, 2021. A total of 473 million shares of FBNH were crossed at N16 per share, significantly above the market price.\n\nThe transaction was registered as a \u201cnegotiated cross deal\u201d by FBNQuest Securities Limited, implying that the deal was already concluded between the parties and was merely taken to the market to formalise the transaction.\n\nAlao, a Marina, Lagos-based stockbroking firm confirmed to a major daily that it sold several millions of shares to Otedola in multiple secondary market transactions, deals that popped up the firm and FBN Holdings as largest dealer and most active stock in recent days.\n\nSome of the deals included shares held by an estranged long-standing director of the group, who lost a major boardroom squabble recently and under regulatory review.\n\nVanguard quoted some of the shareholders of the bank who pleaded anonymity as saying: \u201cIf it is true that he is now the single majority shareholder it means that Otedola must have taken opportunity of the crisis that rocked the Board of Directors of First Bank of Nigeria Holding, FBNH, Plc.\n\n\u201cOtedola sold his 75 per cent direct and indirect shareholding in Forte Oil in 2019 through a merger of his business Zenon Oil with previous African Petrified Oil and they became all the more curious as to what his next move would be. He didn\u2019t keep them guessing too long as he soon announced that he wanted to explore and maximize business opportunities in refining and petrochemicals.\u201d\n\nThe shareholders further said: \u201cEven though he also had investments in the real estate and financial sector, Otedola singled out First Bank for the single reason that there wasn\u2019t exactly one man calling the shots there, unlike in other new generation banks.\n\n\u201cHe wasted no time in taking advantage of the leadership crisis that rocked First Bank not too long ago leading to the Central Bank of Nigeria sacking both the chairman of the bank, Ibukun Awosika and Obafemi Otudeko, the chairman of FBN Holdings. Otedola made his movements, and today he is a better person as a result of them.\u201d\n\nAnother shareholder of the bank said\u201d Otedola made a decision to be the highest majority shareholder and approach those with bulk shares negotiate and buy from them. May be he also bought from the floor strategically.\u201d\n\nHowever, market pundits said the acquisitions by Otedola would possibly lead to no changes in the FBNH, citing corporate governance structure at the banking group, diverse shareholding and CBN regulations. As against other non-financial institutions, CBN reserves the primary approval right for any appointment unto the board and management of a regulated financial institution.\n\n\u201cThis is not like the case of Forte Oil, he was practically the owner of Forte Oil but he is not holding the majority shares in FBNH, and I don\u2019t think he has the financial muscle to attain a clear single controlling equity stake,\u201d a dealer at the stock market said.\n\nFBNH reported a profit after tax of N38 billion in the first half of 2021 up from N35 billion same period in 2020. Many believe that based on his antecedents from previously acquired entities, majority ownership of FBNH by an Otedola backed entity will probably usher in a transformation in the bank. This is expected to boost investor confidence.\n\nThe investment maestro has a pedigree going for him especially after successfully turning around Forte Oil and then selling it to new owners. He also acquired Geregu Power Plant during the privatization of 2013m which is today touted as one of the most efficient plants in the country.",

          "text": "By Olusesan Laoye\n\nIn what appeared to be like a movie to the security guards at the Abalongo correctional Centre in Oyo township, Oyo state, the gun men who attacked the centre were said to have invaded the place in a commando manner which took them unawares.\n\nAccording to one of the officers on duty when the incident occurred late Friday night, the attackers came in a commando way and went straight for business.\n\nHe disclosed that the marauders were up to 20 in number as they surrounded the centre even as they were fully armed with sophisticated weapons.\n\nThe officer who spoke on condition of anonymity, revealed that the attackers who presumably already knew that coming in through the main gate would draw attention to them, after some gun shots to scare people away, instantly blew the back fence of the centre with dynamite which exploded like a rocket and quickly rushed into the cells section from where the over 837 inmates were freed.\n\nSources hinted that the manner with which the gun men invaded the correctional centre was typical of what was experienced in other African countries recently, especially Uganda and Tanzania where dynamite was used to invade their prisons to free inmates.\n\nThe Oyo incident also brings to about five of its kind in Nigeria in the the last few years including incidents in Lagos, Enugu, Kaduna and Jos.\n\nAlthough the correctional centre authorities have said that 262 of the escaped inmates have been recaptured back to the centre, as many as 575 are still at large. Accordingly, there is palpable fear in Oyo township and environs, as there are speculations that hardened criminals must definitely be among those who still at large.\n\nAlthough the motives of the heavily armed gun men who invaded the Abalongo correctional centre were not known, there were feelings that the operation may have been carried out to free some of the inmates known to them and who may have been detained for committing heavy capital criminal offenses.\n\nSome of the residents in the area who spoke with reporters pointed out that they are now living in fear because they were not sure what would be the next steps of the attackers, since they are yet to be identified and their exact mission in carrying out the operation was still not conclusively known.\n\nOne of the residents, who simply identified himself as a tailor and who refused to mention his name for fear of being attacked, said what the security operatives will now have to do is to unravel their missions and find out if there were any inside connections in the operation because it was strange to them.\n\nHe said that at the time of the attack, the gun shots and the explosives used by the assailants rent the air and residents had to run for safety, since, they could not ascertain what was happening in view of the insecurity and incessant attacks by bandits, all over Nigeria, saying that the incident was an indication that no where is safe.\n\n\u201d It was an indication as well, that all parts of Nigeria are now vulnerable to attacks of any kind.\u201d\n\nIt was learnt that the Alaafin of Oyo has shown concern and has communicated with the State Governor Engineer Seyi Makinde and the Commissioner of Police in the State, that they should ensure that the entire Oyo township and environs are well protected from criminals.\n\nIt was said that he also assured the security operatives of his cooperation and that of his people. He was also said to have informed the people of the town to be more careful and be vigilant and should not shy away from reporting to the police or appropriate authorities, of any suspect or movements of unknown faces in their communities.\n\nIt was said that out of the 907 inmates at the centre, 837 are on awaiting trial while only 64 have been convicted.\n\nWhen contacted on the implications of trials being delayed, which has culminated in having a large numbers of people awaiting trials in virtually all the correctional centers in Nigeria, a legal luminary politician and former governorship aspirant in Osun State in the last governorship election, and who holds a Doctorate Degree in Jurisprudence, Dr. (Prince) Ayoade Adewopo told Business Hallmark that the legal system in Nigeria is responsible for the lack of quick dispensation of justice.\n\nHe also averred that there was also a lack of proper investigations by the law enforcement agencies prosecuting many criminal cases, which contributes to the delay in dispensing cases in courts.\n\nHe said since Judges would need clear evidence from those investigating serious or capital Offenses, Judges would have no choice than to keep the suspected criminals in custody, since, they are charged with unbailable offenses.\n\nAlso, he said suspects also stay long in detention when they have no legal representation that could help their matters and this he said, often leads to frustration among the suspected criminals.\n\n\u201cSome of them don\u2019t have those to stand surety for them even if their offenses are bailable ones and that is why you have inmates spending donkey years in prison custody for minor offenses which are not supposed to keep them for long in detention.\u201d\n\nHe then asked that some of the criminal laws in Nigeria should be reviewed to allow for quicker dispensations of Justice.\n\nHe called on both the Correctional officers and the security operatives to swing into action and investigate the reasons behind the attack in such a deadly manner and those behind it and the inmates who could not be found.\n\nWhile reacting to the attack, the Public Relations Officer of the Centre, Olanrewaju Anjonrin told Journalists that the Controller General of the organisation, Haruna Baba has directed that efforts should be made to investigate the reasons for the incident and assured that those at large would be fished out.\n\nHe pointed out that based the instruction of the Controller General, the State Controller for Oyo State, Noel Ailewon has swung into action and the command is making frantic efforts, to arrest the situation.\n\nMr. Anjonrin then assured the people of Oyo State, especially those in Oyo township and environs not to panic saying, that the situation has been brought under control.\n\nMeanwhile, unconfirmed reports stated that during the gun dwell with the attackers, a soldier who was trying to scrutinise them when he suspected foul play was gunned down, while it was also alleged that two Amotekun operatives, who first confronted the gun men were shot dead as well.\n\nThe Abalongo correctional centre was established in 2007, for 160 inmates but at the time it was attacked last Friday, the occupants were 907.",

          "title": "Budget 2021: Another hope in limbo",
          "text": "It has become traditional for every government to make budget from year to year, but the result has always been different from the declared intentions of the budgets. Like everything about this administration, its budgeting process seems to have gone from bad to worse, and the 2021 budget represents the hallmark of its fiscal confusion and conflicts in the management of the economy.\n\nFor an economy that is already experiencing stagflation \u2013 economic stagnation and hyper-inflation, which has swelled the population of poor Nigerians \u2013 the budget, ironically termed \u201cBudget of Recovery and Growth\u201d, the policies enunciated in it do not convey such intentions. It is evident that the 2021 budget may end the way of others since this administration, characterised by padding, under implementation, high deficit and debt, and poor performance\n\nThe parameters are quite conservative, which suggested new thinking and orientation, but the borrowing component and planned taxation throw a spanner in the works. The budget of N16.3 trillion is based on the benchmarks of $58 per barrel oil price, 2.4 mbpd, 12 percent inflation rate, 4.5 percent GDP growth rate, and N6 trillion new borrowing.\n\nApart from the oil price benchmark, ssvirtually every other parameter in the budget is too optimistic and almost unrealistic, as has been the case in the past six years of this government. Currently, oil price is in the lower $80s and the lower benchmark is pragmatic to ensure more accretion to the foreign reserves to cushion the cascading value of the naira and wedge rampaging imported inflation.\n\nAlthough the National Assembly has expressed intent to raise the oil price in a bid to reduce the debt component, wisdom should inform that the oil price be kept reasonably low to have at least a $10 buffer for the naira. Perhaps, this is the only positive in the budget, as other parameters send alarm bell ringing over their thoughtlessness and foolhardiness.\n\nThe biggest danger in the budget is the N6 trillion new borrowing to finance infrastructure, but it has become evident that some parts of the borrowing go into recurrent expenditure, as we spent 97 percent of revenue on debt service in the first half of 209021.\n\nWe agree with the House of Reps members in the debate on the general principles of the budget that it sounds quite contradictory to have low oil price benchmark and a huge debt portion. The purpose of a conservative oil price is to have a modest and moderate budget with small deficit.\n\nHowever, the massive deficit of N6 trillion negates the idea of a lower oil price, which the Reps insisted does not make sense. So the intended increase in the oil price is to reduce the humongous deficit and borrowing, which has remained contentious under this regime. This government has borrowed more than any other government in history.\n\nNigeria\u2019s debt stock has already ballooned from N12 trillion in 2015 to N35 trillion and experts believe it will each N50 trillion by the exit time of the government. Government insistence on basing its borrowing on GDP, rather than revenue is plunging the nation into debt trap. An economy in deep debt and without strong revenue earning capacity can experience neither recovery nor growth.\n\nWith inflation still at 17 percent, and naira under the bus, as a result of foreign exchange pressure, the inflation rate of 12 percent is far-fetched. Inflation reduces purchasing power, which discourages demand and eventually reduces production and capacity utilisation. To achieve 12 percent inflation would be positive, but this is not likely to happen with the plan to raise tax.\n\nAlthough, government argued that many Nigerians evade tax, imposing tax in a recessed economy is a death sentence. According to government, the budget is based on bringing more Nigerians into the tax bracket to ensure more revenue outside of oil. Ordinarily, this is a good proposition.\n\nGovernment believes that only four million out of the 40 million eligible Nigerians pay tax and increasing the figure to about 20 million will solve the revenue crisis of government. In comparison, 14 million South Africans pay tax, which is triple the number in Nigeria with four times South Africa\u2019s population. Government must recognize the reason for the high rate of tax evasion in Nigeria.\n\nThe economy is unproductive and more tax will exacerbate its unproductivity. Tax will raise inflation because companies would pass the cost to the consumers. With high prices, demand would fall, and companies would cut production and ultimately lay off workers. So the very idea of tax is like the deficit of N6 trillion.\n\nSimilarly, the 2.4 mbpd output and 4.5 GDP growth rate are at best mere intentions devoid of concrete economic fundamentals to make them realisable. In the past six years, production output has remained at 2mbpd on average and the GDP has only reached 2.8 percent at peak. It would be great to achieve 4.5 percent growth rate, but the policies do not support such projections.\n\nIn our opinion, this budget does not provide much hope for the recovery and growth of the economy. All the optimism and confidence expressed by government on the budget seem misplaced and impracticable. A budget as an expression of intentions should also be based on facts that not only agree, but should also give a glimmer of hope.\n\nBoth we find absent in the 2021 budget and we are constrained to place any hope of improvement in the economy on it, because it is a badly coupled expenditure plan that sounds big on amount but projects very little on reality and result. It is another disappointment coming from this administration that promised so much to Nigerians, but sadly, has delivered very little.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Agency Reports\n\nThe putsch by the Sudanese military has now fully unraveled after it announced the dissolution of the transitional government, headed by prime minister Abdallah Hamdok.\n\nSoldiers arrested most of the members of Sudan\u2019s cabinet in massive dawn raid early on Monday, triggering street protests by the people.\n\nGunfire and injuries were reported.\n\nAbdel Fattah al-Burhan, a general who headed the Sovereign Council, a power-sharing ruling body, announced a state of emergency across the country.\n\nHe was also the one who dissolved the council and the transitional government.\n\nPrime Minister Abdalla Hamdok was detained and moved to an undisclosed location after refusing to issue a statement in support of the coup, said the information ministry, still apparently under the control of Hamdok\u2019s supporters.\n\nThe ministry called for resistance against the coup. It said tens of thousands of people opposed to the takeover had taken to the streets and had faced gunfire near the military\u2019s headquarters in the capital Khartoum.\n\nAt least 12 people were injured in clashes, a doctors\u2019 committee said on its Facebook page, without providing further details.\n\nThe director of Hamdok\u2019s office, Adam Hereika, told Reuters that the military had mounted its takeover despite \u201cpositive movements\u201d towards an agreement with Hamdok, following meetings with a visiting U.S. special envoy, Jeffrey Feltman.\n\nA Reuters journalist in Khartoum saw joint forces from the military and from the powerful, paramilitary Rapid Support Forces stationed in the streets of Khartoum.\n\nThey restricted civilians\u2019 movements, as protesters carrying the national flag burnt tires in different parts of the city.\n\nThe information ministry said military forces had arrested civilian members of the Sovereign Council and members of the government.\n\nIn a statement sent to Reuters, it called on Sudanese \u201cto block the military\u2019s movements to block the democratic transition\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe raise our voices loudly to reject this coup attempt,\u201d it said.\n\nSudan had been on edge since a failed coup plot last month unleashed recriminations between military and civilian groups, who have been sharing power following the toppling of long-serving ruler Omar al-Bashir two years ago. read more\n\nSince Bashir was brought down by street protests, a political transition has seen Sudan emerge from international isolation under Bashir\u2019s nearly three-decade rule.\n\nElections were to be held by the end of 2023.\n\nThe military was meant to pass leadership of the joint Sovereign Council to a civilian figure in the coming months.\n\nBut transitional authorities had struggled to move forward on issues including whether to hand Bashir over to the International Criminal Court, where he is wanted for war crimes.\n\nIn recent weeks, civilian officials had claimed credit for some tentative signs of economic stabilisation after a sharp devaluation of the currency and the lifting of fuel subsidies.\n\nFeltman, the U.S. special envoy who was visiting Sudan on Saturday and Sunday, tweeted that the United States was deeply alarmed at reports of a military takeover, which would put U.S. aid at risk.\n\nThe United Nations, Arab League and African Union all expressed concern. Sudan\u2019s political leaders should be released and human rights respected, the AU Commission Chair Moussa Faki Mahamat said in a statement, calling for talks to resume between the military and civilian wings of the transitional government.\n\nAside from the political tension, Sudan is in the midst of a deep economic crisis, marked by record high inflation and shortages of basic goods, beginning to show signs of easing amid flows of international aid. Western states have warned that any military takeover would put that financial assistance at risk.\n\nMilitary forces stormed Sudanese Radio and Television headquarters in Omdurman, the twin city of Khartoum, and arrested employees, the information ministry said on its Facebook page.\n\nTwo major political parties, the Umma and the Sudanese Congress, condemned what they called a coup and the campaign of arrests.\n\nThe internet appeared to be down in Khartoum. Al-Arabiya reported the airport was shut and international flights suspended.\n\nPOPULAR TECHNOCRAT\n\nHamdok is an economist and former senior U.N. official who was appointed as a technocratic prime minister in 2019 and is well respected internationally.\n\nThough popular with pro-democracy civilian groups, he has struggled to keep the transition going due to political splits between the military and civilians and the pressures of the economic crisis.\n\nFamily sources told Reuters that military forces had stormed the house of Hamdok\u2019s media adviser and arrested him.\n\nMany of the ministers and officials who had been arrested had been intensifying their rhetoric towards the military in the past few weeks.\n\nThe Sudanese Professionals Association, a main activist coalition in the uprising against Bashir, called on supporters to mobilise after what it called the arrest of cabinet members.\n\n\u201cWe urge the masses to go out on the streets and occupy them, close all roads with barricades, stage a general labour strike, and not to cooperate with the putschists and use civil disobedience to confront them,\u201d the group said in a statement on Facebook.\n\nAs tensions built this month, a coalition of rebel groups and political parties aligned themselves with the military and called on it to dissolve the civilian government, staging a sit-in outside the presidential palace.\n\nLast week, several cabinet ministers took part in big protests in several parts of Khartoum and other cities against the prospect of military rule.\n\nReported by Reuters via NAN",

          "text": "The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), has called on Nollywood celebrities to join hands in the fight against human trafficking as they play a vital role in the society.\n\nNAPTIP Director-General (DG), Dr Fatima Waziri, made the call at the premiere of the movie \u2018Enslaved\u2019, a film based on the fight against human trafficking and child labour in Nigeria.\n\nThe DG, represented by Mrs Jessica Arikpo, the Assistant Chief Intelligence Officer from the Public Enlightenment Department of NAPTIP, said that the film industry, both in Nigeria and across the world, had over the years played a vital role in the agency\u2019s agenda of meeting its mandate.\n\n\u201cBetween 2014 and 2015, the Agency produced a weekly TV series, Itohan, and I\u2019m sure some of you must have watched it on NTA, the result of that programme was quite huge as it made a lot of impact in the lives of young people.\n\n\u201cNAPTIP has no doubt that the movie would continue where other movies, including Itohan stopped, in portraying the dangers of human trafficking and child labour and smuggling of migrants.\n\n\u201cI am persuaded that the premiere of this movie and the lunch of one community campaign will kick-start a new era in the use of various awareness creation platforms in fighting human trafficking.\n\n\u201cI want to also use this medium to call on the Nollywood celebrities to kindly join forces with NAPTIP in the fight as they play a vital role in our society in spreading anti-human trafficking, especially to the youths who watch their parts in shows and movies.\n\n\u201cThese young Nigerians look up to them as role models so it should become part of their cooperate social responsibility to join NAPTIP to fight human trafficking,\u201d she said.\n\nEnslaved, directed and produced by Ugochukwu Ohuonu, aka Twenty Mouth is another true-life story on human trafficking, child labour, and sexual exploitation of young Nigerian girls who are trafficked within states to big cities to further their education by people they hold in high esteem in their communities.\n\nBut on arrival to the city, some were introduced into prostitution and compelled to make daily returns in exchange for their livelihood.\n\nAs a result, many lost their lives for money ritual purposes by men who patronise them. Some were infected with diseases because the men do not consent to the use of condoms and some were not infected but were pregnant as a result of unprotected sex.\n\nTheir babies were sold and if they die in the process, the perpetrators clean up the mess. More so, others were sold as domestic slaves who are subjected to all manner of tortures and stopped from attending school.\n\nSpeaking also, the Keynote speaker, Nwolu Okerewa, said he was glad to be a part of one community campaign. A campaign that was necessary at a time Nigeria and the world were fighting the rampant crime of human trafficking and child labour and enslavement.\n\nOkerewa said, \u201cI am really delighted to be a part of this initiative on human trafficking or modern day slavery which are all names that are used interchangeably to refer to crimes whereby traffickers exploit and profit at the expense of others.\n\n\u201cBy compelling them to perform labour or engage in commercial sex, the United States department of State in 2010 reported that Nigeria is a source, transit and destination for countries for women and children subjected to trafficking in persons.\n\n\u201cUsing a network of people, recruitment is done from rural areas. We are particularly interested in rural areas in Nigeria where women and girls are subjected to involuntary domestic servitude and sexual exploitation.\n\n\u201cAnd boys are forced to labour as street vendors and domestic servitude in mining and begging,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged all concerned Nigerians to make the campaign a part of sensitising their neighbours and people around to stop the proliferation of human trafficking.\n\nHe encouraged everyone to be an agent in ensuring that the evil was brought to bear.",

          "text": "An Islamic organisation, Muslim Rights Concern, has reaffirmed its preference for a presidential candidate from the Yoruba Muslims.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, MURIC argued that no Yoruba Muslim has ever occupied Aso Rock either as a president or vice president since independence in 1960 whereas three Yoruba Christians have enjoyed that luxury.\n\nThe group subsequently listed eight names of some Yoruba Muslims \u201ccompetent\u201d to lead the country.\n\nThe statement titled, \u20182023: On Yoruba Muslim presidential candidate we stand\u2019, was signed by the director and founder of the organisation, Prof. Ishaq Akintola.\n\nAmong those mentioned by MURIC are the National Leader of All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu; ex-APC National Legal Adviser, Muiz Banire; JAMB registrar, Ishaq Oloyede; and Lagos Deputy governor, Dr. Kadiri Obafemi Hamzat.\n\nOthers are Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, ex-Osun State Governor, Rauf Aregbesola, Senator Fatai Buhari from Oyo North, and ex-Lagos Commissioner for Home Affairs, Dr. AbdulLateef AbdulHakeem.\n\nMURIC said, \u201cAs public discourse in Nigeria zeroes in on the 2023 presidential election, we see the need for us to reiterate our position on the need for a Yoruba Muslim presidential candidate from the South West. This we find necessary in view of the proclivity of Nigerians for mass amnesia.\n\n\u201cNo Yoruba Muslim has emerged as president since independence. Mathew Olusegun Obasanjo has been president twice: once as a military head of state (1976\u201379) and as a civilian president (1999 -2007). Earnest Shonekan was an interim head of state (August 1993 \u2013 November 1993). Today we still have a Yoruba Vice President who is also a Christian (Professor Yemi Osinbajo).\n\n\u201cAgain, it is important to state that this is not a categorical statement for the rejection of a Christian presidential candidate in Nigeria. This statement is on the South West alone. We have no objection to a Christian from any other part of Nigeria emerging as the presidential candidate. What we are saying is that a Muslim should be picked if the 2023 presidential candidature is zoned to the South West by any political party.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, MURIC has no favourite political party in this affair. Any political party that picks a Yoruba Christian as its presidential candidate come 2023 should simply kiss Yoruba Muslim votes goodbye. No political party should tell us that they cannot find competent Yoruba Muslims.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Ahmed Tinubu is a Muslim, a manufacturer of leaders and a mentor of performers. Dr. Muiz Banire is a Muslim. Lagos deputy governor, Dr. Kadiri Obafemi Hamzat, is a Muslim. Fashola, Aregbesola, Oloyede, Senator Fatai Buhari, Dr. Abdul Lateef Abdul Hakeem, etc are Muslims of Yoruba stock who have distinguished themselves in public office. Stop marginalizing Yoruba Muslims. We have the stuff. On Yoruba Muslim presidential candidate we stand.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nThe challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to both the Nigeria and global economy in 2020, became an innovative opportunity for First Bank of Nigeria which came up with Fast Track ATM, the next generation ATM, the first of its type in Africa. AMAKA IFEAKANDU looks at the benefits customers stand to gain. .\n\nCOVID-19 as new opportunities\n\nThere is no denying the fact that despite its debilitating effects and disruption of the world economy in 2020, the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic opened new vistas and opportunities for innovation in Fintech across the globe.\n\nClearly, the rapid spread of the virus led to the complete shutdown of economic activities, including markets, local and international airports, hospitals, churches, schools and most small businesses in Nigeria and across the globe. This worrying development brought to the fore the importance of e-banking in the country.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, financial institutions, especially the nation\u2019s commercial banks, were encouraged to explore and deploy online banking services for customers with majority of the staff having to work from home as directed by their managements. Though this directive for banks officials to operate from home promoted, to some extent, the upsurge in technological developments within the financial system, the situation became a threat to some bank customers, especially those with no access to mobile applications to conduct transactions.\n\nNo doubt, the situation made things difficult for these customers as it caused a major disruption to their livelihoods arising from restrictions of movement at both the federal and state levels.\n\nBlessing in disguise?\n\nHowever, this sudden shutdown of the economy also proved a blessing in disguise, as the nation\u2019s financial industry became more innovative with the launch of different electronic applications aimed at meeting the customers\u2019 demands as well as reduce physical human contact as part of hygienic protocols to check the spread of the pandemic in the system.\n\nThe economic hardship arising from COVID-19 automatically changed the lifestyle of individual bank customers with some of them having no option than to embrace electronic banking App for payment of goods and services.\n\nFirst Bank Innovation in e-banking\n\nExpectedly, First Bank of Nigeria (FBN) Limited, the nation\u2019s premier commercial bank, was among the financial institutions that came up with a new App which enabled its customers to use their phones in initiating the process of cash withdrawals from their various bank accounts at the comfort zone of their home. In a pacesetting move, the Bank unveiled the FastTrack ATM, a Next Generation ATM, the first of its kind in Africa.\n\nLaunched as part of its effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the First Bank Fast Track ATM is fully designed to promote financial activities on the ATM and devoid of any form of physical interaction with the machine.\n\nAccording to the bank, the introduction of the FastTrack ATM, done in partnership with Inlaks, enables customers to carry out cash withdrawals without having to touch the interface of the ATM.\n\nOperations of Fast Track ATM\n\nThe bank also explained that with the FastTrack ATM, widely referred to as \u2018Touchless Solution\u2018, the customer carries out the banking transaction by using his or her mobile phone to perform the needed steps designed originally for implementation on the ATM\n\nBy using one\u2019s phone, the transaction is carried out \u2013 in advance \u2013 through the Bank\u2019s USSD or mobile banking option. Upon the schedule, the customer visits the FastTrack ATM to complete the transaction by tapping a contactless Near Field Communication (NFC) card on the ATM to withdraw his or her cash\n\nWith the next Generation ATM, First Bank customers can leverage the real-time mobile banking capabilities of their cell phones to activate cash withdrawals at the FastTrack ATM. The ATM solution is the bank\u2019s response to control the spread of COVID-19, whilst promoting the safety of customers that carry out transactions at the ATM.\n\nBenefits\n\nSpeaking on benefits of the Fast Track ATM, Chief Executive Officer, First Bank of Nigeria Ltd, Dr. Adesola Adeduntan said: \u201cAt First Bank, we are driven to provide seamless financial solutions to ensure our customers are able to timely carry out their transactions in safe, secured, and efficient ways, thereby putting them ahead in digital banking, not just in Nigeria but Africa.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to set the pace regarding the use of the Next Generation ATM in Africa which enables customers to use their mobile phones to remotely initiate ATM-based cash withdrawals via our *894# USSD banking or FirstMobile application. At the core of our strategy lies innovation which is critical to adapting to the new normal.\u201d\n\nAlso, Managing Director, Inlaks, Olufemi Adeoti, said, \u201cgiven that consumers are more adaptable to mobile technology, Inlaks, Africa\u2019s leading Information Technology Solutions provider, together with Hyosung ATM OEM entered into partnership with First Bank to introduce the first fully compliant COVID-19 FinTech ATM.\n\n\u201cThis is in alignment with the \u2018new normal\u2019 desired customer experience which includes digitalization and delivering secure contactless cash access to the bank\u2019s FirstMobile customers for better user experience, simplicity, speed, and conveniences.\u201d\n\nAchievements in card issuing\n\nApart from launching of Fast Track ATM, the bank has been at the forefront of promoting digital payment in the country. The bank was recognized as the first financial institution in Nigeria and the West Africa sub-region to issue 10 million ATM cards to customers across the country. The bank was the second in Africa to achieve the milestone.\n\nThe bank achieved these feats through the trusts in its industry-leading innovative banking solutions by over 10 million customers on its USSD *894# banking platform.\n\nSince its establishment in 1894, FirstBank has consistently built relationships with customers focusing on the fundamentals of good corporate governance, strong liquidity, optimised risk management and leadership.\n\nThe bank, has over the years, led the financing of private investments in infrastructure development in the Nigerian economy by playing key roles in the federal government\u2019s privatisation and commercialisation schemes.\n\nWith its global reach, First Bank provides prospective investors wishing to explore the vast business opportunities available in Nigeria, an internationally competitive world-class brand and a credible financial partner.",

          "text": "Transactions on Point of Sale (PoS) in Nigeria have hit N15.67 trillion in the last five fiscal years, Blueprint can authoritatively report.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) introduced the PoS system and agent banking in 2013 to achieve financial inclusion and develop a cashless economy.\n\nHowever, this novel system of business transactions was not well embraced until recently when Nigerians troop to the PoS points to facilitate their businesses.\n\nTransactions\n\nBlueprint gathered that over 146.3 million transactions were made in 2017, with N1.4 trillion as total transactions. In 2018, the worth of PoS transaction rose to N2.3 trillion after a total of 285.9 million transactions were recorded. In 2019, PoS transactions increased by 53.42 per cent to 438.61 million transactions with the total value increasing by 37.97 per cent to N3. 21 trillion. In 2020, transactions rose by 49.51 per cent to 655.75 million as the total value increased by 47.50 per cent to N4.73 trillion.\n\nAvailable data has also shown that point of sale transactions carried out in the first eight months of 2021 stood at N4.06 trillion, representing a 45% increase compared to N2.81 trillion recorded in the corresponding period of 2020. This is based on data obtained from the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS).\n\nAccording to the data, PoS transactions hit its highest levels for any eight-month period, increasing by 44.8% and 108% compared to N2.81 trillion and N1.96 trillion recorded in the similar period of 2020 and 2019 respectively.\n\nSimilarly, the volume of PoS transactions recorded between January and August 2021 stood at 619.3 million, increasing by 61.8% compared to 382.9 million recorded in the corresponding period of 2020. It is worth noting that a total of 686,577 PoS terminals were deployed nationwide as of August 2021, representing an 84.4% increase compared to 372,333 recorded as of the same period of 2020.\n\nThe value of POS transactions in the country for the month of August 2021 stood at N504.88 billion, lower than N554.67 billion recorded in the previous month, while it rose marginally compared to N503.91 billion carried out in June 2021.\n\nA total of N4.06 trillion worth of POS transactions have been carried out so far in this year, making a grand total of N15.67 trillion.\n\nIn terms of volume, 146.27 million, 285.89 million, 438.61 million, and 655.75 million transactions were carried out in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively, while 619.28 million transactions have so far been recorded by August in the current fiscal year.\n\nThe figures indicate an increased interest in the use of PoS as a transaction method.\n\n307,000 PoS machines\n\nAlthough the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) data shows there were about 307,000 PoS machines in Nigeria as at March 2021, only167,000 are active.\n\nSimilarly, there are 30,000 Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and over 6,000 bank branches, according to the organization.\n\nWhile agent banking promotes financial inclusion, it might not usher the nation into a cashless economy, experts have noted.\n\nIronically, a random survey of several PoS points shows cash withdrawals make up 90% of their daily transactions.\n\nDigital banking\n\nDigital banking is the new route that financial service providers and regulators are travelling to achieve better results, increase transaction speed and security.\n\nToday\u2019s reality demands that real-time payments and banking capabilities should be available whenever and wherever they are needed by customers.\n\nThe road to seamless digital banking and improved access to financial services is long and challenging in Nigeria no doubt.\n\nImproving financial inclusion, access to credit and getting transactions done at the lowest possible cost are challenges banks and other financial institutions are grappling with.\n\nStill, banks and other financial institutions with eyes on the future are taking advantage of digital banking that is defining the sector\u2019s successes and reach.\n\nRise in PoS transactions\n\nBank customers are also not left behind, as majority are now thinking and acting digital.\n\nThere has been rise in PoS, ATM, mobile and internet banking activation and usage across different segments of the economy, including among the unbanked at the base of the society.\n\nHowever, there are still challenges facing the sector, some of which the PoS payment agents have eased when customers don\u2019t get paid at the ATM points.\n\nThe PoS became handy for Nigerians, especially during the coronavirus pandemic era, where they needed to reduce the number of people gathering in the banking halls.\n\nIt is even more convenient for people to use the PoS by paying service fee, which people considered as being in order when viewed against the backdrop of the cost of going to the banks to transact similar business.\n\nThe good side\n\nOn the good side of it, some financial experts said it has created jobs for a lot of people, and also liberalised the banking sector by ensuring people no longer gather in the banking halls which often results in waste of man-hours.\n\nDespite the fact that the ATMs were still working, some customers still use the PoS, depending on the sense of urgency of their need and services.\n\nInsecurity may also be responsible for the proliferation of the PoS business as explained by Mr. Tunde Mabawonku, the chief financial officer of Wema Bank.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe insecurity in the country has its own challenges. Since 2018, we had almost six robbery attacks. In Iju-Itaogbolu, Osun state. we were burgled; we suffered major loss. For us, the money lost was not the problem, but the loss of lives, where they killed staff; killed customers. This is what you can\u2019t get back. Some of the locations where we have closed down, once there is a business justification, we will go back.\n\n\u201cFor example, Igbara Oke, we are reopening it; we suffered robbery attack but we are going back. Iyin Ekiti, we also had robbery attack, we are going back. Okuku in Osun state, we had robbery attack. We had a meeting. We said, let things calm down a bit. So, we take justification, look at it and determine when to go back.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we try to do is turn to technology through agency banking, through other means, that, at least, get the community transacting pending when we see that the business is justified, then we will come and rebuild the branch.\u201d\n\nPreference over ATM\n\nMany bank customers across the country have complained of the difficulty in trying to withdraw cash from the ATMs.\n\nIn some cases, they said the machines often come up to say they were empty and had no money to dispense.\n\nTimothy Alkali, a civil servant, lamented that due to the inefficiency of the ATM platform, he recently lost N25,000 as he attempted to use the PoS machine around his abode in Nyanya.\n\nAlkali said he was debited while the cash was not given to him and that he had to visit his bank to retrieve his cash.\n\nHe further said, up till date, he was yet to be credited one month after.\n\nAnother ATM user, Stanley Egbodo in Aso Pada, who spoke on his experience, complained that \u201cif one is not careful, the card may be compromised because some PoS operators can easily copy a customer\u2019s details in the process of one trying to withdraw cash. I narrowly escaped being swindled.\u201d.\n\nBut in their separate reactions, some ATM users namely, Abiodun and Mohammed said, the ATMs were being starved of fund by bankers to the advantage of PoS because \u201dthe bankers are behind the PoS.\u201d\n\nAbiodun said: \u201cThe bankers are not fair to us. The ATM charges low while PoS, though convenient, charges higher. The bank staff do this so they can get their profit from the pay centres.\u201d\n\nSharing similar view, Mohammed said \u201cthe bankers are ripping us off. They are making a lot of money from PoS, and it is therefore convenient for them to starve the ATMs of fund.\u201d\n\nConspiracy theory\n\nFrustrated, many customers blamed the proliferation of agent banking as responsible for this, while others alleged conspiracy between the banks and its regulator, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nBut dismissing the allegation, its Director, Corporate Communications, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, described the conspiracy theory as preposterous.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is highly preposterous for anyone to say that CBN connived with banks to deprive people of their money. The primary purpose for which ATMs were introduced is to ease the sufferings of Nigerians and to make banking easier and convenient.\u201d\n\nHowever, the apex bank said it was still investigating the matter and the results would be made known.\n\nBanker faults CBN\u2019s claim\n\nBut contrary to the CBN\u2019s position, a banker with one of the new generation banks in the country, who pleaded anonymity, disclosed that it was a way to make extra income for bankers and others.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is not a secret, the bank I work for is aware, they offer me cash and I, in turn, make money for myself and the bank. We noticed people these days don\u2019t have patience to queue at the ATM, they prefer the PoS, which is fast and easy; that is why we get assistance from our banks. They(banks) make profit from every transaction.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s for convenience\u2019\n\nExperts in the nation\u2019s financial Industry have said the increase in PoS patronage was due to convenience and the frustration experienced by customers at ATM points.\n\nChief Research Officer Investdata Consulting Ltd, Lagos, Ambrose Omorodion said the use of PoS seems to be more attractive or convenience for Nigerians because it promotes the cashless policy of the CBN.\n\nHe said with the use of genuine PoS, bank customers were less exposed to robbery attack and misplacement of money.\n\nHe said: \u201cATM is good for quick cash but its exposure to attack is high, even at the point of withdrawals. Though there are some fraudulent activities carried out by PoS operators or their owners when customers withdraw money, but those frauds can be checked or control.\u201d\n\nAdmitting that no system is perfect, he said with the advent of technology, CBN can further put measures in place to track the fraudulent activities among PoS operators.\n\nA financial analyst, Mr Chudi Okagbue, said bank customers patronised PoS regularly because they were faced with the ATM challenges of not being been able to dispense cash.\n\nHe said:\u201cAs you want to withdraw money through ATM in some cases, the machines will signal no money to dispense or there is no network.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe issue of no money or no network while using ATM is frustrating, especially for those that do not have alternative means to get cash or if it happened in an area where you will not have access to banking halls.\n\n\u201cIt is better for one to do transaction with PoS as their operators are staying within the environment we live, so going to the bank or ATM is another stress and waste of time because the way PoS is booming, some financial institutions acquire the PoS machine and engage vendors to work for them and remit to the managers.\u201d\n\nHe stated that apart from banks, there were so many outlets whose business it is to acquire many PoS machines and give out to willing vendors to operate and bring returns.\n\n\u201cIf the acquisition of POS is from banks alone, it might not be everywhere as it is today,\u201d he added.\n\nLike ATMs, Okagbue said, PoS operators also faced challenge of network services, \u201cbut because most of their customers are people they know one-on-one, they can do the transaction later.\u201d\n\nOn PoS locations\n\nHowever, in Abuja, most PoS operators said they avoid situating their kiosks close to any ATM machine because many bank customers actually prefer using the ATM to patronising them (PoS operators) because of their higher charges.\n\nYohana Sadiq, a PoS operator in Kubwa area of Abuja, said: \u201cWhen you withdraw N10,000 using your ATM card on my PoS, I\u2019ll charge you N150 for that transaction.\n\n\u201cSome customers would say it\u2019s too high but the banks also charge us on many fronts. The profit margin is extremely low. Most times, I don\u2019t keep more than N300,000 cash with me at any given time because of security and demand.\u201d\n\nMonday Akpan, another PoS operator, said most people now dread ATMs because their cards could be swallowed by faulty machines and they also risk being attacked by thieves.\n\n\u201cThese days, some ATMs do not have sufficient cash. We are now hot cakes,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Moses Akin, many PoS operators were funded by bank staff: \u201cI\u2019m aware of about three owned by bankers. They ensure they never run out of cash. But this business is really not lucrative, especially if you\u2019re not in a market environment.\u201d\n\nDowntown Mararaba in Nasarawa state, Priscilla Ayuba, a PoS operator in Aso Kucha, told Blueprint that getting funds from the bank is not difficult because she is an agent.\n\nWhile saying the business is very competitive, she noted that \u201cyou either gain or lose, depending on how you handle it. Sometimes, you do transfer and you may get fake alert and pay the customer, but you may never get credited or when you overpay a customer you lose as well.\u201d\n\nShe pointed out that most PoS were not owned or funded by the banks to starve the ATM platforms, but rather \u201cPoS is taking banking nearer to the people and boosting financial inclusion policy of the CBN.\u201d\n\nAyuba, however, said \u201csome operators were less knowledgeable about the system and how it works, such persons lose money often times and would subsequently close shop.\u201d\n\n\u2018CBN should regulate\u2019\n\nOn his part, Mr. Festus Ogwu, a legal expert, said: \u201cI see that part of these PoS operators is the extension of the private business of the bankers. It is a sort of bringing double interest in the banking transactions.\n\n\u201cAnd in that circumstance, loyalty becomes a question here. Even if anything like that is to be done, it should be properly organised. The CBN has directives, orders and regulations. But it has not taken time to look at that level of operation. The CBN should regulate what goes on in the PoS vendors\u2019 operations. I doubt if CBN has a data of PoS operators in this country.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Elvis Paul, a PoS operator, admitted some bank staff operate PoS business but that they have no right to stock money and starve ATM machines.\n\n\u201cFor the question, yes, some banks\u2019 staff really have PoS stands but that\u2019s not to say they have the right to stock money for their PoS and allow the ATM machines of their banks to be starved of funds. It\u2019s totally false and wrong notion for anyone to have that belief.\u201d\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t starve ATMs\u2019\n\nDismissing the allegations, Head, Corporate Communications of Unity Bank, Matthew Obiazikwor, told Blueprint it\u2019s unfounded to say banks starved ATMs of fund to meet PoS\u2019 needs.\n\n\u201cThere is no mechanism or operational process for that to happen. All of them are alternate channels through which customers can access financial services of banks. So, it is not true. They\u2019re not operational reality,\u201d Obiazikwor said.\n\nObiazikwor said the number of customers using the ATM was more, and that the pressure exerted by customers on the cash in the machines, especially at weekends when staffers of the bank won\u2019t be there to reload cash into the machines.\n\nExplaining customers\u2019 preference for ATM, he said, \u201c90 per cent customers will choose the ATM over the PoS because with the ATM you\u2019re dealing directly with your bank and there may be no charges. ATM penetration is somewhat overwhelmed by the population. What is happening is that the uptake of the ATM channel is responsible for the shortage in service rendered.\u201d\n\nSome other bankers believed there could be a conspiracy where those who were supposed to load the ATM machines lodged the cash with their PoS cronies at a fee.\n\nSome even alleged that such funds were always in mint which they sprayed on celebrants at wedding, birthday ceremonies or other forms of celebration as the case may be.\n\n",
          "summary": "In 2019, PoS transactions increased by 53.42 per cent to 438.61 million transactions with the total value increasing by 37.97 per cent to N3.\nSimilarly, the volume of PoS transactions recorded between January and August 2021 stood at 619.3 million, increasing by 61.8% compared to 382.9 million recorded in the corresponding period of 2020.\nA total of N4.06 trillion worth of POS transactions have been carried out so far in this year, making a grand total of N15.67 trillion.\n307,000 PoS machinesAlthough the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) data shows there were about 307,000 PoS machines in Nigeria as at March 2021, only167,000 are active.\nHe said with the use of genuine PoS, bank customers were less exposed to robbery attack and misplacement of money.",

          "text": "\u2026\n\nCommander of a notorious group of bandits terrorising communities in Shiroro local government area of Niger state popularly called Alhaji Na Mata, has reportedly surrendered and handed over three AK47 rifles to the Joint Security Taskforce in Iburo general area of operation.\n\nBlueprint learnt that the commander voluntarily handed over himself and turned in the weapons after suffering devastating defeat in a recent encounter with the security taskforce.\n\nA source from the Iburo community said the commander carried out series of banditry-related attacks in the area before the security taskforce began operation some days ago to clear the bandits.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe Joint Security Task Force recorded this breakthrough at Iburo community during their operation in the area when the commander voluntarily surrendered himself and his weapons to the Joint Security Task Force. He decided to drop his weapons after two of his sons who were also members of his gang were killed during an encounter with the Joint Security Task Force.\u201d\n\nIt was learnt that his group is the third most notorious groups in the area and was responsible for a number of bloody attacks on communities around Shiroro and Munya local government areas.\n\n\u201cAfter the killing of his two children during an operation by the Joint Security Task Force, he decided to repent and surrender his weapons (about three AK 47 riffles) to the security agents,\u201d Blueprint further gathered.\n\nPolice Public Relation Officer (PPRO) in the state, DSP Wasiu Abiodun could not be reached for comment at the time of this report.\n\nIt was however gathered that the ongoing operation by the Joint Security Task Force, comprising local hunters and vigilantes, as well as the conventional security agencies has continued to yield positive results with the killing of scores of bandits in the last one month.\n\nIburo community has remained the epicentre of banditry before the taskforce began operation in the area.\n\nEbonyi\n\nIn a related development, some gunmen in the early hours of Sunday allegedly attacked Nigerian Police Division at Unwana, Afikpo North local government area of Ebonyi state and killed three policemen on duty.\n\nThe gunmen reportedly attacked the division at about 2am, killing one constable and two inspectors in the process.\n\nA source from the area who spoke to Blueprint said the gunmen masked their faces and one of them was killed by the policeman who repelled the attack.\n\n\u201cThey killed 3 policemen, one constable and two inspectors and the police killed one of the gunmen. Nobody knows the identity of the gunmen and Police have taken away their remains.\n\n\u201cThe incident happened around 2 am, nobody knows the route they came from, all we heard was gunshots for about 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, there is no information to know if they destroyed or stole anything from the police station. The men were masked but the one killed had his face unveiled by the police to ascertain his identity. He also had red clothe tied around his waist believing it was a charm,\u201d our source revealed. Spokesperson of the state Police commend, DSP Loveth Odah could not answer call put across to her by one of our reporters as at the time of this report.\n\nEditors want collaboration\n\nMeanwhile, the 17the All Nigerian Editors Conference has called for healthy and harmonious collaboration between the media and security agencies in the fight against insecurity across the country.\n\nThe conference also admitted insecurity was taking a huge toll on societal life and posting negative development indices in several areas.\n\n\u201cThe peace and development, which are germane to further advancement of Nigeria, cannot thrive in times of crises,\u201d the editors said , adding governments at all levels have a huge responsibility to defend, protect and provide for its citizens.\n\nThe positions were contained in a communiqu\u00e9 signed by the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) President Mustapha Isah and General Secretary Iyobosa Uwugiaren at the end of the conference held recently in Abuja, with theme \u201cMedia In Times of Crises: Resolving Conflict, Achieving Consensus.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem of insecurity confronting the country is taking a huge toll on societal life and posting negative development indices in several areas. That the insecurity crises stem from leadership failure that has bedevilled the country for many years\u2019\u2019, the communique stated.\n\nThe conference attended by 350 editors, security chiefs, and other stakeholders, noted: \u201cThere are fears in some quarters that editors and media professionals seem to have taken sides in the raging crises. That journalists and security agents who are first line responders to every flash points appear locked in mutual suspicion.\u201d\n\nThe conference resolved: \u201cGovernments at all levels have a responsibility to defend, protect and provide for its citizens. That agitations for self-determination, which are raging in the South-east, South-west and the South-south regions do not augur well for the unity of the country.\n\n\u201cThe conference called for an end to raging insecurity so that citizens can conduct their normal lives in an atmosphere of peace and concord. That there\u2019s need for healthy and harmonious collaboration between the media and the security agencies in the fight against insecurity.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for security agents to appreciate the role of journalists and media professionals and refrain from anything that will abridge it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conference also advised editors and other media professionals to ensure that they are conflict-sensitive and ensure they do not publish stories that are capable of inflaming ethnic, regional and religious passion, while calling for urgent need to tackle the monster of misinformation and sanitise the media against unprofessional and unethical behaviour.\n\n\u201cThe conference also called on government to support the survival of the media as part of the task of building the nation\u2019s democracy and avoid any acts that will put the media in chains.\n\n\u201cWhile calling on the federal government to confront issues that have given rise to the demands of the different self-determination groups, the conference advised it to endeavour to deal with the different sections of the country on the basis of fairness, equity and justice.\n\n\u201cThere is need for government to ensure that its policies and actions are sensitive to the multi ethnic and religious makeup of the country.\n\n\u201cGovernment needs to commit more resources to education, healthcare and tackle the rising costs of food and other social services,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 further stated.\n\nThe two-day conference was chaired by a veteran journalist, Ray Ekpu, with Group Managing Director, Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Malam Mele Kolo Kyari, as special guest of honour, and President, Newspapers Proprietors of Nigeria (NPAN), Malam Kabiru Yusuf, represented by NPAN Secretary Mohammed Idris Malagi who is also Publisher Blueprint newspapers as guest of honour.\n\nAlso in attendance were Kogi state Governor Yahaya Bello, representatives of Kaduna state Governor Nasir El Rufai (represented by the Special Adviser on Inter-Governmental Affairs, Hajia Hannatu Dalhat) and Osun state Governor Isiaka Adegboyega Oyetola(also represented by Deputy Chief of Staff Prince Abdullah Adeyanju Binuyo).\n\nOthers were Inspector General of Police Usman Alkali Baba (represented by Commissioner of Police Frank Mba, Force Public Relations Officer); Director General Department of Security Service (DSS) Yusuf Magaji Bichi (represented by its spokesperson, Dr Peter Afunanya), and Director General Nigerian Intelligence Agency (NIA) Ahmed Rufai Abubakar (represented by Mr Emma Engon Anzaku, Director, NIA) and Managing Director/CEO Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System For Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) Aliyu A. Abdulhameed among others.\n\nAnsar-ud-Deen tasks FG\n\nSimilarly, the Northern States Council Secretary of Ansar-ud-Deen Society Alhaji Isiaq Sanni has urged the federal government to expose the sponsors and people supporting banditry in Nigeria.\n\nSanni made the call at the 8th-day Fidau (prayer for a deceased person) of late chairman of Kaduna branch of ADS, Alhaji Liadi Adeyinka Olapade, who died penultimate Friday.\n\nHe said Olapade, who until his death was President Yoruba Community in Kaduna state and Muslim Council of Nigeria (MCON), lived, worked and died in advocacy for a united and secured Nigeria through promotion of citizen education.\n\n\u201cAlhaji Liadi Olapade was a philanthropist. The little things we have seen have shown that he is well loved. He did very well for Ansar-ud-Deen Society and humanity at large. Due to his passion for religion and education, which he said is the best way to fight insecurity, he accepted the nomination and represented Northern States Council of Ansar-ud-Deen as board of trustees member of Summit University, Offa.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that today, the insecurity that Olapade fought for still persists. Thus, we are calling on government to put in more effort to the fight against banditry and other security challenges, because their current effort is not enough to address the challenges. Government should expose those behind banditry, those sponsoring the insecurity, to let us know those who don\u2019t want Nigeria to progress,\u201d Sanni said\n\nAlso in his lecture, Missioner ADS Northern states Council, Alhaji Muyideen Ajani Bello, who was represented by Chief Imam of Ansar-ud-Deen Society, Zaria, Alhaji Tajudeen Akewusekisa, urged Muslims to prepare their exit from life.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe should all prepare for our exit because many good people have gone. Alhaji Olapade was one of the major donors and supporters of Summit University.\n\n\u201cHe was very diligent in supporting da\u2019awah. He did everything in religion, he believed in God as one. He was a devoted Muslim, a great philanthropist and a cheerful giver always putting smiles on the face of others. He donated generously towards Summit University. Two years ago, he came to Zaria with some of his friends on the occasion of our anniversary and donated generously.\n\n\u201cThere are three types of grave, you are left to chose which one you want. Some peoples\u2019 grave after death will be illuminated till the day of judgement. Some will remain in darkness in their graves; the unbelievers, those who are not true Muslims. Some will remain as if they are asleep till the day of judgment such as righteous humans devoted to their religions, who take their religion with seriousness. We should all look at where we are going, what is next for us.\u201d\n\nPresident State of Osun Indigenes Association and Public Relations Officer (PRO) Yoruba Community in Kaduna state, Alhaji Yunus Ajao Muibi urged Nigerian youth to emulate Alhaji Olapade. \u201cIf Alhaji Olapade could hold six leadership positions successfully, then the youth of today need to emulate him. He was an icon, a bridge builder. He was one of those who fought for the creation of Osun state. He was actively involved in Yoruba community for 25 years serving in various positions.\u201d",

          "text": "Abuja-Kaduna rail attack which led to the suspension of service by the Nigerian Railway Corporation NRC, the Minister of Transportation, Hon. Chibuike Amaechi, has said that the attack will expedite the procurement process of a digital security system that the Ministry had planned to put in place.\n\nAmaechi who spoke during an unscheduled assessment tour of the train service to ascertain the level of damage caused on the rail tracks after it was attacked by bandits with explosives, said that the Ministry will re-present the proposal for digital security system to Cabinet, so as to get their approval and proceed with installation.\n\nThe Minister who explained that the essence of the digital security system is to enable the Ministry know when there is an impact on the rail, reassured Nigerians that there will be improved security on the Abuja-Kaduna route.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe want to assure the public that beyond the physical presence of Police and the Military along this track, we will get a rail bus for patrol regularly so that we can see what is happening even before the train takes off, and it will be end-to-end.\n\n\u201cApart from this, there have not been any security challenges on this track. What this has done to us is that we would fasten the procurement process of the digital security system that we planned to put in place. It went to the Cabinet two weeks ago, and it was returned. So, we\u2019ll re-present it to the Cabinet to ensure that we get approval for the installation.\n\n\u201cThe essence of the digital security system is to enable us to know when there\u2019s an impact on the rail to forestall this kind of attack. We will get the Police involved so that they will be here before the installation of the digital facility\u201d, he said.\n\nAmaechi also pointed out that although he may not be happy that the attack occurred, it has, however, shown that Nigerian Engineers are now capable of constructing their own railway.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am not happy that the security breach took place, but what it has done is to show that we actually have the capacity to fix our rail. The essence of this is to make sure that by the time the Chinese leave, we should start the gradual process of constructing our own railway. The repair was done by our own Nigerian Engineers in record time and by tomorrow Saturday we will run the first train\u201d, he said.\n\nFor his part, the NRC Managing Director, Fidet Okhiria noted that the NRC will run more trains on the corridor so as to keep vandals away.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt\u2019s better to run more trains as running more trains would not give people the opportunity to tamper/interfere with the tracks, because a train passed from Abuja to Kaduna in not up to 30 minutes when the explosions were executed and planted.\n\n\u201cIf we have all the trains on the track, the people would have to work very hard to be able to plant explosives.\n\n\u201cSo tomorrow, we are running four trips so that we can run from Abuja to Kaduna and balance the train set while we are working on the locomotive that was affected, after fixing the locomotive, we would run our usual ten trips\u201d, he disclosed.",

          "text": "Worried by rising cases of pregnancy-related deaths, the National Blood Service Commission has vowed to drastically reduce the level of maternal mortality occasioned by blood loss during childbirth.\n\nSpeaking during a media briefing alongside sponsor of the Bill, now an Act of the Parliament, Hon. Abas Tajudeen, the Director-General of the agency, Dr. Omale Joseph explained that not less than 15 percent of every 1,000 women die due to blood loss during childbirth and urged Nigerians to imbibe the practice of donating blood.\n\n\u201cAs you donate blood, you\u2019re saving a life, and not only that, research has shown that people who donate blood regularly live more healthy\u201d, he submitted.\n\nAccording to the DG, the Commission was putting the mechanism in place to check sharp practices by hospitals in the use of blood for patients, adding that through its One Million Safe Blood Initiative, it was expected that safe blood will be accessible for Nigerians in the six geopolitical zones of the country at any point in time.\n\nSpeaking further, he said the Commission which had the three core mandates of \u201cregulation, coordination and ensuring the provision of safe blood to the people\u201d, gave the assurance that plans were already in top gear to ensure that wastage of stored blood is halted through the use of expired blood for the production of usable components, noting that safe blood had a viable lifespan of between 30 and 35 days.\n\nFielding question on how Nigerians could be encouraged to have their blood groups handy to help in cases of emergency, the DG disclosed that for a start, the Commission was already collaborating with the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) , to ensure that drivers\u2019 licenses are issued with the holder\u2019s blood IDs.\n\nEarlier Hon. Tajudeen had described President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s assent to the Bill as \u201ca very important milestone achieved in the health sector\u201d, as according to him, blood transfusion before now had been largely unregulated, with a lot of sharp practices involved.\n\nThe lawmaker said available statistics have shown that over 40 percent of voluntarily donated blood was unsafe for use, with the majority of donors doing so for monetary gains, adding that in some cases, recipients ended up being infected with diseases, but that with the Commission in place, a lot of such issues will be addressed.\n\nIt would be recalled the Commission\u2019s establishment Bill, which was introduced by Hon. Abas Tajudeen in the House of Representatives was passed in March 2021, got Senate\u2019s concurrence in June, and was subsequently signed into law by President Buhari.",

          "text": "Sudan\u2019s top general declared a state of emergency, dissolved the authorities leading country\u2019s democratic transition, and announced the formation of a new government after soldiers detained civilian leaders Monday in what activists denounced as a \u201ccoup\u201d.\n\nGeneral Abdel Fattah al-Burhan\u2019s announcement in a televised address came after armed forces detained figures of the government in charge of leading the transition to democracy since the April 2019 ouster of autocratic president Omar al-Bashir.\n\n\u201cTo rectify the revolution\u2019s course, we have decided to declare a state of emergency nationwide\u2026 dissolve the transitional sovereign council, and dissolve the cabinet,\u201d Burhan said.\n\nHis statement came as clashes erupted in the capital Khartoum, with soldiers firing live rounds at people who took to the streets to protest against the power grab.\n\nThe violence was largely centred outside the army headquarters in the capital hours after soldiers detained Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, ministers in his government and civilian members of Sudan\u2019s ruling council, the information ministry said.\n\nThey were taken away after \u201crefusing to support the coup\u201d, it said on Facebook.\n\nInternet services were cut across the country around dawn and the main roads and bridges into Khartoum shut, before soldiers stormed the headquarters of Sudan\u2019s state broadcaster in the capital\u2019s twin city of Omdurman, the ministry said.\n\nPeople took to the streets soon after, setting tyres ablaze and piling rows of bricks across roads to block them in protest against the military move, an AFP correspondent reported.\n\n\u201cMilitary forces have fired live bullets on protesters rejecting the military coup outside the army headquarters,\u201d the information ministry said.\n\nAround a dozen people have so far been wounded in the clashes, according to the Central Committee of Sudan Doctors, an independent medics union.\n\nREAD ALSO: Armed Forces Detain PM, Other Leaders In Sudan \u2018Coup\u2019\n\nInternational Concern\n\nThe power grab, which comes after weeks of tensions between the military and civilian figures sharing power since Bashir\u2019s ouster, was condemned by the international community.\n\nThe European Union called for the release of the civilian leadership and insisted \u201cviolence and bloodshed must be avoided\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe EU is very concerned about Sudan\u2019s military forces reportedly putting Prime Minister Hamdok under house arrest, as well as detaining other members of the civilian leadership, and we urge for their fast release,\u201d said European Commission spokeswoman Nabila Massrali.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Jeffrey Feltman said \u201cthe US is deeply alarmed at reports of a military takeover of the transitional government\u201d.\n\n\u201cAny changes to the transitional government by force puts at risk US assistance,\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\nThe UN described the detentions as \u201cunacceptable\u201d.\n\n\u201cI call on the security forces to immediately release those who have been unlawfully detained or placed under house arrest,\u201d said Volker Perthes, its special representative to Sudan.\n\nThe African Union and Arab League also expressed concern.\n\n\u2018Military Coup\u2019\n\nThe Sudanese Professionals Association, an umbrella group of trade unions which were key in leading the 2019 anti-Bashir protests, denounced what it called a \u201cmilitary coup\u201d and urged demonstrators \u201cto fiercely resist\u201d it.\n\nThe developments come two days after a Sudanese faction calling for a transfer of power to civilian rule warned of a \u201ccreeping coup\u201d, at a news conference that was attacked by an unidentified mob.\n\nBashir, who ruled Sudan with an iron fist for three decades, is behind bars in Khartoum\u2019s high security Kober prison.\n\nThe ex-president is wanted by the International Criminal Court over charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan\u2019s Darfur region.\n\nSince August 2019, the country has been led by a civilian-military administration tasked with overseeing the transition to full civilian rule.\n\nBut the main civilian bloc \u2014 the Forces for Freedom and Change \u2014 which led the anti-Bashir protests in 2019, has splintered into two opposing factions.\n\n\u201cThe crisis at hand is engineered \u2014 and is in the shape of a creeping coup,\u201d mainstream FFC leader Yasser Arman told Saturday\u2019s news conference in Khartoum.\n\n\u201cWe renew our confidence in the government, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, and reforming transitional institutions \u2014 but without dictations or imposition,\u201d Arman added.\n\nSudan\u2019s bankers\u2019 association and doctors\u2019 union on Monday declared campaigns of \u201ccivil disobedience\u201d.\n\nProtesters marched through the streets of Khartoum carrying the Sudanese flag.\n\n\u201cCivilian rule is the people\u2019s choice,\u201d and \u201cNo to military rule\u201d, some of them chanted.\n\n\u201cWe will not accept military rule and we are ready to give our lives for the democratic transition in Sudan,\u201d said demonstrator Haitham Mohamed.\n\n\u201cWe will not leave the streets until the civilian government is back and the transition is back,\u201d said Sawsan Bashir, another protester.\n\nRival Protests\n\nTensions between the two sides have long simmered, but divisions ratcheted up after a failed coup on September 21 this year.\n\nLast week tens of thousands of Sudanese marched in several cities to back the full transfer of power to civilians, and to counter a rival days-long sit-in outside the presidential palace in Khartoum demanding a return to \u201cmilitary rule\u201d.\n\nHamdok has previously described the splits in the transitional government as the \u201cworst and most dangerous crisis\u201d facing the transition.\n\nOn Saturday, Hamdok denied rumours he had agreed to a cabinet reshuffle, calling them \u201cnot accurate\u201d.\n\nThe premier also \u201cemphasised that he does not monopolise the right to decide the fate of transitional institutions.\u201d\n\nAlso on Saturday, Feltman met jointly with Hamdok, Burhan and paramilitary commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.\n\n\u201cFeltman emphasised US support for a civilian democratic transition in accordance with the expressed wishes of Sudan\u2019s people,\u201d the US embassy in Khartoum said at the time.\n\nAnalysts have said the recent mass protests showed strong support for a civilian-led democracy, but warned street demonstrations may have little impact on the powerful factions pushing a return to military rule.\n\nAFP",

          "title": "ICC Prosecutor Seeks Investigation Into Abduction Of Nigerian Schoolchildren",
          "text": "The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) is set to seek authorisation from the Pre-Trial Chamber of the court to open an investigation into cases of abduction of schoolchildren in several parts of Northern Nigeria.\n\nAlso to be investigated are the closure of schools, and the \u201cpersistent failure of Nigerian authorities\u201d at both the federal and state levels to end the abduction.\n\nThis is according to a statement on Sunday by Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP).\n\nAccording to the agency\u2019s Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, the ICC prosecutor\u2019s decision followed a petition sent to the court by SERAP.\n\nSERAP had in the petition dated 4 September 2021 urged the ICC prosecutor, Mr Karim A. A. Khan, QC, to \u201cpush for those suspected to be responsible and complicit in the commission of these serious crimes, to be invited and tried by the ICC.\u201d\n\nIn the petition, SERAP argued that, \u201cThe severe and lifelong harms that result from depriving children the right to education satisfy the gravity of harm threshold under the Rome Statute.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Low Passenger Turnout As Train Services Resume On Kaduna-Abuja Route\n\nResponding, the ICC prosecutor in a letter with reference number OTP-CR-363/21, and dated 22 October 2021 confirmed to SERAP that \u201cthe criteria for opening an investigation into a string of abductions and closure of schools in some parts of Nigeria have been met.\u201d\n\nThe letter signed on the prosecutor\u2019s behalf by Mark P. Dillon, Head of the Information and Evidence Unit, read in part: \u201cOn behalf of the Prosecutor, I thank you for your communication received on 13/09/2021, as well as any subsequent related information.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe preliminary examination of the petition is considered complete. Under Article 53 of the Rome Statute, the next step in the judicial process is for the Prosecutor\u2019s Office to prepare and submit a request to the Pre-Trial Chamber for authorisation to open an investigation on Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce submitted, the request will be made publicly available on the Court\u2019s website: www.icccpi.int.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour communication will be forwarded to the relevant team to be analysed, together with other related communications and other available information, in the context of any future investigations. We thank you for your interest in the ICC.\u201d\n\nSERAP deputy director, Kolawole Oluwadare said: \u201cBy this decision, the ICC prosecutor has taken a significant step toward ensuring that those suspected to be responsible for grave crimes against Nigerian schoolchildren are exposed, and held to account.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe victims of these crimes deserve justice. Impartial justice and reparation will deal a decisive blow to impunity of perpetrators, and improve access of Nigerian children to education. SERAP will work closely with the ICC to achieve these important objectives.\u201d\n\nSERAP\u2019s petition to the ICC prosecutor, read in part: \u201cSenior government officials know well or ought to know that their failure to prevent these crimes will violate the children\u2019s human rights and dignity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe absence of any tangible and relevant investigation or prosecution in Nigeria suggests that the authorities are unwilling or unable to carry out genuine investigation or prosecution of those suspected to be responsible for and complicit in the abduction of students.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe consequences of persistent abductions of students, closure of schools, and the failure to provide safe and enabling learning environments despite federal and state authorities yearly budgeting some N241.2 billion of public funds as \u201csecurity votes\u201d, are similar to those of the offences in article 7(1).\u201d\n\n\u201cMore than 10,000 schools have been reportedly closed in at least seven northern states over the fear of attack and abduction of pupils and members of staff. The states are Sokoto, Zamfara, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Niger and Yobe.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmong the string of abductions in Zamfara was the abduction of over 200 schoolgirls in the town of Jangebe in February. The latest abduction comes after widespread reports of abduction of students and closure of schools in many states of Nigeria, including in north-central Niger State where some 91 schoolchildren were abducted.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn estimated 1.3 million Nigerian children have been affected by frequent raids on schools by suspected terrorists. Some 13 million Nigerian children are out of school nationwide. According to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), more than 1,000 students have been abducted from schools in northern Nigeria since December 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cFamilies and parents have reportedly resulted to paying the terrorists thousands of dollars as ransom to secure the release of their children. An estimated $18.34 million was reportedly paid in ransoms between June 2011 and the end of March 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerian authorities have also failed and/or neglected to satisfactorily address the abduction of 276 schoolgirls from Chibok in 2014, which prompted the #BringBackOurGirls campaign. According to reports, more than 100 of those girls are still missing.\u201d\n\nNigeria is a state party to the Rome Statute and deposited its instrument of ratification on 27 September 2001, thus giving the court jurisdiction over crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes committed on its territory or by its nationals.\n\nThe ICC prosecutor decided to seek an investigation after undertaking a preliminary examination of the cases of abduction of children in the country.\n\nA three-member panel of ICC pre-trial judges will consider whether to grant the prosecutor\u2019s request, once it is submitted, to let the ICC step in as a court of last resort.\n\nJudges will rely on the materials submitted by the prosecution to determine whether there is a \u201creasonable basis\u201d to proceed. Victims and their families may also make their views known to the pre-trial chamber.\n\nIf the investigation identifies suspected perpetrators of the crimes alleged in SERAP\u2019s petition, prosecutors can ask judges to issue international arrest warrants, which can remain under seal to help authorities apprehend those charged.\n\nAs an international court of last resort, the ICC is mandated to bring to justice people suspected to be responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so.",

I commend officers of the Nigeria Correctional Service and other members of sister security agencies who provided perimeter security for our facility for fighting gallantly and holding the fort before the attackers were able to gain access to the awaiting trial section of the facility. However, those who escaped are already being pursued. Some have been rearrested, many more will still be captured,\u201d he said.\n\nGiving more details about those who escaped, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola noted that, 446 out of 907 escapees have been recaptured, whilst 69 never left the facility.\n\nRead Also: President Buhari To Participate In Investment Summit In Saudi Arabia\n\n\u201cAs of the last count, 446 of the escapees have been recaptured, leaving 392 still at large.

What we have reoccurring in recent times are external attacks on our facilities. We have been retraining our officers not just on securing those in lawful custody but in preventing external attacks.\n\n\u201cWe are collaborating with other security agencies in the country to make such attacks near impossible and where they do occur, the attackers will not live to regret it,\u201d the CG stated.\n\nOn the instruction given by the Minister of Interior to immediately begin remediation work on the facility, CG Nababa noted that work has begun already.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, workers are already on site fixing damaged doors, broken windows and mounting walls. Before the end of today, work would have been completed on it,\u201d Nababa stated.\n\nBefore leaving Oyo, the Minister\u2019s entourage paid a courtesy visit to the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III, and commiserated with him over the attack of the FG facility in his town.\n\n\u201cWe are here to commiserate with your majesty over the attack in your town less than 72hours ago.

          "text": "A senior U.S. diplomat on Sunday urged North Korea to refrain from additional missile tests and resume nuclear diplomacy, days after the North fired off its first underwater-launched ballistic missile in two years.\n\nSung Kim, the U.S. envoy on North Korea, spoke after meeting with South Korean officials to discuss North Korea\u2019s recent missile tests while nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang remain stalled.\n\n\u201cWe call on the DPRK to cease these provocations and other destabilizing activities, and instead, engage in dialogue,\u201d Kim told reporters, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\n\n\u201cWe remain ready to meet with the DPRK without preconditions and we have made clear that the United States harbors no hostile intent towards the DPRK,\u201d he said.\n\nLast Tuesday, North Korea fired a newly developed ballistic missile from a submarine in its fifth round of weapons tests in recent weeks.\n\nSouth Korean officials said the submarine-fired missile appeared to be in an early stage of development. That marked the North\u2019s first underwater-launched test since October 2019, and the most high-profile one since President Joe Biden took office in January.\n\nMissiles fired from submarines are harder to detect in advance and would provide North Korea with a secondary, retaliatory attack capability.\n\nTuesday\u2019s launch violates multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions that ban any activity by North Korea in the area of ballistic missiles. Kim said the test poses a threat to the international community and is \u201cconcerning and counterproductive\u201d to efforts to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nKim\u2019s South Korean counterpart, Noh Kyu-duk, said the two had an \u201cin-depth\u201d discussion on Seoul\u2019s push for a symbolic declaration to end the 1950-53 Korean War as a way to bring peace. Noh said he and Kim also reaffirmed that North Korea\u2019s issues of concern can be discussed once talks are restarted.\n\nThe U.S.-led talks on ending North Korea\u2019s nuclear program have been largely stalled since early 2019, when a summit between then-President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un collapsed due to disputes over U.S.-led sanctions on the North.\n\nThe Biden administration has repeatedly said it\u2019s ready to meet North Korea \u201canywhere and at any time\u201d without preconditions. But North Korea says a return to talks is conditional on the U.S. dropping what it calls hostile policy, an apparent reference to the sanctions and regular military drills between Washington and Seoul.\n\nBefore the submarine missile launch, North Korea had also tested several other new weapons systems over a six-week period, including its longest-range cruise missile and a hypersonic missile currently under development.\n\nThose weapons potentially put U.S. allies South Korea and Japan within striking range. Some experts say North Korea may also in coming weeks test a missile that could reach the American homeland in order to maximize its pressure campaign on the United States.",

Sylva said though the country currently produced about 1.3 million barrels per day, concerted efforts were being made to increase production to meet the OPEC quota.\n\nSylva gave the assurance at the weekend, during the 2021 graduation ceremony of Petroleum Training Institute (PTI), Effurun, Delta State.\n\nThe minister, who was represented by Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Dr. Nasir Gwarzo, said the Federal Executive Council (FEC) had mandated the ministry to meet the three million barrels per day production within the shortest time possible.\n\nSylva stated, \u201cSome of the strides of the petroleum ministry, one of which is the mandate to increase crude oil production to three million barrels per day. Today, we are producing about 1.3 million barrels per day. The ministry is putting all concerted efforts to meeting the current OPEC quota.\u201d\n\nSylva also disclosed that the rehabilitation of Port-Harcourt Refinery and Petrochemical Company was on course, adding that soon, that of Warri and Kaduna would commence as well.\n\nOn the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the minister said the committee set up for its implementation would ensure that PTI carried out its responsibility of human capital development in the oil and gas sector in the country.\n\n\u201cThe major stakeholdes like the OPTS, the Petroleum Ministry, the PTDF, NCDMB, the Petroleum Upstream Regulatory Commission and the Mid-stream and Downstream Regulatory Authority will be co-opted to ensure that PTI is supported with respect to policy achievement and funding,\u201d he assured.\n\nSylva commended the Principal and Chief Executive Officer of PTI, Dr. Henry Adimula, for the successes recorded by the institute established for training students for the oil and gas sector.\n\nDelta State Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, expressed satisfaction that the quality of training received by the graduating students would put them in good stead to compete with their contemporaries all over the world.\n\nOkowa, who was represented by the Commissioner for Education, Professor Patrick Muoghbare, called on the public and private sector and organisations as well as captains of industry to look inward to graduands of PTI in the bid to resuscitate the ailing oil and gas industry.\n\nThe Principal/Chief Executive Officer of PTI, Dr. Henry Adimula, disclosed that a total of 2,297 students were awarded the institute\u2019s Diplomas and certificates for 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 academic sessions.

          "text": "As the battle for controlling interest in FBN Holdings Plc deepens, all eyes will be on the company\u2019s share price movement on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX), as the major contenders move to consolidate their hold on the financial institution.\n\nCurrently, the majority shareholders are Chairman of Geregu Energy Group, Mr. Femi Otedola; Chairman of Globacom, Chief Mike Adenuga; current Chairman of FBNH, Mr. Tunde Hassan-Odukale, and Chairman of Honeywell Group, Oba Otudeko.\n\nSome of the major contenders would in the coming days seek to mop up more shares so as to increase their stake in the bank\n\nBy his acquisition of 1,818,551,625 units of shares of First Bank Holdings Plc (FBNH), amounting to a 5.07 per cent of its total issued capital, Otedola, last week formally became one of the majority shareholders in the bank.\n\nThe newest investor in the bank, going by his antecedents with the then Forte Oil, does not give up easily and he is an aggressive investor who would stop at nothing to get what he wants. This, according to an industry analyst, means the other majority investors need to prepare for the battle ahead.\n\nA statement signed by Company Secretary of the holding company, Mr. Seye Kosoko, dated October 23, 2021, and titled, \u201cNotification of Acquisition of Substantial Shareholdings in FBN Holdings Plc,\u201d informed the bank\u2019s stakeholders about Otedola\u2019s investment in the bank.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWe refer to our communication to the market dated October 22, 2021, on the above subject wherein we stated that we would inform the public of any substantial acquisition, upon receipt of notification from the shareholder.\n\n\u201cThis morning, October 23, 2021, FBN Holdings Plc received a notification from APT Securities and Funds Limited, that their client, Mr. Otedola Olufemi Peter, and his nominee, Calvados Global Services Limited, have acquired a total of 1,818,551,625 units of shares from the company\u2019s issued share capital of 35,895,292,791. Based on the foregoing, the equity stake of Mr. Otedola Olufemi Peter and his nominee in the company is now 5.07 per cent.\u201d\n\nAs at March this year, Otudeko was also said to be holding a total of five per cent of the holdco\u2019s total issued share capital. However, inside sources disclosed that Otudeko was currently in negotiation with Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc to sell Honeywell Flour, to partly pay off his loans at FBN Holdings.\n\nOn his part, Adenuga is said to have been buying more shares and his shareholding was said to be between five and seven per cent.\n\nIndications emerged yesterday that Hassan-Odukale and related parties owned about 5.36 per cent stake in FBN Holdings. The companies include Leadway Assurance Company Ltd, ZPC/Leadway Assurance Prem & Investment Coll Acct, Haskai Holdings Ltd, Leadway Capital & Trust Ltd and LAC Investments Ltd. Others are Leadway Properties &Investment Ltd, Leadway Holdings, OHO Investment/Oye Hassan-Odukale, and Leadway Pensure PFA.\n\nBut speaking with THISDAY, a leading industry analyst, who pleaded to remain anonymous, said, \u201cThe majority shareholders that were there before Otedola came on board were so comfortable; that was why they were not bothered about raising their stakes in the bank. But now that their ranks have been broken, everybody would intensify efforts to remain dominant shareholders.\n\n\u201cClearly, what the majority shareholders would do in the coming days is to pull shares together from other minority investors with a view that they would represent the interest of these minority shareholders on the board.\n\n\u201cSo, the question now is, who can pull investors together to be on their bloc? Because the truth is that if they decide to be buying shares from the stock market directly, none of them would be able to have controlling interest in the short term. So, the battle now is on who can galvanise investors to form a bloc.\u201d\n\nThe source, however, pointed out that in every organisation, there was always going to be one person or a group of people that would exercise control over the management, without which, things won\u2019t be properly defined in the organisation.\n\nThe expert continued, \u201cThat was the problem we saw in UACN Plc for some years until the emergence of the present majority shareholders. What it does is that it gives stability and that is how it has always been all over the world. So, over the years, at First Bank, there have always a group that has significant control, until the recent intervention by the CBN, which created a lacuna.\n\n\u201cSo, today Otedola has put himself up to become one of the kingmakers in the bank and now he would have a board position. But if he can galvanise other shareholders and if he is able to mop up substantial shares in the coming days, he might have enough to see him becoming the chairman of the bank.\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding, all these would require the approval of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nMeanwhile, THISDAY gathered from a reliable source that going by recent developments in the bank, Group Chief Executive Officer of FBN Holdings, Mr. UK Ekeh, might be preparing to step down from his position next month. It was learnt that Ekeh had indicated his decision not to continue as Group CEO, and had informed insiders that he had done five years as Executive Director of the defunct Diamond Bank Plc, five years as Executive Director of First Bank, and six years as Group CEO of FBN Holdco.\n\nThe CBN had in April reinstated the Chief Executive Officer of First Bank Nigeria Limited, Mr. Adesola Adeduntan, who was summarily retired by the then Otudeko-led board. Also, the central bank had retained Eke as CEO of FBN Holdings.\n\nObinna Chima",
