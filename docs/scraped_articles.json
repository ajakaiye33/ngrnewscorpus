It\u2019s just a clear case of murder.\n\n\u201cThe state Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, has, therefore, ordered that the matter be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, Panti, Yaba, for proper investigation and the culprits must be arrested and charged with murder.\u201d\n\nAdejobi added that Odumosu warned against jungle justice, explaining that such an action was inhuman, criminal and detrimental to the administration of criminal justice in the state and Nigeria at large.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nWhen you count the legal luminaries transforming Nigeria\u2019s socio-political landscape, Toye Sobande would likely be among your top three. A seasoned scholar, leadership expert and lawyer, Sobande\u2019s journey is one that has likely impacted your life, whether through him or through his mentees.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with his growth record, Sobande\u2019s passage into leadership development began since his childhood where he showcased his ambitious zeal and analytical-thinking skills at will, but they morphed fully from his undergraduate study days at the prestigious Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife, and continued to shine throughout his service year at the annual National Youth Service Corps.\n\nSobande was made the President, Corps Legal Aid Scheme, which is a Community Service Organisation for Law Graduates under the NYSC programme and he worked alongside the Legal Aid Council of Nigeria providing litigation services and also philanthropy centred on legal matters.\n\nSharpening his skills in corporate and commercial law, Sobande honed his talents in this field and went on to handle cases involving intellectual property law (including copyright, trademark and patent); civil cases bordering on banking, insolvency, construction and real estate, among a myriad of others.\n\nAlso read:\n\nAt this point, the budding legal expert had started nurturing a passion for leadership development and he took his challenges in his pocket and established a leadership school named Charis Leadership School, in OAU, where he taught university students about leadership development principles.\n\nSobande\u2019s training in the Nigerian Law School, the University of Buckingham, United Kingdom, propelled him for the zeniths he soars today. Bagging a World Trade Specialist designation, the young man went on to acquire an audacious portfolio working with the Citizens Advice Bureau, UK, the British Heart Foundation, among others. However, in his over 18 year-running career, Sobande\u2019s heart has been drawn to developing Africa, especially Nigeria.\n\nNot even his certifications and fellowships in Management Consultancy or his international memberships in Leadership development, or even his current doctoral studentship at Regent University, United States, where he studies strategic leadership, is enough to deter him from his pro-nationalistic ambitions.\n\nSobande is a man of the people, for the people and from the people. Indeed, he started off from the hearts of Ile-Ife as an Intern at Emmanuel Chambers, Chief Afe Babalola and Co, and even sojourned to the office of the Solicitor General and Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Justice, in Imo State, before his other stints in several law firms that sharpened him enough to chase his post-graduate degree in Buckingham, United Kingdom.\n\nSobande has always been a student of life and a staunch promoter of Leadership, Politics, and Governance. The former Student Union front runner and Secretary-General of the Lagos State Polytechnic Student Union, and Assistant National Secretary of the Nigerian Students Association (NANS) representing the South-West Region, always handed several cards of resilience whenever he was dealt a painful card by life. He never gave up on his dreams.\n\nToday, Sobande is a proud founder of Stephens Leadership Consultancy LLC, a boutique consulting firm offering creative insight and solutions to businesses and leaders registered to operate in the United States and Nigeria and he has engaged in several humanitarian projects, especially geared towards sponsoring educational fees of indigent students.\n\nHe is a weekly columnist with BusinessDay Newspapers and his column is Dubbed, \u201cThe Leadership Factory with Toye Sobande\u201d. Some of his other thought-leadership articles have been featured in other national publications such as Guardian Newspapers, Punch Newspapers, Vanguard Newspapers and Leadership Newspapers, where he has written extensively on the subjects of Leadership Practices and Human Capital Development in Organizations.\n\nHe has also been a regular guest on several broadcast outlets such as Silverbird Television, Nigeria Info 99.3 FM, Inspiration 92.3FM, Lagos Traffic Radio 96.1FM, Eko 89.7 FM, Arise News Television to name a few.\n\nFrom a child of astounding ambitions to a man of purpose, grit and vision, Sobande is one Nigerian championing leadership development and worth celebrating.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

Even if we are one million contestants, just one person will be elected; we have to disagree to agree in the APC. Everyone has his or her supporter but the most important thing is for us to come together and talk to our group. I am contesting and I have my followers but I want us to be orderly in whatever we are doing; not for us but those coming behind. They are observing and watching us as we organize ourselves.\u201d\n\nFormer Lagos State Assembly lawmaker, Mr Kabir Lawal said: \u201cAs regards this chairmanship tussle, I pray we all comport ourselves when an enlarged meeting is called.

The use of face masks is known to adversely impact on aspects of communication and this has created unique challenges for hearing-impaired people who may be put at a greater communication disadvantage than those with normal hearing\u201d.\n\n\u201cOften people will compensate by reading lips and may not realize or acknowledge the hearing loss but the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the difficulties faced by people with hearing and speech deficiencies in communicating,\u201d she explained.\n\nShe called on all Nigerians irrespective of their ages and occupations to utilise the opportunities offered by the organisation across its centres to check their hearing health status and obtain the necessary correctional fittings where necessary.\n\nOkeke-Igbokwe emphasised that some of the most common causes of hearing loss such as exposure to loud noise, ear infections, and ototoxicity are preventable. She also enumerated some of the strategies for reducing hearing loss include annual hearing screening, newborn hearing screening, good maternal and childcare practices, genetic counselling, identification and management of common ear conditions, and occupational hearing conservation programmes for noise and chemical exposure. Other strategies include the reduction of exposure to loud sounds in recreational settings and the rational use of medicines to prevent ototoxicity.\n\nShe appealed to the federal and state governments to assist in promoting awareness and creating programs and necessary environments to prevent hearing loss across Nigeria.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

I never came back, I became a snake that doesn\u2019t go back to where it has turned over its skin. This premises (Governor\u2019s office) became no go area for me. To imagine that in my life my return to this premises will be this glorious is something of emotion.\n\n\u201cThe first eight years, I was virtually declared persona non grata in Ogun state, well that is settled, those involved have come to apologise. Niran Molaolu was the first to come and apologise.\n\n\u201cMy name was sent to EFCC so many times. The EFCC investigated and investigated because everything was documented in files , they found nothing.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t come to Abeokuta not to talk of visiting the office of the Governor. The other eight years, that one also became problematic,\u201d he said.\n\nOsoba who expressed his joy for coming back to the Oke-Mosan Governor\u2019s office after 16 years of leaving office, said \u201cMr. Governor, you will not know how many hours you have added to my life with this action today. It maybe hours, it maybe weeks, days, it maybe years, but you have added something very great to my life today.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Abiodun paid glowing tributes to Osoba, saying the centre was meant to immortalise him.\n\nHe described Osoba as distinguished nationalist, statesman, achiever and a legendary penpusher whose brand of journalism should be emulated by the younger generation.\n\nThe governor added that the centre would accord journalists the opportunity to write their stories and do their jobs conveniently.",

The constitution is expected to put together the value, commitment, aspiration, interest and agreement of different groups, communities and individuals.\n\n\u201cAs polarizing as the issues are with meaningful engagement, all-inclusive participation and gathering public opinion we can resolve the contention and agree on some of the issues in the interest of our nation. And as I have always stated that the interest of our dear nation should be placed far above personal interest, the Governor said.\n\nThe Governor proposed that the idea of restructuring must be motivated by a generational responsibility to build a nation where justice and peace reign and made a call for devolution of power and allocation of more resources to the federating units.\n\nHe urged the review committee to critically work and concentrate on the defects of the 1999 Constitution and tap from the resources of constitutional reform veterans like Professor Oyebode, Bishop Ajakaiye, and Dr Kunle Olajide who participated actively in the 2014 National Conference in order to enrich their suggestions and recommendations.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman of the Consultation, Prof Akin Oyebode in his remarks described the 1999 Constitution as a military documents, adding that this was not the first time Ekiti would be participating in the reform of the country\u2019s constitution.\n\nHe lamented that the recommendations of the 2014 Constitutional Conference organised by the President Goodluck Jonathan administration have been conserved to an historical document.\n\nSome of the speakers, who made presentations at the forum included the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Olawale Fapohunda; Speaker Ekiti State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon Funminiyi Afuye represented by his Deputy, Hakeem Jamiu; Chief Judge of Ekiti State, Justice Ayodeji Daramola represented by Justice John Adeyeye; Chairman Traditional Rulers Council and Alawe of Ilawe Ekiti, Oba Ajibade Alabi, Bishop, Catholic Diocese of Ekiti, Rev Felix Ajakaiye and Chairman Ekiti State Civil Society Organisation, Professor Christopher Oluwadare.\n\nMajor issues raised at the conference included, the need for financial autonomy of the legislature and judiciary, state and religion, gender equality for women and girls, public revenue, fiscal federalism and revenue allocation, Nigeria police reform and security architectures, local government autonomy, electoral reforms and judicial reform.",

He said the 1999 Constitution is a unitary constitution masquerading as a federal constitution.\n\nHis words: \u201cMy own personal preference is that we should scrap this constitution (referring to the 1999 constitution) and adopt the 1963 constitution that can contain everything that is being agitated for now.\n\n\u201cWe adopt it, with amendments here and there, to make it accommodate states rather than regions, which we used to have. I think all these agitations will die down and everybody will be happy.\u201d\n\nSagay also recounted how the regional government controlled all aspects of his life while in secondary school. He said: \u201cWhen I was in secondary school, I knew nothing about the Federal Government, I only knew about Ibadan and Awolowo. The region controlled my life from A to Z.\n\n\u201cI knew nothing about the Federal Government. Everything worked perfectly, beautifully and happily. So, that is what we are missing. The regions competed. Nigeria developed fast. The regions kept what they produced, sent 20 per cent to the federal level, and then 30 per cent to a distributable level, which was then distributed to the regions, according to their needs.\n\n\u201cEverybody was happy. We just have to go back to that. Otherwise, Nigerians will not enjoy stability.\u201d\n\nSagay added: \u201cIf we can have a process which will be towards having a new constitution, it will be better. Until we have it, we can manage with what the National Assembly is doing but certainly, it is far from satisfactory but may result in an improvement of what we have now.\n\n\u201cBut, what we really need is a clear departure from what we have. What we have now is a unitary constitution parading itself as a federal constitution.\u201d\n\nHe also called for the implementation of the APC restructuring report, which had been abandoned by the party for inexplicable reasons.\n\nThe National Assembly is currently embarking on a nationwide public hearing, to give Nigerians an opportunity to make inputs in the current bid to amend 1999 constitution.\n\nUnder 1963 Republican Constitution, Nigeria had four regions \u2014 East, North, West, and Mid-West \u2014 with independent structures that reflected its peculiarities.\n\nIn recent times, there have been calls for restructuring and return to the regional system of government.",

          "text": "Lagos State All Progressives Congress (APC) Publicity Secretary Seye Oladejo writes on the achievements of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu as he marks his second year in office\n\nThe Lagos State All Progressives Congress (APC) is proud of the achievements of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who is marking his second year in office this week.\n\nThe Lagos State government has turned in an impressive mid-term report in spite of the unusual mammoth challenges occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic recession and the EndSars protest.\n\nHowever, the unexpected setback and distractions have not derailed the Sanwo-Olu administration from the fulfillment of its electoral promises.\n\nThe early sign that Lagosians were in for a blissful four year term was the well articulated THEMES agenda, which remain the main thrust of the social contract between the people and the government.\n\nThe acronym, THEMES, captures the whole essence of the expectations of our teeming populace on the delivery of the proverbial dividend of democracy by the government they wholeheartedly entrusted with their mandate, secured future and general well-being.\n\nTHEMES which is the acronym for Traffic Management and Transportation, Health and Enviroment, Education and Technology, Making Lagos a 21st Century Economy, Entertainment and Tourism and Governance and Security has become the marking scheme to access service delivery on the part of government and the fulfillment of its electoral promises.\n\nTraffic management and Transportation is a major challenge of mega cities the world over due to the over 20 million population of citizens whose survival largely depends on unhindered intra-city transportation that has implications for their economic activities, health and security.\n\nThe state government availed itself of the three modes of transportation of roads, rail and waterways.\n\nThe State Government embarked on the massive construction and rehabilitation of roads and fulfilled its commitment to complete inherited projects.\n\nWithin the period under review, completed road projects included Oniru network network of roads, Ojokoro network of roads- 31 in number- the Pen Cinema fly-over, Agege, Oshodi/Abule-Egbe BRT corridor, Phases 1 & 2 of Badagry expressway, Lagos-Ogun boundary roads, 6 major junction improvements at Lekki1 & 2, Ajah, Maryland, Ikotun and Allen Avenue. Jide Oki/Ade Adedina/ Olugbani streets in Iru/Victoria Island, Ijegun-Egbe road and Ishuti road in Igando. St. Finbarrs road/Diya street in Yaba Iwaya road etc. 216 inner roads in the 20 local governments and 37 LCDAs were rehabilitated.\n\nOn-going projects include the Lekki Regional Roads, Lekki-Epe expressway, Agric Isawo Road, Ikorodu, Bola Tinubu-Igbogbo-Imota Road, Ijede road, Oba Sekumade road and construction of 100 bus shelters, 78 of which have been completed.\n\nThe intra-city rail projects -the blue and the red lines- are priorities in the commitment to mass transportation across the state. The government has given firm promises for the completion of the rail projects in terms of the on the site progress report and realistic financial closure to underscore the optimism.\n\nThe completion of the Lagos Rail Mass (LRMT) Blue Line Project (Mile 2 -Marina) and the Red Line will no doubt bring succor to the multitude of commuters across the state. The implications on the quality of life in terms of saved man hour and economic growth are unquantifiable.\n\nIn the past two years, the state government commissioned over 600 buses under the Bus Rapid Transport system, while it recently launched the 500 First and Last Mile Buses. The plan is to have in place 5000 FLM buses to cater for inner transportation and replace okada.\n\nThe waterways have become a safe and reliable mode of transportation since the inception of this administration.\n\nLAGFERRY, the agency in charge of water transportation, has 20 ferries plying various routes in the state.\n\nThe agency has 15 jetties under construction to boost its operations. They are located in Apaa, Badagry, VIP chalet, Badagry, Italy, Ajido, Badagry, Ilado, Amuwo-Odofin, Ilashe, Ojo, Ito Omu, Epe, Offin, Ikorodu, Takwa Bay, Eti-osa, Ijede waterfront, Ikorodu, Marina waterfront, Badagry, Oke-Ira Nla, Eto-Osa, Liverpool, Apapa, Ebute-ero, Lagos Island, Mile 2, Ijegun-Egba, Ojo.\n\nThe construction of a command and control center for the waterways and the procurement of search and rescue boats are geared towards safety on our waterways.\n\nThe Lagos State government has over-hauled its health facilities in response to prevailing and future challenges.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic threw spanners into all areas of human endeavor across the globe.\n\nLagos State as the epicenter of the pandemic had to respond to the enormous challenge, which earned it applause across the globe.\n\nThe pandemic which crept in as the government was settling down, showcased the governor as a great manager of human and material resources. He displayed the expected political will to lead from the front and ensured the provision of the wherewithal to curtail the pandemic and reduce its impact.\n\nThe constant communication with the people through direct regular briefings went a long way to reassure the citizens and built the much desired confidence.\n\nIt is note-worthy and symbolic that the governor was also a victim of Covid-19 to under-score his enormous commitment and sacrifice at a great personal risk for the well-being of the citizens.\n\nDespite walking an unfamiliar path of managing a pandemic, hitherto unknown in this century, he excelled to the admiration of his most uncharitable critic.\n\nHis performance has not only become a reference point but also a manual in top-notch management of a pandemic.\n\nMost importantly, the good news is that Lagos State government is now better equipped and prepared to manage such challenges in future in terms of technical know-how and availability of requisite infrastructure.\n\nThe state government under the auspices of the Medical Project Implementation Unit (MPIU) has commenced the upgrade of infrastructure in the state-owned facilities to build resilient health-care and increase the residents\u2019 access to quality universal health coverage.\n\nThe implementation of the health projects cut across the primary, secondary and tertiary health-care system.\n\nIn the last two years, the government has completed and equipped 2 Maternal and Childcare Centers (MCC) in Eti-Osa and Badagry. Another 110-bed MCC has been recently completed in Epe.\n\nAmong others, the government renovated the Mainland hospital in Yaba with a future plan to converting it to an Institute of Research for Infectious Diseases.\n\nThe general hospitals at Apapa, Harvey road , Yaba , Isolo, Odan and Ebutte-Metta health Centre were renovated for accessible health care delivery.\n\nPresently, a 280 bed general hospital in Ojo and 150 bed New Massey Street Children\u2019s hospital are under construction.\n\nThe construction of a 1,500 bed Psychiatric Hospital and Rehabilitation Centre at Ajidun has also been approved.\n\nThe state government in collaboration with the private sector has completed and handed over an oxygen plant at the Mainland and Gbagada General Hospitals. In the same vein, Triage and Oxygen Centres in 10 locations across the state have been delivered.\n\nThe welfare of health-care workers has also received attention with the construction of a 24 unit Doctors and Staff Quarters at Gbagada General Hospital.\n\nAt inception, the issue of the enviroment was a major challenge to the Sanwo-Olu administration.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn two years, the state government has been able to re-energize and re- organize the Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) and the Private Sector Participation in Refuse disposal for cleaner Lagos.\n\nThe government launched the LAWMA Academy and expanded the Olusosun Dumpsite to 42 acres to accommodate more waste and ensure that trucks can have a quicker turnaround time.\n\nThe state government constructed collector drains at various locations across the state.\n\nTrapezoidal channels and collector drains were also constructed to check the menace of incessant flooding.\n\nEducation and Technology take a prime position in the present administration. The state government is of the view that quality education is germane to the execution of its various developmental agenda.\n\nTill date, the Sanwo-Olu administration has completed 1,097 projects in 970 schools across the state.\n\nThe government has provided blocks of classrooms, administrative offices, school furniture, laboratories and modern toilet facilities across the six Education Districts.\n\n3000 teachers at both primary and secondary schools, were recruited and trained to join the state teaching workforce while those already in service were developed through continuous training to update their skills and knowledge with modern technology.\n\nThe state government signed an agreement with six private investors for the proposed LASU 8,272- units hostel.\n\nThe government implemented a 3,000km of metro fibre connection across the state to promote security. It also provided a fully digital mapping platform and an integrated end to end land administration system, which includes integrated land automation system.\n\nThe Lagos State Science Research and Innovation Council (LASRIC), with start-up funds of $687,000 to drive investment in research and development of tech-focused solutions across the six pillars of the administration\u2019s THEMES agenda was set up.\n\nIn two years, the Lagos State government has delivered 14 housing schemes, adding 7,000 affordable housing units to reduce deficit in the sector.\n\nThe projects which are situated across the state include Lateef Jakande Gardens, Igando, Lagos State Affordable Public Housing Scheme, Idale Badagry, LagosHoms Lekki Phase 2 and Babatunde Raji Fashola Estate, Courtland Villas, Igbokushu.\n\nOther recently completed schemes are located in Odo Onisarutu Ayandelu, Agbosasa, Magodo/Omole, Gbagada and Ibeshe.\n\nIt is note-worthy that the homes are for both low and high networth individuals. The Lagos Mortgage Board has strengthened the \u201cRent to Own\u201d policy to provide many residents especially first-time home-owners with the desired opportunity.\n\nThere\u2019s no gain- saying the commitment of the state government to grow the agricultural sector to promote food security. In line with this, the 5 years Agric road-map was launched.\n\n879 farmers and Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) benefited from the Lagos Agro-Processing, Prodctivity Enhancement and Livelihood Improvement Support (APPEALS) project.\n\nThe government created the Eko Farmers\u2019 Market to deliberately provide ready-made off-takers for farmers to dispose of their products on regular basis.\n\nThe Rice mill at Imota created 250,000 employment opportunities.\n\nThe government introduced a #1B Agric Value Chain Fund targeted at businesses that operate within the agric value chain. The EndSars protest, unfortunately, left in its wake unimaginable destruction and developmental set-back. The negative inpact of the pandemic on the economy and livelihood took a prime position of concern in the governance of the state.\n\nMr. Governor, rather than brood on the colossal losses rallied the citizenry to rebuild, regain and restore the state. The sheer audacity of the leadership naturally attracted support from all and sundry across the nation. The state is not only on course for restoration but looks to end up in the fullness of time like the proverbial palace destroyed by an inferno. The State Government has extended its milk of kindness to mitigate personal and corporate losses.\n\nThe Lagos State government underscored its humane nature with the various impactful empowerment and poverty alleviation programs.\n\n3,673 businesses were supported with #1.156B and a plethora of interventions including grants, mentorship, business advisory, capacity building and market access opportunities.\n\n1,835 businesses were supported with #939.97M and saved a total of 10,000 direct jobs and 40,020 indirect jobs via the MSME Recovery Fund which was an intervention program to cushion the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the EndSars protest.\n\nThe Lagos Economic Acceleration Programme (LEAP) to reduce the effects of the pandemic on small businesses.\n\nA #5B EduFund in partnership with First Bank Plc and EdFin FMB and a #1B fund targeted at businesses in the tourism, hospitality, entertainment, arts and culture sectors was set up.\n\nThe security of lives and property of Lagosians remains one of the most important pillars of the THEMES agenda.\n\nWe acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of the government towards tackling the challenge of insecurity in the state. It\u2019s noteworthy that the novel Lagos State Security Trust Fund remains the rallying point for the provision of the requisite support for the security agencies in the state. The provision of operational vehicles, communication gadgets and other logistics has no doubt made Lagos State the safest in the country.\n\nWe align with the government efforts to tackle the menace of okada riders whose mode of operation, lawlessness, threat to lives and general well-being can no longer be tolerated. We affirm that true development can only be achieved in a stable, secured and peaceful environment.\n\nWe affirm that security and safety remain the business of all and sundry especially at a time like this. The commitment to increase the manpower of the Lagos Neighborhood Safety Watch and equip them accordingly is a step in the right direction.\n\nThe Lagos State government under Governor Jide Sanwo-Olu has become the reference point for good, focused, impactful, inclusive, responsible, responsive, innovative and humane governance.\n\nWe are indeed convinced that Lagos State is in safe hands.\n\nHe is indeed the man for the season.\n\nAs a party, we are proud that you have kept faith as our flag-bearer and on course to fulfill our progressive manifestos to the delight of all Lagosians.\n\nAs the second half begins, we are convinced that all projects will be completed and more impactful policies, programs and projectswill be implemented as you finish strongly.\n\nWe can as well start preparing to add the appellation \u201cYour Excellency\u201c to your name which you have earned in words and deed. Without an iota of doubt, your name will go down in history as the governor who took over at an unusual time in human history, rose and excelled beyond the limitations of the enormous challenges.",

The new agreement will also help to re-balance fiscal terms and address global competition in prioritisation of investments by key players.\n\nThe OML 118 with its straddle fields boast of the presence of the five major players in the deepwater space not only in Nigeria but also globally.\n\nOML 118 is the first major deepwater development in Nigeria in the deepwater Niger Delta 75 kilometres from shore containing the Bonga fields at water depth over 1000m.\n\nThe fields are one of the most prolific deep-water assets in the country, boosting of almost two billion barrels of crude oil, up to 1TCF of gas, modest cost of operations and delivers a significantly level of profit for the investors with a sizeable take for the state. The field also supplies gas to NLNG another strategically important asset to NNPC and its partners.\n\nThe NNPC had in February 2019 signed Heads of Terms (HoT) with the OML 118 PSC contractors, which formed the commercial framework for parties to settle their differences, create pathway for a sustainable brighter future and a reference point for resolving the industry-wide PSC disputes.\n\nThe key feature of the terms of settlement include, clear terms on block ring-fencing, gas commercialisation terms, replacement of disputed tax credits for clearer investment allowances, trade-offs on in-block consolidation and cost limits, early lease renewals, assurance of fiscal stability for investors, protection of profit sharing schemes and settlement of disputed past, among others.\n\nThe objective was that the HoT would translate to fully termed agreements including the Dispute Resolution Agreement and a new PSC Agreement for the OML 118 Contract Area.",

Be a good debtor. Pay up your debt. If you refuse to pay, you won\u2019t step into that bank again\u201d, he said.\n\nEmefiele reckoned that a nexus exists between food security and national security, urging the Federal Government to make good its promise of solving the insecurity challenge; which has led to a scathing spike in food prices following a drop in crop production and disruption of supply chains.\n\nEmefiele said: \u201cSecurity challenges and the economy are interconnected. If the economy is to grow, insecurity must be low. If not, the economy will suffer regardless of our efforts. But the chief of defence staff has assured us of security. Some parts of the northwest are saying they are seeing results of military efforts. Efforts now targeted the southeast and southwest.\n\n\u201cAgain, the United States and the Federal Government, as a way of boosting security, signed a pact for the supply of 12 Tucano airplanes out of which would help us solve our insecurity. I am aware that six of them are coming to the country in the month of July and August. They are coming.

The forum said leaders from the region are pampering the monsters and hiding under them to blackmail the Federal Government into achieving their ambition in 2023.\n\nThe elders also described the posture of South East leaders in taming the growing insecurity in the region as unacceptable. They alleged the governors were yielding their political turf and mandates to secessionists, criminals and subversives.\n\nDirector of Publicity and Advocacy for the group, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, in a statement in Abuja, yesterday, said Nigeria was sliding towards disaster and urged President Muhammadu Buhari to address the many divisive issues troubling the country.\n\n\u201cIf our country is to survive its current difficulties and build a better nation, President Buhari must improve his levels of competence, awareness that the nation is sliding into disaster and sensitivity to the frustrations of Nigerians.Other political leaders who take advantage of the limitations of the President to light fires should know that they will get burnt in them.\u201d\n\nThey further reinstated their earlier position, calling for a ban on open grazing, insisting that a permanent solution must be advanced by all parties, but warned against the alleged killing of Fulani herdsmen and northerners in the south.\n\nPart of the statement read: \u201cIt is now clear that elected people sworn to protect the constitution and protect the unity and integrity of Nigeria have decided to surrender to deeply divisive or outrightly irredentist and secessionist tendencies and movements. In the South East, governors are yielding their political turf and mandates to secessionists, criminals and subversives who think they can exterminate federal presence and northerners from the region, and achieve dubious political goals related to 2023, or break away from the country.\n\n\u201cIn the South West, elected leaders and pampered ethnic bullies are closing ranks to provide a front that apes the do-what-we-want-or-we-leave-the-country strategy of the marginalised leaders of the South East. Governors are building ethnic monsters and hiding behind them to whip up sentiments in a crude attempt to extract concessions no one is in a position to give or guarantee.\n\n\u201cThe South South is squeezed between fear and uncertainty, and its leaders are gambling that they can benefit from further weakening the federal administration and the north if it rides along with the rest of the South.\n\n\u201cA plastic unity is being contrived to create the impression that the entire south is united behind shared grievances against the Presidency and Fulani herders and all northerners who are cast as fair game in responding to all of President Buhari\u2019s multiple failures.\n\n\u201cFor the record, the forum restates its support for a programmed transition that will eliminate open grazing and the establishment of productive, safe and sustainable options in managing our huge national asset in animal husbandry. This cannot be achieved with threats and harassment, but with commitment and collaboration involving all governments and stakeholders.It is in everyone\u2019s interests to support an urgent national initiative that will engineer a safe and productive transition to the end of open grazing.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Okays ranching, revival of grazing reserves\u2019 take-off in June\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday took issue with Southern governors over their ban on open cattle grazing in the region.\n\nThe president, in a statement by his media assistant, Mallam Garba Shehu, described the ban, announced as one of the resolutions the 17 governors from the zone made during their May 11 meeting in Asaba, Delta State, as of questionable legality.\n\nAccording to him, the governors\u2019 action is of \u201cquestionable legality, given the constitutional right of all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and freedoms within every one of our 36 states (and FCT)-regardless of the state of their birth or residence.\u201d\n\nBuhari, hoever, approved ranching and revival of grazing reserves nationwide.\n\nThe president\u2019s stance on the Southern governors\u2019 Asaba Declaration came a few days after the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), expressed similar views.\n\nMalami, while fielding questions on a live television programme, had kicked against the open grazing ban, saying it was unconstitutional.\n\nThe AGF had compared the Southern governors\u2019 decision to their Northern counterparts banning spare parts trading in the North, considering the fact that the majority of spare parts traders in the North are from the South.\n\nHe had said: \u201cIt is about constitutionality. Within the context of the freedoms enshrined in our constitution, can you deny a right of a Nigerian? It is as good as saying maybe the Northern governors coming together to say that they prohibit spare parts trading in the North. Does it hold water? Does it hold water for a Northern governor to come and state expressly that he now prohibits spare parts trading in the North?\u201d\n\nHowever, Malami came under fire over his criticism, with the Southern governors daring him to challenge their decision in the court.\n\nChairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, had described Malami\u2019s opposition to the ban on open cattle grazing as \u201cwicked and arrogant.\u201d\n\nSome senior lawyers and the Founder of Stanbic IBTC and Anap Foundation, Mr. Atedo Peterside, also criticised the minister for his comments.\n\nWhile the pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, and the spokesman of the Senate had called on Buhari to remove the minister for opposing the ban, the South-east Governors\u2019 Forum had said those who opposed the ban wanted the killings to continue.\n\nBut Buhari, while rejecting the governors\u2019 ban, expressed the determination of his administration to address the conflicts of herders and farmers in a sustained and lasting manner that should lead to the emergence of a permanent solution to the frequent clashes between them, as well as the associated problem of the gun-wielding \u201ckiller herdsmen.\u201d\n\nThe statement from the presidency said Buhari had approved some measures to permanently end the frequent skirmishes between farmers and herders as recommended by the Minister of Agriculture, Alhaji Sabo Nanono.\n\nThe statement added that Nanono had submitted a report detailing the recommendations to the president, who endorsed it in April, \u201cwell before the actions of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, which attempts to place a ban on open grazing and other acts of politicking intended by its signatories to demonstrate their power.\u201d\n\nThe president said the Southern governors\u2019 resolutions didn\u2019t offer any solution to the herder-farmer clashes that have been continuing in the country for generations.\n\nHe said: \u201cBut the citizens of the Southern states\u2013 indeed citizens of all states of Nigeria\u2013 have a right to expect their elected leaders and representatives to find answers to challenges of governance and rights, and not to wash their hands off hard choices by, instead, issuing bans that say: \u201cnot in my state.\u201d\n\nThe statement said: \u201cFortunately, this declaration has been pre-empted, for whatever it is intended to achieve, and Mr. President, who has rightly been worried about these problems more than any other citizens in consultation with farmers and herders alike, commissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the states, starting with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant with stated requirements.\n\n\u201cWith veterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families including schooling \u2013 through these rehabilitated reserves, the federal government is making far-reaching and practical changes allowing for different communities to co-exist side-by-side: supporting farmers to till their fields, herders to rear their livestock and Nigerians everywhere to be safe.\u201d\n\nIt added that despite the COVID-19 pandemic that took a toll on public finances, the federal funding for the forest reserve project is ready and will take off in interested states by June.\n\n\u201cThe entire country is acutely aware of the strain the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on public finances, for both federal and states. Still, given the pressing urgency of addressing the perennial challenges, the federal funding for the project that has been delayed is now being partly unlocked. Actual work for the full actualisation of the modern reserve system in a few of the consenting states should take off in June,\u201d the statement said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Dike Onwuamaeze\n\nThe Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) and the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) have expressed excitement over the rebound of the manufacturing sector in the first quarter of 2021, which recorded a growth rate that was higher than its pre-COVID-19 performance.\n\nData released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Sunday showed that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 0.51 per cent (year-on-year) in the first quarter of 2021, (Q1 2021) compared with the 0.11 per cent recorded in the fourth quarter (Q4) 2020.\n\nThe data also showed that the manufacturing sector recorded a 3.40 per cent growth rate in Q1 2021 after recording negative growth in the Q4 of 2020.\n\nIn addition, its Q1 2021 performance was also higher than the 0.81 per cent and 0.43 per cent it recorded in Q1 2019 and Q1 2020 respectively, which were pre-COVID-19 era.\n\nMAN Director-General, Mr. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, while reacting to the GDP report said yesterday that the reported 3.40 per cent growth rate of the manufacturing sector in Q1 2021 came as a surprise, giving the numerous challenges facing the sector.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are currently experiencing the rising cost of manufacturing inputs, so it is surprising to see a rate higher than the rate of 0.81per cent in Q1 2019 and 0.43 per cent of Q1 2020, which were relatively stable periods.\n\n\u201cIn Q1 2021, manufacturing activities more or less rebounded to the level of pre-COVID-19 period. So, it is expected that the sector will present a better performance in Q1 2021 than what obtained in Q4 2020. Particularly the food, beverage, and tobacco and the chemical and pharmaceutical sub-sectors are expected to post higher growths due to the relatively higher capacities utilisation they enjoyed since 2020.\n\n\u201cIn addition, it is not out of place for the cement and basic metal, iron, and steel sector to present high growths in Q1 2021 due to the increased level of construction work going on in different parts of the country backed by government spending across the country.\u201d\n\nHe added that the NBS\u2019s Q1 2021 report on the manufacturing sector corroborated MAN\u2019s Manufacturers CEOs Confidence Index (MCCI) of Q1 2021. The MCCI is a quarterly survey of the manufacturing sector. Its index showed improvement in the confidence of manufacturers in a good number of manufacturing sectoral groups.\n\nHe, however, appealed to the \u201cgovernment to intensify its intervention initiatives and follow through on the cost reduction aspect of ease of doing business. There is urgent need to create a friendlier operating environment and deliberately support the productive sector in a strategic manner.\u201d\n\nLCCI Director-General, Dr. Muda Yusuf, also stated that the recovery of the manufacturing sector from a negative growth territory in Q4 2020 to a positive growth level of 3.4 per cent in Q1 2021 was a surprise.\n\nYusuf said: \u201cThe sector has been grappling with an unprecedented foreign exchange illiquidity crisis over the past few months. This is coupled with the structural, policy, institutional and macroeconomic challenges that have bedeviled the sector. The data does not reflect the reality of the experiences of most manufacturers.\u201d\n\nBut the Chief Consultant of the B. Adedipe Associates Limited, Dr. Biodun Adedipe, said during the breakfast meeting of the Nigeria-South Africa Chamber of Commerce held last Thursday that the country\u2019s manufacturing sector was recovering contrary to the sentiments that the manufacturing entities are closing down.\n\nAccording to him, there are enough activities along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and the Ogun State corridor where new factories are sprouting up to confirm the survey outcomes of the NBS.\n\nHe said: \u201cThese things are real. I can tell you here on authority that there are many conversations with foreign investors trying to put money into manufacturing in Nigeria as we speak. These are real foreign investors. I will not want us to go with the sentiment that nothing is happening there. You will see manufacturing always growing.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "The data also showed that the manufacturing sector recorded a 3.40 per cent growth rate in Q1 2021 after recording negative growth in the Q4 of 2020.\nIn addition, its Q1 2021 performance was also higher than the 0.81 per cent and 0.43 per cent it recorded in Q1 2019 and Q1 2020 respectively, which were pre-COVID-19 era.\n\u201cIn Q1 2021, manufacturing activities more or less rebounded to the level of pre-COVID-19 period.\nSo, it is expected that the sector will present a better performance in Q1 2021 than what obtained in Q4 2020.\nThe MCCI is a quarterly survey of the manufacturing sector.",

Still, given the pressing urgency of addressing the perennial challenges, the federal funding for the project that has been delayed is now being partly unlocked. Actual work for the full actualization of the modern reserve system in a few of the consenting states should take off in June\u201d, the statement said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN) has condemned the opposition of the federal government to the ban on open grazing by some Southern governors.\n\nThe Presidency had on Monday described the ban, which was one of the resolutions 17 Southern governors from the zone made during their May 11 meeting in Asaba, Delta State, as of 'questionable legality'.\n\nIn a statement by Garba Shehu, the presidential spokesman said the governors\u2019 action is of \u201cquestionable legality, given the constitutional right of all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and freedoms within every one of our 36 states (and FCT) regardless of the state of their birth or residence.\u201d\n\nBut speaking at the Nigerian Bar Association Section on Public Interest and Development Law Annual Conference 2021 on Tuesday, Falana stated that the Presidency's stance on the matter has polarised the country further amid several threats to the country's unity.\n\nHe also described the federal government's decision to revive grazing reserves as a knee jerk reaction to the decision of the Southern Governors Forum to ban open grazing, especially as the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association had already accepted the ban on open grazing.\n\nThe Senior Advocate further advised the Presidency to study the Grazing Reserves Act of 1964 so as not to compound the crisis by giving the erroneous impression that grazing reserves are different from ranches.\n\nHe said, \"More than ever before, the media and the Nigerian Bar Association ought to intensify the campaign for the actualisation of the provisions of the Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy.\n\n\"In particular, this is the time to mount sufficient pressure on all governments to provide for the welfare and security of the people pursuant to section 14 of the Constitution.\n\n\"However, in its belated response to the reckless killing of farmers, destruction of farms, kidnapping and raping of women by killer herders, the federal government has decided to revive grazing reserves as a knee-jerk reaction to the decision of the Southern Governors Forum to ban open grazing.\n\n\"Thus, the reaction of the Presidency has further polarised a country whose unity is being seriously threatened by separatist groups. But the reaction is uncalled for having regard to the fact that the National Economic Council and the Nigeria Governors Forum had banned open grazing and resolved to embrace ranching.\n\n\"Whereas the Presidency has said that the fundamental right of armed herders cannot be abridged, why has the Federal Government decided to restrict the movement of cattle to grazing reserves?\n\n\"Last Friday, the Federal High Court ruled that state governments have the power to enact anti-grazing laws. Therefore, it smacks of brazen official impunity on the part of the Presidency to have said that the ban on open grazing is of doubtful legality.\n\n\"Even though it has been said that the policy would take off in June, not a single grazing reserve has been identified, prepared and put into use. Similarly, the Federal Government had announced in 2016 that 55, 000 hectares of land had been acquired in 11 states for the establishment of ranches.\n\n\"By April 2018, the Federal Government launched the National Livestock Transformation Plan with emphasis on the establishment of ranches. The Federal Government later turned round to adopt Cattle Colony and Ruga policies which were rejected by a number of state governments.\n\n\"Instead of further dividing the country along ethnic lines, we call on the Federal Government to halt the mindless killing of farmers and kidnapping of innocent people by killer herders.\n\n\"Instead of weeping more than the bereaved, the Federal Government should listen to the Miyetti Allah which has accepted the ban on open grazing and demanded the establishment of ranches.\n\n\"Since there is a popular demand for the proscription of open grazing, all hands should now be on deck to establish ranches without any further delay.\n\n\"From the information at our disposal not less than 24 states have applied to the Federal Government for the grant to establish ranches. The Presidency should not compound the crisis by giving the erroneous impression that grazing reserves are different from ranches.\"",

          "text": "In a world of online gaming, Zoom meetings and video-on-demand streaming, internet speed is everything.\n\nTo watch Netflix in high-definition, your internet download speed must be at least 5 megabits per second (Mbps), while ultra-high-definition requires 25 Mbps. A clear and stable Facebook Live or Twitch stream requires an upload speed of up to 5 Mbps. On Zoom, group video calls in full HD require between 3 and 3.8Mbps.\n\nAs these services acquire more global audiences, the internet needs to be faster everywhere to provide uniform experiences to users. So how does speed vary within Africa, and when compared with countries outside the continent?\n\nSouth Africa leads mobile, Ghana fixed broadband\n\nUsers can test internet speed using a number of options. Netflix launched fast.com five years ago and it\u2019s a pretty handy tool. But to compare speeds across geographies, we will rely on data from Speedtest Global Index, a service owned by Ookla, a US-based internet analytics company.\n\nSpeedtest provides data for mobile and fixed broadband internet for more than 130 countries around the world. Mobile broadband is the connection available through SIM card-based network operators while fixed broadband typically requires a cable connection.\n\nAccording to their latest data for the first quarter of 2021, the global average for download speed is 53.38 Mbps for mobile and 102.12 Mbps for fixed broadband.\n\nAfrica\u2019s best performers scored below these marks. The best average speed for mobile internet in Africa was in South Africa (44.80 Mbps) while the mark for fixed broadband was in Ghana (51.93 Mbps).\n\nIn descending order, South Africa, Mali, Morocco, Cameroon, Tunisia, Egypt, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Kenya (20.98 Mbps) were the top ten countries for mobile internet speeds in Africa in Q1 2021. The worst-ranked African country was Sudan (131st out of 134 overall) at 12.21 Mbps.\n\nThe top ten standings for fixed broadband are different: Ghana, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, South Africa, Madagascar, Egypt, Senegal, Seychelles, Morocco, Congo and Burkina Faso (23.81 Mbps). Guinea is the worst-ranked African country in this category (173rd out of 176 overall) with 6.66 Mbps.\n\nGhana leads on fixed mobile broadband\n\nSouth Africa, Egypt and Senegal appear in both top 10 lists. But which cities stand out across the continent? For this, we\u2019ll focus on mobile internet speeds and latency \u2013 a measure of how responsive an internet connection is.\n\nFrom Johannesburg to Kairouan\n\nSpeedtest shows the top cities for mobile internet speeds in South Africa, Morocco, Tunisia, Nigeria and Kenya, but not for other countries in the top ten \u2013 like Mali and Cameroon. As such, we are limited in how certain we are of the cities with the top internet speeds in Africa.\n\nHowever, we are able to guess that the major cities in South Africa, Morocco and Tunisia have the fastest speeds on the continent. Johannesburg leads the way with 55.64 Mbps while Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, comes in at 31.32 Mbps.\n\nIn Nigeria, Speedtest data shows Port-Harcourt \u2013 an oil-rich city in the Niger Delta region \u2013 has the fastest speed at 23.02 Mbps. Lagos, one of Africa\u2019s capitals of tech startups records an average of 19.72 Mbps \u2013 a lower mark than Nairobi (24.60) and Cape Town (36.68).\n\nWhere latency is concerned, Nigeria\u2019s main cities (Port-Harcourt, Lagos, Benin city, Kano, Ibadan) also lag behind main cities in comparable African countries.\n\nThe highest latency among South Africa\u2019s top five cities (Johannesburg, Pretoria, Cape Town, Durban and Soweto) is 29 milliseconds. The highest among Kenya\u2019s top five is 39 milliseconds (in Eldoret). Latency is 40 milliseconds in Lagos but that\u2019s the least among Nigeria\u2019s top five. In Kano, the average is 75 milliseconds \u2013 more than twice the global average of 37 milliseconds.\n\nWhat are the numbers revealing to us?\n\nThe numbers above reflect internet performance between January and March 2021. As such, longer-term data will be needed to make better judgement.\n\nHowever, the numbers show a wide gap between internet speeds in Africa and the rest of the world. Africa has the fastest-growing mobile telecoms market but internet penetration is still at about 42%.\n\nLatency is not such a big deal if you are merely browsing social media, attending a Zoom meeting or streaming on Instagram. Anything below 100 ms is fine. But for gaming, between 20ms and 40ms is optimal.\n\nIncreasing download speeds and reducing latency will require more investment in infrastructure from telcos who provide mobile internet but also from fibre optic providers. On the mobile side of things, it means expanding 4G coverage and more 5G investment.\n\nOokla\u2019s 5G map shows South Africa has raced ahead of everyone else in terms of commercially available 5G, with 16 deployments mostly by MTN. Kenya has three deployments but they are limited. Nigeria, on the other hand, hopes to catch up soon by tapping into its satellite infrastructure.",

          "text": "Ethiopia has awarded one out of the two private telco licences it intends to award to a consortium that includes the Vodafone group. The consortium, which made a winning bid of $850 million, comprises Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc and Sumitomo Corp.\n\nThe licence award is a big step for Ethiopia as it marks the opening of its telecom sector to foreign investors. For years, the state-owned Ethiotel has held a monopoly but will now have competition.\n\nBeyond competition, it will have a significant economic impact, considering that the consortium will create 1.1 million jobs and invest $8.5 billion in the next ten years. According to a tweet by the country\u2019s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, \u201cit will be the single largest foreign direct investment into Ethiopia to date.\u201d\n\nThe country also announced that it would not grant a second telecoms licence after rejecting a second bid from MTN.\n\nMTN\u2019s bid is not good enough\n\nThe prospect of a market with 112 million people is as good as it gets for many telcos, so it wasn\u2019t surprising that all the big names initially planned to make bids. Etisalat, Orange Telecoms, MTN and Saudi Telecom Company were some of the companies that registered interest.\n\nIn the end, only two companies put bids forward; the Vodafone consortium and MTN. Safaricom, one of the consortium companies, had announced prematurely in March that it had won the bid.\n\nRegardless, MTN also made a bid of $600 million which was considered not good enough, and now the second telecoms licence will now be retendered for new offers.\n\nOne interesting point is that MTN\u2019s bid was financed in part by a Chinese investor, while a newly created US foreign-aid agency backed the Vodafone consortium\u2019s bid. It is a continuation of what some observers call a competition on the tech front in Africa.\n\nA similar situation played out in Kenya as Safaricom rolled out its 5G service initially with Huawei providing support. The US reportedly had concerns with the decision to use Huawei, in line with a strategy of using its diplomatic might to dissuade African governments from buying into the technology solutions from the Chinese company.\n\nIn the end, Safaricom stuck with Huawei but also included the Finnish company, Nokia. Despite this, it is clear that this is not the last we\u2019ll see of the continuing competition between the US and China in Africa\u2019s tech space.",

          "title": "Successful product managers are walking encyclopedias.",
          "text": "It takes a great team to build an equally great product. Centre Stage exists to tell the behind-the-scenes stories of the people building brilliant products and services in Africa.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Tobi Lufadeju to Centre Stage because I admire how determined she is to succeed in her role and how invested she is in her personal and professional development. Even when she has moments where she feels like a small fish in a big sea, she doesn\u2019t allow her youthful insecurities to slow her down or get in the way of her responsibilities.\n\nTwo weeks after my meeting with Feranmi, I\u2019m back at Eric Keyser to meet with a very nervous but confident Tobi Lufadeju who is a young product manager at Reliance HMO.\n\nWhat were you doing in your early 20s? When I was Tobi\u2019s age, I was wrapping up my MFA (Master of Fine Arts) in English literature and overthinking my future and career path.\n\nAt Reliance, Tobi is in charge of the consumer business unit.\n\n\u201cThe consumer business unit is basically the retail side of the business. But I don\u2019t just handle retail products \u2013 I also handle products for SMEs and our partners.\u201d\n\nCuriousity is a product manager\u2019s super power\n\nTobi describes herself as a curious person, so I had to ask how curiosity plays a role in her work:\n\n\u201cProduct management is the intersection of business, technology and design. Successful product managers need to learn a little bit about each of them because we do a lot of directing in our work. In my role, I have an overview of what everyone is working on \u2013 from the frontend engineers to the DevOps team.\u201d\n\nWhen Tobi uses the word \u2018directing\u2019, I immediately picture a sharp-minded captain steering a large ship in open waters. The captain is responsible for not only the ship but her diverse team of crew members and cabin hands. Should aspiring product managers expect to manage diverse teams? This is what Tobi had to say:\n\n\u201cYes, they absolutely should have that expectation. As the product manager, you are the product\u2019s encyclopedia; so if the head of marketing needs information about the product, you have to know enough to give an appropriate answer. Being a curious person helps me learn as much as I possibly can about what we are building.\u201d\n\nWhen you picture product managers, what do you see them doing? Crunching numbers? Creating colourless spreadsheets? Tracking the lifespan of a product? Counting app downloads? What does their day-to-day work life look like for Tobi?\n\n\u201cI prioritize the work we are doing at all times and carve out time to do the work. I collaborate with different people and communicate our products\u2019 progress reports so everyone on the team knows what they need to do. I also make out time to speak to my direct supervisor \u2013 the business lead \u2013 and realign myself with our goals and plans for the quarter.\u201d\n\nWinning the battle over Impostor Syndrome\n\nProduct managers not only have to speak their product\u2019s language, but they also have to speak their team\u2019s language. How then do successful product managers navigate team management?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a common myth that product managers are micromanagers; this isn\u2019t the case with me,\u201d Tobi said in-between bites of her chicken sandwich.\n\n\u201cAlthough I operate as a kind of middle man, I don\u2019t meddle with the work. I trust my team to do what they are skilled at and leave them to run on their own. I also remember to connect with them as human beings. Yeah, I have to meet my deliverables but I have to support my team as well.\u201d\n\nThere are an estimated 64 million young people aged between 15 \u2013 35 years old living in Nigeria. It\u2019s obvious that our youth population is increasing rapidly with no plans of slowing down. But how prepared are they to enter local and global workplaces? How do young managers deal with issues such as impostor syndrome?\n\n\u201cThe first two months on the job were not easy. I joined an existing team which meant that I had to do a lot of learning and observation in the beginning. My team members would throw around in-house language during meetings and I also had to figure out how to speak the engineering team\u2019s language. I dealt with impostor syndrome big time.\u201d\n\nWhen you get hired by a new company, you have to make your first 100 days count. But being the newbie hire can be a daunting experience. How can new employees quieten the insecure voices in their heads and trust their abilities and skills?\n\n\u201cEven though the learning curve was steep in the beginning, I had to figure it out. I couldn\u2019t afford to fail because that\u2019s my name on the line. So whenever I felt confused after a meeting, I would call one of my team members back and ask questions. I still have moments where I\u2019m confused about certain things but I\u2019ve been given the leeway to experiment and try different tactics.\u201d\n\nCentre Stage tip: When in doubt or confused, ask questions.\n\nTips and tricks for aspiring and existing product managers\n\nEarlier in our conversation, Tobi mentions how important it is to be curious on the job. I asked her what other skills she believes aspiring product managers need to be excellent in their roles?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll start with effective communication. You can\u2019t just tell people what to do, you have to help them understand what needs to be done, why it needs to be done, and who needs to do it. If you cannot communicate clearly, you will not get the results you desire.\n\nPrioritisation is the second skill. Successful product managers must own the product and visualize the bigger picture at all times. When you have the bigger picture in your mind, it\u2019s easier to assign priority levels to different tasks.\n\nFinally, you need interpersonal skills. Although my team members don\u2019t directly report to me, I still have to learn how to speak to them with respect and empathy. When we have long weeks, I ensure I check in on the engineers because, at the end of the day, we are humans and need breaks from time to time.\n\nProduct managers need to learn how to give praise and encouragement, especially when they notice their team members are stressed or when their energy tanks are empty.\u201d\n\nTobi\u2019s role at Reliance HMO is her first stab at being a product manager. In addition to learning on the job, she\u2019s also had to invest her personal time in picking up new knowledge about her responsibilities and that of her team. So, what is she doing to improve her skills?\n\n\u201cPractice. I consciously track what I\u2019m doing and how I\u2019m doing my work. I make out time to reflect on my progress regularly. I follow product leaders and managers on LinkedIn\u2013 I read their articles and make note of the tips they share. I also use Blinkst to read books at an accelerated pace. At one point, I had access to Masterclass, I took some business and product-focused courses. My business lead also sends me resources like podcasts and articles.\u201d\n\nWhere your professional career is concerned, one thing you never stop doing is learning. Tobi is ambitious about being successful in her role and isn\u2019t afraid to do what it takes to achieve her definition of success. My key takeaway from my conversation with Tobi is that managers, no matter how young or experienced they are, must be courageous, curious, and competent.\n\n\u201cIf I had to share any tip with aspiring product managers, I would recommend researching what goes into being a product manager and taking one or two courses about what tools you need to use and what to do on the job. If you are on social media, follow conversational product leaders and engage with them on Twitter or LinkedIn. There\u2019s a lot to learn at once and the work hit me like a wrecking ball in the beginning.\n\nMeasure as objectively as you can. You cannot fit everything into an OKR or KPI framework. Sometimes, you have to use your intuition to measure yourself and how well you are succeeding as a manager and team member. How are you handling your team? Are you driven by impact or are you working for the sake of it? If you are focused on making an impact, you will always deliver value to the business.\u201d",

          "title": "Samsung A12 Vs Infinix HOT 10T: Which Is A Better Buy?",
          "text": "Infinix and Samsung are two major players in the African smartphone market. Both brands have managed to maintain their edge over other competitive brands through the consistent production of exceptional smartphones that meet the varying needs of gadget lovers within the space. Phones like the Infinix HOT 10 and the Samsung Galaxy A12 are one in the number of stellar products offered by both brands.\n\nBoth devices fall within the same range (the mid-range) and it might get a little tricky deciding which to pick if you walk into a store and are faced with both of them. We hope that we can give you a bit of clarity for your next shopping expedition through this comparison of the Infinix HOT 10T and Samsung Galaxy A12.\n\nIn terms of looks, we know that both brands always bring their A-game. The two smartphones are designed with beautiful frames and colors that are easy on the eyes. If we were to judge by looks, you\u2019d definitely want to go home with both. But since we know that you\u2019d prefer to walk away with either one of the two devices, we\u2019d drill a little further.\n\nLet\u2019s start with something of interest to all our mobile game and Netflix lovers.\n\nDisplay\n\nThis is an all-important feature for smartphone entertainment. Whether it\u2019s movie watching and game blasting, you want to be able to enjoy that from a big and sharp screen. To a large degree, both devices offer amazing displays. They both use a drop-notch screen that allows for a higher screen-to-body ratio and a better viewing experience. But here\u2019s where the difference starts to kick in.\n\nScreen size\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy A12 uses a 6.52-inch HD+ screen while the Infinix HOT 10 pushes its screen size up to 6.82 inches. The Infinix HOT 10\u2019s display is also high definition (just like Samsung\u2019s A12) but it\u2019s also specified that it has a 90Hz refresh rate. This translates to smoother images on the Infinix HOT 10T.\n\nResolution\n\nAnother metric with which users can determine the quality of the display is the pixel count also known as resolution. Higher resolutions equal higher quality pictures. This explains why the 1080 movie on your laptop shows more detail than the 720p movie you downloaded from\u2026you know where.\n\nALSO READ: Infinix Launches All-New Hot 10T, The Ultimate Smartphone Entertainment Experience\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established that, here\u2019s the pixel count for both devices. The Samsung Galaxy A21 has a pixel count of 1600 x 720. On the other hand, the Infinix HOT 10\u2019s resolution equals 1640 x 720. Now here\u2019s where this could get a little tricky. Although Infinix has a higher resolution, Samsung fits 1600 x 720 pixels into a relatively smaller screen, while Infinix fits 1640 x 720 (a slightly higher amount of pixels) into a bigger screen. The result? Samsung is left with a higher pixel density which could very well contribute to better display quality.\n\nProcessing power\n\nHere both devices bring entirely different offerings to the table. Although both processors are designed by the same company MediaTek, the devices use processors from different families under MediaTek. Samsung Galaxy A12 uses the MediaTek p35 processor while the Infinix HOT 10T uses the MediaTek G70 processor. Both processors are 8 core processors but according to a Nano review, here\u2019s what you get out of them.\n\nFrom the breakdown above, it seems like the MediaTek G70 rules flawlessly over the MediaTek P35. Overall CPU performance for multitasking is better, gaming performance is also better and to cap it all up, the MediaTek G70 works at a faster clock rate of 2.oGHzcompared to Samsung at 1.8GHz.\n\nBattery\n\nIn this next round, we talk about the battery capacity. Both brands seem to be fairly pitched against themselves with 5000mAh batteries apiece. However, the Samsung Galaxy A12 provides better charging ability with 15w fast charging technology against Infinix HOT 10\u2019s 10W charging technology.\n\nOperating system\n\nBoth devices run on the Google-sponsored Android OS. However, Samsung uses an older version of android 10. Well, it wasn\u2019t old until the 8th of September last year when Android 11 hit the market. Infinix HOT 10 on the other hand, runs on Android 11 the most recent version.\n\nFingerprint unlock\n\nOver the years, this has become another important smartphone feature. Using PINs and passwords has now been termed as taking the longer route. The only alternative solution to fingerprint unlock which has also gained attention is the facial unlock feature. However, it has been reported to be less secure in comparison with fingerprints.\n\nInfinix uses the common rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. Meaning its sensor is positioned at the back of the device and easily accessible with a touch from the pointer. However, Samsung uses a placement that I and a lot of other tech bros have come to enjoy better. Samsung A12 uses a side-mounted fingerprint sensor. Side-mounted fingerprint sensors are perfect because of how they\u2019re used to replace the power button (a button that we\u2019ve already become accustomed to). It\u2019s a lot easier and more seamless.\n\nCamera\n\nSamsung is known to be a king in the area of smartphone photography. At the rear side of the Galaxy A12 Samsung uses a 48+5+2+2MP camera while the Infinix HOT 10 uses a 48+2+AI camera. Both cameras perform brilliantly under varying light conditions. However, the Infinix HOT 10 focuses on night life photography and performs exceptionally well in that regard. Using its Seper night mode and support from its QUAD led flash, Infinix brings more light into the beauty of the night life as contrasted below.\n\nSelfie comparison\n\nThe Infinix HOT 10T is available across all authorized retail stores nationwide at a retail price of 64800 while the Samsung A12 is sold at 67,200. Now that you have more information on what they offer, you can walk into any store and pick whichever one perfectly suits your need.",

          "text": "Banking has evolved over the years and the industry now abundantly relies on web-based applications for providing services to customers. With more and more people increasingly glued to connected devices, banks that hope to compete in today\u2019s market must focus on digital channels.\n\nOne of the pillars of a digital strategy is having a website that serves as the face of a company on the internet and its first virtual touchpoint. But in the digital age, just rolling out a website with a visual style and design stuck in the 90s does not cut it. Consumers have high expectations when it comes to online experience, so banks must find a way to offer the best digital experience possible. Hence the importance of having a unique site with world-class design and functionality.\n\nIf there\u2019s any bank that understands this so well, it\u2019s First Bank of Nigeria Limited, the West African premier financial inclusion services provider. Established over a century127 years ago, FirstBank continues to evolve, successfully adopting the latest technology and embracing innovation in delivering seamless banking solutions to its customers across the world. The bank recently launched a newly-designed corporate website that fits right in with its quest to be Africa\u2019s bank of first choice \u2013 even when it comes to banking on digital channels.\n\nFrom online banking, loan calculator to customer support, here are some standout features of the new FirstBank website:\n\nDesigned for Banking on the Go\n\nThe new FirstBank website has a simple yet striking and modern design in a fresh, magazine-style look that promotes access to essential information for its customers, FirstMonie agents, prospective agents and the public.\n\nThe site leverages the bank\u2019s brand colors to attract attention to certain areas. FirstBank uses its blue color on the call-to-action buttons, with the backdrop remaining mostly gold. This makes them stand out from the other menu items and brings user attention to where it matters most without overwhelming visitors.\n\nMore importantly, the website is designed from a mobile-first standpoint, which is responsive, considering increased usage of mobile devices compared to desktop computers. With this design, the FirstBank website reformats to fit the screen of whatever device the visitor is using to view it and allows users the flexibility to conduct business wherever they may be.\n\nIntuitive site navigation\n\nWhen people visit their institution\u2019s website, it is not because they are looking for somewhere to spend their extra time. They are often seeking help and want to get to things quickly. FirstBank offers a wide array of financial services for a varied customer base, which can make it difficult to maintain a clean and easily navigated website. But the new platform \u2013 with a simple and clearly labeled navigation \u2013 allows users and potential customers to find exactly what they\u2019re looking for quickly and easily.\n\nOne of the core strengths of the new website is prominent links to top pages. The homepage begins with a prominent header that displays clear visual and clickable options that direct users to the main categories of Personal Banking, Business Banking & Private Banking and features a clear link to FirstBank\u2019s Contact/Customer Service page with alternate ways for visitors to seek help, such as email and phone.\n\nMoving down the homepage provides visitors with easy navigation for common prospect needs, represented with icons and calls to action. On the new website, these include Open Account, Agency Banking, Find a Branch, Loan Calculator, etc. The intuitive and user-friendly upgrade guides customers to make well-informed decisions about their financial needs, whatever they are.\n\nEasy Access to Online Banking\n\nIn the digital age, a bank is less likely to be considered by younger generations if it does not have online banking. And for banks that do offer online banking, they have to make it easy for consumers to find and use. On its new website, FirstBank puts an obvious button to online banking in top navigation so visitors know exactly where to go. The \u2018Online Banking\u2019 login/enrollment call-to-action is placed at the top of every page, easing the digital experience for existing customers.\n\nSeparate Product Pages with Strong Calls-to-Action\n\nThe FirstBank website has unique secondary pages for every product, and clear calls-to-action for people to be able to navigate to those pages. Across all pages, the main image rotates displaying a variety of themes in line with the banking category and each contains easy-to-navigate dropdown menus, with a simple, straightforward, and detailed breakdown of the bank\u2019s products by the problem that they solve for individuals and businesses. From the product pages, a visitor can easily know how to get or sign up for the product or service they are interested in.\n\nOnline Account Opening\n\nA bank can\u2019t be open all day, but its website can be. Knowing that some potential customers do not live by its operating hours, FirstBank offers banking on their terms through the website.\n\nA standout feature of the new website is that it enables online applications and the ability to submit personal information securely. That makes it easy for interested visitors to open an account, offering a clear start to their banking journey.\n\nTools and Content that Empower Customers\n\nEvery user experience begins with a goal in mind and the new FirstBank website empowers its customers by providing a wide array of financial information and tools that meet customers needs, whatever they are. Among many actions, users can perform various transactions \u2013 make payments, transfer money, manage accounts, buy airtime, calculate loan rates and virtually interact with the bank \u2013 without stepping out of their comfort zone.\n\nThe site also serves as a library to keep customers abreast of various financial services solutions and offers intriguing content that is relevant to FirstBank\u2019s varied customer base \u2013 such as how-to guides that educate consumers on better managing their money and making the best financial decisions, thereby helping them to improve their economic and social wellbeing, as well as unique blog articles/insights on enterprise scaling, global trade and navigating the Covid-19 pandemic, targeted at corporate clients.\n\nLocation Finder\n\nOne of the most intriguing features of the new FirstBank website is its Location Finder, where visitors can browse locations of the bank\u2019s branches and Firstmonie Agents. The feature allows users to search based on their radius or address and helps them find the FirstBank branch that\u2019s closest to them and best fits their needs. The branch locator is interactive and integrated with Google Maps API, which makes it easier for the visitor to browse the locations.\n\nOverall, FirstBank gets it right when it comes to usability, understanding its customers\u2019 needs and expectations, and website navigation behavior while creating a beautiful site that employs some of the latest trends in responsive web design, with exceptional user experience and a perfect mix of exciting features.\n\nWith the new FirstBank website, customers are at an edge in the industry as they establish a relationship with the Bank that puts YOU, its customers, First.\n\nYou can visit the new FirstBank website here.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nInfinix and Samsung are two major players in the African smartphone market. Both brands have managed to maintain their edge over other competitive brands through the consistent production of exceptional smartphones that meet the varying needs of gadget lovers within the space. Phones like the Infinix HOT 10 and the Samsung Galaxy A12 are one in the number of stellar products offered by both brands.\n\nBoth devices fall within the same range (the mid-range) and it might get a little tricky deciding which to pick if you walk into a store and are faced with both of them. We hope that we can give you a bit of clarity for your next shopping expedition through this comparison of the Infinix HOT 10T and Samsung Galaxy A12.\n\nIn terms of looks, we know that both brands always bring their A game. The two smartphones are designed with beautiful frames and colours that are easy on the eyes. If we were to judge by looks, you\u2019d definitely want to go home with both. But since we know that you\u2019d prefer to walk away with either one of the two devices, we\u2019d drill a little further.\n\nLet\u2019s start with something of interest to all our mobile game and Netflix lovers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisplay\n\nThis is an all-important feature for smartphone entertainment. Whether it\u2019s movie watching and game blasting, you want to be able to enjoy that from a big and sharp screen. To a large degree, both devices offer amazing displays. They both use a drop-notch screen that allows for a higher screen-to-body ratio and a better viewing experience. But here\u2019s where the difference starts to kick in.\n\nScreen size\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy A12 uses a 6.52-inch HD+ screen while the Infinix HOT 10 pushes its screen size up to 6.82 inch. The Infinix HOT 10\u2019s display is also high definition (just like Samsung\u2019s A12) but it\u2019s also specified that it has a 90Hz refresh rate. This translates to smoother images on the Infinix HOT 10T.\n\nResolution\n\nAnother metric with which users can determine the quality of display is the pixel count also known as resolution. Higher resolutions equals higher quality pictures. This explains why the 1080 movie on your laptop shows more detail than the 720p movie you downloaded from\u2026you know where.\n\nALSO READ: Infinix Launches All-New Hot 10T, The Ultimate Smartphone Entertainment Experience\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established that, here\u2019s the pixel count for both devices. The Samsung Galaxy A21 has a pixel count of 1600 x 720. On the other hand, the Infinix HOT 10\u2019s resolution equals 1640 x 720. Now here\u2019s where this could get a little tricky. Although Infinix has a higher resolution, Samsung fits 1600 x 720 pixels into a relatively smaller screen, while Infinix fits 1640 x 720 (a slightly higher amount of pixels) into a bigger screen. The result? Samsung is left with a higher pixel density which could very well contribute to better display quality.\n\nProcessing power\n\nHere both devices bring entirely different offerings to the table. Although both processors are designed the same company MediaTek, the devices use processors from different families under MediaTek. Samsung Galaxy A12 uses the MediaTek p35 processor while the Infinix HOT 10T uses the MediaTek G70 processor. Both processors are 8 core processors but according to a Nano review, here\u2019s what you get out of them.\n\nFrom the breakdown above, it seems like the MediaTek G70 rules flawlessly over the MediaTek P35. Overall CPU performance for multitasking is better, gaming performance is also better and to cap it all up, the MediaTek G70 works at a faster clock rate of 2.oGHzcompared to Samsung at 1.8GHz.\n\nBattery\n\nIn this next round, we talk battery capacity. Both brands seem to be fairly pitched against themselves with 5000mAh batteries a piece. However, the Samsung Galaxy A12 provides better charging ability with 15w fast charging technology against Infinix HOT 10\u2019s 10W charging technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOperating system\n\nBoth devices run on the Google sponsored Android OS. However, Samsung uses an older version android 10. Well, it wasn\u2019t old until the 8th of September last year when Android 11 hit the market. Infinix HOT 10 on the other hand, runs on Android 11 the most recent version.\n\nFingerprint unlock\n\nOver the years, this has become another important smartphone feature. Using PINs and passwords have now been termed as taking the longer route. The only alternate solution to fingerprint unlock which has also gained attention is the facial unlock feature. However, it has been reported to be less secure in comparison with fingerprints.\n\nInfinix uses the common rear mounted finger print censor. Meaning its sensor is positioned at the back of the device and easily accessible with a touch from the pointer. However, Samsung uses a placement that I and a lot of other tech bros have come to enjoy better. Samsung A12 uses a side mounted fingerprint sensors. Side mounted fingerprint sensors are perfect because of how they\u2019re used to replace the power button (a button that we\u2019ve already become accustomed with). It\u2019s a lot easier and seamless.\n\nCamera\n\nSamsung is known to be a king in the area of smartphone photography. At the rear side of the Galaxy A12 Samsung uses a 48+5+2+2MP camera while the Infinix HOT 10 uses a 48+2+AI camera. Both cameras perform brilliantly under varying light conditions. However, the Infinix HOT 10 focuses on night life photography and performs exceptionally well in that regard. Using its Seper night mode and support from its QUAD led flash, Infinix brings more light into the beauty of the night life as contrasted below.\n\nSelfie comparison\n\nThe Infinix HOT 10T is available across all authorized retail stores nationwide at a retail price of 64800 while the Samsung A12 is sold at 67,200. Now that you have more information on what they offer, you can walk into any store and pick whichever one perfectly suits your need.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

It\u2019s a lot easier and seamless.\n\nCamera\n\nSamsung is known to be a king in the area of smartphone photography. At the rear side of the Galaxy A12 Samsung uses a 48+5+2+2MP camera while the Infinix HOT 10 uses a 48+2+AI camera. Both cameras perform brilliantly under varying light conditions. However, the Infinix HOT 10 focuses on night life photography and performs exceptionally well in that regard. Using its Seper night mode and support from its QUAD led flash, Infinix brings more light into the beauty of the night life as contrasted below.\n\nSelfie comparison\n\nThe Infinix HOT 10T is available across all authorized retail stores nationwide at a retail price of 64800 while the Samsung A12 is sold at 67,200. Now that you have more information on what they offer, you can walk into any store and pick whichever one perfectly suits your need.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "Egyptian agritech startup, Mozare3, has raised over $1 million in a pre-seed round. Algebra Ventures, Disruptech, and some angel investors like EFG-EV, participated in the round.\n\nMozare3 CEO, Hussein Abou Bakr, and his Co-founder, Tamer El-Raghy, founded the company in 2020 to assist more than 20 million smallholder farmers in Egypt by making markets and credits accessible to them.\n\nThe startup also plans to develop the first digital community for Egyptian farmers and offer them agronomy support through its professional network.\n\nThe agritech startup assists farmers sell their crops by working with institutional buyers like frozen vegetable processors, large retailers, and wholesalers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe farmers sign an offtake agreement \u2014 an arrangement between a producer and a buyer to purchase or sell portions of the producer\u2019s future goods \u2014 with Mozare3 to sell their produce at a particular price for institutional buyers.\n\nThis reduces the likelihood of the farmers not getting buyers after the harvest season. Most importantly, it encourages farmers to focus on their work without worrying about after-harvest sales.\n\nAccording to MENabytes, Abou Bakr said they currently have offtake agreements with 100 farmers and three large institutional buyers.\n\nAlthough most of Mozare3\u2019s work is done offline, a small group of farmers is currently beta testing its app.\n\nWith the app launch at the end of 2022, the company wants to reach over 10,000 farmers.\n\nIt would also allow farmers to access credit, receive agronomy support, buy fertilisers and other products to grow crops, and sell their products through its digital offtake agreements.\n\nAbou Bakr has over 20 years of experience in subsistence and commercial farming, food processing, and international trading. Before he founded Mozare3, he founded an agri processor and exporter, Plantform, that used to source produce from smallholders in over ten governorates in Egypt.\n\nThe CEO and the team hope to increase Mozare3\u2019s network to over 2,500 farmers with whom they have offtake agreements and increase its institutional buyers to over 37.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Egyptian agritech startup plans to introduce credit solutions to fund purchases of different products like motorbikes for the farmers and their families.\n\nEl-Raghy believes that Mozare3 would make supply more efficient by providing farmers with innovative financial products and turning them into contract farmers to fulfil consumers\u2019 growing demand, processors, and exporters.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, approximately 24 million people \u2014 over one-quarter of the population \u2014 work in Egypt\u2019s farming and fishing sectors. And being a major component of the economy, 6.5 million people depend on agriculture for survival.\n\nPerhaps Mozare3\u2019s plans to develop its tech, expand its team, and grow its network of farmers would help farmers and boost the economy as agriculture contributes 11.3% to the country\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nFeatured Image Credit: MENAbytes\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nNon progressive in Osun State are being intimidated by Aregbesola\u2019s rising profile. There have been several attacks on Aregbesola\u2019s birthday billboards from 2019 to date. Aregbesola is facing a big challenge to help the poorest people and ensure that everyone sees benefits from economic growth in Osun State as a result of the attacks. The attacks are calculated to smear the intimidating rising profile of Rauf Aregbesola.\n\nA billboard erected by the Caretaker Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the State of Osun, Hon. Rasaq Salinsile, to congratulate the Minister of Interior and former Governor of the state, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola on his 64th birthday, was recently destroyed. The billboard was erected at the famous Old Garage area, Osogbo, The billboard was erected at the famous Old Garage area, Osogbo, the state capital. It was said to have been destroyed by some unknown persons at the early hours of Monday.\n\nIn March 2021 Olateju Adunni, the Personal Assistant to Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola was attacked by some hired thugs. An elder brother to the Senator Representing Osun Central Senatorial District, Dr Ajibola Basiru, simply known as Simple, whose real name could not be confirmed as at the time of filing this report, was also attacked. Olateju Adunni, the Personal Assistant to Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola was attacked by some hoodlums. This was a direct attack on Aregbesola and his rising profile in Osun State.\n\nAn elder brother to the Senator Representing Osun Central Senatorial District, Dr Ajibola Basiru, simply known as Simple, whose real name could not be confirmed as at the time of filing this report, was also attacked by the thugs who shot and unleashed machete cuts on their victims. The hoodlums, according to eye witnesses, came in an 18-seater bus led by two armed policemen.\n\nI gathered that the victims were attacked at a restaurant in Oroki Estate, Osogbo, around 10:30pm, where the lawmaker representing Osogbo Constituency at the State of Osun House of Assembly, Hon Taofeek Badmus was marking his birthday.\n\nThe Personal Assistant to the Speaker of the House of Assembly, Hon Timothy Owoeye, identified as Joseph Akanbi, was also attacked by the hoodlums.\n\nIn June, 2020 the billboard hosting the \u200bpicture and complimentary messages for Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, the Minister of Interior, Federal Republic of Nigeria was destroyed. The billboard, which was erected at Jaleyemi junction, Osogbo, State of Osun by a socio-political group, \u2018Jaleyemi For Good Governance\u2019 was allegedly destroyed. The billboard was allegedly destroyed by some unknown persons. According to the Chairman of the group, Rasidi Bello, the billboard on which Aregbesola\u2019s picture appeared was torn and taken away.\n\nBello, stated that while attempting to fix replace the billboard with a new one, two members of a group loyal to Hon. Lasun Yusuf, former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, approached and warned them not to hang the banner.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhile we were attempting to fix the billboard and replace the banner with new Aregbesola\u2019s picture and complimentary words around 6PM, one Monsuru, popularly called Esu told us not to hang the banner. Another \u2018guy\u2019 known as Ibadi came to join him and also told us that we should not hang the banner. They said they wanted to hang IleriOluwa\u2019s banner on the billboard. The two of them are members of a group loyal to Hon Lasun Yusuf.\n\n\u201cLater, Nurudeen Adebayo, the leader of the group came and ordered his boys to attack us. They started throwing stones and broken bottles at us. We had to leave the place for them. They brought and spread out a big banner of IleriOluwa. \u2018Sponsored by Sola Oladepo\u2019 was written beneath the banner. Later, they uprooted the billboard and took it away.\u201d\n\nCorroborating Bello\u2019s claim, the Leader of the JaleyemiFor Good Governance, Idris Muftau, stated that members of the group had contributed to fix the billboard with a new banner on which \u2018Aregbesola: An Icon of Dynamism, the source and symbol of promotion of socio political excellence and good governance in the State of Osun\u2019 was written with picture.\n\nAccording to Muftau, the billboard was erected in 2016 and the group paid a sum of N16, 500 to the Osun Signage for them to host the new banner on it. He said the thugs that attacked them on Monday came back on Tuesday morning and threatened them not to dare erect any billboard at the spot again.\n\nMuftau said: \u201cWe were surprised that members of the Lasun Yusuf group could be telling us they wanted to host Ilerioluwa banner on our billboard without prior notice or due consultation. If anyone is going hang IleriOluwabanner in this place, it should be given to us. We worked for him and we are for him. It is absurd that two members of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) even joined the people that attacked us.\n\n\u201cOne of our members, Adetayo Adeleke was injured and rushed to the hospital. We reported the case at Oja Oba Police Station and the Divisional Police Officer led a team to the Jaleyemi junction to see the place the billboard was originally erected by us.\u201d\n\nInvestigations by the medium revealed that the said Lasun Yusuf group had dissolved into the APC and wanted to demonstrate their loyalty to Governor Adegboyega Oyetola and as such, resorted to hang a banner for him.\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes fro Osogbo, Osun State\n\n...",

          "text": "The \u00a34.2 million recovered from the former governor of Delta State, James Ibori, has been paid to the Delta State Government, the Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, said on Tuesday.\n\nThe fund, which the federal government recently received from the United Kingdom, is part of the proceeds of crime seized from the ex-governor.\n\nMr Idris stated this while appearing before the committee investigating the status of recovered loot.\n\nHe stated that \u201call recovered funds that belong to the respective states are paid directly to the states\u201d.\n\n\u201cSome recoveries are for state governments, I know there was a time recovery were made on behalf of Plateau State, there was one for Bayelsa, even Delta, such recoveries go to those states,\u201d he stated.\n\nAdejoro Adeogun (APC, Ogun), the chairman of the committee, asked Mr Idris specifically if the Ibori loot was paid to Delta State. He (Idris) answered in the affirmative.\n\n\u201cIt was paid to the state, it was paid to Delta State. Any recovery that is arising from any state, goes to that state. State governors will not even allow it to fly, they will take the federal government to court. We pay them their money,\u201d Mr Idris said.\n\nContradiction\n\nHowever, this contradicts the earlier position of the federal government.\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, had said the money will be used by the federal government to fund three ongoing projects; namely, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Abuja-Kano road and Second Niger Bridge.\n\nThe agreement to return the money to Nigeria was done under the auspices of the U.K.-Nigeria Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).\n\nMr Malami signed on behalf of Nigeria, while British High Commissioner, Catriona Laing, signed on behalf of the U.K.\n\nControversy\n\nThe issue of how the recovered fund will be expended when finally returned to Nigeria has been a matter of intense battle between the federal government and Delta State.\n\nThe federal government, through the AGF, has said the fund would be ploughed into the construction of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Abuja-Kano Road and the Second Niger Bridge, which he said would boost economic growth and help alleviate poverty.\n\nBut the Delta State Government had demanded the return of the money to the state adding that it should be left to decide how to spend the funds since its people were the victims of the looting.\n\nConviction\n\nMr Ibori pleaded guilty to money laundering, conspiracy to defraud, and forgery in a U.K. court in February 2012.\n\nHe was sentenced to a total of 13 years in prison.\n\nSome of his associates and family also received sentences for similar offences and were similarly sent to prison.\n\nMr Ibori, a man who stole millions from the suffering people of oil-rich Delta State and laundered the proceeds in the U.K., had earlier been set free of the charges by a Nigerian federal court.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe was later arrested in the United Arab Emirate (UAE) and extradited to the U.K where he was eventually jailed for the aspects of the crimes committed in the U.K.\n\nThe ex-convict, who was believed to retain his political influence in Delta State while serving his jail term in the U.K., returned to Nigeria in February 2017 after completing his imprisonment.",

the United Nations, the African Union and the European Union, as well as other friendly and partner nations to support the transition framework put in place by Chad\u2019s Transition Military Council led by General Mahamat Idris Deby.\n\n\u2018\u2018The need to support the Chadian government to effectively carry out its planned 18-month transition is sacrosanct.\n\n\u2018\u2018However, it must be stated that the sanctity of the Chadian constitution as the supreme guiding document defining the social contract in the country must be respected.\n\n\u2018\u2018The transition period should be civilian-led, with requisite powers given to the constitutionally mandated organs of government saddled with the responsibility of administering the country,\u2019\u2019 President Buhari in a statement by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, said.\n\nAt the in-person meeting attended by the Presidents of Central African Republic, Niger, Chad, Chairman of the Presidential Council of Libya and a representative of the President of Cameroon, President Buhari said the death of President Deby Itno had direct implications for the continued peace and stability of Chad as a nation, the Lake Chad region and the wider Sahel Region.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u2018\u2018Our region is faced with difficult, several challenges that need the support and engagement of all to overcome.\n\n\u2018\u2018While transnational crimes and rebellion cutting across our region continue to evolve in scope, the attendant conflicts also continue to retain their distinct form of inflicting untold hardship and difficulty on the lives of our citizens.\n\n\u2018\u2018The threats by the Chadian rebel groups, who are clamouring to overthrow the government, must be viewed with all the seriousness they deserve because the consequences of a destabilized Chad to the sub-region cannot be imagined.\n\n\u2018\u2018The flow of refugees and displaced persons from the country, unrestrained flow of arms, drugs and other harmful substances into Lake Chad and Sahel Regions, which are already challenged by terrorists seeking to establish parallel systems, would further compound the security and stability of our areas and neighbouring countries.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is, therefore, our collective duty and in honour of the memory of the men and women that have died in search of peace in the region, to rise in unison as leaders of the region to ensure that peace, stability and security are not disrupted in Chad and in the entire region.\n\n\u2018\u2018These challenges, which are fuelled by an interplay of poverty and the loss of sustainable means of livelihood due to climate change, have been further exacerbated by the direct consequence of complete breakdown of law and order in Libya.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Libyan conflict has increased fragility in our region with debilitating security implications across the Lake Chad and the larger Sahel Region, typified by increased circulation of illicit arms and ammunition, narcotic substances as well as a refugee crisis that continues to threaten the security of the region,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nUrging fellow leaders not to relent in their efforts and allow the enemies of the region to succeed in their quest to destabilize the area, President Buhari said: \u2018\u2018We must reinvigorate our collective will and commitment towards eradicating terrorism and entrenching democratic rule and good governance in Chad and in our region.\n\n\u2018\u2018We must remain focussed and true to ensuring sustainable development of the region.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari also used the occasion to commend the untiring efforts of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, the Multinational Joint Task Force, member countries\u2019 National Armed Forces and Security and Intelligence Agencies \u2018\u2018who daily strive to ensure the complete restoration of peace and stability in the region.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe pledged that officers, some of whom have paid the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty for the survival of the region, will never be forgotten.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are committed to ensuring that the ideals of restoring peace, stability and viability of the Lake Chad Region to its glorious state to which some of you have paid the ultimate price, is achieved,\u2019\u2019 he declared.\n\nOn the request of President Buhari and in recognition of the immense and sterling contributions of the late President of Chad to peace and stability in the region, the Summit observed a minute silence for the departed leader.\n\nEulogising the Marshal of Chad, President Buhari described the late President as a committed African leader and statesman who stood for peace and stability of the Lake Chad Region, the Sahel and the African continent in general.\n\n\u2018\u2018His passion, commitment and zeal to the cause of the Lake Chad and African unity would be greatly missed,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nRead also: Column: Lessons to Learn from Chad",

We have now provided the first COVID-19 vaccine doses to a total number of 1,929,237 Nigerians, representing 96% of the targeted population.\n\nIn addition, we have begun providing second doses, and that number has reached 4,683. Those individuals currently eligible for second doses will have received their first dose 6 to 12 weeks ago.\n\n\u201cWe are advising that all Nigerians who have received their first dose should check their vaccination cards for the date of their second dose, and ensure that they receive the second dose to gain full protection against COVID-19\u201d.\n\nWhile reiterating the commitment of his agency in raising more awareness on the pandemic which is currently ravaging the world, Dr Shuaib added that the agency is putting in place measures to ensure that Nigerians have access to accurate information about COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n\u201cAs we transition to administering second doses, our teams have assessed the communication and mobilization activities that have been undertaken thus far to create awareness for the COVID-19 vaccine and encourage uptake. We will be building on the work we\u2019ve already done in these areas to ensure that Nigerians can easily access accurate information about COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nOur goal is to do everything possible to educate, combat misinformation, and ensure confidence in the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, and to ensure all Nigerians have clear information on how, where, and when to get the vaccine. We will do this through continuous engagement and communication with communities across our country\u201d.\n\nOn the success achieved so far, he said, \u201cPermit me to say that the success we have achieved with the first dose is the collective efforts of all stakeholders, for which we are most grateful\u201d.\n\nHe further disclosed that about 440,000 health workers have so far taken the core BD19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cConcerning the proportion of health workers that have been vaccinated so far, 440,000 health workers have taken the core BD19 vaccine. This represents about 23 percent of the total number of people who have been vaccinated so far.\n\n\u201cIn particular, I want to use this opportunity to sincerely appreciate the father of the nation, His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, for his exemplary leadership and for providing all the needed resources to enable us successfully conduct this unprecedented massive vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe also wish to appreciate the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 response under the leadership of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha for his guidance. Our partners and donors have been with us providing technical support and resources.\n\n\u201cAs most people here know by now, the global community is facing great challenges regarding vaccine supply. Like most nations, this impacts the clarity over Nigeria\u2019s next shipment. While we have information that we may get the next consignment of vaccines by the end of July or August, these have not been officially confirmed.\n\nWhen we are able to, we will provide an update regarding timelines and details of the next shipment. At present, we do not have that information available due to the wider context we are in.\n\n\u201cHowever, we can update you on some positive developments. Pfizer and BioNTech pledged on Friday of last week to provide 1 billion doses of their COVID-19 vaccine to low-and-middle income countries by the end of 2021, and another 1 billion doses in 2022. Johnson & Johnson also announced it has signed a deal to provide 200 million doses of its vaccine to Covax\u201d.\n\n\u201cSeparately, the International Monetary Fund is now advocating for a $50 billion fund to be spent on ensuring a faster rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and is calling for at least 40% of the global population to be vaccinated by the end of this year, and at least 60% by June 2022.\n\nThe fund would be used to increase COVAX vaccine coverage, procure additional tests, and expand vaccine production capacity. We strongly endorse the creation of such a fund, and emphasize that all nations must have comparable access to COVID-19 vaccines in order to end this pandemic.\n\nAdditionally, the United States announced it will donate 20 million vaccine doses by the end of June to the COVAX scheme\u201d.\n\nHe also rolled out the rescheduled dates for the PSC\u2019s Zonal Town Hall meetings across the remaining Zones.\n\nHe further assured Nigerians that the Federal Government has taken significant precautions to protect Nigerians against B.1.617.2, known as the Indian variant.\n\n\u201cFlights from India and other high-risk countries such as Turkey and Brazil have been barred from entering Nigeria, we are ramping up our test and trace measures, and we are accelerating the national project to establish production of oxygen supplies across all states of Nigeria.\n\nI want to seize the opportunity to enjoin Nigerians to continue to observe the Public Health or non-pharmaceutical measures in place to curb the transmission of Covid-19, as we are not out of the woods yet\u201d, he added.\n\nHe commended World Health Organization, WHO and United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, UNICEF, Country Representatives Dr Walter Mulombo and Peter Hawkins respectively, for coming for the press conference.\n\nEarlier, UNICEF Country Representative, Peter Hawkins, called on governors, traditional, religious leaders and community leaders to encourage their people to step forward and be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cI want to encourage all governors, traditional, religious leaders and community leaders to encourage their people to step forward and be vaccinated. Protecting yourself is important and by doing so you also protect your family and your communities.\n\n\u201cWe hope that by the end of this year we will be able to vaccinate 40 million people and then in 2022 the remaining 60 million will be vaccinated to make up the 112 million which is our objective.\u201d",

          "text": "By Abankula\n\nGovernor Samuel Ortom of Benue has slammed the Buhari government\u2019s insistence on open grazing and cattle routes, saying they are ideas that were prevalent in the 1950s and no longer tenable in the 21st century.\n\nIn a statement released by Ortom\u2019s spokesman Terver Akase, Ortom said Buhari\u2019s insistence on open grazing reserves was curious.\n\n\u201cWe find the move not only shocking and curious but also as a misplaced priority,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Buhari Presidency on Monday queried the legality of the ban on open grazing by governors in the entire southern part of the country.\n\nIt also dismissed the move as a \u2018no solution\u2019 to the farmers and herdsmen crisis.\n\nInstead, in the statement signed by Presidential spokesman Garba Shehu, President Buhari was disclosed to have \u201ccommissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the States, starting with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant with stated requirements.\u201d\n\nBut Ortom ruled Benue out of the plan by the Federal Government, which will commence in June.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, the Presidency is the lone hand pushing for the continuation of open grazing and the return of cattle routes of 1950s and 60s.\n\n\u201cThe Presidency has, by its endorsement of open grazing, emboldened armed herders who lay claim to all lands in Nigeria as belonging to Fulani, hence their invasion of farming communities and killing of original owners of such lands.\n\n\u201cThe fact must be established that grazing reserves or cattle routes are no longer tenable in the 21st century when Nigeria\u2019s population far exceeds that of the fifties at a time these routes were contemplated.\n\n\u201cAt present, the routes have been taken over by airports, roads, schools, hospitals, as well as markets, houses and other human activities.\n\n\u201cThe country\u2019s land mass has also reduced to less than 923 square kilometers with the excision of Bakassi to Cameroon. Besides, the international best practice of animal husbandry is ranching; and that\u2019s the stand of Benue State.\u201d\n\n*Read the rest of the statement:\n\nWe in Benue have embraced ranching as the viable alternative to open grazing and there is no going back on our resolve. Our ranching law which prohibits open grazing is Benue people\u2019s reaction to the incessant killings, and it is also an instrument of development. The law was enacted by representatives of the people in the Benue State House of Assembly, in the exercise of its powers as provided for by Section 4 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended). Part 2 of the Second Schedule reinforces the power of the State House of the Assembly providing that \u201ca House of Assembly may make laws for the State with respect to industrial, commercial or agricultural development.\u201d The Law followed due process with public hearings and requisite opportunity for all stakeholders making input.\n\nRanching as a policy has the potential to launch Nigeria into 21st-century agricultural good practices. Today, open grazing is extinct in most countries of the world. In Europe, America, Asia and in many countries in Africa, pastoralism has long given way to ranching. How can Nigeria then still be battling with a problem of pastoralism that in other countries has been solved over a century ago? According to the United States Department of Agriculture, USDA, India has 303 million cattle, Brazil, 226 million, China, 100 million, USA, 93 million, Argentina, 53 million and Australia 27 million. All these countries ranch their animals. Nigeria has less than 20 million cattle which can easily be ranched. Unfortunately, the cows are allowed to either roam the streets freely or encroach on people\u2019s farms and other investments.\n\nWhile we may not stop the Federal Government\u2019s plan to rehabilitate grazing reserves or create cattle routes in other states, we wish to make it clear that no land in Benue State has been gazetted for grazing routes, grazing reserves, cattle colonies and Ruga settlements. Benue is therefore not part of the grazing reserves rehabilitation programme of the Federal Government.\n\nWe expect the Federal Ministry of Agriculture to weigh the negative consequences its recommendation will have on the unity and security of the nation and advise Mr President that Nigerians are not on the same page with him regarding the matter of open grazing. It is not too late to salvage the situation.\n\nWe are concerned about the plight of millions of farmers who have been displaced as a result of herders\u2019 attacks and are now in IDP camps; a development that is already adversely affecting food production. Benue State has over one million displaced people who are mostly farmers, and the task of returning them to their ancestral homes is what should bother the Ministry of Agriculture and other agencies of the Federal Government.",

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and its Production Sharing Contract (PSC) partners \u2013 Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo), Total Exploration and Production Nigeria Limited (TEPNG), Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria Limited (EEPNL) and Nigerian Agip Exploration (NAE) \u2013 have executed agreements to renew Oil Mining Lease (OML) 118 for another 20 years.\n\nThe five agreements signed include, Dispute Settlement Agreement, Settlement Agreement, Historical Gas Agreement, Escrow Agreement and Renewed PSC Agreement.\n\nA statement by the Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division of the NNPC, Dr. Kennie Obateru, quoted the Group Managing Director of the Corporation, Mallam Mele Kyari, as saying that over $10bn of investment would be unlocked as a result of the agreements which signaled the end of the long-standing disputes over the interpretation of the fiscal terms of the Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) and the emplacement of a clear and fair framework for the development of the huge deep-water assets in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, this is an indication of \u201ca renewed confidence between NNPC and her partners; between the Government and the investing communities which include NNPC. It produces value for all of us by providing a clear line of sight for investment in the Bonga bloc of around $10billion,\u201d Mallam Kyari stated.\n\nHe disclosed that the deal would yield over $780million in immediate revenues to the federal government while it would also free the parties from over $9billion in contingent liabilities.\n\n\u201cUltimately, these agreements will engender growth in our country where investment will come in for other assets, not just in the deep-water, but even for new investors. It is an opportunity for them to see that this country is ready for business,\u201d the GMD enthused.\n\nHe thanked President Muhammadu Buhari, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timpre Sylva, and the NNPC Board of Directors for enabling the Corporation to achieve this laudable landmark.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, the Country Chair of Shell Companies in Nigeria, Mr. Osagie Osunbor, said the OML 118 renewal agreement would remain a watershed in the history of deep-water investments in Nigeria, assuring that the giant stride would further bolster investor confidence in the country.\n\nSpeaking in a similar vein, the Managing Director of SNEPCo, Mr. Bayo Ojulari, noted that the agreements marked the end of a twelve-year dispute that had marred business relationships and affected trust and investment.\n\n\u201cToday, we have signed agreements that define the future of deep-water for Nigeria. This is the first deep-water block that was developed in Nigeria and it is also the first one that we are resolving all the disputes that will lay the foundation for the resolution of other PSCs,\u201d the SNEPCo helmsman stated.\n\nOn their parts, the Managing Directors of Total, Mike Sangster, Exxonmobil, Richard Laing and NAOC, Roberto Danielle, all applauded the GMD NNPC, Mallam Kyari, for providing leadership which engendered the resolution of the disputes, assuring that the agreements would attract more investments into the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "text": "Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom on Tuesday said the Federal Government\u2019s insistence on open grazing suggests it has a hidden agenda.\n\nThe Presidency had on Monday faulted the recent resolutions of the Southern Governors, including the ban on open grazing in the entire southern part of the country.\n\nA statement signed by Presidential spokesman Garba Shehu said the Governors\u2019 resolutions failed to provide any solution to the lingering crisis between farmers and herders in the country.\n\nInstead, the statement added, President Buhari has \u201ccommissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the States, starting with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant with stated requirements.\u201d\n\nBut the Benue State Governor, in a statement signed by spokesman Terver Akase, said the insistence on open grazing reserves was curious.\n\n\u201cWe find the move not only shocking and curious but also as a misplaced priority,\u201d the Ortom statement said.\n\n\u201cAt a time the country is worried about the worsening security situation and many Nigerians are calling for national dialogue to address the fundamental issues that have led to the present state of affairs, the Federal Government considers the reopening of cattle grazing routes as the only solution available to it.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Open Grazing Ban: Southern Governors Did Not Provide Any Solution \u2013 Presidency\n\nThe Governor faulted the Federal Government\u2019s plan to commence rehabilitation work on grazing reserves in the country next month.\n\nOrtom recalled that the Northern States Governors\u2019 Forum (NSGF) had met on February 9 and agreed that the current system of herding mainly by open grazing is no longer sustainable, in view of the growing urbanisation and population of the country.\n\nWhile noting that the Forum consequently resolved to sensitize herders on the need to adopt ranching as the new method of animal husbandry, Ortom said the 17 Governors of Southern Nigeria also met on May 11 in Asaba and banned open grazing in the entire region.\n\nThe Southern Governors, the Benue leader added, adopted ranching as the alternative method of rearing animals.\n\nHe added, \u201cAs it stands, the Presidency is the lone hand pushing for the continuation of open grazing and the return of cattle routes of 1950s and 60s. The Presidency has, by its endorsement of open grazing, emboldened armed herders who lay claim to all lands in Nigeria as belonging to Fulani, hence their invasion of farming communities and killing of original owners of such lands.\n\n\u201cThe fact must be established that grazing reserves or cattle routes are no longer tenable in the 21st century when Nigeria\u2019s population far exceeds that of the fifties at a time these routes were contemplated.\n\n\u201cAt present, the routes have been taken over by airports, roads, schools, hospitals, as well as markets, houses and other human activities. The country\u2019s land mass has also reduced to less than 923 square kilometers with the excision of Bakassi to Cameroon. Besides, the international best practice of animal husbandry is ranching; and that\u2019s the stand of Benue State.\u201d",

          "text": "The US will reopen its Consulate General in Jerusalem \u2014 a move that restores ties with Palestinians that had been downgraded by the Trump administration.\n\nThe consulate long served as an autonomous office in charge of diplomatic relations with the Palestinians. But former US President Donald Trump downgraded its operations and placed them under the authority of his ambassador to Israel when he moved the embassy to Jerusalem.\n\nTrump\u2019s move infuriated the Palestinians, who view east Jerusalem as occupied territory and the capital of their future state.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken, who announced the move, did not give a precise date for reopening the consulate.\n\nBlinken announced the step after a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.\n\n\u201cAs I told the president, I\u2019m here to underscore the commitment of the United States to rebuilding the relationship with the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people, a relationship built on mutual respect and also a shared conviction that Palestinians and Israelis alike deserve equal measures of security, freedom opportunity and dignity,\u201d he said.\n\nBlinken is in the region to help shore up the cease-fire last week that ended a devastating war 11-day war between Israel and Gaza\u2019s militant Hamas rulers that killed more than 250 people, mostly Palestinians, and caused widespread destruction in the impoverished coastal territory.\n\nHe promised to \u201crally international support\u201d to help Gaza in the wake of the war. He later announced nearly $40 million in aid to the Palestinians, including $5.5 million in emergency assistance for Gaza. That brings total U.S. assistance to the Palestinians under the Biden administration to over $360 million after the Trump administration had cut off nearly all assistance to them.\n\nBlinken has promised that any assistance will be kept out of the hands of Hamas, which does not recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist and which Israel and the US consider a terrorist organisation.\n\nThe truce that ended the Gaza war on Friday has so far held, but it did not address any of the underlying issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, something Blinken acknowledged after meeting earlier in the day with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\u201cWe know that to prevent a return to violence, we have to use the space created to address a larger set of underlying issues and challenges. And that begins with tackling the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza and starting to rebuild,\u201d he said.\n\nThe top US diplomat faces the same obstacles that have stifled a wider peace process for more than a decade, including a hawkish Israeli leadership, Palestinian divisions and deeply rooted tensions surrounding Jerusalem and its holy sites. The Biden administration had initially hoped to avoid being drawn into the intractable conflict and focus on other foreign policy priorities before the violence broke out.\n\nThe truce remains tenuous since tensions are still high in Jerusalem and the fate of the Palestinian families is not yet resolved.",
