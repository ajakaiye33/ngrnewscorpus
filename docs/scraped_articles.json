          "title": "Cooking gas demand falls by 38%, marketers clash over price",
          "text": "National cooking gas demand has dropped by 38 percent, according to the Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers, NALPGAM.\n\nThe revelation came on the heels of clamours by a group of experts on Tuesday that demand for Liquefied Natural Gas, popularly known as cooking gas, had dropped to a record low across the country.\n\nThe President of the Nigerian Gas Association, Ed Ubong, said at a downstream event in Lagos that national gas consumption had dropped due to high prices.\n\nThe Executive Secretary of NALPGAM, Bassey Essien, also confirmed the development to The PUNCH during a telephone interview.\n\nFollowing the clamour, NALPGAM, President Oladapo Olatunbosun, on Wednesday, said gas demand had dropped from 1.2 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) to around 750,000mtpa.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that the local consumption of cooking gas has dropped from 1.2 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) to around 750,000mtpa out of which about 600,000 mtpa is supplied by local producers,\u201d he said, bringing the percentage drop in demand to 37.5 percent per annum.\n\nThis brings to fore, the achievement of President Buhari\u2019s National Gas Expansion Programme which seeks to deepen local gas usage within the next decade.\n\nThe Federal Government had targeted a consumption of 5mn metric tonnes per annum.\n\nOlatunbosunalso alleged that the Nigeria Liquefied Petroleum Gas Association inflated price of a 20metric tons by 100 percent.\n\nAccording to him, gas importers who were members of NLPGA sold to plant owners at N12.7million per 20metric tons (MT) despite purchasing the product at around N7 million per 20MT from NLNG and other local producers.\n\nWhile NALPGAM is the association of indigenous private companies with operating gas bottling plants with membership spread across the country, the NLPGA is the umbrella body of all stakeholders including importers, skid owners and also players in the LPG sector in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, cooking gas, as at Monday, May 23, was N750 per kilogram(Kg) at the depot and was sold at N800/kg at the retail end in Lagos, Ogun and some states in the South West, while the same quantity went as high as N900 to N1000 per kg at retail end in Gombe and Bayelsa and other states.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt does not make economic sense to be supplied with a receipt of around N7 million per 20MT and sell to consumers at the same price that imported LPG landed in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cGive us the exact figure of LPG your members got from NLNG. We are aware that the local consumption of cooking gas has dropped from 1.2 million metric tonnes per annum(mmtpa) to around 750,000mtpa out of which about 600,000 mtpa is supplied by local producers.\u201d\n\nThe General Manager, External Relations & Sustainable Development, NLNG, Andy Odeh, told Sunday PUNCH in an email response that it could not disclose its contractual agreement with its customers. \u201cWe have no comments on your enquiries as our sales terms are confidential and commercially sensitive information,\u201d he said, when asked to disclose the price it sold to marketers.\n\nWhile speaking during one of the technical sessions on the topic \u2018Gas as a catalyst for sustainable economic development- The role of Nigerian Content\u2019, at \u2018The Nigerian Content Midstream and Downstream Oil and Gas Summit 2022\u2019 organised by the Nigerian Content and Development Monitoring Board, NCDMB, in Lagos on Tuesday, gas stakeholders unanimously submitted that national gas consumption was currently very low and expressed worry over the dwindling purchasing power of Nigerians.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Wole SOYINKA\n\nSo, it has happened! No one can claim it was nowhere fearfully expected, but one dared hope that the ugly, abominable word \u201creprisal\u201d would remain locked down within the dark pit of primitivism hidden in the Nigerian psyche. I decided to edit out the warning expression of that fear from my recent Abuja statement \u2013 this was a concession to a superstitious fear, that \u201cgiving it voice\u201d could set off the zombie trigger in the homicidally inclined. Then of course one would be held responsible for inserting the notion in the heads of others. We all know however that these retarded minds are ever present among us, and only await the most trivial excuse to actualize their innermost craving. From the pronouncements of even those who claim to be men of God, we are left in no doubt that such craving receives endorsement from across the human spectrum. Where they cannot act, they incite others to fulfill their credo of morbidity.\n\nThe horror that was recently afflicted on the people of Anambra and the rest of us was redoubled for me personally because the news reached me outside the country while I was participating in an event of youth empowerment \u2013 a college graduation ceremony. The anticipated question surfaced again and again: What kind of mind is capable of such bestiality? And yet it happens, again and again. We know who these killers are, they live among us. Sometimes I undergo the feeling that I actually know them, that I have encountered them, have heard them and perhaps even read them. And we know that unless they are pre-emptively denounced and exposed, they will strike and strike again. Their actions reduce us all, tarnish us, and question our humanity.\n\nAt the Abuja event, exactly a week ago, I proposed the need to develop the collective sense of a Lowest Common Denominator in the seizure of our humanity. Any act that attempts to drag us below, or remove that rung of the human ladder should be answered by a total community shutdown \u2013 or other equivalence \u2013 of its own accord, until that rung is fully reclaimed. The Anambra infanticidal orgy is one such. Deborah Samuel\u2019s mob immolation was another. Response to such abominations transcends the mandatory functions of security agencies. The act constitutes a breach in community ramparts and should be answered by collective action. Again, I insist that it is long past time to move beyond pious denunciations \u2013 essential, yes, but insufficient. We simply must devise ways of making our revulsion so stark, unambiguous, and inclusive. Only then will such pollutants of civic consciousness be brought to rethink, come to understand that it is not just the immediate family, friends and colleagues whose humanity is thus violated, but the totality of cohabitants.\n\nI admitted, in Abuja, that I nearly cancelled that engagement as an expression of that revulsion, and in solidarity with the bereaved. In the end, I decided that this would not be the right gesture. It so happens that I also have an engagement in Anambra, at a school where, for all I know, the children of Mr. Jibril Ahmed were enrolled, or would soon be enrolled, a sanctuary of learning for the one yet in the womb of the murdered Harira. It need not have been that very institution, but it is to just such a place of creative formation that they were all innately predetermined. Collective action is not always easy to come by \u2013 except of course by coercion, which is what we are witnessing in the activities of militant groups in the East. That, however, is not the issue, this being a crossroads that the Anambra people will navigate themselves. The cold-blooded murder of guests in our home is however not merely a national issue but a violation of the much touted values of the black race. We must begin somewhere, \u201cdraw a line\u201d \u2013 however individual and limited. I totally repudiate the killing of guests, of the unarmed, of innocents , the vulnerable, indeed, the murder of humanity.\n\nThis time, I believe the decision is right, the moment compelling. In empathy with those innocents whose scholastic careers have been so brutally annulled, I serve notice of cancellation of that engagement with the Anambra school, scheduled for August. The deaths of those innocents cannot be reversed, but we must begin, even yesterday, the process of reversing the mental trajectory that makes death from innocence the current norm of national existence.",

The Multi-National Joint Task Force in the Lake Chad region and the G5 in the Sahel have continued to degrade the insurgents by substantially reducing their capacity to inflict harm on our citizens.\n\n\u201cMr. Chairman, these efforts, however, need to be strengthened and complemented by the African Union, through the African Union Peace and Security Architecture.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason, Mr. Chairperson, that we endorse the key recommendations contained in your report. Some of the recommendations which we believe should be implemented immediately include;\n\n\u201cIncreasing troop levels in situations of combating terrorism, and enhancing intelligence capabilities of deployed troops, including improving the operational cooperation of contingents in the operation areas;\n\n\u201cEnsuring the readiness of the African Standby Force for immediate response when a Member State is under terrorist threat;\n\n\u201cStrengthening the fight against cybercrime, money laundering, drugs and arms trafficking, smuggling of persons and counterfeit goods, which facilitate terrorist financing; and\n\n\u201cEnsuring that specialized institutions like the African Centre for the Study and Research on Terrorism and AFRIPOL, are adequately resourced in order for them to effectively discharge their mandate,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMore than validating the report on terrorism, the President underscored the need for political will to forge a \u201cCoordinated Continental Approach to tackling insecurity.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason, that we commend the Chairperson of the Commission for his comprehensive report on Terrorism and Violent Extremism in Africa. The report is very enriching, resonating and it behooves us as the Assembly of the African Union to show the political will and forge a Coordinated Continental Approach to tackling insecurity, as we must entrench peace and stability on our continent,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nPresident Buhari said the recommendations, if implemented, will go a long way in increasing the capacity of affected states to respond to the threats posed by terrorists and violent extremists in their respective countries.\n\n\u201cYour Excellencies, this summit affords us yet another opportunity as leaders of the continent to rub minds and take far-reaching decisions to address the challenges of terrorism and violent extremism on our continent.\n\n\u201cThe activities of these sinister groups have not only led to the loss of valuable lives and property.\n\n\u201cThey have equally taken a drastic toll on our national economies. The capacity of Governments to address infrastructural needs and other developmental challenges, in line with our Sustainable Development Goals is grossly diminished.\n\n\u201cThe resources meant for developmental programmes are being channeled to fight terrorists and violent extremists, who are currently rampaging our continent,\u2019\u2019 the President said.\n\nThe Commission Reports on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism and Violent Extremism and on Unconstitutional Changes of Government in Africa was presented by the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, H.E. Moussa Faki Mahamat.\n\nThe report looked at persistent threats, evaluated current response mechanisms, and decided on the specific actions and measures necessary to strengthen the collective security of the Member States facing terrorism and violent extremism.\n\nThe report also recommended actionable measures needed to stem the upsurge in the continent.",

          "title": "Osun 2022: Between money politics and good governance",
          "text": "Gradually but steadily, the stage is being set for the Osun governorship election. As July 16, 2022, the date fixed for the poll by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), is drawing nearer, it is no longer news that political activities are on the increase and the atmosphere is being charged. The gladiators are already spoiling for war and the coveted trophy in sight is the Osun governorship seat, currently occupied by Gboyega Oyetola.\n\nOnly recently, Ademola Adeleke, the factional candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), bragged before a rather stunned audience that he was \u201cloaded with enough money\u201d and would be going into the election to spend \u2018not only naira but dollars, pounds and Euro\u201d and that, \u201cthis time around\u201d, it would be \u201cfire-for-fire.\u201d And, in what looked like a swift response, Governor Oyetola of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) said that he had no frivolous money to purchase private jets for traditional rulers or hard currencies to fritter. Rather, he would be bringing to the table his competence and imbued capacity to transform the state through good governance. Hear him: \u201cas you all know, a state like Osun is too sophisticated for kindergarten politicians to govern. It is too costly to allow such people to experiment with Osun.\u201d\n\nTo start with, Adeleke\u2019s boastful gesture and attitudes remind one of a Yoruba saying: \u2018oro t\u2019owo ba se ti, ile lo maa gbe\u2019 (money answereth all things). Till date, this aphorism sits squarely within the thoughts and social content of the Yoruba society. Perhaps, due to our level of development and the gnawing impact of poverty, it is unfortunately true and inviolable! The race may change it tomorrow; but, until that happens, this is the way it is! That\u2019s why it will be foolhardy for anybody to ignore the role or impact of money in politics.\n\nThat said, the level of development in Nigeria \u2013 and Osun State in particular \u2013 must be brought to the fore to draw useful inferences from what Adeleke said concerning the state of his preparedness for the forthcoming election. Without being unnecessarily immodest, the significant import of the pronouncement can only find succour in the inner workings of the PDP gubernatorial hopeful: \u2018voters\u2019 consent in Osun has been commoditised\u2019; \u2018votes are for sale in Osun\u2019; and \u2018merchandise goes to the highest bidder\u2019. Apparently, Adeleke did not understand the socioeconomic-cum-political implications of his utterances. Of course, this is troubling!\n\nThat Nigeria has Americanized her politics by lacing it with money has created an erroneous impression that the influence of money is absolute. The interesting thing about this erroneous assertion that it is not true! For instance, the American society still puts high premium on justice and accountability. However, here in Nigeria, the native prebendal politics only ensures \u2018poverty for the masses, riches for a few.\u2019 Hence the ever-increasing gap between the rich and the poor, which is already tilting our society towards the precinct of an inevitable collapse. Yes, a man who has not eaten in the last two days is bound to despise his birth-right for \u2018some bread and lentil stew.\u2019 Such a soul would probably cower at the supplication of Ademola\u2019s \u2018dollars, pounds and Euro.\u2019 But then, the society will end up being worse for it. Huge influx of money without tangible production of goods and services will likely trigger a running inflation and impact the domestic economy negatively.\n\nIn fairness to posterity, Adeleke is one of the reasons Nigeria is lagging behind in development and innovative thinking. How do I mean? A country that wants to grow will neither breed governors whose priority is in buying private jets for traditional rulers nor contemplate a money-driven election that will end up being \u2018fire-for-fire.\u2019 Had the PDP governorship candidate worked for the money which he has been squandering upandan, history has shown that he most certainly would have behaved differently. The more reason he needs to be thoroughly rebuked for attempting to import a very toxic phenomenon into Osun politics.\n\nBy the way, let it be known that Adeleke started trekking this despicable political path some five years ago, during the immediate past administration in Osun. Remember his Year 2017 senatorial pursuit, following his elder brother\u2019s demise! Remember the illogical premise that Osun West Senatorial bye-election ticket should be surrendered to Ademola, simply because Isiaka Adeleke, the man who held the office before his demise, was Ademola\u2019s elder brother? Of course, consensus failed, and election was called as expected in a democracy. At the end of the day, a gullible electorate succumbed to the sweet melody of loaves of bread and wads of naira notes and PDP won in 9 out of the 10 Local Governments in the Senatorial District. Ejigbo Local Government, which reluctantly went to the ruling party, was won marginally.\n\nReports even had it that while Adeleke\u2019s tenure lasted in the Upper Chamber, the \u2018Dancing Senator\u2019 neither attempted a good deed for his Senatorial District nor quenched the fire of a wrong move. He was just there! Tragically, the electorate couldn\u2019t ask questions about his scorecard while he was in the Senate. Again, this is where the society is also culpable! If Adeleke didn\u2019t do well at the Red Chamber, why then must he be considered for election as Osun State\u2019s First Citizen? Unfortunately, it is because nobody has been asking that question that Ademola is now trying to insult our collective intelligence. The question, then, is: is this how our people will want to waste four years on pecuniary conveniences for which forty years won\u2019t be able to revive?\n\nIs the PDP governorship hopeful a sellable candidate? Well, all over the world, electability is a function of unimpeachable character profile and socially-prescribed benchmarks as they relate to an individual\u2019s social class roles and expectations in the society. Yes, at the level of \u2018Area Boys\u2019, they can be found as willing tools. That is understandable! But it is a statement of fact that \u2018Area Boys\u2019 have no credible future. Besides, he who aspires to become Osun governor must be able to read a Budget. So, it will be unwise for the contestant to think that he can railroad a whole society into his compromised camp.\n\nOn a last note, it is a statement of fact that money has its own serious impact on the society. That\u2019s a truth no one can run away from. To deny the fact that it has a serious impact in politics and our social existence is to be clever by half. However, even, if Adeleke parts with, say, \u00a31000 for each voter, such a voter will surely finish spending it. Chances are that the money will go back to England because Nigerians will buy products that are not manufactured here.

          "title": "New thinking in public service and administration",
          "text": "The Fourth Industrial Revolution has already become definitive of the twenty-first century, and the Nigerian civil service system cannot afford to keep struggling to key into the fundamentals of a new age that has transformed human sensibilities and ethos in many radical ways, from the way we work to the ways we organize our lives and existence. The public service is one of the fundamental institutions, across the globe, that has been significantly affected by the massive and radical digital transformations of human administrative endeavors. The challenge, however, and especially with a public service in a difficult administrative environment like Africa, is how easy it is for the public service to be caught up in its bureaucratic rules and processes in ways that deeply circumscribed its efficiency and service delivery mandate. This is all the more so for the Nigerian public service and her struggle to reprofessionalise as a functional institution while undermining her bureaucratic credentials.\n\nThis is not a light assessment given the predilection for an institution like the public service to be taken in by administrative traditions, and be fixated on a procedural mindset that is firmly opposed to change. Such a mindset becomes trapped unfortunately in yesterday\u2019s ways of thinking and is immune from exploring the new possibilities available for making the public service a better institution for complementing the capabilities of the state to improve the well-being of humans. The vocation of the public service\u2014the administrative principles, codes of practice, ethical values and knowledge systems\u2014constitute all that shapes the future of the profession. However, what happens if the professionals are not looking up, and defining the conditions and circumstances that make for the continuous transformation of the profession? What happens, that is, if we refuse to conduct regular environmental scanning, deploy scenario planning, follow global trends, or interrogate the intellectual assumptions and theories undergirding administrative practices? Thus, with the shifting demographics, constantly evolving technologies, and environmental sustainability challenges, the way we lead, the way we administer, the way we solve problems or manage change, etc., are changing so dramatically now that any institution not willing to key into the innovative sensibility will be left behind. And, of course, the Nigerian public service cannot afford to be left behind.\n\nThe way forward is straightforward: it involves investing in new thinking. The idea of new thinking speaks about the capacity of an individual, an organisation or a state to assess and reassess current situation and future possibilities through a strategic framework that will enable the individual, organization or state function better and more efficiently. The idea of new thinking is conditioned by a reform program that is strategic. In other words, new think for any organization or institution combines strategic thinking and strategic planning to be able to face the future. It is this strategic thinking that allows an institution like the public service to rethink and reengineer its modus operandi and business model to become better.\n\nThe notion of new thinking presupposes an old one. And with regard to the public service, this old thinking template is represented by the traditional, \u201cI-am-directed\u201d Weberian framework that defines administrative business before the advent of the managerial revolution. This Weberian structure required from civil servants the requisite characteristics of anonymity, neutrality and impartiality, and an overall profile circumscribed by efficiency, effectiveness, integrity, accountability, responsiveness, representativeness, loyalty, equity, fairness, and so on. However, it is a system that is essentially hierarchical, cumbersome and acutely bureaucratic to effectively fulfil the mandate of good governance. As a migrated structure, the Weberian system arrived Nigeria without its value foundation. This made it impossible for the Weberian structure to organizationally mature into fully formed and value-oriented institution. Thus, it eventually became a bureaucratic paradigm that became ultimately a bureaucratic culture that contributed to the underdevelopment narrative in Nigeria. This made it possible for the system to be hijacked by various personalities for selfish and short-term ends.\n\nTransforming the public service in the grip of this old business model demands also that the reformer must put in mind that the transition into the fourth industrial revolution must also occur within what has been called the VUCA environment. The public service is immersed in a VUCA environment, characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. These are four elements that are defined by the state of the world, decisions of government, and national dynamics. The VUCA environment is one that confronts the functioning of the public service and demands an engagement that enables the public service to confront the challenges and achieve administrative excellence in the process. This implies that such a public manager who will steer the public service through the challenges of the VUCA environment cannot be merely transactional, and operating with a twentieth century administrative mindset. It also means that the public service must always aspire to become capacity ready in meeting the challenges of governance and administration that the social, political, cultural and economic environments might throw up.\n\nThe public service, within a VUCA environment, is faced with the challenge of transforming itself within what is called a scenario. In administrative reform, a scenario consists of a starting point (an initial or alpha state), a trajectory (chain of steps or events) and a future (omega) state. A reform agenda or scenario therefore takes a state from the alpha point though a trajectory to an omega point. Within a VUCA environment, therefore, the public service is always finding itself in an alpha point as the environment keeps getting complex and challenging, and is always oriented towards an omega that is better able to serve the needs of the citizens. The burden of the VUCA environment, together with the imperative of the fourth industrial revolution, requires that the public service in Nigeria must be constrained by the demand of strategic thinking and planning. While strategic thinking is conceptual and initiates the search for imaginative strategies, strategic planning is more programmatic in the ways it formalizes the steps involved in transforming the public service.\n\nIn thinking and planning strategically, therefore, care must be taken to distinguish between creating a strategy and being strategic. On the one hand, creating a strategy is a process of translating a plan into a set of results. On the other hand, the act of being strategic is a competence that involves critical thinking. The argument is that an institution, like the public service, requires strategic thinking to generate a reform strategy that will move the institution forward into more optimal functionality and productivity. Both must be channeled institutionally to the most central process of strategic decision making. This is what allows the institution to either think outside of the box or even without a box to structure institutional imagination. Strategic decision-making is ultimately tied to an institution\u2019s capacity to maneuver through the VUCA environment in order to perform better. Thus, to move the Nigerian public service system forward to an omega point of cutting-edge optimality that creates performance, public value and productivity, there is the need to bring strategic thinking to bear on the institutional parameters, processes and values in ways that generate strategies for efficiency and effectiveness. Here, we survey the significant areas that constitute the locus of new thinking for the public service and the transformation of its efficiency and service delivery capacity.\n\nSince strategic decision-making is key to the adoption and deployment of new thinking in Nigeria\u2019s public service, then strategic policy intelligence emanating from the irreducible developments in contemporary decision science becomes inevitable. Decision science has become a critical field that has integrated cognate developments from artificial intelligence, organisational psychology, systems thinking, machine learning, probabilistic modeling, scenario analysis, big data analytics, and many more to become a key area that the public service must buy into to push forward its policy intelligence that strengthen decision-making. Modern policy making that has taken cognizance of decision science will most likely possess nine fundamental features: (i) forward-looking; (ii) outward-looking; (iii) innovative, flexible and creative; (iv) evidence-based; (v) evaluation; (vi) review; (vii) joined-up; (viii) inclusive; and (ix) learned lessons.\n\nStrategic decision-making in turn demands that we rethink the nature of government and of the governance space where this strategy would be deployed. This is the occasion for the open government initiative to create a Public Service 2.0. Open government is founded on the principle that government\u2014not just its laws and policies, but the reasons and processes of decisions that generated those policies and the flows of money that fund their implementation\u2014should be open to the citizens and nongovernmental agents. The idea of open government aligns the public service with the necessity of (re)creating public value(s) that will transform the quality of life of the citizens. Indeed, the joint production of public value(s) by the government, nonstate actors and the citizens places the public service squarely within the ambit of the New Public Governance approach, the New Public Administration, and the New Public Service approaches that place the active citizens at the core of democratic governance, and the center of service delivery by the public service.\n\nNo public service can operate within the imperatives of the fourth industrial revolution without transforming its idea of human resources management and the dynamics of the workplace. For example, the idea of remote working and specialist contractors provide an institution like the public service the capacity to recruit a global workforce and create incentives that increase employee loyalty and commitment, and collaborations that generate productivity. This gives room for the achievement of a better work-life balance deriving from freer time and flexibility to work. And facilitates the acquisition of \u201ctwenty-first century literacies\u201d: (a) interpersonal skills: facilitation, empathy, political skills; (b) synthesising skills: sorting evidence, analysis, making judgements, offering critique and being creative; (c) organising skills: group work, collaboration and peer review; and (d) communication skills: better use of new media and multi-media resources.\n\nThus, even though institutional reform is inevitable within the public service system in Nigeria, such a reform must be constrained by the imperatives of new thinking that arms the public service system with the wherewithal by which it must facilitate its own transformation. This is how the public service can become not only world-class, but compliant with the fourth industrial revolution and the challenge of national development in Nigeria.",

          "text": "It gives me great pleasure to be here to felicitate with you on the Nigerian Air Force 58th Anniversary Celebration. This is particularly so because the Nigerian Air Force has over these 58 years transformed into a formidable and resilient air force that is positioned to effectively tackle both contemporary and future security challenges\u201d. \u201cThis adaptability has thus enabled the Service to respond effectively to our dynamic national security challenges.\u201d \u201cOn assumption of office I \u201cpromised to equip and re-professionalize our armed forces to perform their constitutional responsibilities more effectively and we have demonstrated the required political will and leadership as well as committed resources towards capacity building and re-professionalizing the armed forces.\u201d \u201cToday, I can say confidently that the armed forces have indeed witnessed tremendous improvement in the past seven years. In particular, the provision of modern equipment and personnel motivation through enhanced welfare are also ongoing\u201d. \u201cThe provision of modern equipment and personnel motivation\u201d, like the Super Tucanos and the Augusta helicopter gunships among others, have greatly helped turn the tide in the fight against terrorists and other non-state actors, and sustained the Nigerian Air Force\u201d. \u201cWe will continue to provide more platforms to modernise the Nigerian armed forces\u201d. \u2013 President Muhammadu Buhari, speaking at the ceremonial parade to commemorate NAF\u2019s 58th anniversary in Kano, Monday, 24 May, 2022.\n\nGoing further he said: \u201cto this end, we have approved the procurement of more platforms such as the Beechcraft, some modern helicopter gunships and UAVs for the Nigerian Air Force to enable it to man our airspace more effectively. Be rest assured that as a government, we are willing to do even more to ensure the provision of the requisite support and encouragement to overcome various security challenges.\u201d\n\nIf the above are true, with the fact that the Nigerian military is widely regarded as a decent fighting force, why then has Nigeria not been able to make a dent on the crippling insecurity that has literally crippled Nigeria throughout the Buhari administration?\n\nThis article will interrogate why.\n\nThe piece, though not necessarily inspired by Niyi Akinnaso\u2019s \u201cWho gets kidnapped or killed next? -The Nation, Wednesday 25 May, 2022, as I had decided on the topic the previous Tuesday after reading newspaper accounts of the serial killings, muggings and kidnappings that happened in literally every part of the country days before, it at least affirmed for me, the reasonableness of having to now call the President\u2019s attention to the fact that he has barely a year left in office as well as from the distinct possibility of having his tenure dubbed the bloodiest in the annals of Nigerian history, the civil war years inclusive. It actually did a little more than that, as it pointed unmistakably to the fact that I am not, in any way being flippant, when I write here that the time has come for Nigerians to ask President Buhari the reason, or reasons, life has become so short and bruttish under his watch. We should equally ask Mr President how he intends to change this odious trajectory since, as they say, it is unwise to continue to do things the same way, and expect to have a different outcome.\n\nSlightly over a year ago on 9 May, 2021, I wrote as follows on these pages: \u201cNigeria has always been reputed as having one of the best armies in Africa and has, for that reason, led many multi- national operations, both here in West Africa, contributed to United Nation\u2019s peace keeping operations elsewhere\u201d. \u201cUnfortunately, that is now history as the Nigerian security forces is not only spread thin, locally, in many theatres of war, but also made to keep peace over a huge swathe of territory where insecurity has become the order of the day\u201d. \u201cIndeed, not too long ago, wives of some soldiers had cause to demonstrate, protesting their husbands having to fight Boko Haram terrorists almost bare handed\u201d. \u201cThat was the result of some military officers, some of who have since been convicted, stealing security funds with both hands. Add to the above, the ease with which some unpatriotic elements reveal plans and movements of our soldiers mostly for religious reasons, or by those who see the fight against terrorists as an attack on the North or on Muslims\u201d. \u201cGiven these circumstances, it is no surprise that our soldiers have become somewhat overwhelmed with some of them turning tail on battle field, abandoning their weapons, which then fall into enemy hands. Nigeria is thus fighting the insecurity war like she has her hands tied behind her backs despite the yeoman\u2019s efforts of our soldiers who still put in their best in spite of the obvious disadvantages that confront them\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf the above is the situation in areas like the Northeast where our soldiers are involved in asymetric war against terrorists, what of the thousands of murderous herdsmen and bandits, spread all over Northern forests and those thousands who were funneled into Southern forests during the Covid -19 lockdown while Nigerian security forces looked the other way, and are now kidnapping and killing people all over the South?\n\nYet there\u2019s hardly any arraignment in courts of these serial murderers, and where there are, at all, the cases are soon summarily terminated on orders from above\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut things will soon change as victims are about to start defending themselves and their ancestral lands against these mauruders, even if with the last pint of their blood\u201d.\n\nThis will be the natural response by victims if President Buhari will only continue to ask Nigerians to pray as antidote against AK 47 which these untouchable terrorists, and bandits, brandish all over the country without law enforcement agencies checking them as if Nigeria is a country without laws\u201d. \u201cThe time has come for President Buhari to rule like he is President of the whole of Nigeria and, therefore, stop asking beleaguered communities, like Benue state, to continue to tolerate their killers who he described as their neighbours\u201d.\n\nWithout mincing words, President Buhari has, through his mismanagement of our diversity, encouraged a massive rush into the country, of a huge number of sahelian Fulanis from countries where terrorism has become second nature, and they come fully armed into Nigeria. This he did, not only when he announced a visas on arrival policy for all Africans while attending the Aswan Forum for sustainable peace and development in Africa, which took place in Egypt, but mainly through his continuing encouragement of open grazing by Fulani herdsmen despite the horrors they cause, as well as through his directive to the Attorney \u2013 General of the federation to gazette a moribund, if not totally non existent, grazing routes all over the country.\n\nBut these are not the only ways President Buhari has tacitly encouraged and, ipso facto, sparked insecurity in Nigeria. For reasons which cannot be far from ethnic and religious consainguity, his government, which trailed Nnamdi Kanu all the way to Kenya and has, since his rendition, hauled him before the courts, as well as followed Igboho of the Yoruba Nation fame all the way to Benin Republic, has not said a word beyond Attorney \u2013 General Malami giddily announcing, on 23 September 2021, that the government has nabbed 400 financiers of terrorism in the country.\n\nListen to him:\u201dThe Federal Government has suceeded in blocking terrorism financing in Nigeria. It has also succeeded in identifying, and detaining, \u201chigh profile individuals\u201d responsible for funding terrorists\u2019 activities in the country\u201d. That was after he had announced in May of the same year \u201cthat the Nigerian government was about to begin the prosecution of about 400 suspected Boko Haram financiers and was profiling some high-profile Nigerians strongly suspected to be financing terrorism for prosecution\u201d. Speaking further, he said:\u201dWe have succeeded in identifying those that are responsible for funding terrorists. We have also blocked the leakages associated with funding and are embarking on aggressive investigation that is indeed impacting positively in terms of the fight against terrorism\u201d. \u201cBut then, the truth of the matter is that investigation is ongoing, is advancing and for the purpose of investigation, I wouldn\u2019t like to be pre-emptive in terms of making disclosures that would have the effect of undermining the successes we are recording as far as investigation is concerned\u201d.\u201dWe have indeed obtained a legitimate court order taking into consideration what we have presented before the court and which made the court to, eventually, exercise its discretion in granting orders that we can have them in custody\u201d.\n\nNot at all surprising, President Buhari\u2019s Attorney \u2013 General has since then been in a literal trance. Mum has been the word since then you would think Nigerian courts have shut down completely and her judges banished to Afghanistan. But Nigerians are not deceived. They know the factors at work and how it appears that, in this administration, nothing must ever touch a Northerner, especially, if he/ she shares the same faith with the President. Or what in all decency should be more urgent than getting to the very root of terrorism funding in Nigeria? This is one reason insecurity is fated to be a recurring decimal during the Buhari administration.\n\nAnd this is one thing that baffles me about President Buhari. In 2014, when he was not yet the presidential candidate of the APC, I had written, while canvassing his candidacy, that Nigeria needed him more than he needed Nigeria. Looking back now I hope to God I didnt rush to judgment or how would, a foreign country, namely, the United Arab Republic ( UAE), jail 6 financiers of terrorism in Nigeria but a government headed by President Buhari would not as much as let such people have their day in court, guilty or innocent? Is it that we just do not respect the rule of in Nigeria?\n\nThe way things are going, if President Buhari would not now, even belatedly, very actively commit himself to seriously reconsidering many of the steps he has taken so far, and which have had, possibly unintended consequences such as increasing insecurity in the country and, proactively, make amends, he may have no way of escaping a very harsh judgment of history.\n\nLife after office, as we have seen from some of our past leaders who are still on terra firma, can be truly cold and dreary. This is the reason I hope that the President who , unfortunately, has not only been a collateral victim of the failings of some of his very weak predecessors, but also suffered some unfortunate events of his own like the massive drop in oil prices experienced almost as soon as he took office, and not forgetting the economy, and life shattering, global Covid -19 pandemic, would give the advice here a thought, and reverse policies, or actions, which may, unfortunately, see his name on the opposite side of History.\n\nAs he never ceases to promise, he should endeavour to end this cycle of convulsive insecurity which has turned Nigeria into a killing field, and so, not hand it over to his successor.\n\nI wish him well.",

          "text": "\u201cHow can we say we are fighting corruption under this situation? The Customs Act says you must send in your audited accounts, six months into another financial year. We must clear the outstanding unaudited accounts. What the President does with this will tell us how we are fighting corruption.\u201d (Senator Matthew Uroghide, Chairman, Senate Public Accounts Committee (SPAC) \u2013 21st February 2020, Punch newspapers.\n\nIt was the late Professor Chinua Achebe, highly and globally referred author, novelist and social critic, that opined that, simply and squarely stated, Nigeria\u2019s problem emanates from inept and rudderless leadership. This columnist while conducting his PhD research studies in Malaysia centred on followership controverted this stand and stake of Achebe with the cognitive notion that followership failure, in a democratic setting, is responsible for the country\u2019s woes. Many may not concur with this columnist in this controversial leadership-followership circus or conundrum. In Yoruba common parlance, it is said that: \u201cki a ti ibi isana kiyesi ogun\u201d (meaning: it is good to observe the way a stick of match produces fire as a patterned behaviour of a charm or amulet). In a melodrama that occurred during the Senate Public Account Committee (SPAC) reported in the Punch of 21st February 2020, there was an alleged query raised by the Office of Auditor General of the Federation regarding a discrepancy of twenty-eight billion Naira (N28b). In the original submission to the SPAC by the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation, there was non-reporting of this figure. The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) raised an eyebrow that all collections and remittances of NCS are automated. In a swift response, the Accountant General evasively stated that the seeming discrepancy was already appropriated as the 2015 ECOWAS Stabilization Fund to which there was no empirical documentation to substantiate. The whole issue was allowed to rest untidily that way! Swept under the carpet? The Senator Matthew Uroghide-led SPAC was an unfinished business worth torch lighting specifically with recurring incidences of unaudited accounts of many MDAs to the scale and span of five years and over! What a country with intent in crippling and checkmating corruption!! In corroborating Albert Einstein, it is insanity when we do the same thing over and over whilst expecting different results. The erstwhile Chairman of SPAC, Senator Matthew Uroghide, in exasperation stated: \u201cthe Customs Act says you must send in your audited accounts, six months into another financial year.\u201d As we speak, has there been any move on the part of the Federal Government to enforce compliance with this Act? What is the present National Assembly (NASS) doing to ensure compliance and dealing with errant MDAs? Is NASS doing anything tangible to review our archaic and atavistic laws that allow someone stealing billions to spend six months behind bars with payment of paltry amount while the seemingly hungry, common criminal who stole ten tubers of yam was to spend five years in prison? Was there any query from the Presidency regarding this incident to the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation? In the book titled: \u201cTipping Point\u201d written by the best-selling author, Malcom Gladwell, it was discovered that small crimes whilst not punished graduated into big crimes in New York, USA. Before leaving this matter, it is noteworthy to mention that the Accountant General in office then in 2015 is the same Ahmed Idris, the recently suspended Accountant General of the Federation indicted for disappearing from the treasury the humongous sum of eighty billion Naira (N80b). One can posit: is Malcolm Gladwell not right that small criminals if not checkmated will become big time criminals?\n\nMr. President: Let us begin somewhere\n\nThis present government of President Muhammadu Buhari has exactly one year in office. It is not too late to insert some fiscal controls into governance to apparently checkmate and cripple corruption. Firstly, there should be updated audited accounts for all MDAs. The government can set aside a space of six months for all MDAs to comply. Secondly, external auditors should be contacted and consulted to look at the books of all revenue generating MDAs. The report should not just be submitted to the government but be published for public scrutiny. Thirdly, globally acclaimed experts should be engaged to inculcate into our fiscal systems controls via exploiting modern technology that will sound alarm once there is a probable corruption within the system. Fourthly, heads of MDAs cum Accountant General of the Federation should be given less power to access funds on behalf of the government even though this may initially introduce some sort of red-tapism, but it will duly serve as a form of probity, accountability and transparency. The system should inculcate multi-layer endorsements before there is release of funds as it is done in countries like Singapore. Fifthly, payment of services rendered by the government should not be through cash but through e-format. In Singapore for instance, there is a cash card accepted in public places to pay for public goods and services. There are loading points within the city-state-nation where owners of cash cards can credit their cards.\n\nMr. President: Do we need a loan from China?\n\nIn the last one week, the news wave has been hit with heist at the high echelon of the government at the centre. It is indeed worrisome for a wobbling economy struggling to survive. Imagine this occurring in the midst of a perennial Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) strike and gargantuan funds being expended in both subsidy payment and debt-servicing. Definitely, it is not going to be a tea party for the incoming president come 29th May 2023. First to be reported was the alleged klepto-treasury manager, Accountant General of the Federation, of a humongous sum of eighty billion Naira (N80b). He has since been suspended from office while he had earlier been picked up by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC). In the same vein, before the dust settled, the former Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Nsima Ekere was on the hook of EFCC for alleged diversion of forty-seven billion Naira (N47b). This according to Channels Television was done through registered contractors belonging to the agency of government. Coming on the heels of Ekere was that of another alleged heist committed by the Director-General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr. Bashir Yusuf Jamoh. In a widely circulated online publication laced with seemingly undeniable details, NIMASA helmsman was accused of looting alleged sums of N1.5trillion and $9.5million belonging to the agency. If this is confirmed by EFCC, even as Dr. Jamoh himself reported to be a kinsman of Mr. President, has officially written to EFCC to probe it further, it will be a landmark heist \u2013 first time thieving will be in trillion! The rate of corruption thrives in high places, with puerile and pedestrian punishment meted to actors caught in the act, if care is not taken, the whole vault of the Central Bank will be emptied one day while security men just \u201ctanda for outside dey watch!\u201d About the last one year, it would be interesting and intriguing itemizing the alleged heist in the MDAs of the federal government, even at subnational level as well. These are some of the major ones:\n\nOffice of the Accountant General of the Federation (Ahmed Idris) N80 billion\n\nOffice of the MD, NDDC (Nsima Ekere) N47 billion\n\nOffice of DG, NIMASA (Bashir Jamoh) N1.5 trillion\n\nOffice of the CEO/MD, FMBN (Gimba Yau Kumo) N31 billion\n\nOffice of the MD, NPA (Hadiza Bala Usman) N165 billion\n\nOffice of the Accountant General of Rivers State (Siminaliayi Fubara) N435 billion\n\nIs the Federal Government serious in moving Nigeria forward?\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, as the father of this house called Nigeria, must not allow this house to fall even as the cracks are widening. It is both worrisome and irksome that some of the cracks are arising from the foundation. EFCC should be allowed to wield the big stick no matter whose ox is gored in the process! It is instructive for the Federal Government to pay attention to the tinkering of legal luminary, Mr. Femi Falana, SAN, faulting the suspension of the Accountant General of the Federation, Mr. Ahmed Idris by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning as illegal as only the President could suspend or sack Idris in consonance with the Constitution. According to Falana:",
          "summary": "In the original submission to the SPAC by the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation, there was non-reporting of this figure.\nIn a swift response, the Accountant General evasively stated that the seeming discrepancy was already appropriated as the 2015 ECOWAS Stabilization Fund to which there was no empirical documentation to substantiate.\nWas there any query from the Presidency regarding this incident to the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation?\nMr. President: Let us begin somewhereThis present government of President Muhammadu Buhari has exactly one year in office.\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, as the father of this house called Nigeria, must not allow this house to fall even as the cracks are widening.",

          "title": "Obasanjo and his \u2018touch of madness\u2019",
          "text": "On May 19, while receiving Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant Mohammed HayatuDeen in Abeokuta, Ogun State, ex-president Olusegun Obasanjo, as is his custom, waxed profound about Nigeria\u2019s existential struggles. Ignoring his own failings and the controversies that swirled around his politics and ethics as president, he drew a strong connection between leadership deficiencies and Nigeria\u2019s instability and crises. And responding to his visitor\u2019s opening remarks, Chief Obasanjo adumbrated four panaceas he believed were indispensable to the resolution of the country\u2019s crises.\n\nQuoting him extensively, he had said: \u201cI will say four things, of which I was reminded this morning. One is knowledge. If Nigeria is not at the table, maybe the knowledge that we should have of ourselves, of our situation, of our continent, and, indeed, of the world is not that adequate. If that knowledge is adequate, we will do what is right, when it is right and how it is right.\n\n\u201cThe second is vision. What is the vision that we have? And if you have no vision, you may have eyes, but you are blind. And I believe that is part of our situation.\n\n\u201cThe third is passion. And when you said you are involved in this with a passion, and I was telling some people this morning that passion means madness; that you are mad about Nigeria. I am and I have no apologies for that; because I have no other country I can call my own and I have no other country I can go to and say, yes, I have come to live here. Passion means being mad about Nigeria, having a touch of madness and I look at you (Hayatu-Deen) and say, yes, you are mad about Nigeria, too.\n\n\u201cFourth one is innovation. We cannot be doing the same thing that we have done in the past that did not pay us and continue to repeat it and expect any change. We have to move out of it, we have to innovate, we have to re-strategise. And you talk about security and people ask me about it and I say I know that we can put all insecurity in Nigeria behind us within a space of two years. That we have not done that or that we are still in the situation we are is a choice that has been made by our leaders, not the way God wants us to be.\u201d\n\nAs galling as his self-righteousness is, Chief Obasanjo is right. In general, his analysis of the Nigerian condition is not exaggerated, nor even misdirected. His confident assertions give the impression that should he have the chance to lead Nigeria again, he would resolve all these knotty issues in two years. He may be right that the inability to resolve these issues is the choice of Nigeria\u2019s leaders, but given his own antecedents, for example his 1999 Inauguration Day promise to resolve the power conundrum in a jiffy, his two-year deadline may be characteristically but unduly optimistic. Throughout his eight years in office, Chief Obasanjo was neither scientific in his approach to governance nor, despite his vaunted claims to being passionate about Nigeria, altruistic. Given the chance again, he would try of course, and his methods would be seen to be detribalised and nationalistic, far better than the current administration\u2019s insular approach, but nothing in his methods or \u2018madness\u2019 bears out his confidence that he would succeed where others have failed.\n\nAnd that leads to the controversial point which Chief Obasanjo asserted in his interaction with the visiting presidential contender. Mr HayatuDeen of course has no hope of clinching the ticket, not even by a long shot, but there is no doubt about his bona fides or intellect, or even of his noble intentions for Nigeria. Chief Obasanjo spoke of the ideal leader needing to possess a \u2018touch of madness\u2019 as a prerequisite for successful leadership. He didn\u2019t misspeak of course; no, he usually never does, not even when he is far off the mark. But he also never accepts blame for anything, including those things that he deliberately and unethically botched, such as the manner he raised funds to build his presidential library where he is today ensconced in sybaritic lavishness and medieval contentment.\n\nWhile adumbrating the problems Nigeria is immersed in, Chief Obasanjo spoke about the place of knowledge in finding a resolution. Here, knowledge must naturally presuppose not only scientific reasoning but also historical experience, yes, the same history he scoffed at during his first term in office. It is not clear, should this presupposition be right, that any touch of madness would be appropriate. What madness would resolve the country\u2019s power supply conundrum when other lesser endowed nations and developed economies had resolved this same problem with a touch of science, methodicalness and appropriate investments? What touch of madness is required for any nation under siege by criminals and non-state actors, when devolved law enforcement and truly national security forces properly kitted and remunerated would be more than sufficient?\n\nWhere was any touch of madness when the founding fathers of the United States crafted their timeless constitution, which like many other great constitutions, was based on the great Bill of Rights derived from the Magna Carta of 1215. Perhaps a touch of madness would be needed to foment a revolution against colonial oppression, but solving existential problems like power crisis, economic woes, insurgency, and banditry, etc. should require, not madness, but methods. How many touches of madness would be required in a country should the same problems keep recurring? Was it touch of madness that helped China leap to a first world beginning from 1978-79? The touch of madness Chief Obasanjo referred to is a hangover of military methods, a needless and foolish recourse to extralegal measures to tackle often routine but sometimes complex problems, and counterproductive measures involving the abrogation of the rule of law. Where have such serial constitutional malfeasances, to which the people have sadly become acculturated, got Nigeria?\n\nFortunately, it was not Mr HayatuDeen who spoke about a touch of madness; he spoke only of his passion for Nigeria. The madness rhetoric came from Chief Obasanjo who, as always, is convinced, that his analysis is irrefutable. Well, regardless of what touches he thinks are appropriate for Nigeria, it will barely make a dent on the fundamentals of retooling the country. For eight years, he had the opportunity to use whatever touches caught his fancy; he flunked it. His lack of vision and discipline made him a part of the problem. His misrule and undemocratic practices \u2013 his so-called touch of madness \u2013 produced the ailing Umaru Yar\u2019Adua as president; and that in turn led to the irresolute Goodluck Jonathan; which also out of popular revulsion and anger produced Muhammadu Buhari. Periodic madness got Nigeria only into a cul de sac; it is time to get a bold thinker, not a mad man, no matter how fleeting, into office.\n\nPeter Obi and others like him\n\nDespite his gleeful claims to parsimoniousness, there is nothing particularly remarkable about the style and politics of former Anambra State two-term governor and presidential aspirant, Peter Obi. His defection to the PDP after leaving office as governor was opportunistic, and was aimed at having a shot at the presidency in the years ahead. He deemed that year had come when he ran on the Abubakar Atiku ticket to contest the 2019 presidential election. This year, he had hoped to run for the presidency but seemed to have been thwarted by what he described as a gang-up against him in the PDP.\n\nMr Obi merely typifies aspirants whose ambitions will be thwarted by the illiberal atmosphere suffusing Nigerian democracy. The politicians are themselves not principled, as Mr Obi is showing, and will hop, step and jump to as many parties as their fancies and political expediencies can carry them. The public must be cautious in being carried away by the political umbrage the aspirants take. True Mr Obi will be frugal should he mount the throne, but even as Anambra governor, there was little remarkable about his government. Governance is after all not about just telling inspiring and humorous stories of frugality, especially when every other thing about the aspirant or candidate is jaded and uninspiring.",

If the organisers give my award to someone else, they will die.\u201d\n\nThe artiste was nominated in two categories at the 15th edition of The Headies which is billed to hold later this year in the United States of America.\n\nIn the petition, the organisers of the award demanded a retraction from the up-and-coming artiste. Moreso, he is to be invited to the police headquarters to give an undertaking not to engage in any unlawful act that will cause a breach of peace.\n\nFurthermore, it was demanded by the organisers of The Headies that Portable should publish a written apology to all the nominees in the two categories.\n\nThe organisers of the award further stated that if the singer does not meet their demands, they will not only disqualify him from participating in the Headies but \u201calso enforce the instrumentalities of the law to the fullest.\u201d",

          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

This licensing follows a visit to Nigeria by the company\u2019s team in May last year to discuss the possibility of obtaining a licence. Starlink which currently operates in 36 countries has over 400,000 subscribers around the world.\n\n\u201cThe company received two licenses, which include the International Gateway license and Internet Service Provider (ISP) license, and will be trading as Starlink Internet Services Nigeria Ltd. According to NCC, the International Gateway license has a 10-year tenure while the ISP license is to last for five years. Both licenses take effect from May 2022 and may be renewed after the expiration,\u201d per Nairametrics.\n\nStarlink approved by Nigeria \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec & Mozambique \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddffhttps://t.co/Q1VvqVmJ2i \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 27, 2022\n\nStarlink is a low latency broadband internet system created to meet the needs of consumers in rural areas with low internet penetration across the globe. In simpler terms, it delivers super-fast internet via satellites to rural areas. It is theoretically capable of delivering 150Mbps internet speeds to any place on the planet. All the customer needs is a clear view of the sky.\n\nStarlink enters a Nigerian Internet service provider space that is dominated by telcos like MTN and Airtel, as well as individual ISPs such as Spectranet, SMILE and others.\n\nCompared to existing similar internet plans in Nigeria which cost an average of $50, Starlink is a more expensive option costing $599 (~\u20a6330,000) for a full kit, including a terminal, mounting tripod, and Wi-Fi router, then a $110 (~\u20a660,500) for preorder and monthly subscription. Its premium service costs about $2,500 (~\u20a61.375 million) for the full kit and $500 (~\u20a6275,000) monthly.\n\nThis price range is deemed expensive for the average Nigerian, except it introduces a different offering for the Nigerian Market.\n\nShare this article",

It\u2019s also the ideal time to bill that tech bro or sis.\n\nThis type of weekend only occurs once a month. If you miss it this month, you\u2019ll have to wait until the next. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to wait. Just kidding. No, I\u2019m not .\n\nBy the way, today is Children\u2019s Day in Nigeria. It\u2019s an excellent opportunity to fulfil that promise to take them out or buy that ice cream. \ud83d\ude09 I mean, make a child happy today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis weekend, I\u2019m also following my advice and billing you. Just kidding. I still don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do this weekend, but I know it will be fun.\n\nEnjoy your weekend however you can. You know I\u2019m always concerned with your overall health and wellbeing. Take care of yourself during this short break!!!\n\nSo today, I\u2019m going to talk about two stories:\n\nJumia\u2019s partnership with CGAP\n\nProducts for people with disabilities\n\nJumia\u2019s partnership with CGAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt goes without saying that Jumia is one of the dominant players in the African eCommerce market. In Nigeria, the company made $33 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2021, with a $14.6 million increase in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nAlso, the Central Bank of Nigeria recently granted it a Payment Service Solution Provider (PSSP) licence.\n\nThe licence will enable it to process payments for Nigerian third-party businesses. This development pits it directly against Paystack, Flutterwave, eTranzact, and Remita.\n\nIt also provides an additional revenue stream when the company desperately needs to increase revenue.\n\nInterestingly, the company is testing a healthtech play through a partnership with the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis collaboration will provide users with access to doctors for a $1 monthly subscription fee.\n\nWell, Chimgozirim thinks it\u2019s a fantastic move that will allow Jumia to leverage its existing customer base and infrastructure.\n\nI do not think we have enough doctors in this country, though. I mean, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends one doctor for every 600 people in a country.\n\nHowever, in a country with one doctor for every 5,000 people, the WHO\u2019s recommendation appears a long way off.\n\nFurther, the Nigerian Medical Association reports that only 35,000 of the 72,000 registered doctors are practising in Nigeria.\n\nIn his article, Chimgozirim discusses what the collaboration could mean for healthtech startups. You can find it here: Dear healthtech startups, Jumia is coming for your bread!\n\nKenya\u2019s digital products for people with disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a report, approximately 40% of Africa\u2019s population is disabled, including 10-15% of school-age children. This implies that there are over 300 million people with disabilities in Africa.\n\nEven though people with disabilities are often referred to as the world\u2019s largest minority, in Africa, they face exclusion, discrimination, and barriers to exercising their fundamental rights and participating in development.\n\nHowever, Kenya, an African country, is changing the narrative.\n\nHow? Kenya has developed a standard for digital accessibility for people with disabilities.\n\nThis means that people with disabilities, and older people who are largely disconnected from most e-government services and business-owned digital platforms, will be connected, supported, and empowered by digital products to increase their digital inclusion.\n\nHow? It will be accomplished by providing computer assistive technology to the blind and visually impaired. Also, public and private sector digital products and services (like websites and mobile applications) will be more accessible and usable by all Kenyan citizens.\n\nThis follows the announcement by the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) of a partnership with inABLE to develop a national information and communication technology (ICT) accessibility standard.\n\nThis is similar to EnableMe Kenya, an online platform, aimed at providing community-oriented technological support and increasing digital inclusion for people with disabilities.\n\nAccording to Bernard Njiraini, KEBS Managing Director, \u201cTo accommodate all people in the society, inclusive design and universal design principles should be integrated into digital products and services.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe African Leadership Group and Udacity are offering 5,000 scholarships to African citizens who want to advance their careers in tech. by learning new digital skills. Scholarship recipients will enrol in one of the following Udacity Nanodegree programmes: Data Analyst, Full-Stack Web Developer, or Cloud Developer. Apply here.\n\nGrant Master has announced the start of its second Creative Writers Fellowship cohort. The Fellowship for Creative Writers will take place virtually from July 4th to August 26th, 2022. Apply here.\n\nMOBI Automation, a startup that uses Web3 technologies to solve business problems, is looking for a Chief Technology Officer, UI & UX Designer, Senior Frontend Developer, and Creative Designer. Send your resume here.\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious? Apply for the Coinbase Community Ambassador Program (CAP) \u2014 Summer 2022 here.\n\nHave an amazing weekend!\n\nVictoria Fakiya for Techpoint Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria Fakiya A writer with ADHD who is interested in mental health and how technology is improving the lives of Africans with mental disorders.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, May 17, 2022, Nigerian eCommerce giant, Jumia released its financial report for the first quarter of 2022.\n\nCo-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec shared that orders, revenue, and gross merchandise value (GMV) saw significant growth compared to the last nine quarters. Comparing Q1 2021 with Q1 2022, orders grew from 6.6 million to 9.3 million, GMV grew from $198.9 million to $252.7 million, while revenue went from $33 million to $47.6 million.\n\nEven with this growth, it\u2019s not all rosy for the company as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss was $53 million. On a call with TechCrunch, Poignonnec shared that the company plans to keep EBITDA loss below the $70 million it recorded in Q1 2021.\n\nNow to some good and potentially exciting developments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJumiaPay, its fintech product, has secured a payment service solution provider (PSSP) licence, which will allow it to process payments for third-party businesses in Nigeria. This development puts it in direct competition with Paystack, Flutterwave, eTranzact, and Remita. It also provides another revenue stream when it desperately needs to increase revenues.\n\nPSSPs usually make their money by charging a transaction fee for every transaction they facilitate, and these fees often vary depending on the transaction\u2019s value. Per the report, 34% of orders placed on Jumia were completed using JumiaPay, and with its licence, JumiaPay\u2019s numbers could significantly increase in the coming quarters.\n\nHealthcare at the drop of a hat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: AMISOM via Iwaria\n\nPerhaps the most interesting thing about the developments shared in the report is Jumia\u2019s decision to venture into the healthcare space. Via a partnership with Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, the company is testing a service that will allow users to access doctors with a monthly subscription of $1.\n\nViewed in isolation, this is a great move that could see Jumia tap into its existing customer base and infrastructure. It also represents a more formidable competitor for existing healthcare startups.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 1 doctor per 600 people in a country, but Nigeria has 1 doctor for 5,000 people. Furthermore, the Nigerian Medical Association reports that only 35,000 of the 72,000 registered doctors are practising in Nigeria, while the healthtech industry in Africa is projected to be worth $259 billion by 2030.\n\nAlthough little detail was provided about the move, its foray into an area that is notoriously difficult in Africa and is not remotely related to its core business warrants some questions.\n\nExisting telehealth startups in the country include CribMD, iWello, and WellaHealth. As private companies, their records are often not in the public domain, but in a 2021 interview with Techpoint Africa, iWello reported that it had 140 clients, with CribMD reportedly serving 2,800 patients as of 2021. WellaHealth\u2019s CEO also shared that the company hit 10,000 unique users in 2017, with thousands on its waitlist.\n\nThese companies are significantly less funded than Jumia, with Africa\u2019s healthcare sector raising $392 million in 2021. However, these companies have to combat low Internet penetration, dwindling household incomes, and cultural norms to get paying customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, Jumia has no expertise operating in the healthcare sector and would likely have to go through a learning curve for this venture to succeed. Even with the option of hiring experienced professionals, things will probably not go their way immediately.\n\nThe fragmented nature of the healthcare space is another challenge that existing players face. For example, there are only a handful of hospitals with digitised records and even fewer still that share this information. This makes it imperative that healthtech startups build solutions for this purpose.\n\nBuilding partnerships for effective healthcare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile these could pose challenges to Jumia\u2019s healthtech plans, Yomi Kazeem, Senior Consultant, Salient Advisory, believes that Jumia has what it takes to succeed, especially if it goes the partnership route.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he said, \u201cJumia can potentially build out its healthtech play through more partnerships to facilitate diagnostics. It can also partner with pharmacies, leverage its logistics network, and pair medication delivery with its telemedicine service, so patients are not only speaking to doctors remotely but also receiving needed medication seamlessly.\n\n\u201cThis approach is important because, ultimately, providing access to consultations is only one part of healthcare. With more of these companies emerging, user acquisition becomes more competitive. In essence, third-party partnerships that facilitate access to patients on a larger scale are vital.\u201d\n\nUnlike existing healthtech players, Jumia has an established logistics service that could help it deliver medications faster than startups that have to depend on third-party providers. While this means Jumia could potentially cut into their market, it also presents an opportunity to expand healthtech services in the country while unlocking one more revenue stream for Jumia.\n\nHealthtech startups, for example, can provide faster and more efficient services by partnering with Jumia. Such partnerships could also expose them to Jumia\u2019s considerably larger customer base.\n\nAn example of such a partnership is Airtel Kenya\u2019s partnership with MyDawa, an online pharmacy in Kenya that allows Airtel\u2019s customers log into the MyDawa website without incurring data costs while MyDawa provides an option to pay for products with Airtel Money.\n\nDespite being boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, healthtech startups are still a long way from meeting Africa\u2019s healthcare needs. However, partnerships such as this could be key going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

The CAR adopted bitcoin as a reference currency.\n\nAlso, a Nigerian, Chidi Nwaubani, launched the \u201cLooty\u201d project to reclaim African artefacts stolen by European colonists.\n\nThe project will create 3D images of these artefacts, sell them as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and use the proceeds to support young African artists.\n\nPlease listen to the podcast to hear these gists in particular. Bolu spoke last, so you\u2019ll have to listen till the end.\n\nYou can find today\u2019s episode here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nHow Traction wants to stop fake alerts\n\nCanza Finance\u2019s journey\n\nEsaal\u2019s $1.7m seed\n\nJABU\u2019s $15m series A\n\nTraction wants to stop fake alerts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraction Founders: Dolapo Adejuyigbe and Mayowa Alli (L-R)\n\nOn Monday, I had to use a PoS kiosk because I had problems with one of my banks. Currently, I have two active accounts, but only one has an ATM card.\n\nThat was intentional. I had no idea the other ATM card would come in handy. I have, however, learnt my lesson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, at the kiosk where I was supposed to transfer money to get cash, I asked if they accept mobile transfers, and the attendant took a long look at me before responding reluctantly in the affirmative.\n\nWith her response, I knew they don\u2019t accept mobile transfers. But, because I am someone she knows, she reluctantly agreed.\n\nOf course, the attendant isn\u2019t the only one who has reservations about accepting mobile transfers. In fact, there are small business owners in my neighbourhood who refuse to accept mobile transfers.\n\nSo, before I went there, I mumbled some incantations because I had no money. \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude39 I\u2019m kidding. But that money was urgently needed, though.\n\nAlthough the transfer was successful, she did not give me my money until she saw and confirmed the alert. I was slightly vexed, but I understood why.\n\nReceiving fake alerts isn\u2019t new for merchants in my neighbourhood, so they\u2019d rather you give them cash for every item you buy over making a mobile transfer.\n\nI waited about 15 minutes before she gave me my money. Fear of fake alerts cost me 15 minutes of my time! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude22 I\u2019m not crying, but I believe this is a problem.\n\nI\u2019m sure you know someone or have heard of someone who has been a victim of receiving fake alerts. Consider a merchant receiving fake alerts for every item they sell or service they render. That\u2019s cruel, in my opinion.\n\nHowever, there appears to be a solution. What is it? Traction! The Nigeria-based fintech startup believes its proprietary solution can solve this problem.\n\nHow? It has a unique feature that allows merchants to confirm that every alert is real. Isn\u2019t this interesting?\n\nBusiness owners can use the app to accept payments, generate invoices, manage inventory, and track payments. It also enables merchant employees to confirm payments without calling their boss. Aren\u2019t you curious now?\n\nIf you are, please read Ogheneruemu\u2019s story to learn more about the startup: Traction is building an ecosystem for Nigerian small businesses, starting with stopping fake credit alerts\n\nCanza Finance\u2019s journey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R, Pascal Ntsama, Canza Finance CEO and Co-Founder and Oyedeji Oluwole, Canza Finance CTO and Co-Founder.\n\nWith the volatility of cryptocurrency, I won\u2019t even look at you twice if you ask me to buy, not to think of launching a crypto business with you.\n\nIt\u2019s simply too risky, if you ask me. It\u2019s high today, low tomorrow; please don\u2019t give me a heart attack. \ud83d\ude0f\n\nThis reminds me of something that happened last Monday. Please accept my apologies if you are a crypto trader or investor. But, I couldn\u2019t stop laughing when the guy next to me on the bus was glued to his screen, checking his crypto app. \ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude02\n\nSincerely, this guy didn\u2019t even close the app for a second. He was just staring. His expression was sad. That could be due to the drop in cryptocurrency that week.\n\nToday\u2019s story, on the other hand, features two Co-founders, Pascal Ntsama and Oyedeji Oluwoye, who began working together after Oluwoye advised Ntsama to buy cryptocurrency. That was bold, if you ask me.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t convinced initially, but after seeing Oluwoye\u2019s success with cryptocurrency two years later, he agreed.\n\nThat\u2019s when the pair realised there was more to cryptocurrency than just trading. They established Coincentrix in 2017 and received a grant from the Zcash Foundation in 2018.\n\nThen, in 2019, they launched Canza Finance, a crypto neobank that connects African businesses to the global economy.\n\nIn other words, the startup makes cryptocurrency transactions easier. It also allows for payments and peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions within the country. Besides, it intends to include treasury management in its suite of services.\n\nChimgozirin described the startup\u2019s journey in detail here: Canza Finance is a neobank enabling decentralised cross-border payments for Africans\n\nEsaal\u2019s $1.7 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to mental health, there is a common misconception that only people suffering from mental disorders see therapists. This is because some of us mistake mental health for a mental illness, which it is not.\n\nMental health is more than just the absence of a mental disorder. It includes how you think, feel, and act.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re having trouble thinking clearly, stressed, or feeling depressed, it can affect your productivity at school, work, or at home, indicating poor mental health.\n\nConsequently, it would help if you spoke with a trusted person who can keep your information confidential while also providing a safe space to express your emotions and possibly offer advice. You can also talk with someone who is trained in counselling or psychiatry.\n\nMoreover, due to the stigma surrounding mental health, most people are afraid of physically going to a centre to see a therapist or psychiatrist\n\nIn Egypt, Fadi Doss, Founder and CEO of Esaal, launched a platform that connects users to experts, allowing them to receive personalised and genuine answers to health concerns straightforwardly and smoothly.\n\nAnd yesterday, Esaal \u2014 an online health and wellness consultation platform \u2014 announced a $1.7 million seed round, led by Egypt-based A15.\n\nEsaal claims that it has over 350 consultants. Also, the company offers consultations on a wide range of topics, like anxiety, physiotherapy, paediatrics, and nutrition.\n\nUsers use an app to access these services via texting, video/voice calls, and in-person visits. They can pay with cash, credit cards, Vodafone, and Fawry.\n\nPer the CEO, the services are available in seven other countries across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries: Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Palestine, and Iraq.\n\nThe funding will be used to expand across MENA, invest in product and brand development, and hire more people. Between 2021 and 2025, Esaal anticipates a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50-60%.\n\nJABU\u2019s $15m series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamibian B2B eCommerce retail platform, JABU, announced a $15 million Series A round yesterday, Wednesday,May 25, 2022.\n\nThe round was led by Tiger Global and saw participation from Box Group, Knollwood, D Global Ventures, Afore Capital, Oldslip and FJ Labs.\n\nFounded in 2020 by David Akinin (CEO), JABU claims to be the solution to Namibia\u2019s inefficient and nearly non-existent supply chain and distribution.\n\nThe company has a fleet of vehicles and eight distribution centres, with a platform connecting over 6,000 retailers to local and multinational suppliers like Namibia Breweries Limited, ABInBev, Bokomo, Coca-Cola, and Namibmills.\n\nWhat\u2019s new? Akinin stated that JABU intends to build around its Jwallet, a wallet system that is currently available as a standalone product. It enables Southern African merchants to use their physical flows to provide cash withdrawal and deposit services to their customers.\n\nIs this similar? Yes. It\u2019s identical to agency banking, a branchless banking system in Nigeria and West Africa where human agents serve as ATMs to provide financial services in outlying areas. And in Morocco, Chari provides a similar service.\n\nJABU will use the Series A funding to expand its presence in Southern Africa and enter new markets like Botswana and Eswatini later this year.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe African Leadership Group and Udacity are offering 5,000 scholarships to African citizens who want to advance their careers in tech. by learning new digital skills. Scholarship recipients will enrol in one of the following Udacity Nanodegree programmes: Data Analyst, Full-Stack Web Developer, or Cloud Developer. Apply here.\n\nGrant Master has announced the start of its second Creative Writers Fellowship cohort. The Fellowship for Creative Writers will take place virtually from July 4th to August 26th, 2022. Apply here.\n\nMOBI Automation, a startup that uses Web3 technologies to solve business problems, is looking for a Chief Technology Officer, UI & UX Designer, Senior Frontend Developer, and Creative Designer.

Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby Abdullahi Fawale\n\nShort answer? Apply to AltSchool Africa.\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect avenue. Within 12 months, you would have learnt a highly sought-after tech skill and obtained a top-rated diploma. The knowledge and experience gathered during the program adequately prepare you for your first tech job.\n\nReady to begin that journey? Get started HERE.\n\nYou\u2019re reading this for one of two reasons:\n\n1. You\u2019ve made the decision to switch careers and you have your eyes set on the tech space. You\u2019re now on the lookout for key pointers on how to start.\n\n2. You\u2019re yet to decide on transitioning though you\u2019ve been giving it a lot of thought. You however seek more information in the hope that you get all the clarity and green light you need.\n\nA third possibility could be that you know someone who is at that phase of their life\u2014yearning for a career change and real opportunities for growth. This piece answers some of your questions about pursuing a career in tech and how to transition.\n\nBefore we dive in, what is your \u201cWhy\u201d?\n\nThe tech space undoubtedly holds a myriad of opportunities for skilled talent worldwide. Global ecosystems continue to witness exponential growth. In Africa, solution-driven startups keep springing up & raising rounds to help drive growth and expansion.\n\nTech news platforms are often inundated with announcements of funds raised by startups which sometimes run into several millions of dollars. More jobs are getting created. Top tech talents are being enticed with juicy compensation packages and then poached. Junior employees are now taking up more responsibility and securing promotions. It\u2019s Career Christmas!\n\nHowever, it\u2019s quite easy to get distracted by this zeitgeist. Away from the exciting announcements and fascinating Twitter conversations, the growth and successes of these tech ecosystems are powered by the blood and sweat of deeply passionate and hardworking people who put in their absolute best to make things work.\n\nIn other words, working in tech is not a walk in the park. Your \u201cwhy\u201d mustn\u2019t be influenced by the current ecosystem zeitgeist, but by a genuine readiness to learn, contribute and grow.\n\nYou also must define what you want to do going forward. Are you looking for core tech/code roles (e.g Software Engineering) or no-code roles like Product Design, Product Management, Product Marketing, Technical Writing, Customer Success, Recruitment etc,?\n\nHave you looked into what it takes to be successful in this new path and are you ready to give what it takes?\n\nAnswer these questions as truthfully as you can. Don\u2019t worry if you fear your answers aren\u2019t convincing enough at the moment. You can always look up more information on these roles to guide your final decision.\n\nWith that said, here are 5 Proven Tips to Help You Transition Into Tech:\n\n1. What transferable skills do you have?\n\nA sizeable number of people that transition to tech do so by leveraging their previously acquired skills\u2014though these skills are mostly no-code or non-technical. For instance, a Customer Service Representative at a local bank could easily transition to a similar role at a FinTech startup. A journalist or creative writer could try out technical writing and pick up really fast. Human Resource Managers/Recruiters in conventional companies would easily settle in as technical recruiters after a few months of training. The list goes on.\n\nWhat you should do is identify the skills you already possess and see what roles those could get you in tech. If you have your eyes set on an entirely different role (one that doesn\u2019t align with your current skills), check out the skills required for that role and how to go about acquiring them. Then go for it.\n\n2. Search for opportunities in industries where you have prior experience\n\nThis is in many ways similar to what we discussed above\u2014about seeking opportunities in tech where your previously acquired skills are a match. Say you\u2019re a Risk & Compliance Officer at a local bank; you can work the same job at a FinTech startup. A seasoned chartered accountant can head the Accounts & Finance unit at a tech startup. Medical doctors could, for instance, work as consultants at HealthTech startups offering home services. Product Managers can easily function across numerous industries. Conventional journalists and content creators could niche down and focus on reporting/producing content on tech and so on.\n\n3. Take courses & write a certification exam\n\nOne of the sure-fire ways to transition to tech is to learn the skill(s) required to function in specific areas of interest. A great way to achieve this is by taking online courses, registering for and joining boot camps and writing certification exams. Thanks to the internet, there now seems to be unlimited access to information allowing us to learn on our own.\n\nThe democratization of the internet has also brought about a rise in the number of digital platforms that help people acquire knowledge and learn new skills. Within a few months, you can go from being a complete outsider to becoming an entry-level professional, anywhere in the world.\n\nThis is where AltSchool Africa comes in. At AltSchool Africa, you can learn some of the world\u2019s most sought after tech skills and earn a top-rated diploma within 12 months. The school runs a number of coding and no-code learning programs that are stand-alone specialisations under its School of Engineering and School of Product respectively.\n\nFor instance, when you apply to the School of Engineering, you will have to select a specific area of specialisation among the following:\n\nFrontend Engineering Backend Engineering & Cloud Engineering\n\nHowever, for the no-code School of Product, you can choose to learn either Product Design, Product Management or Product Marketing.\n\nIs it possible to land a job in tech by just taking courses without certification? Yes. However, earning a certification badge from an institute of repute certainly opens more doors and gets you in much bigger rooms.\n\n4. Be on the lookout for Internships\n\nMany careers that began as internships have blossomed into highly successful vocations. Some of the most revered, most admired professionals today, started out as interns and managed to build their careers into the success we currently know them to be.\n\nInternships offer great learning opportunities and direct pathways to getting your first job in tech. Not only do you get the opportunity to learn directly from much more experienced professionals\u2013you could also be on your way to getting your first offer of employment. This, of course, is dependent on how well you perform during the period.\n\n5. Network. Network. Network\n\nThe opportunities you seek aren\u2019t coming to pay you a visit in the comfort of your home. You have to get out there and grab them. Your social capital will, to a large extent, influence your career trajectory.\n\nWho do you know? Who do they know? What do they know? What do they do?\n\nUnderstanding the power of networking and actively making time to build connections will help you grow personally and professionally. So, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll do:\n\nIf your LinkedIn has been inactive, it\u2019s time to power it up: That is a good place to start. Find people doing great work in your preferred field and connect with them. Genuinely engage them in conversations and keep an open mind during these discussions.\n\nYou could also look up startup founders and hiring managers in companies you have an interest in: Try to connect with them and send a properly worded message. Briefly introduce yourself and why you\u2019re reaching out. Remember to be courteous.\n\nAttend tech events: These events are the perfect place to network as attendance is primarily physical. You can walk up to stakeholders, politely introduce yourself and tell your story. If you\u2019ve completed all the necessary training and are now in search of a job, that would be a perfect place to pitch to startup founders and execs too.\n\nYou should also consider volunteering: A good number of startups are in the business of building communities and organizing events. Due to the workload which sometimes could get overwhelming, these startups seek to onboard volunteers to help out on a project temporarily. In some cases, volunteers are paid a stipend for the work they do. In reverse scenarios, they aren\u2019t. However, monetary benefits shouldn\u2019t be your primary concern here. Your focus must be on learning as much as you can, gaining insights into the workings of the space, identifying key players and expanding your social circle.\n\nVolunteering, when done right, puts your name on the lips of persons that have the capacity to get you your next job.\n\nJoin Tech Communities: As the ecosystem grows, stakeholders are beginning to appreciate the power of community; the need to bring key players and intelligent outsiders together to look inwards and map out strategies for continued growth.\n\nOne of the strategies designed to ensure said growth is the creation of smaller groups or communities dedicated to knowledge sharing, resource sharing, mentorship and access to opportunities. The primary targets of these communities are entry-level & intermediate professionals who are then guided by more experienced tech talent. Members of these communities often have a shared sense of responsibility to help each other grow.\n\nThere are communities for everyone. So, whether you\u2019re a Software Engineer, Data Analyst, Product Manager or Technical Writer, there is a place for you.\n\nOn a final note:\n\nIt is very much possible to transition into tech within one year. As a matter of fact, some have managed to make the switch in just a few months. Bear in mind that if you must transition and do it fast, you will have to simultaneously employ more than one of the methods mentioned above. For example, you could have direct, transferable skills but you may have to network and volunteer to access even bigger and better opportunities.\n\nThese methods also aren\u2019t set in stone. You could come up with other creative, honest ways to move several steps further and get to work.\n\nIn the meantime, let\u2019s circle back to where we began:\n\nA quick guide on How to Transition into Tech in 1 Year?\n\nApply to AltSchool Africa\n\nApplications to the School of Product are currently open.\n\nReady to begin that journey?

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari Saturday in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, kicked against desire of some leaders to remain in power, after completion of their constitutional terms in office, describing it as precursor to violence, loss of lives and displacements across the continent.\n\nThe President who was speaking at the 16th Extraordinary Session of Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union, holding at Sipopo International Conference Centre, also called on African leaders to work towards stronger position by the African Union (AU).\n\nPresident Buhari also noted that attempts at tenure elongation by some leaders reverses the gains of democracy and good governance in Africa, and serves as recipe for volatility and violence.\n\nPresident Buhari advised leaders to consider strengthening democratic structures and cultures by adhering to the constitution.\n\nRead also: Buhari, African leaders meet on security in Malabo\n\n\u201cMr. Chairperson, let me start by thanking the Chairperson of the Commission for the comprehensive report we have received on Unconstitutional Changes of Government in Africa.\n\nWe are equally grateful to H.E. Julius Maada Bio, President of the Republic of Sierra Leone for his lead intervention on this pressing continental issue, especially for those of us in West Africa, where the spate of Unconstitutional Change of Government have been increasingly alarming.\n\n\u201cYour Excellencies, as you are aware, in the past couple of months, we have witnessed a spate of unconstitutional changes and a return of military incursion in the continent. This situation is totally unacceptable. It is an attempt to draw the continent backward and derail the great mileage we had gained over the years in our quest for sustainable democracy.\n\n\u201cIn the West African region, the ECOWAS Heads of State and Government have not shied away from taking appropriate steps and measures to curtail this unpleasant trend. I dare say that we have demonstrated great political will, in out-rightly condemning military incursions and unconstitutional Change of Government wherever it occurred,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President said far-reaching sanctions were imposed on ECOWAS countries that had unconstitutional change of government, when it became necessary, adding, \u201cIt is therefore imperative to call on the African Union Heads of State and Government to express the same level of Political Will to ensure that this unfortunate trend especially in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso is curbed.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cWe must work collectively to ensure that constitutional democracy is restored to these countries as quickly as possible. There should be no room for unconstitutional change of governments in the continent.\n\n\u201cI reiterate that the resurgence of coup d\u2019etats in our continent calls for deep introspection on our parts as leaders. It requires our better appreciation of the root causes of military incursion into our politics.\n\n\u201cAs African leaders we have a duty to provide good governance to our citizens, address cases of extreme poverty and engender peaceful, free and fair elections in our countries. We must shun all calls for tenure elongation beyond the provisions of our respective constitutions,\u2019\u2019 the President told the African leaders.\n\nAccording to President Buhari, calls for tenure elongation, undoubtedly, only contribute to heating up the political climate and serves as catalyst for crises and political instability.\n\n\u201cMr. Chairperson, in concluding my remarks, I would like to make a clarion call for a coordinated continental response that condemns all forms of unconstitutional Change of Government in Africa. Let us rise to the occasion and reject such changes as well as support imposition of far reaching sanctions regime from all African Union Member States, whenever and wherever military incursions rear their ugly heads.\n\n\u201cWe should also get the International community to buy into and cooperate fully with the African Union in imposing coordinated measures on those countries violating constitutional order.\u2019\u2019",
          "summary": "President Buhari also noted that attempts at tenure elongation by some leaders reverses the gains of democracy and good governance in Africa, and serves as recipe for volatility and violence.\nPresident Buhari advised leaders to consider strengthening democratic structures and cultures by adhering to the constitution.\nRead also: Buhari, African leaders meet on security in Malabo\u201cMr.\nWe must shun all calls for tenure elongation beyond the provisions of our respective constitutions,\u2019\u2019 the President told the African leaders.\nAccording to President Buhari, calls for tenure elongation, undoubtedly, only contribute to heating up the political climate and serves as catalyst for crises and political instability.",

In line with this, Enageed developed this initiative with the objective to improve the capacity of local community contractors and ensure their businesses continue to grow,\u201d Menkiti said\n\nSpeaking on the local capacity development initiative, the company Head of Supply Chain Management, Mr. Frank Emerua, said Enageed has put in extra efforts to properly engage with the community to facilitate their social license to ensure the safety of people and facilities, improve production and promote the sustainable development of all host communities thereby fostering economic growth.\n\nHe also stated that Enageed developed this initiative with the objective to improve the capacity of local community contractors and ensure their businesses continue to grow.\n\nEmerua explained that the theme \u201cConnecting our Communities to Endless Opportunities\u201d assumes significance, as Enageed believes that building human and social capital is a never-ending act and is integral to strategic community investments.\n\n\u201cEnageed is aware millions of people around the country still live in abject poverty without access to basic amenities, employment, health care, and education, Enageed is deliberate about the development of our communities. Enageed has gathered a rich combination of speakers who would be providing key lessons on fundamental 21st-century skills. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is critical in all sectors of the world\u2019s economy and is changing the way we live, work and do business.\n\n\u201cTo ensure community contractors have the right skills for an increasingly digital and globalized world, the ICT session which is a key component of this training would bridge that gap.\n\n\u201cAnother key component of the training is financial literacy which matters across many levels of our world economy. As such, there has been an increasing recognition of the importance of financial literacy and inclusion. This session would ensure our contractors are more knowledgeable about finance in a way that is relevant to their business.\u201d\n\nHe further noted that the company\u2019s commitment to promoting healthy environment, has also led to the medical check-up which is being conducted for members of the community as safety and health is at the heart of its operation.\n\n\u201cEnageed is hopeful that this session will enlighten the community on how to stay healthy and will provide relief for people requiring eyeglasses and other basic health needs like hypertension, blood sugar and other health issues.\n\n\u201cWe stand ready to ensure continuous development in the communities we operate in, and believe the skills learned and knowledge gained will better equip community contractors to improve the efficiency of their operations and grow their businesses. We therefore look forward to the future outcome of this training that will foster innovation and better economic development in the Ajoki Community,\u201d he declared.\n\nIn his goodwill message, the Secretary General of Ajoki Community, Scott Omesan, thanked Sahara Group for coming up with the initiative to foster better relationship between it and the host Community.\n\nOmesan promised that as a Community, \u201cwe shall do everything possible to protect the company\u2019s facilities in our domain.\u201d\n\nHe also added: \u201cWe also expect cooperation with the company for it to follow local content policy and best practices. There are some job the community can do. We are not going to struggle for jobs we cannot do.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s programme has given us the opportunity to learn more about ICT. Also, the medical outreach has afforded a lot of our people the opportunity to know their health statuses in the area of eye problem and others. Even the contractors among us, the programme will afford them the opportunity to know more as growing contractors and not to depend on the bigger contractors. So having such thing in Ajoki Community, I think the relationship between us and the company will continue to be cordial.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

I look forward to squaring up with him as a worthy opponent in the coming election. I have known the former Vice President as a formidable politician and a patriot who believes in the unity and progress of our dear country.\n\n\u201cAs we move further into the election season, I charge the PDP presidential candidate and all political actors across Party lines that we should make this election season one that is devoid of bitterness, rancour and strife.\n\n\u201cWe should make our campaigns peaceful and issue based. Election season should be a festival of ideas that will uplift our country and improve the living condition of all our people.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately for the PDP, its candidate will be burdened to explain why Nigerians should give it another opportunity, after squandering 16 years at the central government, without much to show.\n\n\u201cNigerians are yet to forget the national ruin and mismanagement of our country for 16 years by successive PDP administration and this bad memory will dog the campaign of the PDP Candidate\n\n\u201cNevertheless, I once again congratulate our former Vice President for his victory in his party\u2019s primary.\u201d",

Mr Tambuwal asked delegates to vote for the former vice president, putting him ahead of his major rival Nyesom Wike.\n\nMr. Abubakar formally stated his intention in running for President of Nigeria in 2023 in March. Security, the economy, education, and devolving greater resources and authorities to the federating units were all major themes in his campaign.\n\nIf elected president in the 2023 general elections, Mr Abubakar pledged the people that his administration would combat the theft of public funds. The presidential candidate promised to give the educational sector the attention it deserves.\n\nHis victory followed the comments of Doyin Okupe, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, who revealed that the presidential primary election will be a money market as presidential aspirants, like Messrs Abubakar and Wike, would persuade delegates with money. How much role cash distribution played throughout the exercise was unclear.\n\nMe Abubakar\u2019s desire to be president dates as far back as 2019 when he won the ticket of the PDP but was beaten at the polls by incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe former vice president had tried five times unsuccessfully to become Nigeria\u2019s president, starting in 1992 when he ran under the Social Democratic Party.

          "text": "BY ONU OKORIE\n\nLagos: May 26, 2022: To encourage and simplify vehicle ownership for personal use by millions of Nigerians, First City Monument Bank (FCMB) now offers auto loans of up to N30 million at a reduced interest rate. The FCMB auto loan supports acquiring brand new and pre-owned vehicles (popularly known as \u201cTokunbo\u201d), with N500,000 as the minimum loan amount that a customer can access for a repayment duration of up to 5 years.\n\nThis affirms FCMB\u2019s commitment to improving the social well-being of individuals and enhancing access to credit for higher standard of living for families.\n\nCommenting on the unique value proposition, Divisional Head, Personal Banking of the Bank, Mr Shamsideen Fashola, said, \u201cvehicle ownership is one of the most exciting moments in a person\u2019s life. Yet, many people struggle to save up for a long time to make this dream come true. To bridge this gap, we created a value proposition that is flexible, convenient and empowers individuals, families and businesses to achieve the dream of vehicle ownership. Nigerians can now finance their dream vehicle with an auto loan from FCMB at a low-interest rate with monthly or yearly payment options depending on their income. We, therefore, urge the populace, including, but not limited to salaried individuals, to take advantage of this opportunity to fulfil their vehicle ownership dream\u201d.\n\nFCMB Auto Loan empowers qualified Nigerians to part-finance the purchase of brand-new and pre-owned vehicles while spreading the repayment between one and five years. The loan, which is dependent on the type of vehicle to be purchased, is open to salaried individuals and self-employed Nigerians.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the number of registered vehicles in Nigeria is 13 million. However, vehicle ownership in the country has been declining because of increased prices. This is due to foreign exchange and importation challenges, leading to a drastic reduction in purchasing power and sales decline in the auto industry.\n\nA purpose beyond profit commercial banking institution, First City Monument Bank is a member of FCMB Group Plc, led by Ladi Balogun as Group Chief Executive. The Bank is committed to COVID-19 recovery, income equality and poverty reduction by easing credit constraints to disadvantaged individuals and small businesses. The intervention of FCMB in the automobile sector aligns with Goals 3 and 10 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which focus on well-being and reduced inequalities.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar has been elected as the Peoples Democratic Party\u2019s flagbearer for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nIt will be the 75-year-old\u2019s sixth attempt for the nation\u2019s top job.\n\nHe was also the PDP\u2019s candidate in the last election in 2019, which he lost to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nTo win the PDP\u2019s 2023 ticket, Atiku had to beat the likes of Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike, Akwa Ibom Governor, Udom Emmanuel and former Senate President, Bukola Saraki.\n\nBefore voting commenced on Friday at the primary election in Abuja, Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal stepped down for Atiku, a move that strengthened the Adamawa politician\u2019s bid for the ticket.\n\nMr Atiku scored 371 votes. His closest challenger, Wike, polled 237 votes. Saraki pulled 70 votes.\n\nEmmanuel (38), Mohammed (38), Anyim Pius Anyim (14), Mrs Tari Diana Oliver (1) and Sam Ohuabunwa (1) shared the remainder of the valid votes.\n\n\u2018Sense of Belonging\u2019\n\nIn his victory speech, Atiku commended the electoral process employed in the primary.\n\n\u201cToday we are making another history,\u201d he said. \u201cA history which we believe will bring about fundamental changes and also in our political processes.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that his campaign will be built on five fundamentals, including a pledge to unify the country.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\u201cI pledge to unify this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I refer to myself as a unifier.\n\n\u201cThe reason why I feel that unity is important is because APC has disunited Nigerians completely.\n\n\u201cI will work to restore unity and bring a sense of belonging to all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nMr Atiku vowed to decisively deal with the country\u2019s security challenges and confront its economic problems.\n\n\u201cThe PDP made Nigeria one of the most prosperous countries in Africa,\u201d he said. \u201cWe implemented economic reforms. The APC wiped out all those gains.\u201d\n\nHe also called on his fellow contestants to work and cooperate with him.\n\nEarly signs\n\nThere were speculations that the PDP may postpone its National Convention after the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) extended the deadline for political parties to conduct their primaries for the 2023 general elections by six days.\n\nThe extension had prompted the ruling All Progressives Congress to postpone its own primaries, earlier scheduled for Sunday, to June 6.\n\nBut the PDP quickly denied that it had any plans of shifting its postponement, criticising INEC for \u201cshifting the goal post.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe Convention, which was held at the Velodrome of the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja, sprung to life before midday on Saturday as party delegates began to troop in.\n\nUdom Emmanuel was one of the first presidential aspirants to arrive and others soon followed.\n\nAlthough the Convention had been scheduled to begin at 10am, proceedings did not commence until late evening.\n\nParty leaders who spoke to Channels Television were upbeat about the success of the election, vowing to take back the country from the ruling APC.\n\nSigns that Atiku would emerge as the flagbearer surfaced after Adamawa State Governor Umaru Fintiri revealed that Mohammed Hayatu-Deen had stepped down for the former Vice President.\n\nHayatu-Deen, one of the presidential aspirants, announced earlier that he was exiting the race but did not say he was supporting any particular candidate.\n\nThe big twist\n\nAfter the National Anthem was sung, all 14 aspirants were given the opportunity to address the delegates for a maximum of five minutes.\n\nAtiku went first, following an alphabetical order. And Wike, his eventual closest challenger, spoke last.\n\nBut the big twist of the primary came after the speeches, when voting was about to commence.\n\nTambuwal, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives and North-West politics stalwart, stepped on to the podium and announced he was stepping down for Atiku.\n\n\u201cI have come to the conclusion \u2013 to the glory of God Almighty, seeing millions of Nigerians suffering and the need for us to close ranks in the party and as one of the leaders in this party \u2013 I have come to a patriotic conclusion to step down my aspiration,\u201d Tambuwal said, to wide cheers and applause.\n\n\u201cAnd not only that, I have appealed to my supporters to take this in good strides and for national unity and patriotism \u2013 not only that, those who are delegates here \u2013 should vote for Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.\u201d\n\nFrom there, it seemed destined to be Atiku\u2019s night as the final results later showed.",

          "text": "Vinicius Junior scored the only goal of the game as Real Madrid beat Liverpool 1-0 in Saturday\u2019s Champions League final in Paris to become kings of Europe for a record-extending 14th time after a night marred by problems outside the ground that led to the kick-off being delayed by over half an hour.\n\nBrazilian winger Vinicius turned in Fede Valverde\u2019s enticing low cross in the 59th minute at the Stade de France and Liverpool could not find an equaliser as Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side lost to the Spanish giants in a Champions League final for the second time in five seasons.\n\nThe Anfield side will wonder what might have been had the outstanding Thibaut Courtois not pushed Sadio Mane\u2019s shot onto the inside of a post when they were on top in the first half, as they fell short of a trophy treble.\n\nWinners of the English League Cup and FA Cup this season, they just missed out to Manchester City for the Premier League title and were denied a victory here which would have put them level with AC Milan on seven European Cups.\n\nInstead Real have a fifth Champions League in nine seasons to go with their Spanish title, as Carlo Ancelotti becomes the first coach to win European club football\u2019s greatest prize for a fourth time.\n\nAncelotti was also in charge of Real when they won the 2014 final having also triumphed with AC Milan in 2003 and in 2007, the latter victory coming against Liverpool.\n\nDelayed kick-off\n\nThe match kicked off 35 minutes later than the planned 9:00 pm (1900 GMT) start in the French capital after chaos at entrances to the stadium led to fans being unable to get to their seats.\n\nUEFA said it was \u201csympathetic\u201d towards those affected and put the huge build-ups of supporters at gates down to \u201cthousands of fans who had purchased fake tickets which did not work in the turnstiles\u201d.\n\nTear gas was also fired by police as a small number of people could be seen trying to scale fences around the perimeter of the groud.\n\nThe final was only moved to the French capital after Saint-Petersburg was stripped of the game following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nThe delayed kick-off may have been responsible for the slow start to the game itself, as it took 16 minutes before there was an incident of note, Mohamed Salah turning a low Trent Alexander-Arnold cross towards goal only for Courtois to save.\n\nLiverpool were seen as favourites to avenge their loss to the Spanish giants in the 2018 final in Kyiv and they began to take control of the game.\n\nMane came agonisingly close to opening the scoring in the 21st minute as he skipped his way into a shooting position inside the box only for Courtois to tip his net-bound shot onto his right-hand post.\n\nKlopp\u2019s side, with Fabinho and Thiago Alcantara starting in midfield after overcoming fitness worries, were on top but could not turn their superiority into a lead.\n\nOutstanding Courtois\n\nReal, meanwhile, created almost nothing in the first half with Karim Benzema quiet, but their captain briefly thought he had got the breakthrough two minutes before the interval.\n\nThe Frenchman prodded home after the ball broke back to him inside the area but the offside flag was raised.\n\nThe decision to disallow the goal was upheld after a lengthy VAR check, despite Fabinho deflecting Valverde\u2019s touch through to Benzema.\n\nYet Ancelotti\u2019s side kept their nerve and were rewarded with the goal as the hour mark approached.\n\nValverde drove forward down the right before firing a low ball across the face of goal for Vinicius to turn it in at the far post past his Brazilian national team colleague Alisson.\n\nJust like in 2018, Real had drawn first blood, but this time there was no need for them to send on Gareth Bale in order to ensure victory.\n\nCourtois was superb, flying to his right to keep out a Salah curler before two saves in quick succession late on.\n\nFirst the Belgian got down low when substitute Diogo Jota deflected Salah\u2019s effort towards goal, and then he produced a strong arm to turn a Salah strike behind.\n\nIt was Real Madrid\u2019s night.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Former President Donald Trump has called on US lawmakers to prioritise funding for school security over sending military aid to Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking at a pro-gun conference, Mr Trump questioned how the US \u201chas $40 billion to send to Ukraine\u201d but cannot ensure security in schools.\n\nThe meeting of the National Rifle Association (NRA), the largest US gun group, is taking place in Houston.\n\nThe intervention comes days after 21 people died in a Texas school shooting.\n\n\u201cBefore we nation-build the rest of the world, we should be building safe schools for our own children in our own nation,\u201d Mr Trump said in Friday\u2019s speech, drawing loud applause.\n\nEarlier this month, the US Congress overwhelmingly voted to send nearly $40bn (\u00a331bn) in military aid to Ukraine. In total, US lawmakers have sent about $54bn to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February.\n\n\u201cCongress should vote immediately to take back every penny of unused Covid relief money,\u201d Mr Trump went on. \u201cTake it back from the states and use that money to quickly establish impenetrable security at every school all across our land.\u201d\n\nMr Trump rejected calls for tightened gun controls, saying decent Americans should be allowed firearms to defend themselves against \u201cevil\u201d.\n\nHe instead proposed a \u201ctop-to-bottom overhaul\u201d of school safety, with fortified single points of entry including metal detectors and at least one armed police officer on every campus. He accused Democrats of stonewalling such security measures.\n\nThe former Republican president began his speech by reading out the names of the Uvalde shooting victims, with each marked by a bell toll.\n\nThe annual conference of the NRA, which has five million members, is taking place 280 miles (450 km) from Uvalde, the scene of the worst school shooting in the US in a decade.\n\nAhead of the event, several conservative speakers and musical performers announced they were backing out \u2013 including Senator John Cornyn and the manufacturer of the rifle used in the Uvalde attack.\n\nMr Trump hit out at those who withdrew, telling the crowd: \u201cUnlike some, I didn\u2019t disappoint you by not showing up.\u201d\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott, who had been slated to speak in person at the event, instead told the crowd via videolink that gun laws are ineffective at preventing mass shootings.\n\n\u201cThere are thousands of laws on the books across the country that limit the owning or using of firearms \u2013 laws that have not stopped madmen from carrying out evil acts on innocent people and peaceful communities,\u201d Mr Abbott said.\n\n\u201cIn Uvalde, the gunman committed a felony under Texas law before he even pulled the trigger. It is a felony to possess a firearm on school premises. But that did not stop him.\u201d\n\nMr Trump called in his speech for the US to \u201cdrastically change our approach to mental health\u201d.\n\nHe made a similar call during his presidency, even while critics at the time accused him of trying to defund medical programmes that included mental healthcare.\n\nBefore Mr Trump spoke, Texas Senator Ted Cruz blamed mass shootings mainly on absent fathers, declining church attendance, social media and video games.\n\nMr Cruz also reiterated his pro-gun stance and urged delegates \u201cnot react to evil and tragedy by abandoning the Constitution or infringing on the rights of our law-abiding citizens\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf the left disarms America, those crimes would no longer be stopped,\u201d Mr Cruz said. \u201cMany more single moms in subways would be assaulted or raped or murdered. Home invasions would turn much more deadly, as only the criminals would have guns. And far more children would be murdered.\u201d\n\nOutside the venue, hundred of protesters gathered to oppose the NRA. They held signs saying \u201cNRA kill kids\u201d, \u201cprotect children not guns\u201d and held crosses and photos of shooting victims.",
