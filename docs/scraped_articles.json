          "title": "Doctor advised my mum to \u2018kill\u2019 me after I became paralysed at eight \u2013Helen Alonge, polio survivor",
          "text": "Mrs Helen Alonge survived poliomyelitis as a child but she lost her ability to walk. In this interview with TOBI AWORINDE, the civil servant and current master\u2019s student in Theatre and Media Arts shares her triumph story following the physical abuse and discrimination that marked her adolescent years\n\nCan you tell us about yourself?\n\nI will be 32 years old on June 16, 2021. I am physically challenged. I am a graduate of English and Literary Studies from the Ekiti State University and I am currently pursuing a master\u2019s degree in Theatre and Media Arts at the Federal University Oye Ekiti. I am a native of Ilupeju-Ekiti in the Oye Local Government Area of Ekiti State but I live and work in Ado Ekiti. I grew up in Ekiti.\n\nWere you born physically-challenged or something happened along the line?\n\nI wasn\u2019t born physically-challenged. I was eight years when the incident happened. Funnily enough, it actually happened on my eighth birthday. So, while celebrating my birthday, I also mark the anniversary of becoming physically-challenged. Growing up, it wasn\u2019t easy, but I thank God because life itself is not easy. We just have to thank God.\n\nDo you want to talk about what exactly happened to you?\n\nMy parents concluded that it was through poliomyelitis. It happened in the night. My mum was selling food in a primary school then. She would wake up very early in the morning to prepare the food. My dad is a retired soldier but he was still in service then, so he was on duty (on the night of the incident). The following day, which happened to be my birthday, I woke up like any other child and then realised I couldn\u2019t stand up. My sister and everyone else sang birthday songs for me, expecting me to jump up, but I couldn\u2019t.\n\nThey called my mum, but she told them, \u201cLeave her; she will stand up when it is time.\u201d They all thought I was joking but I just couldn\u2019t move my legs or hands. I could only open my eyes and see what was going on; it was as if I was in another world. Then my brother got angry and said, \u201cEverybody is preparing for school; today is your birthday but you have to go to school.\u201d\n\nHe tried to force me to stand up but as he pulled me from the mattress, I fell down. That was when they knew that seriously something was wrong somewhere. He was scared, so he called my mum. She rushed in and tried all that she could. It was a very sad day. We went from the hospital to a church to herbalists. It was after some time that I started gaining strength in some other parts of my body, but I was totally paralysed at first. I was crawling around.\n\nWhat did the doctors say when you visited the hospital?\n\nA doctor advised my mum to inject (euthanise) me because raising a child with a physical challenge was a very difficult task. As God would have it, she refused. A message was sent to my dad concerning what was happening. He came home and saw everything, so he got angry, thinking my mum had got involved in something diabolical that had brought the issue upon me. My mum and dad got separated. So, it was only my mum that went through all the struggles then.\n\nWhat do you mean by a doctor advising your mum to \u201cinject\u201d you?\n\nThere were actually two of us that had that problem in that hospital but the other guy died, and my mum thought it was natural but the doctor said that was the same advice he gave to the woman and she agreed. The doctor said for a person with disabilities, it would be easier to cope at a young age, but while growing up, it would be much more difficult. But my mum was like, \u201cIf she wants to die, let her die naturally, instead of me to be the cause of her death.\u201d So, I was discharged from the hospital that very day.\n\nWhat was the experience of going to herbalists like?\n\nI remember vividly that my first experience of discrimination from my family was through a religious leader. When I was taken to church for deliverance and prayers, instead of the pastor to allow peace to reign, he said I was in a cult and that I had been possessed. At 1am, they would bring me out and start flogging me with brooms, saying they wanted the evil spirit to leave me.\n\nHow old were you then?\n\nI was about 11 years old. My mum was crying and rolling on the ground. After the flogging she was still the one who would help to massage my body. She would even kneel down to beg me, saying, \u201cDo you like that you cannot walk?\u201d I was crying and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have an idea of what he (the prophet) is saying.\u201d There was a day I was forced to tell her, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just get me something and let me just die?\u201d She was scared, and I said, \u201cWith the torment I underwent at the hands of those people every night, as they were beating me, sometimes, I wished I wouldn\u2019t breathe again.\u201d I think she was jolted by those words, so she quit attending the church.\n\nDid you experience any signs of paralysis before your eighth birthday?\n\nBefore then, there was nothing. As I said, I was actually preparing for my birthday, which was the following day, when it happened. I was healthy without any trace of illness before then.\n\nHow difficult was it for you to come to terms with your condition?\n\nI had to stop school, and I must say, the situation actually affected some of my brothers and sisters then. They couldn\u2019t leave me at home alone, while my mum was struggling to make ends meet. Most of the time, they would stay with me at home and it actually affected my education because I couldn\u2019t resume school immediately. I was at home for some years.\n\nBut something happened that made my dad come back to reunite with us. He was working at the Kainji Dam in the North at the time. A National Youth Service Corps member in my brother\u2019s school wondered why my brother would always rush home during any break. So, one day, he trailed my brother home, saw me and said, \u201cIs this why I punish you every day for leaving the school premises during recess?\u201d He said he wanted to see my dad. He eventually saw my dad and he told him there was a particular school in the South-West (for children with disabilities). He asked my dad to make enquiries for a special needs person like myself. My dad then made enquiries and that was when he retired from the Nigerian Army. He came back home. I then started school, but as God would have it, I was too old to resume in Primary One. They had to test my intelligence. I had been getting tutored at home by my brothers. When they returned from school, they opened their books to teach me how to read and write. I started using my hands again and I learnt that from home. When I returned to school, I was put in Primary Five that year.\n\nDid you experience any struggle catching up in school?\n\nHonestly, I give credit to God for that aspect. I always say God is wonderful because I didn\u2019t experience any challenge in learning. I was even the one teaching most of the pupils in my class. I tell people it is a mystery because I don\u2019t know how it happened. Even my teachers were puzzled. A lot of names were given to me back then.\n\nWhat kind of names?\n\nIn Yoruba, some would say, \u201cThis one is a witch! Maybe it is in the middle of the night that they teach her everything.\u201d Even my sister at home said it. But I tell people that it is a mystery to me.\n\nDid you face other forms of discrimination?\n\nI do tell people that for persons with disabilities, discrimination shouldn\u2019t be a problem because it is something we face daily everywhere. You want to board a cab, you face discrimination. Some transporters will not want to take you because they feel it is easier and faster for them to pick somebody standing on his or her feet than picking someone in a wheelchair \u2014 before you can fold the wheelchair, they would have passed you by. They would even charge you an amount that they know you won\u2019t be able to pay. That is discrimination.\n\nRemember I said I attended a special needs school. After JSS 3, I had to leave the school to be enrolled in a regular school. That was where I knew what true discrimination is. The class and toilet, sometimes, were not accessible. I joined in SSS 1, but due to the inaccessibility of the building, I had to stay in the same classroom from SSS 1 to SSS 3 because that was the only classroom that was accessible. But most of my teachers showed understanding, so they had to bring down the classes to me.\n\nThough they didn\u2019t see it as discrimination, some of my classmates would say to my face, \u201cThis is where we were last session. Now that we are in SSS 2, we are still here and it is because of Helen.\u201d Though I saw it as teasing, at the same time, it wasn\u2019t a nice thing for them to say. When I was about to take the West African Senior School Certificate Examination they moved me to the hall. I must say it was very stressful because it was not accessible and I had to be carried by five students and teachers to get to the hall. Due to this, I only came around when I had papers. Normally, I should have been there for lessons or just to have fun like other students. Whenever I did not have papers, I just stayed at home. When I got to the university, it was another world entirely. I faced a lot of discrimination in school.\n\nDo you think the situation is better today in terms of accessibility of buildings and inclusive amenities?\n\nI must say we don\u2019t have accessible buildings. I have been at home for the past one and a half months due to inaccessible buildings in my office. In March, my office was moved from the ground floor to the first floor, and they are aware that I am wheelchair-bound. In school, there is no accessible building. Even where I am currently pursuing my master\u2019s degree, if I don\u2019t go with an aide there is no way I can access the building. So, whenever I want to go to school, I have to budget money for two \u2013 for myself and the person that will help me. Till date, we haven\u2019t achieved that goal of accessibility.\n\nWhere do you work?\n\nI work in the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture in Ekiti State.\n\nAre you happy about the eradication of polio in Nigeria?\n\nI am very happy that Nigeria could achieve that, though anyone can become disabled at any stage in life. People get disabled in home accidents. I know someone who built a house, bought the tiles, and did everything. She fell at home and her leg was amputated, though she didn\u2019t dream of it. And sometimes people become disabled in their old age. But at least, through the eradication of polio, disabilities can be drastically reduced. Thank God we have achieved that as a country.\n\nYou recently got married. How did you meet your husband?\n\nI thank God because I got married on April 3, 2021, which happened to be the Holy Saturday. I met him three years ago. In terms of what persons with disabilities face in their relationships with the opposite sex, it has really been an issue, especially the mindset of persons without disabilities towards persons with disabilities, whether male or female. There is this discrimination that \u201cshe can\u2019t do this, she will be a liability to you.\u201d Having experienced a lot of heartbreaks, I never knew marriage would come my way, so I did things my own way.\n\nMy husband and I started out as friends. But when I saw the signals, I started staying away from him. I didn\u2019t want to pick his calls at times, but he kept calling and checking on me. One day, he was forced to say, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to get married one day?\u201d I said, \u201cOf course, I will.\u201d He said, \u201cThen when is the time?\u201d I said, \u201cAnytime.\u201d Last year, on my birthday, he proposed and we got married. Thank God for working it out, though some of his family members were against it. But he made them realise that this is the person he wants. Like he always says, there are a lot of positive things that happened to him when we met.\n\nBefore we got married, there was a day I was washing my clothes in the bathroom. He often looks at me amazingly and I would be wondering, \u201cWhat is actually going on?\u201d But I don\u2019t ask questions. That day, he said he sees in me the complete opposite of what people say. I asked, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d and he said, \u201cDo you know that people keep telling me every day that this lady will not be able to wash or cook.\u201d But he said he sees me doing these things by myself without even complaining, and I laughed. To the glory of God, we got married.\n\nWhat was your wedding day like?\n\nIt was a wonderful day that I will never forget. After putting on a matriculation gown and a convocation gown, seeing myself in a wedding gown made me so happy. That was a wonderful day. Both of my parents were present. Honestly, I was happy. While some were saying it was difficult, God made it easy for me. I am an indoor girl. It is not as if I don\u2019t go out, but I like to study. But there are times when I like to go out and have fun. I didn\u2019t stress myself looking for men; I used to pray and tell God, \u201cYou see I am in a wheelchair. I don\u2019t want a man that will come and deceive me. I want someone after your own heart.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\u2026we fear for their lives every day, govt should intervene\n\nThe constant attacks on police facilities particularly in the South-East and South-South regions of the country have put fears in the minds of relations and dependents of cops serving in the regions.\n\nThe family members of the police officers who spoke to Saturday PUNCH expressed worry over the development. While some of them spoke on condition of anonymity, others agreed to the use of their names without pictures because of fear of attacks.\n\nThey noted that they usually feared for the lives of their loved ones in the Police Force whenever they left for work every day.\n\nOne of them who is a petty trader at Aba and wife of a sergeant in Abia State, Eno Nsikaku, said fear over attacks on police facilities often made her to worry about the safety of her husband anytime he left for work.\n\nNsikaku said, \u201cWe now live by the day. If my husband who serve his fatherland comes back safely after leaving for work, I am usually happy. Otherwise, when he leaves for work, I am usually afraid of what would happen next. I am usually on my knees each time my husband leaves for work, especially on night duty. I don\u2019t sleep but keeps vigil, praying that he returns alive. Without him, I am finished as he is the family breadwinner. I can\u2019t afford to train my four kids with the petty business of selling fruits.\u2019\u2019\n\nFour serving cops in Umuahia comprising three women and a man, who spoke on condition of anonymity with one of our correspondents, said the risked they faced was enormous despite poor pay.\n\nOne of them said, \u201cWe now work with fear as we face risks each time we are at work and yet, we are not appreciated.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnother woman whose husband is a mobile policeman said each time her husband left for work, she was often frightened.\n\nThe full housewife whose husband is a constable in Abia State, Chisom Eziyi, said her husband always asked her to pray for him each time he left for work, adding \u201ceach time he makes this request, I will be lost in thought thinking of what I will do as a newlywed if he becomes a victim. His work is now risky as hoodlums target police stations in the South-East.\u2019\u2019\n\nEziyi, who is from Item in the Bende Local Government Area of the state, prayed to God to take control, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a widow at this stage. I pray for his safety every day.\u2019\u2019\n\nHowever, the Abia Police Command had noted that it was, \u201ctaking proactive measures over the issue and not resting on its laurels.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe state police spokesperson, SP Geoffrey Ogbonna said, \u201cWe are taking steps towards addressing the issue.\u201d\n\nReports noted that over 25 police stations had been attacked in parts of the South-East and South-South in the past five months. They added that over 127 policemen and other security personnel have been killed during the attacks. The attacks which have occurred in Abia, Imo, Anambra, Enugu, Ebonyi, Akwa Ibom and Rivers States, have spread fear among the populace.\n\nThe October 2020 #EndSARS protests in the southern part of the country hijacked by hoodlums, killer herdsmen menace on host communities, banditry including insurgency caused untold security challenges in the country.\n\nThe criminal herdsmen\u2019s activities have increased with people being killed, abducted and maimed, farmlands destroyed, women raped and lately attacks on policemen and police facilities. Abia State has had its own share of such mayhem, with more police stations burnt since January till date. Women have abandoned their farmlands following increased attacks by herders while robberies and kidnappings soared.\n\nHowever, the attacks on police facilities in the state by \u201cunidentified gunmen,\u201d have continued. On February 2, 2021, some gunmen attacked Omoba Police Station in the Isiala Ngwa South Local Government Area of Abia State, killing a policeman. The attack occurred in the early hours of Tuesday at the station located along the Umuene\u2013Omoba Road and the assailants were said to have arrived there on motorcycles and opened fire on the station as policemen on guard repelled the attack.\n\nAgain, suspected hoodlums, on Tuesday, February 23, 2021 attacked and burnt the World Bank Housing Estate Police Station, Abayi in Aba, Abia State, killing about two police officers. It was learnt that during the attack, the hoodlums killed an Assistant Superintendent of Police and a police corporal. Again Nkporo Police Station was also burnt and on Monday, April 12, 2021, another set of unidentified gunmen in the early hours of the day, torched the Uzuakoli Police Station in Bende Local Government Area of Abia State. This development occurred a few days after Abia State Government raised the alarm over plot by hoodlums to attack some key locations in the state.\n\nIn his reaction to the issue, the state Commissioner of Police, John Kalu, stated that security agencies had been fully mobilised and placed on high alert to thwart the planned attack and bring those concerned to justice swiftly. Not long after that, gunmen attacked Ubani Police Station.\n\nNo human casualties or loss of weapons at the station were recorded during the attack because the station was deemed vulnerable to attacks based on intelligence and already vacated by cops three weeks earlier.\n\nWhile dust had yet to settle on the incident, Ubakala Police Station in Umuahia South LGA was razed down even as two cops reportedly lost their lives. The incident occurred five days after the Bende Police Station was burnt and a few weeks after the attack on the Ubani Ibeku Police Station.\n\nUnhappy with the development, the state government lamented that attacks on security agents, particularly men of the Nigeria Police Force, constituted danger to everyone in society, calling on citizens and leaders to come together to immediately end the needless and mindless acts. The government said, \u201cThose who feel aggrieved must find peaceful means of ventilating their grievances and agitating for redress as provided for in our constitution rather than take the laws into their own hands.\u2019\u2019\n\nPanic in Anambra too\n\nAttacks on cops and police facilities in Anambra State climaxed with the attack on the Zonal Police Headquarters, Ukpo, Anambra State, in April, 2021. The attack was the ninth of such onslaughts on police and other security agents in the state this year.\n\nIn February, criminals attacked policemen at Mkpologwu and Omogho communities in the Aguata and Orumba North Local Government Areas, respectively, killing four policemen and setting patrol vehicles ablaze. They also made away with victims\u2019 rifles.\n\nIn March, gunmen killed three policemen on duty at a location in Neni community, in the Anaocha LGA of the state, and carted away their rifles. They also set their patrol vehicles ablaze.\n\nThe same day, three naval officers on duty at Awkuzu, Oyi LGA, were attacked and killed. Their guns and other military equipment were equally taken away by their killers.\n\nThe same month, the hoodlums attacked a vehicle belonging to the Nigeria Correctional Service on a court duty, killing one officer and a policewoman who boarded the vehicle from the court in Ekwulobia.\n\nA former Governor of the Central Bank, Prof Chukwuma Soludo was attacked about the same period in his Isuofia home town in Aguata Local Government Area of the state during a meeting with youths in the area over his governorship ambition on the platform of the All Progressives Grand Alliance. Three policemen were killed during the incident and their guns carted away. The ugly scenarios had sent jitters to cops in the state. A cop, who spoke with one of our correspondents on condition of anonymity, said, \u201cMost of us wear plain clothes to work these days. Life has no duplicate.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe situation ostensibly is affecting relatives of cops in the state.\n\nA wife of a policeman in the state, Ogendi Chinasa, said her friend\u2019s husband was killed alongside others at Umunze in the Orumba North Local Government Area of the state about two months ago.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe hoodlums just attacked them without any provocation at a checkpoint and killed two of them and took away their rifles. My friend suddenly became a widow, with five young children to cater for. It\u2019s painful and frightening. They have returned to their hometown in Kogi State because of the incident. I have told my husband to get ready to quit the police after December.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t continue with police work after December. No, he won\u2019t. And he has seen a reason with me why he won\u2019t continue with the job. Even if it\u2019s \u2018pure (sachet) water\u2019 that we will be selling, I will be happier with that than for him to continue risking his life. I pray for his safety every day he leaves home for work.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s the same feeling with the daughter of a policeman, who gave her name only as Ujunwa. She said, \u201cMy father has been a sergeant since I have grown to know him as my father. He hasn\u2019t been promoted despite his dedication to duty. I couldn\u2019t attend higher institution because my father couldn\u2019t afford it. We are six in my family. I\u2019m the first. I left secondary school in 2019 and I now sell Zobo drinks to assist in the family. My five siblings struggle to get basic education. I don\u2019t think my father should continue with police work with the insecurity in the country. We fear for his life daily as he goes to work. I think he should retire now and use his retirement benefits now that he is still agile to start a small business. My mum died of cancer last year and we don\u2019t want to lose our dad to unidentified gunmen. The attackers kill policemen like fowls on daily basis.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut Daalu Nwanna, a husband to a police woman, said he had no reason to withdraw his wife from the force.\n\nNwanna said, \u201cMy wife, and generally women, in the force don\u2019t carry guns, so they are not targets. The gunmen target those who carry guns because I think they are stockpiling arms and ammunition for reasons known only to them. My wife works at the state police command head office. She is like any other civil servant. So, she is not a target. People can decide what to do for themselves. They can resign if the so feel; but remember death is everywhere and not only in the police.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe police have however said they were on top of the security situation in the state including motivation packages for cops.\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer, Ikenga Tochukwu, told Saturday PUNCH that the Commissioner of Police, Chris Owolabi, was taking steps to boost the morale of cops in the command.\n\nThe PPRO said, \u201cFor us in Anambra State Police Command, it\u2019s call for more work and our men are more dedicated and motivated to serve. The administration of the Commissioner of Police, Chris Owolabi, has every day revived strategy with the aim to earn the trust of the good people of Anambra and together we shall police effectively.\u201d\n\nRelatives of cops in Enugu worry\n\nSome policewomen in Enugu State have lamented the security situation in the country, especially with the attacks on police facilities by unidentified gunmen.\n\nThe policewomen, who spoke with our one of correspondent on condition of anonymity, added that the situation made them to stop wearing uniforms to work.\n\nOne of them said that they go to work with their clothes in bags and wear them in their offices.\n\nSpeaking with Saturday PUNCH, a cop identified only as Chimezie said, \u201cAfter work, we will remove the uniforms and wear mufti for fear of being attacked by unidentified gunmen. Nobody is happy with the security situation in Enugu and the South- East in general.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that no matter what is done, they have to take care of the police especially the officers, the rank and file; those who work round-the-clock trying to secure everybody including the poor and rich. A situation whereby, an officer dies in the course of duty and within two weeks, if he is living in the barracks, his family is thrown out of the barracks is not a good thing. Some of us who are alive and witnessing what is done to our dead colleagues\u2019 families don\u2019t feel motivated. We do what we can do to receive our salary and avoid anything that will lead to death.\n\nA policewoman, who gave her name only as Ijeoma, told our one of our correspondents that the situation in the South-East was bad to the extent that they feared every day whenever any police facility was attacked.\n\nShe noted, \u201cThe situation doesn\u2019t call for the show of power. The desperation and injustices bottled for so long has been let loose and everyone is suffering it. The solution to the crisis is for the political leaders to rework the country\u2019s basis of unity. There\u2019s no way force can unite the country.\n\n\u201cThere is division along tribal, religious and ethnic lines. My children are young. I live in the barracks. Every day I leave house to work, my mind is with my children. I always pray that nothing bad should happen to them. That the situation we have found ourselves.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the measures to contain the rising insecurity, the state Commissioner of Police, Mohammed Aliyu, said that their operational modalities had changed.\n\nAliyu said, \u201cWe are not having it so good, it is not only in Enugu State. It\u2019s the same in all the states of the federation. I assure residents that we are changing our operational strategies to counter the emerging security threats in the state. You also know that the acting Inspector-General of Police, on Tuesday launched new security operation, code-named \u2018Operation RP \u2013 Restore Peace\u2019, so that operation is part of the measures the police have taken to stem the tide of insecurity.\u201d\n\nThe Divisional Police Station in Adani, Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area of the state was attacked on April 21, 2021. Emene Divisional Police Station and four other stations were attacked by hoodlums during the October #EndSARS protests in the southern part of the country. Amechi-Idodo Police Station, Akwatta Police Post under the Central Police Station, Maryland Police Post under Uwani Police Division and Phase 6 Police Post, under Trans-Ekulu Police Division, had also been torched by hoodlums.\n\nAkwa Ibom not left out\n\nAlso, families of cops in Akwa Ibom State called for concerted efforts to end the persistent killing of security agents and attack on police facilities in the state.\n\nAbout 22 security agents, mostly policemen have been killed and three police stations including personal and operational vehicles burnt since the onslaught against security agents started in March, this year.\n\nAmong the police stations burnt include the divisional police station in Essien Udim, Ini and Etim Ekpo local council areas in the state.\n\nSpeaking with one of our correspondents, a relative of a police officer in the state, Mr. Etim Etim said all hands must be on deck to nip the situation in the bud, adding that police officers were no longer safe.\n\nAccording to him, the attacks on police facilities and killing of security agents if not checked can affect the morale of cops and lead to general insecurity in the state.\n\nEtim said, \u201cAs a family member to a cop, I feel concerned for the life of my brother, because the way things are, no policeman is safe. I call on the government to curb the situation so that a policeman or woman can go to work freely and be safe.\n\n\u201cThis is because the officers who are being killed have families, children and are breadwinners. My brother helps the family greatly. If anything happens to him, it will affect us economically and psychologically. We want the Federal Government to do something about it and secure the lives of policemen in the state.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn her comment, the wife of a policeman, Mrs Gift Bokime, said the killing of security agents had brought fear and anxiety, adding that her mind was not always at rest until her husband returned from work.\n\nShe said, \u201cI want the government to do something about it and urgently because policing is now a risky profession. The killing of security operatives has further worsened the fears. I always pray and thank God each time my husband leaves and returns home after the day\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, a student and a relative of policeman, Miss Godsgift Gaius, advised cops to be vigilant in addressing the situation.\n\nShe called on Divisional Police Officers to take adequate measures in tackling security challenges in their respective stations, adding the police authorities shouldn\u2019t sit back and watch their stations burnt down without taking precautionary measures.\n\nGaius stated, \u201cThe killing of security operatives is a bad development in our society. It\u2019s a tragedy so to speak. Security is a two-way thing. While I will call on the government to take serious steps to stop the killing, I also call on the DPOs to secure the police stations. Something cannot be happening to a police station and the DPO will not take proactive measures about it. The police have to be proactive to secure the stations.\u2019\u2019\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Actress, Oloruntimilehin Bukola, popularly known as Kiitan Bukola, has revealed that her rape ordeal at the age of 10 had a long-term effect on her sexual life.\n\nIn an interview with Saturday Beats, she said, \u201cI cannot remember what age I started taking alcohol but I started drinking beer in secondary school. My mom did not know about this habit and my father did not live with us. Drinking is an addiction for me. I find it difficult to make love without getting high, because of my rape ordeal. That way, I can do whatever I want. Also, I have to really share a close bond with my partner before I can get intimate. Sometimes, I feel irritated, angry and paranoid for no reason. I still get flashes from the incident. I can picture his face clearly. However, I am really trying my best to stop my drinking habit. People close to me know that I always have (alcoholic) drinks around me.\n\n\u201cI did not want to tell anyone my story at that time because of the fear of being stigmatised or ridiculed. That was what prompted me to make a movie about my experience 23 years later. I want victims to have the courage to speak out. The incident happened at Oke Bola in Ado Ekiti.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, I had another bad experience with a guy some years back. We were in a long-distance relationship but he came to Nigeria after a while. I had gone to see my mum in Ondo State and he was in Akure (the state capital) at the time. We spent some time together and when it was getting late, I asked him to drop me at the park. However, he cajoled me and we stayed back in his house. He tried to have sex with me and when I refused, he slapped me very hard. I told him it was the time of my menstrual cycle. But, he insisted that he wanted to confirm. He later confirmed and apologised. I did not sleep till 5am when I left his house the next day. This happened in 2006 or 2008. I have been more careful since then.\u201d\n\nThe actress who urged victims to speak out regardless of when the incident happened also said she wished she met her rapist before he died. She added, \u201cWhen I told my rape story on social media, I found out that the guy had died. I was told he was killed during a robbery. I was hoping to meet him and I would have paid him back for what he did to me.\n\n\u201cI knew the identity of my rapist, so I told my family friend about it, who then informed me that he (rapist) had died. Another person also confirmed the story to me after I spoke out about the incident. I think my career also helped me to speak out because I could make a film out of it.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Dennis Agbo\n\nThe Anti-Corruption and Research-Based Data Initiative (ARDI), has cautioned that twisting the comment of the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation (HAGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami on open grazing is not good for the nation\u2019s interest.\n\nThe group also insisted that the barrage of criticism against Malami (SAN) on the proposed ban on Open Grazing by the forum of Southern Governors is not necessary.\n\nExecutive Secretary of ARDI, Chief Dennis Aghanya in a statement on Friday noted that in analyzing the statement critically, the HAGF (Malami) was not faulting the rights of the Governors to make decisions for the interest of their people.\n\n\u201cRather, as the chief law officer of the federation, he was insisting on the precision of the order which needs to be enacted as a law by the various state assemblies so that such order can stand the test of any legal challenge and would not be perceived to target a section of people. Any order that is not passed as a law is certainly unconstitutional and that was what the HAGF was stressing.\n\nAlso read:\n\n\u201cNo sane Nigerian is unaware of the usual rift between the herders and farmers resulting from movement of cows across the country and a lasting solution is needed to nip the situation. But identifying the HAGF\u2019s comment with the ethnic and religious garment is mischievous and an ill wind that would blow no one any good.\n\n\u201cMalami\u2019s expression simply aimed at depicting freedom, rights and ownership and not indirectly targeted at any ethnic group. Malami, by his conduct and disposition, is very open and accommodating to all, irrespective of one ethnic, religious and social background. Hence, it is inconceivable to imply that he is an ethnic or religious bigot.\n\n\u201cThe implication of his alarm is that it is usually the encroachment of the right of other parties that is punishable and not the act of lawful grazing,\u201d Aghanya strengthened.\n\nHe said that Malami is not that too petty to be beclouded with ethnic sentiment at the detriment of what the law stipulates.\n\n\u201cTherefore, overheating the system on avoidable issues, when the country is grabbling with challenges of insecurity and global economic problems will do us no good.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

It\u2019s as simple as that; you\u2019re dead. So, I dared not. Not because one was not tempted, I remember we wore minis, but you know, they\u2019ve gone too far these days. But the thing is that there is an ongoing evolution. And then parents, let us also take responsibility.\u201d\n\nShe spoke alongside music legends Sir Shina Peters, Queen Salawa Abeni, Bright Chimezie, Victor Uwaifo, and Yvonne Chaka Chaka at a recent event by AMC media for an upcoming music project tagged Cloud 9.\n\nResponding to a question about the moral culture and quality of today\u2019s artists and their music compared with that of her time, she suggested that younger artists need guidance because they are still evolving.\n\nOnwenu said: \u201cLeave them alone, they\u2019re going to evolve. When you do music and the music is not lasting, you\u2019ll realise you\u2019re out of the way. Right now, we have artists that we can be proud of, they\u2019re bringing laurels to us from all over the world. They\u2019re reaching places that because of technology, some of us didn\u2019t get to, and all I can say is that continue teaching, let\u2019s continue talking. Those that are real artists will endure; they\u2019re coming with a sense of purpose\u201d.\n\nSpeaking of the Cloud 9 concert and award ceremony, Onwenu said she worked on new music while the Covid-19 pandemic raged and promised her fans to expect something new. Cloud 9 is a retrospective project designed to rekindle the social groove of the 60s to 80s and will allow fans to celebrate and honour their legends who will perform on the same stage.",

One of the arguments against compulsory registration is that it allows the government to track SIM card owners and makes it easier to track calls and messages.\n\nA Device Management System will take this step even further, allowing the government even more access to what should be private information. While the argument from the government is that it improves security, there\u2019s the risk that the government can spy on its citizens.\n\nGeneralized surveillance in countries like Nigeria with weak security agencies controlled by the executive can become police states where opposition leaders can be tracked and arrested. But with the rise in crime in Nigeria in the past year, it is easy to understand the government\u2019s argument.\n\nDoes the government\u2019s argument make sense?\n\nIn a 2016 paper, \u201ccomplete mobile phone registration has many generalised benefits to the society especially in combating crime.\u201d\n\nWith increasing reports of kidnappings taking place around the country, a centralised registry may help to find bad actors even quicker, and it could help combat the sale of stolen phones. When there\u2019s a central registry for IMEI, the police could identify the owners of lost and stolen phones thousands of times daily.\n\nA critical part of this paper argues for a central database of mobile phones that law enforcement agencies presumably can access. Yet, it is this central assumption that still provides a problem.\n\nWhether Nigerians trust that the government will not abuse access to such critical information remains to be seen.\n\n*An earlier version of this report stated that the NCC asked telcos to register the IMEI numbers of their subscribers; the NCC has now clarified its position",

          "text": "Exceptional results require a high-performance team but how do you build one?\n\nIn what can be termed a mini-MBA session, Seni Sulyman and Chichi Offodile in an edition of TechCabal Live shared expert advice on how to build high-performance teams.\n\nSeni Sulyman is the founder and community manager of Black Ops, a network of top African operators building great companies and cultures across the world. Before starting Black Ops, Seni helped scale Andela\u2019s operations from series B to series D with over 1,000 team members across US and Africa offices.\n\nChichi Offodile is the COO of Helium Health. She has over 15 years of experience working at EMC/Dell and Deloitte.\n\nTheir Journey at Helium Health and Andela\n\nThe conversation begins with Chichi and Seni talking about their journeys at Helium Health and Andela respectively. They both stepped in when each company had a viable product/service, some traction, and funding.\n\nFor Chichi, she was brought in when Helium Health had figured out what it was doing but was uncertain about how to move forward. Her strength lies in figuring out how to build a sustainable company and that\u2019s what she set out to do via a transformation plan.\n\nSeni joined Andela in 2016 when the company was in only two markets \u2013 Nigeria and Kenya. At that time there had been a few leadership exits and the general employee morale was low. His mandate was to stabilize the ship. Which he did before focusing on operational expansion.\n\nHow do you begin the transformation process?\n\nFor Seni, he believes the transformation process should start with the why\u2014 otherwise known as communicating a vision that galvanises everything. At Andela, he had to create a modified version of the vision that was more compelling to the team.\n\nAfter clearly articulating the vision, decide on the steps to take to achieve the vision. This involves setting performance indicators and reviews, so it\u2019s clear what the goals are and whether people are hitting them.\n\nHow does a high achiever culture permeate a company?\n\nBoth Seni and Chichi believe that it starts with hiring people with the potential to be high achievers and then setting a good example as a leader.\n\nGiving people room to execute the tasks they\u2019ve set out to do is also an important factor.\n\n\u201cI make sure that leadership allows people to be creative. Allow people to execute. If you don\u2019t give people the opportunity to succeed, you\u2019ll be stifling them. I motivate people by allowing them to set their goals and fix a timeline to achieve it,\u201d Chichi said.\n\nBuilding cohesiveness within the team\n\nGreat things are rarely ever done by one person. How do we ensure that the team sticks together?\n\nSeni believes the people have to align on the why. This alignment has to start from the top, there has to be a unified strategy at the top level.\n\n\u201cStrategy is a lot more of what you\u2019re saying No to than what you\u2019re saying Yes to,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting an example of when he had to build cohesiveness within a team, he said that during his time at Bristow he noticed that two senior executives weren\u2019t aligned on the company\u2019s direction. One person wanted a high-end airline, while the other person wanted a low-cost airline.\n\nTo resolve this issue, he had to call both of them together to iron out their differences before the company could move forward.\n\nHow do you get teams to keep going without burning out\n\nA common challenge high-performance teams face is that they experience burnout due to the intense and fast-paced nature of work.\n\nSeni responded to this question by stating that he thinks that the issue with the pandemic and people experiencing burnout is that a lot of people were thrown into remote work without warning.\n\nThe solution to this is to encourage people to take time off work since the line between work and rest can be blurry. As a leader, you have to practice what you preach.\n\nIn order to encourage people to take some time off work, he often schedules his emails sent in the middle of the night to go out by the next morning to avoid creating unnecessary work or a sense of urgency.\n\nAnother activity that helps is social gatherings, it\u2019s important for companies to have occasional fun hours. One-on-one sessions are also helpful. These are open-ended meetings with employees, where the manager finds out how they\u2019re doing as human beings and what\u2019s going on in their lives.\n\nHe ends with a caveat \u2013 it\u2019s a little difficult to build a high-performing team without working really hard.\n\n\u201cYou cannot work 80 hours a week every week, you\u2019ll burn. You also can\u2019t work 40 hours every week and materially change the world.\u201d\n\nYou have to be thoughtful and deliberate in getting work done.\n\nChichi adds that she believes companies also need to do two things.\n\nThey have to be deliberate with capacity planning. If you\u2019re growing as a company, you can\u2019t expect to have the same set of people working at the same level while the company is expanding. You need to hire more people or adjust people\u2019s roles.\n\nBe open about flex working. The output is the most important thing, let people work in ways that work for them.\n\nAt what point should a company hire an operations lead?\n\nChichi\u2019s response to this question is that the first thing to do is to have a thought process to manage operations but as soon as you have funds for it, please hire.\n\nWatch the full conversation here",

          "title": "Stax wants you to enjoy USSD with better design, without ever dialling codes again",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nMost people who started using mobile phones in the 2000s became familiar with USSD through loading and checking airtime balance. With time, mobile banking became a major use case; again for airtime transactions, but also for buying internet data, sending money and paying bills.\n\nUnlike mobile apps that need to be downloaded and installed, USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, if you insist) is lightweight and straightforward to use.\n\nDial the code for the desired service, follow the instructions e.g. \u201cpress 1 to Check Balance\u201d on each page and, provided there isn\u2019t some \u201cconnection failure\u201d or \u201centry error\u201d, your wishes will come true.\n\nA misconception is that USSD is for people who use basic phones but the feature has become mainstream even among smartphone users in Africa. A study of smartphone users in Bangladesh, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa showed that 87% of all financial-related transactions were conducted via USSD, with only 13% via mobile app.\n\nSo, USSD works well. But it still has its fair share of frustrating glitches that you normally wouldn\u2019t encounter on an app. For one, you need to memorise the code for each service you want to access. You could minimise an app to get information from, say, your notes app. But you mostly can\u2019t minimise a USSD session once it\u2019s started.\n\nUSSD\u2019s original design did not foresee \u201chow the introduction of smartphones would bridge the worlds of computing and telecommunications to form an entirely new industry,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi explains.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say we should throw it away. On the contrary, some companies recognise that USSD is here to stay in Africa. As such, they are merging the best of both worlds: stacking the visual appeal and interactivity of smartphones on top of USSD\u2019s simple and efficient backend.\n\nOne such company is Hover, a US-based company, and their solution is called Stax.\n\nMaking USSD smart\n\nStax is a mobile app currently available only to Android users in 10 countries, including Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. It has three use cases: buy airtime, send money, and request money. All without ever dialling any USSD code.\n\nStax\u2019s main promise is that users never have to dial a code again\u2026 while enjoying USSD.\n\nIt\u2019s not a digital wallet or account, so it doesn\u2019t ask for an email address or phone number. But \u2013 and this is an important but \u2013 Stax needs certain phone permissions.\n\nWhat permissions? Three precisely: to make and manage phone calls; send and view messages; and access your contacts.\n\nWith those enabled, you can input how much airtime you want to buy, choose the bank or fintech-powered account you want to debit and input the phone number to credit or select from your phonebook.\n\nIt would be great if this is where it ends but \u2013 somewhat unfortunately \u2013 Stax asks for two other permissions to complete this task of buying airtime. Permission to display on top of other apps on your phone and another to connect with mobile money and telecom services on your behalf.\n\nThis gave me pause and maybe it is because of the copy: \u201cAllow Stax to have full control of your device?\u201d\n\nThree paragraphs beneath that question describe why the permission is needed. But all the bad news I have absorbed about privacy risks over the past four years flashed before my eyes, discouraging me from clicking \u201cAllow.\u201d\n\nJess Shorland, co-founder of Hover, agrees that some work needs to be done to make users more comfortable with the permissions. But she has an explanation for why they are necessary:\n\n\u201cIt allows us to automate the USSD session on behalf of the user. We\u2019ve basically built a different interface for USSD. The user interacts with that interface in a way that is a lot more screen-reader friendly.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one big permission request\n\nIn other words, the accessibility permission is what enables Stax to do these things on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\nWhen a user gives Stax access, the app activates a screen reading functionality and acts as a web browser. USSD is still happening in the background but instead of presenting those USSD screens, Stax\u2019s SDK reads the USSD dialog, runs the functions and shows the user a familiar app interface.\n\nBut what are the risks? Because there is no way to convince a user that giving up control doesn\u2019t somehow make them a little vulnerable. Shorland says Stax only takes the information needed to enable the user complete their transaction.\n\n\u201cEverything happens client side, not on our servers. It\u2019s also what enables us to be offline,\u201d she says, emphasizing that the app is open-source as a sign of transparency.\n\nWho in Africa needs Stax?\n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of cool that Stax, a fintech app, works offline like regular USSD. But with the internet being more central to the digital and financial services space today, why should we cheer for Stax?\n\nHover CEO and co-founder Ben Lyon says they are \u201cbuilding for the world as it is today so that we can bridge it to where it ought to go.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, there were 159 million monthly active mobile money accounts in Africa, according to the GSM Association. Africa represents more than half of the global mobile money usage.\n\nLyon thinks such numbers and smartphone usage \u2013 expected to double to 678 million by the end of 2025 \u2013 will make USSD even more mainstream. \u201cIt is a standard view of the tech industry that USSD is a bygone thing. It is actually just categorically wrong.\u201d\n\nIf that view is wrong as he insists and if USSD\u2019s user experience needs to be modernised for the smartphone age, then solutions like Stax would seem right on time.\n\nStax wants the app to be under 10MB so that it will work easily on every (Android) phone. Average transaction time is supposed to be 12 seconds.\n\nMy airtime purchase this morning took a bit longer. It showed a transaction failure message at the end and my bank debited me two seconds later. But I got the airtime.\n\nStax is\u2026 a work in progress\n\nAs of today, Stax currently supports transactions for eight banks (Access, First, Guaranty, Keystone, Sterling, UBA, Wema, Zenith), OPay and Paga.\n\nBeing in the USSD business in Nigeria means getting into the CBN (banks) vs NCC (telcos) scuffle around who pays for USSD services. What does Hover think about this debate?\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that USSD is about accessibility and inclusion, I believe strongly that consumers should not pay to access the channel,\u201d Lyon says.\n\n\u201cI hope NCC and other players come around to this view that consumers should not pay.\u201d\n\nOutside of that and other potential headaches, Stax\u2019s focus will be on convincing individuals and businesses that the app is reliable for all seasons and geographies, regardless of internet connection, says Peace Itimi, who leads growth for the product.\n\n\u201cWe are not monetizing Stax yet and it\u2019s not on the near term roadmap to monetize it,\u201d Lyon says. \u201cThere is a WhatsApp sized opportunity here and our first priority is to make sure we can seize the opportunity at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBen also name-drops WeChat as a possible inspiration for monetization. With a large user base, Stax could begin enabling discovery and access to third party services, in what could make Stax a super app of sorts.\n\n\u201cWhen people understand what the product can do, they will fall in love with it,\u201d Itimi says.\n\nThat depends: on how they fix those curious accessibility permissions, and if people really feel the need to switch from basic USSD \u2013 which works okay \u2013 to a shinier, app-enabled life.",

          "text": "This might be it!\n\nFinally, a financial app that considers the lifestyle of regular people, the harsh economic situation in the country, and everyday financial challenges that influence how people borrow, save or invest.\n\nCan we pique your interest?\n\nLet\u2019s start with savings. Some of us have been saving from when we were kids and it was cool to have a piggybank. Beyond piggybanks and other traditional ways of saving like Esusu, it has become common to save with banks and almost everyone has a savings account. Some even have up to three. But what value do you get from those savings accounts or the Esusu contribution? How much interest do you earn from them in a month?. Probably nothing. In most cases, you even pay more on annoying charges. The good news is that savings has evolved. It\u2019s no longer enough to just keep money anywhere and call it savings. Financial apps like Branch, PiggyVest and Kuda have shown that your savings can be an investment which allows you to earn actual interest, no matter how small. People hardly have enough to money to meet their financial needs and this clearly influences the service features on majority of these financial apps.\n\nHowever, they all differ in the interest they offer on their platforms. If you\u2019re familiar with all the top ones, a quick research will show you that while several savings and investment apps offer sumptuous interest rates with up to 15% per annum being the highest, Branch sets the pace with 20% interest rate per annum. Branch is also the only financial app so far that offers flexible withdrawals, which means your money doesn\u2019t have to be locked for any minimum duration. Afterall, we save for rainy days, don\u2019t we? So if the rainy day comes you should have access to your money.\n\nAll the things your bank won\u2019t do.\n\nHere are a few more things that sets Branch apart from both your regular banking and other financial apps.\n\nAt your beck and call, for a cost: Trust your bank to be on top of their game when they send you notifications but obviously at a cost. Branch has no such thing as SMS alert fees.\n\nPay, to pay bills: Every month, you pay all sorts of bills like DSTV and PHCN on your regular financial apps and banking apps. But of course, it always comes at a cost \u2013 N100 here, N50 there. Some banks even say this cost is negligible, but everyone knows if you stack up enough N100 notes, you\u2019ll eventually have enough to do something that is not negligible. Again, with Branch, this service is free!\n\nTransfer fees: How many transfers have you made in the last month alone? How many did you make last year? If you add up all the charges you pay for making transfers in a month, you can at least buy airtime or data with it. If you add up all the cost for a year, who knows what you can buy with it. The point is, in the end, all these costs and charges add up to something. So if you can make unlimited transfers for free, why would you rather pay for it? Branch doesn\u2019t think you should pay for it though.\n\nAnybody home? \u2013 Customer service with most banks would leave a sour taste in your mouth. They will put you hold. They will tell you the problem can\u2019t be solved remotely and you should go to a branch near you. When you get to the bank branch, you\u2019ll be in a queue, then you\u2019ll fill forms. Finally, they\u2019ll tell you to go wait at home that it will be done in a few days. That doesn\u2019t happen with Branch. Branch customer service team is available 24/7 and all problems are resolved in-app.\n\nBonus programs: Most financial apps have some form of bonus program but none of them is like Branch. Branch has a second-generation referral system that makes referrals a win-win for all parties. Whereas other financial apps pay one-time bonuses for referrals, Branch pays you N500 when friends you refer pay up their first loan. The friends you invited also earn N500. In addition, you earn N50 for every deposit of N300 and above. How cool is that?\n\nThe money part: Branch gives you up to N500,000 in loans within seconds of applying on the app. No collateral or paperwork required. Start with small loan amounts and get higher amounts the more you repay.\n\nClearly, Branch offers you more flexibility and a lot more profit than other financial apps. So if you\u2019ve been suffering from poor financial services, it\u2019s time to make a switch. Branch can be downloaded on the Google Play Store",

We\u2019re excited to support Onyekachi, Michael and Ruke with their mission of connecting retailers to manufacturers with mentorship and guidance as they continue to grow as leaders and scale TradeDepot.\u201d, said Tosin Faniro-Dada, the Managing Director & CEO of Endeavor in Nigeria.\n\nEndeavor Entrepreneur candidates go through a rigorous selection process which culminates in an International Selection Panel (ISP) where candidates are vetted by trusted mentors, drawn from Endeavor\u2019s extensive network of over 4,000 mentors across the world. As part of the process, TradeDepot was presented at the 15th v-ISP and was successfully selected in a unanimous decision by the panelists as part of a cohort of 13 entrepreneurs from 9 markets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to welcome Kachi, Michael, and Ruke to the Endeavor Entrepreneur network! TradeDepot is solving a critical problem in the retail sector across Africa through its B2B e-commerce platform. The company has the potential to scale regionally and globally and to join the tech powerhouses catapulting Nigeria\u2019s entrepreneurial ecosystem into the world\u2019s view. The founders have demonstrated deep knowledge of the market; they also have great chemistry and an amazing co-founder relationship, having built several companies together over 20 years. We\u2019re excited to support them through their scale-up journey!\u201d said Linda Rottenberg, the CEO, and Co-founder of Endeavor.\n\nSince launching in 2016, TradeDepot has surpassed several milestones, raising a $3 million Series A in 2018 and a $10 million pre-Series B in 2020. \u201cMichael, Onyekachi and I see joining the Endeavor Network as a great opportunity to connect with a curated group of very talented founders and mentors in various countries across the world, and look forward to leveraging these connections as we continue to execute on our mission\u201d, said Ruke Awaritefe, the CBO and Co-founder of TradeDepot.\n\nAfrica\u2019s $1 trillion retail market is largely informal and offline, with over 90% of all sales happening in millions of small \u201cmom and pop\u201d stores. TradeDepot\u2019s mission is to consolidate this fragmented informal\n\nretail supply chain, connect the world\u2019s top consumer goods manufacturers to micro retailers on the streets of Africa\u2019s cities and support the informal retail sector with inventory financing to scale and grow. Today, TradeDepot, through its ShopTopUp platform, digitally and seamlessly plugs the gap in informal retail by providing flexible and affordable loans to its retailers to buy more goods at the best prices, scale their businesses and generate more revenue.\n\nAbout Endeavor\n\nEstablished in 1997, Endeavor is a mission-driven, global organization leading the high-impact entrepreneurship movement.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nBitnob is a Nigerian startup that lets users buy, save and invest in bitcoin. Users can access these features and much more through the mobile app that\u2019s available for Android iOS.\n\nBitnob offers a ton of other options, like loans, Dollar-Cost-Averaging plans, and many much more. At first glance, the Bitnob app feels fantastic, with a simple UI and easy-to-find functions. But how does it handle the functions that truly matter, like buying BTC and saving?\n\nWe\u2019re about to find out.\n\nGetting started with Bitnob\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the onboarding process\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a new account on Bitnob\n\nSetting up your Bitnob app begins with installing it from your app store. When you open it for the first time, you\u2019ll need to create an account. Unlike many other apps, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you just sign up with an email and get on with it.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll need to supply your first name and last name. Your first name will be used to create a username that\u2019s unique to you (more on the username later.)\n\nYou\u2019ll also provide your phone number and receive an OTP for verification. Once that\u2019s clear, you can create a secure password and five-number transaction pin.\n\nI love this part because the app makes you choose something secure and up to 8 characters. Once you have all this dialed-in, you can get to the fun part.\n\nDepositing money on Bitnob\n\nAs an app for savings and investment, I expected Bitnob\u2019s deposit system to be as simple as inputting debit card information. Unfortunately, I was wrong.\n\nIf you remember, the topic has been complicated in Nigeria since the CBN has ordered banks to close accounts of crypto traders back in February. To protect its users, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you buy BTC straight from your bank account.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll first buy a recharge voucher from Ovarr. One thing I love is that the cards are sold in bundles ranging from $10 to $500. This way, users can buy within their financial limits.\n\nTo buy the voucher, you have to fill in your user information and then pay using a debit card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter buying the voucher, you\u2019ll get a pin that you can paste into Bitnob to activate your purchase.\n\nSo while the process is slightly longer than I expected, it works all the same.\n\nWithdrawals on Bitnob\n\nWithdrawals aren\u2019t quite as tedious, and you can complete them in a few short steps.\n\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need to select \u2018withdraw\u2019 in the plan of your choice. You can withdraw to a BTC wallet or a USD wallet. To get cash in my local bank account, I had to first select a USD wallet and then send the cash to my local account.\n\nYou can send BTC to your blockchain wallet by selecting \u2018send\u2019 and pasting the BTC address in the provided field. You can also use the QR code scanner instead of pasting the BTC address.\n\nSending BTC to another user follows this same procedure. You simply paste their address or scan their Bitnob BTC wallet address.\n\nCustomization options\n\nYou can make changes to your Bitnob account through the \u2018account\u2019 icon. From here, you can change your name and user name, and fill in next of kin details,\n\nYou can also add your bank accounts and mobile money accounts here. I love that you get to choose between the two options.\n\nBitnob Features\n\nNow we get into the staple features of Bitnob\n\nAccessing loans\n\nBitnob offers Nobcredit, which is an awesome way for users to get quick cash while still HODLing their BTC. You can access Nobcredit from the app\u2019s home page, and the process is quite quick.\n\nThe loan amount you get depends on how much BTC you have as collateral. You can then pay back before the tenure expires to reclaim your BTC.\n\nYour interest rate is calculated based on your loan-to-value ratio, or the amount of collateral you have. Average rates are between 16 and 17.2%, and loan tenures range between 3 and 12 months.\n\nI love that you can check your interest rate and collateral volume using the in-app loan calculator. This makes sure that you have all the information you need before moving forward.\n\nPlans\n\nOne of Bitnob\u2019s main features is that you can create a savings plan for your BTC. You can name the plan, choose the amount you want to save in USD, and pick the frequency of savings. The available options are daily, weekly, and monthly.\n\nYou can also select a maximum duration for the lock. WIthdrawing before the maturity date will earn you a 3% penalty. The penalty is one more reason to keep saving.\n\nThe plans work based on the concept of Dollar-Cost-Averaging, which simply allows you to invest large sums over a period. The longer your investment tenure and the more often you make deposits, the bigger your overall portfolio.\n\nUnfortunately, you can only fund your plan with money from your USD wallet, which means you\u2019ll have to buy vouchers that cover your savings amount.\n\nUsers can create as many plans as they need, and adjust the deposit amount, frequency, and maturity date for a bigger payout.\n\nReferrals\n\nBitnob allows you to earn up to $1,000 via referrals alone. And it\u2019s quite easy to get started because you get a referral code immediately when you sign up. You can copy the code right from the home screen.\n\nWhen a new user signs up with your referral code, you get a small USD reward based on how much your referral deposits. I love the referral system because it\u2019s as easy as sending your code to whoever you invite.\n\nSecurity and Support\n\nHow does Bitnob handle security and customer care?\n\nReaching customer care\n\nHave you ever tried to reach customer care only to be kept on hold for an unreasonable amount of time? I loved that Bitnob went a different route by allowing you to live chat with customer care right in the app.\n\nI got a response within 2 minutes (I actually checked) of sending the message which was quite impressive. You can also access the FAQs section from within the app.\n\nSecurity features\n\nIf you have trouble remembering your passwords don\u2019t worry. Bitnob automatically activates fingerprint login for every user with a biometric-enabled device. If you\u2019d rather log in old school, you can turn this feature off in the accounts tab.\n\nOne cool but annoying security feature is that the app logs you out every time your screen goes to sleep. I found this quite irritating because I use the app a lot and I have to log in every few seconds.\n\nBut I also can\u2019t stay mad because it protects my BTC even more. Once my screen turns off, no one can access or even see my funds, which makes me feel good.\n\nOther standard security features also apply. For example, you can\u2019t change passwords unless you provide the old password.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nOverall, the Bitnob app delivers an impressive performance. My only reservation is the convoluted process associated with depositing. However, it\u2019s completely understandable given the current financial laws.\n\nBefore you go, I wanted to tell you one quirky thing I found about the app. It displays these short but interesting messages on the login page and your dashboard, and they really add character to the app. Two of my favourite are \u2018we care about you,\u2019 and \u2018my favorite human, cheer up.\u2019 Be sure to look out for these when you download the app.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

This way, users can buy within their financial limits.\n\nTo buy the voucher, you have to fill in your user information and then pay using a debit card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter buying the voucher, you\u2019ll get a pin that you can paste into Bitnob to activate your purchase.\n\nSo while the process is slightly longer than I expected, it works all the same.\n\nWithdrawals on Bitnob\n\nWithdrawals aren\u2019t quite as tedious, and you can complete them in a few short steps.\n\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need to select \u2018withdraw\u2019 in the plan of your choice. You can withdraw to a BTC wallet or a USD wallet. To get cash in my local bank account, I had to first select a USD wallet and then send the cash to my local account.\n\nYou can send BTC to your blockchain wallet by selecting \u2018send\u2019 and pasting the BTC address in the provided field. You can also use the QR code scanner instead of pasting the BTC address.\n\nSending BTC to another user follows this same procedure. You simply paste their address or scan their Bitnob BTC wallet address.\n\nCustomization options\n\nYou can make changes to your Bitnob account through the \u2018account\u2019 icon. From here, you can change your name and user name, and fill in next of kin details,\n\nYou can also add your bank accounts and mobile money accounts here. I love that you get to choose between the two options.\n\nBitnob Features\n\nNow we get into the staple features of Bitnob\n\nAccessing loans\n\nBitnob offers Nobcredit, which is an awesome way for users to get quick cash while still HODLing their BTC. You can access Nobcredit from the app\u2019s home page, and the process is quite quick.\n\nThe loan amount you get depends on how much BTC you have as collateral. You can then pay back before the tenure expires to reclaim your BTC.\n\nYour interest rate is calculated based on your loan-to-value ratio, or the amount of collateral you have. Average rates are between 16 and 17.2%, and loan tenures range between 3 and 12 months.\n\nI love that you can check your interest rate and collateral volume using the in-app loan calculator. This makes sure that you have all the information you need before moving forward.\n\nPlans\n\nOne of Bitnob\u2019s main features is that you can create a savings plan for your BTC. You can name the plan, choose the amount you want to save in USD, and pick the frequency of savings. The available options are daily, weekly, and monthly.\n\nYou can also select a maximum duration for the lock. WIthdrawing before the maturity date will earn you a 3% penalty. The penalty is one more reason to keep saving.\n\nThe plans work based on the concept of Dollar-Cost-Averaging, which simply allows you to invest large sums over a period. The longer your investment tenure and the more often you make deposits, the bigger your overall portfolio.\n\nUnfortunately, you can only fund your plan with money from your USD wallet, which means you\u2019ll have to buy vouchers that cover your savings amount.\n\nUsers can create as many plans as they need, and adjust the deposit amount, frequency, and maturity date for a bigger payout.\n\nReferrals\n\nBitnob allows you to earn up to $1,000 via referrals alone. And it\u2019s quite easy to get started because you get a referral code immediately when you sign up. You can copy the code right from the home screen.\n\nWhen a new user signs up with your referral code, you get a small USD reward based on how much your referral deposits. I love the referral system because it\u2019s as easy as sending your code to whoever you invite.\n\nSecurity and Support\n\nHow does Bitnob handle security and customer care?\n\nReaching customer care\n\nHave you ever tried to reach customer care only to be kept on hold for an unreasonable amount of time? I loved that Bitnob went a different route by allowing you to live chat with customer care right in the app.\n\nI got a response within 2 minutes (I actually checked) of sending the message which was quite impressive. You can also access the FAQs section from within the app.\n\nSecurity features\n\nIf you have trouble remembering your passwords don\u2019t worry. Bitnob automatically activates fingerprint login for every user with a biometric-enabled device. If you\u2019d rather log in old school, you can turn this feature off in the accounts tab.\n\nOne cool but annoying security feature is that the app logs you out every time your screen goes to sleep. I found this quite irritating because I use the app a lot and I have to log in every few seconds.\n\nBut I also can\u2019t stay mad because it protects my BTC even more. Once my screen turns off, no one can access or even see my funds, which makes me feel good.\n\nOther standard security features also apply. For example, you can\u2019t change passwords unless you provide the old password.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nOverall, the Bitnob app delivers an impressive performance. My only reservation is the convoluted process associated with depositing. However, it\u2019s completely understandable given the current financial laws.\n\nBefore you go, I wanted to tell you one quirky thing I found about the app. It displays these short but interesting messages on the login page and your dashboard, and they really add character to the app. Two of my favourite are \u2018we care about you,\u2019 and \u2018my favorite human, cheer up.\u2019 Be sure to look out for these when you download the app.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "Does the Nigerian government want safety or surveillance with its new IMEI policy?",
          "text": "From July 2021, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) will require Nigerians to submit their IMEI numbers to a Centralised Equipment Identity Register.\n\nIn May 2021, the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy released a Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Registration (PDF) that requires Nigerians to submit their IMEI numbers to a Centralized Equipment Identity Register (CEIR), otherwise known as Device Management System (DMS), which the NCC would manage.\n\nSome of the reasons given for the Ministry\u2019s action include curtailing the counterfeit mobile phone market, discouraging mobile phone theft, enhancing national security, protecting consumer interest, increasing revenue generation for the government, reducing the rate of kidnapping, mitigating the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitating the blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices.\n\nThis move follows the Nigerian government\u2019s previous initiatives for digital identities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecall that in December 2020, the Nigerian government released a statement mandating all Nigerians to obtain their National Identification Number (NIN). Predictably, there was a rush as Nigerians all over the country attempted to get their NIN before the deadline at the end of 2020.\n\nThe directive caused a massive uproar among Nigerians because it was given in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic. Perhaps as a result of that, the deadline was moved to February 2021. Since then, it has been moved thrice, with the new deadline now June 30, 2021.\n\nThe NCC\u2019s IMEI policy will definitely have major implications for the entire nation if implemented.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nThe International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique number used to identify a mobile phone. It is usually found inside the battery compartment of most phones but can also be gotten by dialling *#06#. With an IMEI number, a phone can be tracked, but more than that, it can also be used for identity theft and even cloning a phone.\n\nEver since the news broke, there has been an understandable outcry, with IMEI and Isa Pantami trending on Twitter.\n\nHowever, while the government requires Nigerians to share this data, they do not have to, as your IMEI is part of the data transmitted to your network operator as soon as you make a call, use data, or send a text.\n\nThis information is rarely ever used beyond providing the details that your phone needs to work. However, security operatives can use it in the case of theft or while tracking terrorist activity.\n\nA few countries, including Azerbaijan, India, Cambodia, Chile, Columbia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Thailand, Turkey, and Lebanon, already have some form of this database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf a phone owner possesses their IMEI number, they could provide law enforcement agencies with this information to track these phones if they are stolen.\n\nWhile the reasons given by the government for this new policy appear genuine at first glance, Nigerians are bothered about the possible ways the government can exploit this data.\n\nAn article on The Insider details how the Saudi government uses IMEI numbers to track the location of women who have run away from abusive partners. Most of the doubts expressed regarding the use of this information for surveillance.\n\nIt has not always been used negatively. The ITU reports that implementing this in Great Britain and Turkey resulted in a reduction in mobile phone theft while it increased the number of legally imported mobile devices in Ukraine by 95%, as well as increasing revenues from the import of mobile devices\n\nAccording to a data privacy expert, some of the questions that should be asked include whether there are sufficient safeguards in the absence of a comprehensive data protection law. Also, is the government going to be transparent about its use of this data and what happens in the case of a violation?\n\nOne must remember that with the government mandating Nigerians to link their SIM cards to the NIN, the government already has rich insights into the activities of its citizens. Adding IMEI data to this would mean that they can also get real-time location data on anyone.\n\nWith Nigeria\u2019s poor human rights history, Nigerians may be right to be suspicious about the motives behind this policy.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

We are not yet in perfect condition, but I believe it is something that can be improved upon. I believe we are all very proud of them, we hope that they will deliver more so that the nation will be a better place\u201d, he said.\n\nThe accountant-general of the federation, Ahmed Idris, in his remarks applauded BusinessDay for recognising rewarding hardworking public servants in the country, noting it is an indication that the work being done by the recipients and others like them in government are being noticed.\n\n\u201cThe BusinessDay event is an award to deserving public servants. I salute the courage in sustaining the award in the past four years. It is gratifying that the basis for which selection is made for this award is success. This award is proof that the government is performing. If someone comes to the public sector and singles out one for award, the government is the one that takes the credit, \u201che said.\n\nIdris disclosed that the Federal Government has introduced measures for greater transparency and accountability in the public financial system:\n\n\u201cIt has brought about sanity generally in the conduct of public officers particularly in managing public finances. Furthermore, in an effort to ensure maximum revenue generation, and accurate remittance the Federal Government has approved the posting of treasury directors to some key federal institutions, eventually we will extend this posting of revenue directors to all agencies of government. Presently, the government has taken the financial transparency and accountability campaign to a higher level by inaugurating the Auto Treasury Portal to give Nigerians access to financial transactions of MDAs. The essence of this is to be more open,\u201d Idris said.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Ogho Okiti, managing director of BusinessDay Media, said the winners emerged through a meticulous process that took into consideration all parameters sufficient to measure the progress and contributions of ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs).\n\nHe added that the selection criteria were predominately based on what the awardees have achieved under their watch over the last year, which included but not limited to the introduction of new and innovative methodologies of service delivery and implementation of strategies that have wide-reaching impacts on the sectors they operate in and the economy in general.\n\nOkiti, while noting that the operations of MDAs in the public sector are interrelated, said BusinessDay adopted globally acceptable metrics in recognising those that have performed exceedingly well over the last one year as demonstrated in their contributions to the development of the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, we converged here today to reward, recognise and celebrate some distinguished ministers, heads of departments and agencies for their selfless, laudable services to the nation while executing the mandates of their individual institutions\u201d, the MD said.\n\n\u201cIt was not an easy task arriving at the list of winners, in view of the fact that the Nigeria\u2019s public sector is quite large and the incredible performances of the MDAs are significant. Notwithstanding, in this year\u2019s edition, the Award Committee painstakingly selected the winners,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "The relative calm in Warri town and OdeItsekiri (the ancestral home of the ethnic nationality) as Prince Tsola Emiko, the Oludesignate goes into \u201cIdeniken\u201d (seclusion) preparatory to ascending the throne of the kingdom can be likened to the peace of the graveyard.\n\nWhat has made this matter worse, according to most indigenes of Warri, is the silence of prominent Itsekiri sons and daughters all over the world, who seem to be watching developments keenly.\n\nHowever, one of the Itsekiri senior chiefs, who is also one of the kingmakers Chief Yayah Pessu, the Ojomo of Warri, alongside other concerned persons in the kingdom, are presently making frantic efforts to bring all the warring factions to the negotiations table before matters get out of control.\n\nSources said these efforts have been deliberately frustrated by one of the factions in the crisis as they have refused to cooperate with Chief Pessu\u2019s group. Chief Johnson Atserunleghe, the Iyatsere of Warri Kingdom and his group have allegedly refused to attend the peace initiatives, which took place in the residence of Chief Pessu, in the oil city on Friday, 14th May, 2021.\n\nAnd they have so far refused to give reasons why they were not present in the peace meeting, after they had earlier agreed to attend. However, the following persons were said to have attended the peace meeting according to Palace Watch sources: Chief Ayiri Emami, the suspended Ologbotsere of Warri Kingdom; Chief Macgrew Richmond, Mr. David Iwere (the young man, who led the Itsekiri youths protest on May 7, 2021 at the Nigerian Police Zone 5 Headquarters in Benin City): Chief Thomas Ereyitomi (a representative of one of the constituencies in Warri at the National Assembly in Abuja); Chief Isaac Jemide (another kingmaker, who is the Oshodi of Warri Kingdom; Chief Kent Omatsone (former Speaker, Delta State House of Assembly); Chief S.E. Mene (an educationist); Chief Omawuli Akulagba and Pa. Chief Akoma Dudu, one of the oldest men in the Ginuwa ruling house, who was supposed to be the Regent under the present dispensation.\n\nThe Secretary to the Itsekiri Leaders of Thought and five other members were at the meeting. He was said to have apologized to the house that his leader could not attend the meeting because of other pressing issues. Chief Atserunleghe and his group, which is made up of Prince Emmanuel Okotie-Eboh (the present Regent); Prince Yemi Emiko and others, especially representatives of the Ginuwa ruling house, who are major factor in the Warri crisis were conspicuously absent at the meeting.\n\nA chief in the Warri Palace, who was at the meeting but did not want his name mentioned, expressed disgust at the behavior of most members of this faction, saying: \u201cit sad and depressing, that these people have again refused to show up in this peace meeting.\n\nThese people needed to be here, if the present peace initiative is ever to succeed.\u201d Palace Watch heard that the absence of the Iyatsere group angered many members of the Ologbotsere faction, who travelled from very long distances to attend the peace meeting in Warri.\n\nAccording to our source, Chief Pessu, the Ojomo of Warri Kingdom at whose instance the peace meeting was called, was said to have made the following remarks, after the opening prayers at the meeting: \u201cI am motivated to call this particular peace meeting because of three major reasons.\n\n1- How to find an enduring peace in the kingdom, as the present development in the Warri nation since this crisis broke out, has not in any way helped our image as a people. It is therefore, commonsense that we cannot all fold our hands and watch while things continually degenerate the way and manner they are going.\n\n2- The meeting is also called to see how the missing crown, which is the symbol of the Itsekiri people is found and returned to the Warri Palace immediately.\n\n3 \u2013 As a Chief in Warri Palace, I was scandalized by a particular incident that happened at the Nigerian Police Zone 5 Headquarters in Benin City, the last time I went there.\n\nA statement made by one of the police officers, who is handling the Warri crisis at the Nigerian Police, Zonal Headquarters in Benin City, set me thinking seriously on how to get this matter resolved once and for all.\n\nOne of the Police officers, mockingly asked me, \u201cIf you people, the Warri Chiefs claim that it was the Ifa-Oracle that assisted you people as Warri Chiefs to arrive at the selection of Prince Tsola Emiko as the new Olu of Warri designate, why did the same Ifa, not help the warring Chiefs to locate the missing crown?\u201d\n\nIt was at this point, it dawned on me, that we should all immediately do, all within our powers to get this matter resolved once and for all, as no external body, will come and help us resolve our differences.\n\nHence this meeting.\u201d After his remarks, Chief Ayiri Emami, the suspended Ologbotsere of Warri Kingdom, who was present at the meeting, was said to have calmly asked Chief Pessu, why Chief Johnson Atserunleghe, the Iyatsere of Warri Kingdom and his group, especially Prince Emmanuel Okotie-Eboh, who is the present Regent and Prince Yemi Emiko, who are the moving forces behind the Iyatsere group, absent at the meeting?\n\nWas it that, you did not invite them to this meeting?\u201d Chief Emami then stressed, \u201cChief Pessu, if you really want to make peace you would have made sure the Iyatsere group, who are the aggressors in this crisis, are present at this meeting.\u201d\n\nChief Pessu, was said to have told the gathering, that he made efforts to reach the persons in question, and that they had promised to be present at the peace meeting. A furious Chief Macgrew Richmond was said to have told the gathering that he was present at the meeting because of his personal respect for Chief Pessu.\n\nHe then went ahead to question, \u201cwhy should I be invited to a meeting where the missing Warri crown is to be discussed?\n\nAgreed, I am a Chief in the Warri Palace, but I am not a member of the royal family and I don\u2019t even know, where any of these missing items are kept in the palace. I have never had access to such places in the Warri Palace.\n\nAs we all gather here, members of my immediate and larger families have been embarrassed continually over this missing crown, which I knew nothing about. My life has been threatened over this matter unreasonably.\n\nOn the 26th of May, 2021, is supposed to be the 30th anniversary of my marriage, and as a matter of practice over the years, I\u2019m always present in London with members of my immediate family to mark the day.\n\nBut sadly, I can\u2019t attend this year\u2019s celebration and can\u2019t attend to my immediate family needs, because of this matter.\n\nIf for any reason, I decide now to travel out of Nigeria although, I am granted bail by the Nigerian police on self-recognition, it will be misconstrued or rumored all over the place, that I have either jumped bail or gone to hide the missing crown, which I know absolutely nothing about its whereabouts.\n\nAnd as such, I\u2019m stuck here in Nigeria and can\u2019t move around and go about my daily businesses as I would have wanted to. But if invariably, the missing crown is eventually found and after the new Olu would have been installed, I will go to court to clear my name, as I can\u2019t just be called a thief, and I will allow the matter to go just like that.\u201d\n\nAfter a heated debate, and in an effort to calm Chief Emami and others down, the peace committee agreed to reach out to the Ginuwa Ruling House, especially Prince Emmanuel Okotie-Eboh, the present Regent to do a letter withdrawing Chief Ayiri Emami\u2019s purported suspension as Ologbotsere, as this move is likely to give room for further peace negotiation.\n\nChief Emami was said to have bluntly declined the proposal, saying \u201cthe Ginuwa Ruling House, has no powers to suspend me as Ologbotsere in the first instance, and why should I accept a letter from Okotie-Eboh to that effect? Secondly, this illegality called suspension, was carried out before he Emmanuel Okotie-Eboh, ever became the regent.\u201d\n\nThe former Speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly.was said, to have called for caution, and explained the implications of not finding the missing crown before a new Olu of Warri is crowned.\n\nHe was said to have told the gathering that in 2016, some months after the immediate past Olu of Warri, HRM Ogiame Ikenwoli, was crowned, the then Delta State Government refused to give him his due recognition as the Olu of Warri.\n\nAs alleged then, that Ogiame Ikenwoli was not given a staff of office by the state government, hence its refusal to give Ogieme Ikenwoli all his dues and recognition. It thus, took the Warri Palace quite some time to convince the Delta State Government that Olu of Warri does not take staff of office from the state government, as the symbol of Oluship in Warri kingdom is the crown, which is now missing.\n\nThe former speaker was said, to have wondered aloud, asking, if the present Olu of Warri is to be crowned, what will the Itsekiri people use to crown him as the Olu of Warri Kingdom?\n\nSince the symbol of the Itsekiri throne, the crown is now missing, he, therefore, appealed to all the people present at the meeting to join hands with all other concerned people to locate the missing crown.\n\nThe peace meeting also unanimously agreed, that Chief Atserunleghe, the Iyatsere of Warri Kingdom and his group, who are presently behaving as people who have conquered a territory, should be advised to thread softly and be open to all peace initiatives in the general interest of the Warri people.\n\nREAD ALSO: \u201cMy Mentor\u201d-Singer, Falz showers encomium on Father, Femi Falana as he turns 62\n\nThe peace meeting further agreed, that all efforts should be made, to ensure that the 1979 edict which stipulates every steps that should be followed before an Olu of Warri is crowned, is followed to the letter, as the Delta State government will later ask, after the new Olu of Warri would have been crowned, whether or not the Warri King Makers followed the laid down rules, if yes, the Attorney-General of Delta State will be demanding for evidence to this effect.\n\nPalace Watch contacted Chief Yayah Pessu, to find out how the peace meeting went, and why the iyatsere and his group did not turn up for the meeting.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have made some significant progress, even though Chief Atserunleghe, the Iyatsere of Warri Kingdom and his group were unable to attend the meeting.\n\nWe are, however, confident and certain they will show up in our next meeting, which will hold very soon.\n\nIn the interim, we are reaching out to all concerned in this matter individually, and their responses have been quite encouraging, which is an indication that the much sought-after peace will be achieved any moment from now.\u201d\n\nPalace Watch made efforts to reach, the Chief Atserunleghe, the Iyatsere of Warri Kingdom, and Prince Yemi Emiko on this matter, but these efforts were not successful as they refused to pick the calls.",

          "text": "A leaked audio tape has disclosed one of the moments when Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State schemed with his officials to frustrate the Nigeria Labour Congress protesters and \u201cneutralise them.\u201d\n\nThe 16-minute audio tape, obtained was believably captured on Tuesday by one of El-Rufai\u2019s kitchen cabinet members.\n\nThe audio captured the governor\u2019s anger with the NLC.\n\nEl-Rufai and other voices in the tape were caught implying that the NLC leaders first camped in Kano State before they reached Kaduna and were mobilised from there by the Kano State government, making a hidden citation to Governor Abdullahi Ganduje\u2019s officials.\n\nAlso in the tape, the governor was also clued in on the activities of alleged hired thugs and the plan to disturb the peaceful protest on Wednesday and he was excited about the development.\n\nThey also examined the police personnel whom they accused of giving protection to the NLC protesters and not siding with the state government.\n\n\u201cWe pray they come out tomorrow, let them come out. We will mobilise,\u201d one of those with him said.\n\nAnswering a phone call believably from the Minister of Transportation. Rotimi Amaechi, as captured in the tape, the governor said, \u201cOh Amaechi, excellency, how now? Oga sir, how are you doing? Hello, can you hear me?\n\n\u201cOga sir, I may not be able to come today because I still have a situation on my hands. I think we will have neutralised them by tomorrow or next. I don\u2019t know whether you are still in town.\n\n\u201cGive me today and tomorrow. Let\u2019s plan for Thursday evening. Thursday afternoon, we will be in economic summit. It will be virtual but I will be busy. Thuraday evening will be fine.\n\n\u201cPoliticians\u2026nobody wants to confront the unions. I am the only North politician in Nigeria. This whole thing is being financed. They came from Kano right? They brought aides from Kano. They went to Kano.\u201d\n\nHe also accused an unnamed governor of providing mobilisation funds for the NLC to destabilise the northwestern state.\n\nWorkers in the state workers had on Monday begun a five-day strike over El-Rufai administration\u2019s retrenchment of 45,000 workers and his alleged anti-labour policies.\n\nWhile addressing fellow governors at the meeting, he said, \u201cI would like to inform the forum that one of our colleagues, a state governor actually gave the NLC money to come to Kaduna to do this because people think everything is politics. This is not politics. This is a monster that will consume all of us. It will not consume Kaduna I\u2019m confident of that.\u201d\n\nWhen reminded that the NGF issued a statement from the office of the chairman on the subject, El-Rufai replied, \u201cThat press release with the greatest respect was unhelpful. It was unhelpful. It said nothing. It was trying to play both sides.\u201d\n\nIt was reported Tuesday that hoodlums reportedly loyal to El-Rufai disturbed the peaceful protest embarked upon by the NLC in Kaduna State.\n\nThe governor in a tweet had earlier said the labour union leaders were declared wanted for \u201ceconomic sabotage and attacks on public infrastructure under Miscellaneous Offences Act.\u201d\n\nHe said there would be a \u201chandsome reward\u201d for anyone who knows the whereabouts of the union leaders.\n\nA source said while the protest was going on in Kaduna on Tuesday, some suspected thugs in different vehicles, started stoning the protesters.\n\nThe NLC later on Thursday ended the five-day warning strike.",

          "title": "Reducing governance cost: Whither Oronsaye report?",
          "text": "\u2026It forces FG to borrow ceaselessly \u2013 ICIR, \u2026Cut estacode \u2013 Odinkalu, \u2018\u2026Govt should downsize lawmakers, MDAs\u2019, \u2026 Restructuring the way out \u2013 Expert\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the governments at all levels in the country cannot meet their obligations, and this has been blamed on the present high cost of governance. Worried by the declining fortunes from oil revenue, the administration of the late Musa Yar\u2019Adua found it difficult to meet its obligations. ELEOJO IDACHABA in this report takes a look at the Steve Oronsaye report and wonders if it could be revisited.\n\nAfter his death, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan inherited a heavy burden of which necessity was placed on that administration to devise a way of cutting down running costs with a view to meeting other obligations. This led to the inauguration of a Presidential Committee on Restructuring and Rationalisation of federal government parastatal, commissions and agencies under the chairmanship of a public service technocrat, Steve Orosanye, to prune and abolish certain institutions whose functions appear similar.\n\nAlthough the Committee finished the work and submitted its report, 10 years later, the government is still crying foul on account of the high cost of governance. The 800-page document otherwise known as the Oronsaye report contained far-reaching recommendations that, if implemented, would help to address the high cost of governance in the country. In all, it identified 929 MDAs, parastatal, commissions as well as agencies, but recommended that 38 agencies be abolished and 14 reversed to departments in a ministry.\n\nThe debate\n\nRecently, the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, said at a policy dialogue on \u2018Corruption and Cost of Governance in Nigeria,\u2019 organised by the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) that the government had initiated a number of programmes aimed at cutting the cost of governance in the face of dwindling revenue.\n\nShe said President Muhammadu Buhari had directed the Salaries and Wages Committee to review the payroll of public servants.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cMr. President has directed that the salaries committee that I chair work together with the Head of Service of the Federation and other members of the committee to review the government pay rolls in terms of stepping down on cost.\u201d\n\nAhmed said the measures were aimed at reducing recurrent expenditure, projected to gulp N5.6 trillion, about 41.5 per cent of the N13.5 trillion budgeted by the government for the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nShe had during the 2020-2022 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and Fiscal Strategy Paper (FSP) revealed that there would be a spike in personnel cost (including pensions cost) from N2.45 trillion in 2019 to over N3.4 trillion in 2020 due to the Nigerian government\u2019s decision to create five new ministries.\n\nAs at the time she was speaking, it was reported that the additional personnel cost arising from the creation of the new ministries was not factored in the implementation of the New Minimum Wage.\n\nThe development prompted a series of reactions from stakeholders who blamed the government for what they called its ineptitude towards reducing the cost of governance, but has resorted to borrowing and anytime loan facilities are not available, they said the Buhari administration would contemplate downsizing the workforce or rationalise salary payments.\n\nPDP\u2019s take\n\nIn its reaction, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in a statement by its publicity secretary, Kola Ologbodiyan, described stated that it was wicked and completely unacceptable that the ruling party would rather choose to go after workers\u2019 salaries even after APC had already increased the heavy burden it placed on Nigerians through the high cost of fuel, electricity, food and other essential commodities that have gone far beyond the reach of many Nigerians.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cRather than impose more hardship on our workers, the APC and its administration should realign the budget by removing their padded figures as well as end the exposed looting in the integrated payment system where trillions of naira are being siphoned through non-existent workers and overheads.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the APC and its administration should return the over N15 trillion stolen from various agencies of the government and channel the same to governance.\u201d\n\nAPC\u2019s response\n\nOn its part, the APC speaking through its national secretary, APC Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), John Akpanudoedehe, said the federal government has no plans to slash salaries of civil servants as alleged by PDP.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe PDP is up to its comical tales on what it terms intelligence at its disposal to slash the salaries of workers in the country; clearly only the PDP believes its tales. We are proud of our credentials as a truly progressive and people-centred political party.\u201d\n\nWhile all of these were going on, the Kaduna state government fired over 4,000 employees on its payroll on the grounds that it can no longer pay the New Minimum Wage and this development led to the ongoing strike in the state. Also, Imo, Ekiti and other state governments have since indicated that they can no longer pay the New Minimum Wage.\n\nThe ICIR view\n\nIn its take, the International Centre for Investigative Report (ICIR) noted that, \u201cHigh cost of governance is forcing the Nigerian government into borrowing money to finance budget deficits and also to fund capital projects. But the cost of servicing the loans has taken a huge toll on the economy.\u201d\n\nICIR noted that despite the dwindling revenue challenges, political office holders are still among the highest paid in the world. For instance, the president and his deputy earn N3.5 million and N3.03 million respectively as basic salaries, per annum, according to available records from the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC).\n\nAlso, the annual basic salary of a minister is put at N2.02 million; minister of state, N1.95 million; special adviser, N1.94 million; governor, N2.22 million; deputy governor, N2.11 million; and commissioner, N1.33 million.\n\nIn addition to the basic salary, the president is entitled to allowances such as hardship allowance \u2013 50 per cent of his salary, about N1.757 million, and consistency allowance \u2013 250 per cent of his salary, which is about N8.79 million.\n\nThe president\u2019s gratuity, it noted, is 300 per cent of his salary, amounting to N10, 544,115 and he is also entitled to a leave allowance of 10 per cent of his salary as well as a vehicle loan which amounts to 400 per cent of basic salary. This also applies to the vice president, lawmakers and other senior public servants.\n\nExperts\u2019 take\n\nReacting, Barrister Edward Omaga, a human rights lawyer, anti-corruption crusader and chairman, Board of Trustees/president of Global Integrity Crusade Network (GICN), said \u201crestructuring the country is the only panacea to reducing cost of governance.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe ongoing debate about how best Nigeria can considerably reduce the cost of governance is timely and justifiable. It is however important to point out that the economy is crumbling and certain drastic measures must be adopted by those in authority to salvage the situation.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, restructuring is the answer to our hydra-headed economic challenges at the moment. We hear recently that Kaduna is on a collision course with labour over sacked workers because the governor claimed that he no longer pays salaries. The story is the same in other states like Benue, Ekiti and Imo who have piles of unpaid salaries and pensions. While this is happening to poor civil servants, it is rather surprising to note that heads of ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) and politicians continue to take jumbo salaries and allowances which, to say the least, are outrageous. One then begins to wonder where lies the justification for failing to pay workers.\n\n\u201cMy position on how best to reduce the cost of governance is clear and simple. It is high time the president on whom lays enormous powers under the 1999 Constitution (as amended) take positive steps to implement the excellently drafted Steve Oronsaye report.\n\n\u201cAs it is, nothing stops Mr. President from coming up with an Executive Order for implementation of the Oronsaye report. Our Coalition of Civil Society Organisations had written to him before now on this same matter, but no action was taken. When I talk about restructuring, I mean changes in fiscal policies, not creation of more states or regions. I can authoritatively say that the solutions to our national malaise and challenges are with our leaders, but they have failed to tackle them headlong in order to protect their primordial interests.\u201d\n\nPolitical will\n\nOn his part, a public affairs analyst and executive director, OJA Consult, Jide Ojo, noted that there is simply lack of political will on the part of the Buhari administration to save the cost of running the government.\n\n\u201cA lot of things are done that may be politically expedient but economically suicidal. For instance, why did President Muhammadu Buhari increase the number of his ministers from about 37 in his first tenure (2015 \u2013 2019) to 43 members in his second tenure? Why has he not deemed it fit to reduce the number of aircrafts in his Presidential Air Fleet from the current six or thereabout to just two or three?\u201d\n\nHe said all the trillions of unremitted revenues by the government-owned enterprises should have warranted stiff punishments.\n\n\u201cThe Auditor General Report of 2017 which indicted several heads of ministries, departments and agencies should have warranted stiff penalties. The country shouldn\u2019t be witnessing budget padding, the kind of which BudgIT revealed about the 2021 budget where an estimated 316 duplicated items in the budget amounting to over N39 billion was found.\n\n\u201cI learnt the president had asked the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and the Head of Civil Service of the Federation to implement the White Paper on the Oronsaye report since April 2020; ironically more than a year after, nothing has been done. In any event, I have issues with the report which is that only about 10 per cent of the recommendations were approved for implementation. Aside from that, since 10 years now when that report was first submitted several other ministries, agencies and departments have been created and still being created. That report should have been updated and thereafter promptly implemented.\u201d\n\nOn the way out, he said, \u201cThere is a need for the president to sponsor an executive bill for amendment of the Constitution. Section 147 (3) which asks the president to appoint at least an indigene of a state as a minister should have been amended to ensure that we have only two ministers per geo-political zones. After all, the United States of America with over 300 million population has only 15 secretaries equivalent to our own ministers. We can also tinker with the Constitution to reduce the number of senators representing each state to two instead of three. We should also reduce the number of members of the House of Representatives from 360 to 240. Also, the state assembly should have only a member representing each local government instead of the current arrangement.\u201d\n\nEx-rights commission\u2019s boss\u2019 reaction\n\nIn his reaction, a professor of Law and former chairman, National Human Rights Commission, Prof. Chidi Odinkalu, \u201cLife in high level political leadership is really about Arithmetic and calculus. This administration failed woefully as if ill-equipped for leadership.\n\nPresident Buhari should have known that the cost of governance was unsustainable when he emerged in 2015, and with the political will he had then, he should have set about re-shaping governance as a priority.\n\n\u201cThe groundwork was already laid before he came, but instead, he saw governance as sadaka for his inner coterie and vengeance against the people he defined as \u20185%.\u2019 As a result, instead of fiscal consolidation, we had a snowballing of the cost of governance and of corruption too.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s debt to GDP ratio has risen by about 12 percentage points in two years. The profile doesn\u2019t look good. We are in sovereign insolvency territory. It was just a matter of getting on with the Oronsaye report which had the recommendations. Buhari had the political will in 2015 to implement it, now he no longer has it.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, laying off workers doesn\u2019t necessarily raise revenue; instead, it costs the government revenue in taxes because for most states, the only assured tax is PAYE which comes back to the government.\n\nOn the way out of the development, he said, \u201cThe biggest line item in most budgets is travel; this is because most establishments use estacode to supplement salaries. People get paid for trips not made and there are no reports or deliverables either. So, cutting down travel and estacode would be more sensible.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "Japan has expanded a coronavirus state of emergency hours in an effort to contain a worrying surge in infections nine weeks ahead of the opening of the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s no forced lockdown, the state of emergency allows prefectural governors to demand that shops and public establishments close or shorten their hours. It has expanded from the hotspots of Osaka and Tokyo in late April to other regions earlier this month, currently covering 42% of Japan\u2019s population.\n\nOn Friday, the government announced a decision to add Okinawa, a southern archipelago that hosts most of the US military forces stationed in Japan, starting Sunday.\n\nAs the government pushes to host the Olympics in July, virus containment is essential to warding off mounting public worry about the safety of the event. Recent polls have found that more than 80% of Japanese oppose hosting the Summer Games.\n\nEarlier Friday, Japan approved the production and use of Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines. Health Minister Norihisa Tamura said the two vaccines will help speed up inoculations. Japan has administered one or more vaccine doses to roughly 5 million people, or just 4% of the population, using the Pfizer shots that were approved in February.\n\nA quicker vaccine rollout is seen as key to Japan\u2019s ability to contain a worsening spread of the coronavirus. More than half of Japan\u2019s roughly 12,000 COVID-19 deaths have happened since February. The number of COVID-19 patients in serious condition hit a record high this week.\n\nPrime Minister Yoshihide Suga has pledged to finish vaccinating the country\u2019s roughly 36 million elderly population by the end of July, when the Games are to be held. However, a government survey of 1,741 municipalities released last week found around 15% will not be able to meet the deadline.\n\nFollowing local vaccine rollouts at cities and towns across the country, the government on Monday will open mass-vaccination sites in two of the country\u2019s biggest metropolitan areas, Tokyo and Osaka, with the goal of administering the shots to up to 15,000 elderly people a day. The sites will use the Moderna shots.\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s vaccines will not be distributed to public vaccination sites anytime soon, the health ministry said upon approval. Because of reports of rare blood clots, the regulatory body will continue to examine the risks and usage guidelines.",

          "text": "Seven people have died after a powerful roadside bomb went off near a vehicle carrying a local leader of an Islamist political party in southwestern Pakistan.\n\nLocal police chief Abdul Bashir said the attack took place when Abdul Qadir, a local leader of a faction of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam party, was on his way to attend a pro-Palestinian rally. Along with the seven killed, at least 15 people were wounded, he said.\n\nNo one claimed responsibility for the attack and police said they were still investigating. Liaquat Shahwani, a Baluchistan government spokesman, condemned the bombing.\n\nHours later, responding to calls from the Jamaat-e-Islami party, thousands of Islamists and members of civil society groups rallied in the capital, Islamabad, in support of Palestinians. Similar anti-Israel rallies were also held in other main cities across Pakistan, which is among few countries with no diplomatic ties with Israel.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi welcomed a cease-fire between Israel and the Hamas militant group that rules the Gaza Strip.\n\nQuetta is the capital of Baluchistan, where security forces in Baluchistan have been battling an insurgency for more than a decade by separatists demanding autonomy or a higher share of the province\u2019s gas and mineral resources. Pakistani Taliban and other militants also have a presence in the province.",
