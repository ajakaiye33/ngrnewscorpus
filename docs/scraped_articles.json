          "text": "The National Judicial Council has appointed nine Heads of Court and 54 judges for 16 states. Also, the council has barred three erring judges from promotion due to \u2018conflicting Exparte Orders in matters with same parties and subject matter.\u2019\n\nIn a statement signed by the NJC\u2019s Director of Information, Soji Oye, Esq., even though there was no written petition, allegations of corruption or impropriety against the subject judges, the Council nevertheless, initiated investigation pursuant to its inherent disciplinary powers under the Constitution to unravel the circumstances that led to the spate of Exparte Orders granted by these Courts of coordinate jurisdiction over matters bearing same parties and subject matter.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe National Judicial Council rose from its two days meeting held on 14 and 15 December 2021, with a resolution to bar the three Judges of Courts of concurrent jurisdiction who granted conflicting Exparte Orders in matters with same parties and subject matter from promotion to higher Bench for a period ranging from two to five years whenever they are due.\n\n\u201cEven though there was no written petition, allegations of corruption or impropriety against the subject judges, Council nevertheless, initiated an investigation pursuant to its inherent disciplinary powers under the Constitution to unravel the circumstances that led to the spate of Exparte Orders granted by these Courts of coordinate jurisdiction over matters bearing same parties and subject matter.\u201d\n\nThe meeting which was chaired by the Deputy Chairman of Council, Hon. Justice Mary Peter-Odili, CFR agreed with the recommendations of the Investigation Committee set up in September 2021.\n\nDuring the meeting, Hon. Justice Okogbule Gbasam of the High Court of Rivers State was barred from elevation to higher Bench for two years whenever he is due.\n\nHon. Justice Nusirat I. Umar of the High Court of Kebbi State be barred from elevation to higher Bench for two years whenever due.\n\nAlso, Hon. Justice Edem Ita Kooffreh of the High Court of Cross River State will not be promoted to higher Bench for five years for allowing himself to be used as a tool for \u201cforum shopping\u201d and abuse of Court process.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cHon. Justice Okogbule Gbasam of the High Court of Rivers State be barred from elevation to higher Bench for two years whenever he is due, as he failed to exercise due diligence in granting the Exparte Order in Suit No: PHC/2183/CS/2021 between IBEALWUCHI EARNEST ALEX & 4 ORS AND PRINCE UCHE SECONDUS & ANOR, as there was no real urgency, in the circumstances of the matter, that would have required an Exparte Order. His Lordship is also issued with a warning letter to be circumspect in granting such Exparte Orders in the future.\n\n\u201cCouncil also resolved that Hon. Justice Nusirat I. Umar of the High Court of Kebbi State be barred from elevation to higher Bench for two years whenever due, having found fundamental defects and non-compliance with the law in granting the Exparte Order in Suit No: KB/HC/M.71/2021 between YAHAYA USMAN & 2 ORS AND PRINCE UCHE SECONDUS & ANOR. He is also issued with a warning letter to be circumspect in granting such Exparte Orders in the future.\n\n\u201cHon. Justice Edem Ita Kooffreh of the High Court of Cross River State will not be promoted to higher Bench for five years for allowing himself to be used as a tool for \u201cforum shopping\u201d and abuse of Court process in Suit No: HC/240/2021 between Mr. ENANG KANUM WANI AND UCHE SECONDUS as it was evident that, in granting the Exparte Order, he was seised of earlier Orders of the High Courts of Rivers and Kebbi States, being Courts of coordinate jurisdiction with his. He is also to receive warning letter to be circumspect in granting such Exparte Orders in the future. The Council also placed him on its Watch-List for a period of two years.\u201d\n\nMoreso, the Council approved the appointment of 63 judges for 16 states, nine of which are Heads of Court. It also received notification of retirements from Hon. Justice Mudashiru Oniyangi of the Court of Appeal; Hon. Justice Bello Duwale of the High Court of Sokoto State; Hon. Justices S. A.

          "text": "The Anambra State government led by Governor Willie Obiano has commiserated with former governor Chukwuemeka Ezeife over the death of his wife, Mrs Njideka Ezeife, which occurred three days ago.\n\nMrs Ezeife was the Anambra State First Lady from January 1992, to November 1993, when the husband was the state governor.\n\nHer husband was the first elected Anambra State governor following the creation of the state on August 27, 1991, by the military regime.\n\n\u201cMrs Njideka Ezeife played a significant part in making the husband become a role model to a generation of not just Igbo people but all Nigerians,\u201d the state government said in a statement in Awka today signed by the Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, C. Don Adinuba.\n\n\u201cEzeife couldn\u2019t proceed to secondary school after his primary education, but he ended up with a doctoral degree in economics from Harvard, symbolising the Igbo spirit to not just succeed but excel despite all odds.\n\n\u201cUnable to return to Nigeria on completion of his studies, he became an academic at Makerere University in Uganda and when he eventually came back home, he joined the federal civil service where he rose to the position of permanent secretary.\n\n\u201cHis wife was with him all the way during the years of tribulations and determination which ended up in praise\u201d.\n\nAdinuba noted that Mrs Ezeife would be remembered also for her role in making the Ezeife administration adhere strictly to prudent financial management and laying the foundation for the subsequent development of the state.\n\n\u201cThe state had just been created when he assumed office, and it had practically no infrastructure, no offices, no facilities and no funds,\u201d the commissioner observed.\n\n\u201cDr Ezeife had to squeeze water out of stone, and he saved a lot of money which he planned to invest in the state\u2019s rapid development in the last two years of the administration which would enable him to win reelection easily, but his lofty plans were truncated when the military struck, once again, in Nigerian politics on November 17, 1993\u201d.\n\nAdinuba recalled that following the military coup, Ezeife and his wife returned to Lagos where the family shared a small family house on Awolowo Road in Ikoyi which served as both their residence and office because they could not afford a bigger house.\n\n\u201cFar from bemoaning their fate,\u201d stated Adinuba, \u201cMrs Ezeife and the family accepted their new condition with philosophical equanimity.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Mrs Ezeife encouraged her husband to continue to take an active part in the affairs of the nation, beginning with Anambra State because of her strong conviction that charity must always start at home.\n\n\u201cDr Ezeife accepted the counsel, contributing robustly to Anambra\u2019s rapid development in the last few years, like most other former governors of the state.\n\n\u201cIn appreciation of his sincere and energetic contribution, Governor Willie Obiano appointed him a member of the Anambra State Council of Elders when it was inaugurated, working alongside such distinguished Anambra sons and daughters as Chief Emeka Anyaoku, former Secretary General of the Commonwealth; Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Achebe, Obi of Onitsha and former director of Shell International; Iyom Josephine Anenih, a senior lawyer and former Minister of Women Affairs; Chief Simeon Okeke, former chairman of the Police Service Commission; Most Reverend Paulinus Ezeokafor, the Catholic Bishop of Awka; Archbishop Maxwell Anikwenwa, former leader of the Anglican Communion in Anambra State; Bishop Alexander Ibezim, the Bishop of Awka and leader of the Anglican faith in the state; and Sir Chris Okoye, the doyen of the civil engineering profession in Nigeria; as well as Chief Ogene Okeke, the vice chairman of Ohaneze Ndi Igbo.\u201d\n\nGovernor Obiano has already personally condoled Dr Ezeife over the wife\u2019s transition, pledging that he and his family would say special prayers for the repose of Mrs Ezeife\u2019s soul.\n\n\u201cThe state administration,\u201d he promised, \u201cwill certainly participate effectively in her burial\u201d.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Tasks EFCC to verify his claim\n\nBy Dapo Akinrefon\n\nChief Ayo Adebanjo\n\nLeader of the pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, on Thursday, faulted former Interim National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Chief Bisi Akande that Asiwaju Bola Tinubu built his Lekki house.\n\nReacting to Akande\u2019s allegation, he described the former Osun State governor as a neophyte and a beneficiary of a struggle he did not take part in.\n\nAkande, in his autobiography, titled: \u2018My participations\u2019 alleged that Adebanjo pestered National Leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to build him a house in Lekki.\n\nHis words: \u201cAbout a week ago, last Thursday, 9 December to be exact at the presentation of the book \u201cMY PARTICIPATION\u201d by Chief Bisi Akande it was said that Chief Bisi Akande stated in the book that I brought pressure on Bola Tinubu to build the house for me. But since Bola Tinubu himself was present at the presentation I expect him within a few days to refute such a malicious falsehood about me emanating from his Man Friday.\n\nI hold this view because Bola Tinubu just some 3 years ago on the occasion of the presentation of my auto-biography \u201cSAYING IT AS IT IS \u201d that for my incorruptibility and strength of character he Bola Tinubu would not have been Governor of Lagos State in 1999. What then could he be demanding from me after his two-term governorship to make me pressurize him to build a house for me when I did not get a naira from him before he became the governor?\n\nThere has been a lot of pressure on me not to react to Chief Bisi Akande\u2019s tantrums, he is a neophyte, a beneficiary of a struggle he never took part in. I have been urged to keep to the adage not to \u201cAnswer a fool lest you reduce yourself to his level, but there is also an adage that says, \u201cAnswer a fool lest he thinks he is wise\u201d.\n\nA lot has been said in the press and social media to demolish tantrums. But I owe a duty to myself and to put the record straight for posterity about the big lie that Bola Tinubu built my house in Lekki for me.\n\nI, therefore, deny the LIE propagated by Akande, I wish to state categorically that my house at Lekki was built with my resources through the sale of 3 developed properties, loan from GTBank and the sale of undeveloped landed property given me by my late leader, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, of blessed memory.\u201d\n\nHow I built my Lekki house\n\nGiving details of how he sold some of his properties and took a bank loan to build the Lekki house, he said: \u201cA 4-bedroom duplex with 2 bedroom flat enclosed with 2 undeveloped plots at plot 4, block 14, Nuru Oniwo Street, Aguda Surulere, Lagos State, this is where I was living before moving to Lekki. The house was commissioned in 1972 by Chief Obafemi Awolowo.\n\nA wing of the duplex was once occupied by a staff of the security outfit then known as \u201cspecial branch\u201d headed then by the late Alhaji M. D. Yussuf who later became Inspector General of Police when General Olusegun Obasanjo was the Head of State. It was later occupied by one of the wives of Chief Pius Akinyelure, who often visited his wife there in company of Senator Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201cThe gate of this property was forced open by Abacha security forces when NADECO was holding a sendoff party for American ambassador Walter Carrington in my house, I took the Federal Government to court for damages and I was awarded #1million naira which has not been paid till today by the Federal Government, Mr Olisa Agbakoba SAN, was my counsel.\n\n\u201cThe house was sold to St Baths Anglican Church, Aguda, Surulere.\n\nTwo storey building at Odedola Street, Surulere, Lagos State. I bought it through an Estate Agent by name Mr Shiwoniku who has relocated to UK, he has a brother who is a legal practitioner in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe house was sold to a Ghanaian by name Mr Akappo. He is still alive and he lives in one of the flats in the building.\n\n\u201cFour storey building with a warehouse on the ground floor and six flats on top. It was commissioned by Chief Awolowo in 1977.\n\n\u201cI inherited the plot of 45\u2019X100\u2019 from my mother Salamotu Anomo-Adebanjo, who built a bungalow on it.\n\n\u201cShe bought the land when I was in primary school in 1940 from one Pa Idowu Onitiri for \u00a320, which she paid by installment of \u00a310, \u00a37, \u00a33. His son Akanbi Onitiri, executed the conveyance for me without extra payment after showing him the purchase receipts from his father, when I was developing it in 1976. Akanbi Onitiri is the father of Sumbo Onitiri, a well-known estate surveyor in Lagos.\n\n\u201cThe building was sold to a woman through an estate agent.\n\nI then took a loan from GTBank to complete the house in Lekki where I am living now.\n\nWhen the interest on the loan became unbearable, I was compelled to sell the undeveloped land given to me by Chief Awolowo in Dide-Olu Estate in Maroko Victoria Island. One Mr. Ade Otusanya a friend of my son Femi Ayo-Adebanjo bought the land.\n\nThe contractor who built my Lekki house is Engr. Hakeem Sulaiman, Senior Partner of Messrs HA associates.\n\nThe Electrical and Mechanical Contractor is Engr. Tokunbo Oshokoya, Senior Partner of Messrs Oshea Projects.\n\nThe Architect is Mr Deji Johnson\n\nThe Quantity Surveyor is the late Otunba T. B Adebayo.\n\nThe Lekki property, the house in my village, Isanya Ogbo which I built 40 years ago, and 3 Bedroom flat in a townhouse, at Omorinre Street in Lekki, are the properties I have in the whole world.\n\nI hereby authorise the EFCC to verify the above facts.\n\nIt is alleged that Chief Bisi Akande\u2019s building at Ila-Orogun, which I understand is more than double in expanse of my house in Lekki and some other properties he has in Lagos and abroad were financed by Bola Tinubu. His house in Ibadan was also alleged to have been built by the contractor that built the secretariat in Oshogbo, when he was the Governor of Osun State.\n\nI hereby challenge Chief Bisi Akande to clear the air by disclosing the source of financing these properties as I have done above.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Bola Tinubu, the great philanthropist should also disclose the source of his wealth with which he bankrolled the elections of APC in the Southwest and that of General Muhammad Buhari and his various properties in Lagos. He should also authorize the EFCC to verify such details as I have done above.\u201d",

          "title": "Holding Charge practice must stop \u2014 Lawyers",
          "text": "By Innocent Anaba, Henry Ojelu & Onazure Dania\n\nJustice Niki Tobi, then of the Supreme Court, captured the illegality of Holding Charge practice when he said: \u201cThe function of the prosecution is not to rush a charge to a magistrate court, a court which has no jurisdiction to try capital cases and play for time while investigation is in progress.\n\n\u201cI have said it before and I will say it again that the unique police phraseology of a holding charge is not known to our criminal law and jurisprudence. It is either charge or not. There is nothing like holding charge.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Administration of Criminal Justice Law, ACJL, stipulates that investigation must be concluded before arrest or a remand order, but despite the plethora of court decisions declaring Holding Charge illegal, the police and magistrate courts still indulge in the illegal practice thereby overcrowding the prisons with awaiting trial inmates. In this edition of Law and Human Rights, lawyers expressed concerns over the issue and suggested measures to end the reoccurring practice.\n\nExcerpt:\n\nS\u2019Court must be obeyed\u2014 Agbakoba, SAN\n\nFormer Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, President, Dr Olisa Agbakoba, SAN, said: \u201cMy simple view is that the rule of law is supreme and as the Supreme Court has declared, Holding Charge unlawful. It is important to comply.\u201d\n\nPractice fuelled by impunity\u2014 Prof Erugo, SAN\n\nProf. Sam Erugo expressing his view on the issue said: \u201cYes, there are several judgments declaring Holding Charge illegal, and it has continued only to the extent of the unchecked impunity of some officers.\n\n\u201cSuch impunity has no formal or official support, but encouraged somehow by omission, in the failure of the system to punish erring officers.\n\n\u201cThere is no argument that most officers of the Force and Security Agencies act with such brazen impunity that suggests failure of control, and ostensibly, failure of rule of law. The question continues to resonate -who will police the Police?\n\n\u201cHowever, it looks like the old form of Holding Charge is gradually giving way to a new practice flowing from recent Criminal Justice legislations.\n\n\u201cThere is a new dimension to Holding Charge following the enactment of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, ACJA, and the Administration of Criminal Justice Laws in the states.\n\n\u201cThese legislations permit the Police and other Security Agencies to obtain court orders to detain criminal suspects for a limited period. Probably, there is nothing wrong in the new practice, but the issue or challenge, to my mind, remains in the abuse of such powers, or impunity in its exercise.\n\n\u201cRelated to that challenge is the incompetence or recklessness of some judicial officers who fail to exercise their powers judicially and judiciously in granting such detention orders.\n\n\u201cThey should be able to balance the competing interests before granting applications, and especially by protecting the human rights of citizens against clear cases of abuse.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unknown to law\u2014Adeniji, SAN\n\nFormer Lagos State Attorney-General and Commissioner of Justice, Kazeem Adeniji, SAN, said: \u201cA Holding Charge connotes the practice where a charge is laid against an accused person at the Magistrate Court to enable the law enforcement agency complete their investigation and refer the case to Director of Public Prosecutions for legal advice and subsequent prosecution by the Attorney-General before the court with competent jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cIn Alhaji Toyin Jimoh V. Commissioner of Police (2004) LPELR-11262 (CA), it was held that holding charge is unknown to Nigerian Law and the accused person detained thereunder is entitled to be released on bail within a reasonable time before trial.\n\n\u201cThe above position of our courts necessitated amendments to our criminal procedure laws especially the Administration of Criminal Justice Law of Lagos State, 2007 (further amended in 2011) but now ACJL 2015 which specifically provided for Remand Proceedings in Section 264 granting power to the Magistrate Court to remand a suspect in respect of offences triable on information for 30 days and subsequently another 30 days after which the Magistrate Court shall issue notice to DPP to show cause why the suspect should not be released or in appropriate circumstances, grant bail to the suspect.\n\nALSO READ: NSA names religious organisations backing terrorist groups in Nigeria\n\n\u201cSimilar provisions exist in Sections 294 to 295 of the ACJA, 2015 with time limit of 14 days in the first instance and another period not exceeding 14 days. The provisions of the Administration of Criminal Laws are in line with Section 35 (4) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (As Amended).\n\nIt\u2019s root cause of prisons congestion \u2014Pedro, SAN\n\nCondemning the practice, former Lagos State Solicitor-General and Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Justice, Lawal Pedro, SAN, said: \u201cHolding charge is unconstitutional and unknown to law but our security agencies usually used it when they rush to the courts with suspects, before looking for evidence to prosecute them.\n\n\u201cThe continued use of the Holding Charge by security agencies to detain awaiting trial suspects, is the major cause of the high number of awaiting trial inmates in our correctional centres and the undue delays in the criminal justice administration system of the country.\n\n\u201cThis procedure is unacceptable in any democracy where suspect is presumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\n\u201cIt is advised that our security agencies should desist from such obnoxious practice and emulate what happens in civilized societies where investigation does not commence with arrest and detention but by discreet surveillance on crime suspects and discreet investigation until such a time when enough evidence would have been obtained for his arrest, interrogation, arraignment and prosecution.\u201d\n\nPractice should be amended \u2014Alliyu, SAN\n\nYomi Alliyu, SAN, said: \u201cWhat cannot be done by court pronouncements through judgments could be done by legislation?\n\n\u201cBy that I mean that correctional centres should by legislation, be given option on who they admit into their centres.\n\n\u201cThe law should be that nobody whose trial is awaiting the decision of another body shall be accepted in these centres and if accepted against the law, the head of that centre shall be liable to three years imprisonment without prejudice to the right of the person thus unlawfully detained to seek remedy in civil courts.\u201d\n\nIt renders bail procedure ineffective \u2014 Edun\n\nWelfare Secretary of Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, Kunle Edun said: \u201cIt is sad that despite the revolutionary provisions in the Administration of Criminal Justice Act and the domesticated versions in the various states in Nigeria, the courts are still grappling with understanding the good intentions of these laws, five years after.\n\n\u201cACJA has annihilated Holding Charge and every Magistrate Court now has the power to grant bail even in capital offence cases, where the evidence clearly shows that the charge is frivolous.\n\n\u201cMore so, the practice of remanding a Defendant after arraignment and adjourning the matter to enable him file bail application in a non-capital offence charge, is not supported by our criminal laws.\n\n\u201cIt is a convention that has made useless and ineffective the bail procedure system. By remanding a defendant in a non-capital offence charge, his constitutional right to personal liberty is further infringed upon. ACJA and the various ACJLs put the onus on the Prosecution to show why a Defendant in a non-capital offence charge must not be granted bail.\n\n\u201cThe reverse is the case in practice because the onus is shifted to the Defendants. This convention is one of the major reasons we have congested detention centres. There are provisions in ACJA for periodic inspection of detention centres by Judges and Magistrates but most of the state Judiciaries hardly conduct these inspections mainly due to funds constraint.\n\n\u201cThis brings to fore the urgent need for financial autonomy for the judiciary. ACJA and the ACJLs of the various states in Nigeria require that criminal cases be heard from day to day where practicable but this has not been the case.\n\n\u201cThe dearth of Magistrates and Judges is a huge constraint in the quick dispensation of justice.\n\n\u201cThere is need to appoint more Magistrates and Judges to decongest the detention centres, or better still, increase the criminal jurisdiction of Magistrate courts.\n\nIt\u2019s evil, unjust \u2014 Hannibal\n\nChariman of African Bar Association, Uwaifo Hannibal said: \u201cHolding Charge is one of the endemic problems facing the justice delivery sector in Nigeria. So despite a plethora of decisions to the contrary, this method of serving justice in criminal cases continues as if it is the normal.\n\n\u201cA lot of factors are responsible. Firstly, those who file the Charges for Capital punishments are from the Attorney-General\u2019s office in the various Justice Ministries, do they not know the law?\n\n\u201cSecondly, with the number of cases clogged in the High Courts and the snail speed of judicial administration, can justice be done and manifestly so in the early stages of filing complaints and charges and the need to keep the accused under legal custody with some form of legal control clothed with legal authority?\n\n\u201cThe Magistrate Courts were essentially created to deal with daily adjudication of criminal matters often in a summary way and often times, within the reach of the Police who make daily arrests, investigates and charges.\n\n\u201cThe convenience of the Magistrate Court which is not a court of record and has no special procedure requiring expertise as in the higher courts, is the allure that keeps oiling Holding Charge.\n\n\u201cThe solution from my perspective, is law reform. We need to do a holistic reform in the Judicial Sector particularly in the Criminal Justice System.\u201d\n\nMagistrates who indulge in the practice must be sanctioned \u2014Akingbolu\n\nKabir Akingbolu said: \u201cHolding charge as a practice is illegal because it is unknown to our criminal jurisprudence. However, the police with the collusion of Magistrate Courts continue this practice.\n\n\u201cThis is very sad because as a result of the ugly practice, many people stay longer than necessary awaiting trials.\n\n\u201cThe best solution, I think, is for the lawyers to go against the magistrates who do this by petitioning them to the relevant disciplinary agencies for proper action.\n\n\u201cIf the magistrates are not punished for this ominous act, they won\u2019t desist from such terrible act that is affecting our Criminal Justice System negatively.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s reflection of lawlessness \u2014Igbinedion\n\nSenior lecturer in the Department of International Jurispondence, University of Lagos, Dr. Simeon Igbinedion said: \u201cWe live in a clime where the subordination of rule of law to the omnibus \u2018national security\u2019 and personal rule has been routinised by politicians, government officials and government institutions. The continued indulgence in Holding charge reflects the lawlessness around us. What can be done?\n\n\u201cLet rule of law take its pride of place; let the law and decisions of court be enforced to the letter; let those out to subvert such enforcement be made to face the wrath of the law.\u201d\n\nMagistrates, Police should be trained \u2014 Asia\n\nElvis Asia said: \u201cHolding charge or remand proceeding is not absolutely illegal or unconstitutional. The Administration of Criminal Justice Act and law in most states of the federation, have provisions for remand pending investigation.\n\n\u201cHowever, there must be strict compliance with the procedure set out in the law. For example, magistrates must ensure that the applications are brought within a reasonable time not more than 24-48 hours after arrest depending on the court distance.\n\n\u201cThis is mandatory under the Constitution. Magistrates can also grant bail instead of making a remand order and limited time should be given to enable the court monitor the process, otherwise, they should be set aside. Magistrates must also ensure that there is a clear reasonable ground for the application.\n\n\u201cThe present system where magistrates just rubberstamp whatever the police files is the problem. They need to be trained to understand their role in the process. The process can be better managed to maintain the sanctity of the constitution.\u201d\n\nCourts without jurisdiction should decline cases \u2014 Ochai\n\nEmmanuel Ochai said: \u201cI think that our Criminal Justice System needs to be reformed. Section 35 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) as provided for how long a suspect can be detained without being properly arraigned before a court of competent jurisdiction. Unfortunately, some courts still remand suspects on Holding charges which is illegal.\n\n\u201cTo curb this menace, legal officers have to be proactive in ensuring that whoever is suspected of committing a criminal offence is brought before a court of competent jurisdiction within a reasonable time and judicial officers should also ensure that they have jurisdiction to try the case before assuming jurisdiction in respect of the said charge.\n\nErring magistrates should be punished\u2014 Adegborioye\n\nAdenrele Adegborioye, said: \u201cHolding charge is illegal and unconstitutional. Any person charged with a bailable or non-capital offence should not be detained beyond the constitutional required period of 24 to 48 hours.\n\n\u201cOur magistrates and police need more training and education about the position of the law as it is wrong for any magistrate to continue to unlawfully detain suspects under Holding charge despite the pronouncement of the Supreme Court on this issue.\n\n\u201cAlso, the supervising authorities should not hesitate to discipline any erring Magistrate who still persists in detaining a person accused of an offence under Holding charge without any legally justifiable reason.\u201d",

          "text": "The National Judicial Council (NJC) has barred three judges of courts of concurrent jurisdiction from promotion to the higher bench for a period ranging from two to five years whenever they are due.\n\nThe affected judges are said to have granted conflicting ex-parte orders in matters with the same parties and subject matters.\n\nAt its emergency meeting held in Abuja between December 14 and 15, 2021, the NJC passed the resolution to bar the three judges.\n\nThe outcome of the meeting held behind the closed door was made public in a statement issued on Thursday by the NJC Director of Information, Mr Soji Oye.\n\nThe statement said that even though there was no written petition, allegations of corruption or impropriety against the judges, the Council nevertheless, initiated an investigation pursuant to its inherent disciplinary powers under the constitution to unravel the circumstances that led to the spate of ex-parte orders.\n\nThe meeting, which was chaired by the Deputy Chairman of Council, Justice Mary Peter-Odili, agreed with the recommendations of the investigation committee set up in September 2021 that Justice Okogbule Gbasam of the High Court of Rivers State be barred from elevation to higher bench for two years whenever he is due, as he failed to exercise due diligence in granting the ex parte order.\n\nThe offending order was issued in Suit No: PHC/2183/CS/2021 between IBEALWUCHI EARNEST ALEX & 4 ORS AND PRINCE UCHE SECONDUS & ANOR, as there was no real urgency, in the circumstances of the matter, that would have required an ex parte order.\n\n\u201cHis Lordship is also issued with a warning letter to be circumspect in granting such ex parte orders in the future.\n\n\u201cCouncil also resolved that Justice Nusirat I. Umar of the High Court of Kebbi State be barred from elevation to higher Bench for two years whenever due, having found fundamental defects and non-compliance with the law in granting the Ex parte Order,\u201d the council said.\n\nHer ex-parte order was issued in Suit No: KB/HC/M.71/2021 between YAHAYA USMAN & 2 ORS AND PRINCE UCHE SECONDUS & others.\n\nHe was also issued with a warning letter to be circumspect in granting such Exparte Orders in the future.\n\nOn his part, Justice Edem Ita Kooffreh of the High Court of Cross River State will not be promoted to a higher bench for five years for allowing himself to be used as a tool for \u201cforum shopping\u201d and abuse of the court process.\n\nHe issued the order in Suit No: HC/240/2021 between Mr ENANG KANUM WANI AND UCHE SECONDUS as it was evident that, in granting the Exparte Order.\n\nHe was seised of earlier orders of the High Courts of Rivers and Kebbi states, being courts of coordinate jurisdiction with his.\n\nHe is also to receive a warning letter to be circumspect in granting such Exparte Orders in the future.\n\nThe Council also placed him on its watch list for a period of two years.\n\nMeanwhile, the Council has approved the appointment of 63 judges for 16 states, nine of which are Heads of Court.\n\nThe Council also received notifications of retirement from Hon. Justice Mudashiru Oniyangi of the Court of Appeal, Hon. Justice Bello Duwale of the High Court of Sokoto State, Hon. Justices S. A. Omonua and O. S.

          "text": "A popular activist, Comrade Idris Miliki, has accused the Kogi State Government of fraudulent activity for not releasing the local government election result one year after it was conducted.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that the Kogi State council election was conducted on 12th December 2020.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday at a one-day meeting with Civil Society Organization (CSO) partners on prioritizing anti-corruption and accountability issues during the upcoming 2023 election at the state level, Miliki, who is the Executive Director, Conscience for Human Rights and Conflict Resolution (CHRCR) described as shameful that Kogites are still begging the relevant authorities to release an election result conducted for over a year.\n\nAccording to him, corruption has gone beyond embezzling public funds, adding that, continuous failure to release the council result even when the elected chairman has been inaugurated and they have been collecting salary should be condemned.\n\nHe noted that it is the duty of the government to be accountable to the people, stressing that, the fight against corruption is a collective responsibility.\n\n\u201cOne year after the purported kangaroo Local Government election was conducted in Kogi State, we are yet to have access to the election result. The chairman has been inaugurated, and they are collecting salaries from public funds. This is totally unacceptable and should be condemned in its entirety.\n\n\u201cNigerians can access the result of the election that brought in our Governor in Kogi State.

I just loved the grandeur with which he carried himself at that age of about 70.\n\n\u201cAfter the pleasantries, he related how badly his party was received by Ila people in the First Republic and that Orangun Adetona Ayeni, Ariwajoye the First, was then the local leader of the AG.\n\n\u201cHe explained how he had been dodging all invitations to Ila to celebrate anniversaries of Adetona\u2019s coronation to avoid another public resentment by association.\n\nRead Also: APC miracle would have been difficult without Tinubu, says Akande\n\n\u201cI was flattered, humbled and shaken when he asked if I could accept to be his friend through whom he would then visit Ila again.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Yes!\u2019 Perhaps intuitively, I had prepared for this moment and would not let it pass without achieving my objective.\n\n\u201cI calmly brought out my note and with every decorum, announced that I had some questions.\n\n\u201cHe suggested, after my first question, that I should first ask all the questions together because he thought the answer to one might be applicable to some others.\n\n\u201cAt that point, Awolowo\u2019s equally legendary wife, Mama, Chief (Mrs) H.I.D Awolowo, peeped in and whispered to him.\n\n\u201cHe nodded back and told her to my hearing that he would prefer not to be disturbed until he was done with my audience.\u201d\n\nHe went on: \u201cWe discussed for well over two hours. In the end, I was totally satisfied in my mind that Awolowo was the leader of leaders.\n\n\u201cWithin my simple assessment, I was marvelled by his intellectual capacity and his presence of mind about names, dates and historical events.\n\n\u201cI was bowled by his sense of humour and truly mesmerised by his fatherly gesticulations in explaining difficult issues.\n\n\u201cI loved him more when I and my colleagues had to take our leave that evening.\n\n\u201cIn my assessment since that encounter, Awolowo can be rated indeed, as one of the greatest intellectuals in the politics of his time.\n\n\u201cNow that I had been admitted into the sanctum of the Awoist Movement, I felt energised and empowered.\n\n\u201cMy colleagues and I quickly and anxiously reported our meeting with Awolowo to the Ila Union in Lagos.\n\n\u201cWe, in the union, agreed in principle, to prefer Awolowo\u2019s politics to any other.\n\n\u201cShortly after our visit to him, Chief Awolowo, accompanied by Chief Fasanmi, Chief Michael Omisade and Chief S.M. Afolabi visited Ila Orangun to hold a private meeting with our elders.\n\n\u201cAwolowo had earlier sent Omisade to me with the itinerary of his tour to our division just a week earlier.\n\n\u201cChief Omisade, a lawyer, was among those jailed with Awolowo during the Treasonable Felony case of 1963.\n\n\u201cHe was used by Ife elders as an independent candidate to defeat Fani Kayode of the Action Group to become a member of the House of Representatives in 1959 when Ila was part of Ife Division. He hailed from Ile-Ife.\u201d\n\nAkande, after the meeting, organised the visit of Awolowo to Ila-Orangun.\n\n\u201cI carefully selected and arranged the audience for the Ila meeting. Among those I selected were a group of men, led by Tijani Ologundudu, that remained influential for having participated and been jailed in the Hunters Riot of 1944.\n\n\u201cThey were the Muslim Youths in my father\u2019s time known as Kewulere. I also invited the cream of Ila local politics, those who controlled our grassroots.\n\n\u201cThey were impressed with the coming of Chief Awolowo.\n\n\u201cIn their presence, Chief Awolowo invited me to the immediate next meeting of the Committee of Friends.\n\n\u201cAt the meeting of the Committee of Friends, I first saw Chief Awolowo in action among some intellectual giants like Professor Sam Aluko, Professor David Oke, Professor Banji Akintoye, Chief Ayo Fasanmi, Chief Bola Ige, Chief Omisade, Chief Phillip Umeadi, Chief Wumi Adegbonmire and others. I respected him the more.\n\n\u201cAwolowo\u2019s coming to Ila brought me into the emerging trend of politics in Oyo State and the consequential role I was destined to play in it.\n\n\u201cI was still involved in the intrigues at the Constituent Assembly, but my heart was now on the future of Oyo State and our burning desire to get Awolowo elected as the President of Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "The Federal Government yesterday faulted former President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s assessment of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s score card in the last six years.\n\nIt disagreed with the former leader\u2019s remark that the President has nothing to offer in office, particularly on the worsening insecurity that has upset the country.\n\nThe government warned Nigerians against the use of incendiary and insulting words, especially by leaders, saying that they can overheat the polity and heighten tension.\n\nGovernment also said that with a recent court declaration, bandits have been declared as terrorists, stressing that no administration in Nigeria\u2019s recent history has provided the security agencies with the hardware to tackle insecurity as that of President Buhari.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, made the clarifications at a briefing in Abuja against the backdrop of increasing banditry and kidnappings in the country.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEx-President Obasanjo had on Monday claimed that President Buhari has nothing more to offer the nation.\n\nHe said the nation should start looking beyond the tenure of Buhari by shopping for a new leader in 2023.\n\nObasanjo said: \u201cPresident Buhari has done his best. That is what he can do. If we are expecting anything more than what he has done or what he is doing, that means we\u2019re whipping a dead horse and there is no need.\u201d\n\nBut, Mohammed said the assessment of the President by Obasanjo was wrong because Buhari was doing his best for Nigeria.\n\nThe Minister said: \u201cIf anybody is worried today about the security situation of the country, it is Mr. President.\n\n\u201c President Buhari has done so much, under very difficult economic and social conditions, to tackle insecurity in our country.\n\n\u201cNot only has he done so much. President Buhari continues to do much more to keep Nigerians safe. To say he has nothing more to offer is untrue, fallacious and smacks of dirty politicking.\n\n\u201cBy boosting the number and capacity of our fighting forces, Mr. President is putting them in good stead to tackle insecurity not just during the life of his administration but long after he would have left office.\u201d\n\nMohammed assured Nigerians that Buhari will leave the nation better with sustainable achievements.\n\nHe added:\u201d President Buhari is leaving a legacy of security, infrastructural development, economic prosperity and social cohesion for Nigeria.\n\n\u201dThis may not seem obvious today, amidst daunting challenges, but posterity will be kind to this President.\n\n\u201cDespite all this, President Buhari has not relented, constantly presiding over meetings of security chiefs to get an update and also issue necessary directives, and not missing any opportunity to offer succour to his countrymen and women, when necessary.\n\n\u201cThe skewed narrative in certain quarters that the President has not shown enough empathy is glib talk. The President has also continued to work with our neighboring countries and indeed our Western partners to tackle insecurity, especially terrorism.\n\n\u201cWith the entire Sahelian region experiencing a devastating surge in terrorist attacks, more so in the wake of the Libyan crisis, it has become even more imperative for Nigeria to step up regional cooperation to more effectively tackle insecurity \u2013 and that is what Mr. President has been doing.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, President Buhari has done so much, under very difficult economic and social conditions, to tackle insecurity in our country. Not only has he done so much. President Buhari continues to do much more to keep Nigerians safe. To say he has nothing more to offer is untrue, fallacious and smacks of dirty politicking.\n\n\u201cBy boosting the number and capacity of our fighting forces, Mr. President is putting them in good stead to tackle insecurity not just during the life of his Administration but long after he would have left office. President Buhari is leaving a legacy of security, infrastructural development, economic prosperity and social cohesion for Nigeria. This may not seem obvious today, amidst daunting challenges, but posterity will be kind to this President.\n\n\u201cPlease permit me to use this opportunity to commend the military, police, civil defence and other security, intelligence and para-military agencies for their continued service to the nation. It is important to remember that our men and women in uniform sacrifice their sleep and comfort so we can in turn sleep well.\n\n\u201cEven as we continue to battle insecurity, it will be uncharitable on our part to suggest they are not doing enough, or not to appreciate their sacrifices. The recent massive surrendering of Boko Haram terrorists and the huge pressure on bandits represent a testament to the effectiveness of the efforts of our security agencies. We should encourage them to do more, instead of pillorying them.\u201d\n\nThe Minister said the use of incendiary and insulting words, especially by leaders of all hues, can only overheat the polity and heighten tension.\n\nHe asked Nigerians to appreciate the efforts of the government at addressing security challenges in the country.\n\nMohammed said: \u201cFinally, while there is nothing wrong in the citizens expressing their concerns over the insecurity in the country, we wish to say that the use of incendiary and insulting words, especially by leaders of all hues, can only overheat the polity and heighten tension.\n\n\u201cWhile the government provides leadership, all Nigerians have a role to play in securing our nation. Security is not the sole responsibility of the security forces alone.\n\n\u201cWe must not only support our security agencies, we must also say something anytime we see something that hampers our safety and security, as encapsulated in the mantra: \u2018\u2019If you see something, say something.\u2019\u2019\n\nAsked why the Federal Government\u2019s position on the status of bandits, Mohammed said:\u201d I think the AGF went to court and got a declaration. As far as the law is concerned today, bandits are terrorists. But it is not me or you that will say that they are terrorists, the court has made a declaration.\n\nRegarding gazette on the court declaration, the Minister said: \u201cThere is a process for everything, we should be patient. The Attorney-General of the Federation won\u2019t go to court for nothing. For the AGF to go to court, it is the biggest step to declare bandits as terrorists.\u201d\n\nResponding to a correspondent, the Minister insisted that Buhari has improved security architecture of the nation than he met it.\n\nHe said: \u201cSince assuming office in 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari has continued to make the issue of security a major plank of his administration\u2019s policy. This is not a surprise, considering the fact that the fight against insecurity is one of the three priority areas of the APC-led Federal Government.\n\n\u201cYes, the security situation has continued to pose a great challenge, but amidst the cacophony of voices \u2013 some genuinely concerned about the situation and others ready to exploit it for selfish ends \u2013 it is easy to forget where we are coming from.\n\n\u201cToday, we only look at the current situation, without wondering what would have been had this President not taken the bull by the horns, as far as security is concerned.\n\n\u201cWith the way the insurgents were going before this Administration came into office, with their control of a vast swath of land the size of Belgium, with their freewheeling attacks in almost a dozen states, including the Federal Capital Territory which was hit at least five times, perhaps they could have achieved their aim of declaring an Islamic State in Nigeria, if President Buhari had not acted decisively.\n\n\u201cAfter all, in 2014, Boko Haram declared a Caliphate in Gwoza after capturing Bama and Gamboru as well as other towns and villages in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. They installed their own Emirs, collected taxes and flew their flag before the military dislodged them.\n\n\u201cYes, banditry and kidnapping have added to the state of insecurity, President Buhari has also continued to provide quality leadership in order to ensure that our security agencies decisively tackle the cankerworm of insecurity of any hue.\u201d",

Adebanjo\u2019s statement read:\n\n\u201cThe details are as follows:\n\n\u201cA 4 bedroom duplex with 2 bedroom flat enclosed with 2 undeveloped plots at plot 4, block 14, Nuru Oniwo Street, Aguda Surulere, Lagos State, this is where I was living before moving to Lekki*.\n\n\u201cThe house was commissioned in 1972 by Chief Obafemi Awolowo.\n\n\u201cA wing of the duplex was once occupied by a staff of the security outfit then known as \u201cspecial branch\u201d headed then by the late Alhaji M.D. Yussuf who later became Inspector General of Police when General Olusegun Obasanjo was the Head of State.\n\n\u201cIt was later occupied by one of the wives Chief Pius Akinyelure, who often visit his wife there in company of Senator Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201cThe gate of this property was forced open by Abacha security forces when NADECO was holding a sendoff party for American ambassador Walter Carrington in my house, I took the Federal Government to court for damages and I was awarded #1million naira which has not been paid till today by the Federal Government, Mr. Olisa Agbakoba SAN, was my counsel.\n\n\u201cThe house was sold to St Baths Anglican Church, Aguda, Surulere.\n\nTwo storey building at Odedola Street, Surulere, Lagos State.\n\n\u201cI bought it through an Estate Agent by name Mr. Shiwoniku who has relocated to UK, he has a brother who is a legal practitioner in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe house was sold to a Ghanaian by name Mr Akappo.\n\n\u201cHe is still alive and he lives in one of the flats in the building. Four storey building with a warehouse on the ground floor and six flats on top. It was commissioned by Chief Awolowo in 1977.\n\n\u201cI inherited the plot of 45\u2019X100\u2019 from my mother Salamotu Anomo-Adebanjo, who built a bungalow on it*.\n\n\u201cShe bought the land when I was in primary school in 1940 from one Pa. Idowu Onitiri for \u00a320, which she paid by installment of \u00a310, \u00a37, \u00a33. His son Akanbi Onitiri, executed the conveyance for me without extra payment after showing him the purchase receipts from his father, when I was developing it in 1976. Akanbi Onitiri is the father of Sumbo Onitiri, a well known estate surveyor in Lagos.\n\n\u201cThe building was sold to a woman through an estate agent.\n\n\u201cI then took a loan from GTBank to complete the house in Lekki where I am living now*.\n\n\u201cWhen the interest on the loan became unbearable, I was compelled to sell the undeveloped land given to me by Chief Awolowo in Dide-Olu Estate in Maroko Victoria Island. One Mr. Ade Otusanya a friend of my son Femi Ayo-Adebanjo bought the land.\n\n\u201cThe contractor who built my Lekki house is Engr.

His house in Ibadan was also alleged to have been built by the contractor that built the secretariat in Oshogbo, when he was the Governor of Osun State.\u201d\n\nHe also challenged Tinubu to disclose \u201cthe source of his wealth with which he bankrolled the elections of APC in the Southwest and that of General Muhammad Buhari and his various properties in Lagos.\u201d\n\nHe dared the former Lagos governor \u201cto authorize the EFCC to verify such details as I have done above.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Minister of Police Affairs, Alhaji Maigari Dingyadi, disclosed this in Abuja while speaking to newsmen at the end of the weekly virtual FEC meeting at the State House, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nDingyadi said the increments would take effect from January 2022.\n\nOther packages announced by the federal government included tax waiver for junior officers with effect from October 2021 and payment of outstanding funds for uninsured personnel between 2013 and 2020.\n\nDingyadi said FEC also approved a review and upgrading of the take home pay of police personnel in Nigeria.\n\nThe pay rise came amid awful revelations and controversies in the wake of the reports and recommendations of the #EndSARS panels set up by state governments to probe the protests, which rocked the country last year.\n\nDingyadi recalled that in October 2020, Nigeria was rocked by #EndSARS protests and Mr. President addressed the country and appealed for calm. He said the president also promised a review of the remunerations of police officers to enhance their take home pay in recognition of the services they rendered to the country in terms of maintenance of peace and order.\n\nThe minister explained, \u201cWe have tried to create a situation where their take home pay will be enhanced through the increase in their allowances.\u201d\n\nDingyadi listed the police personnel allowances and approvals that were reviewed upward to include duty tour allowance, which was raised to six per cent of the new take home pay. Council also approved the payment of N1.12 billion for the settlement of outstanding benefits of personnel for the uninsured period between 2013 and 2020, which had not been covered under the group personal insurance programme.\n\nHe stated, \u201cFEC has also approved the release of N13, 127, 972, 260 (Thirteen billion, one hundred twenty seven million, nine hundred seventy two thousand, two hundred and sixty nine naira) for payment as outstanding death benefits of 5,472 personnel within the uninsured period of 2013 to August 2021, not covered under the Group Life Insurance.\n\n\u201cCouncil has also approved the payment of the sum of 1.2 billion as payment of outstanding burial expenses of personnel period of January 2012 to 2021.\n\n\u201cCouncil has also graciously approved the annual insurance premiums of 750 million naira as well as payment of Four billion, eight hundred and twelve million, five hundred thousand naira for the repairs and replacement of damaged police infrastructure in future budgets, starting from 2022.\n\n\u201cCouncil has also approved a tax waiver in the sum of eighteen billion, six hundred million for personnel, junior officers in the police, in order to increase their take home pay, this is going to take effect from October 2021.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, government has also approved the increase of the current rent subsidy, which is currently between 15 and 20 per cent, amounting to N61 billion, increase is 40 per cent of the consolidated policy salary structure (CONPOST) in the sum of seventy eight billion three hundred million naira, that is to say an increase of about sixteen billion, four hundred million naira. \u201cIt has also approved payment of an additional six per cent shift duty allowance for officers on level 01 to 14 and the supervisors allowances for officers on level 15 and above. This will come out to about ten billion and thirty million naira with effect from 2022. Most importantly, government also approved payment of about 20 per cent of CONPOST, it is peculiar allowances to boost morale, and take home pay of the Nigeria Police.\n\n\u201cThis 20 per cent is percentage of the total salary, known as peculiar allowance. It is a new allowance created to improve their take home pay.\u201d\n\nDingyadi added that all the proposed allowances and salary structure would be compiled and forwarded to the office of the Auditor General of the Federation (AuGF) and Salary and Wages Commission for vetting and proper scrutiny\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is thereafter that the Accountant General of the Federation will be directed to approve the payment. We can see that with this development now, the police would be earning a more attractive pay that will be commensurate with what they\u2019re doing. What we expect the police to do after this is to double their efforts and justify the confidence that Mr. President and FEC have vested in them.\n\n\u201cAs a ministry we will do whatever it takes to ensure that we improve the performance and the relationship between the police and the public to ensure that they justify this good gesture.\u201d\n\nThe minister emphasised that although the proposal may not have been captured in the 2022 Appropriation Bill, it would be taken care of via a supplementary budget that would be sent later to the National Assembly for approval.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, who was also at the media briefing, said the police wage increase was not part of the 2022 budget proposal of federal government currently before the National Assembly. Ahmed assured that the police salary increase would come into effect once the supplementary budget was approved by the legislative arm.\n\n\u201cNo, we are not talking about taking effect in January 2022. But the effective date is still January 2022. When all the problems are sorted out there will be supplementary budget sent to the parliament.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Electoral Bill: Three Days to Go, Buhari Keeps Nigerians in Suspense",
          "text": "\u2022President plays card close to his chest, as ex-lawmaker expresses optimism\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja, Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos\n\nDespite appeals from different quarters to President Muhammadu Buhari, including the diplomatic community, to sign the amended electoral bill forwarded to him by the National Assembly on November 19, the president has continued to keep the people in suspense even when it is three days to the 30 days deadline within which he is constitutionally mandated to assent to the bill or return same to the legislature.\n\nAlthough the president has not hinted at any possibility since he received the electoral bill, the bill has, however, been mired in controversy between those urging Buhari to sign it in order to enhance participatory democracy as indicated through the approval of direct primaries and those who have reservations about that model of electing candidates by political parties.\n\nHowever, while a political party, the National Rescue Movement (NRM), has accused the president of failing to assent, a former member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Timothy Golu, has expressed optimism that Buhari would sign the bill eventually.\n\nRecently, some newspapers\u2019 reports had alleged that the president might have caved in to pressure from some governors of his party, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and withheld his assent to the bill, because of the excuse that direct primaries would be too expensive to run.\n\nBut the presidency and the National Assembly had quickly come out to dismiss it as untrue. While one of Buhari\u2019s spokespersons, Mallam Garba Shehu, said he had not been briefed about such a development and therefore not correct, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, too said it was untrue.\n\nInterestingly, those believed to be pushing for indirect primaries were said to have recently reactivated their agenda, seeing that the president had a few days more to the deadline.\n\nAccording to sources, they have reached an understanding with a section of the National Assembly leadership that they would convince the president to return the bill to them on the grounds that he wanted certain clauses amended, but that once that was done, they should file it away and not treat it till the time of the elections.\n\nAlthough the president, sources claimed, was being convinced to inform the principal officers of the National Assembly that he would withhold his assent for them to also reconsider the timing for the submission of candidates\u2019 list by political parties from 180 days to 90 days as it currently stipulated in the 2010 amended electoral act, it is a decoy to scuttle the whole process.\n\nYet, those who want the president to leave a legacy of sound and enduring electoral system, have insisted that even if he would return the bill on the grounds of a few contentious clauses, including direct primaries, he must ensure that the current effort at reforming the electoral system through many other clauses did not go to waste.\n\nCuriously, however, those in support of the president assenting to the bill as it were and also convinced he would sign it eventually, have argued that the process of returning a bill to the legislature was much longer than merely signing it hence their conviction that the president had only kept the decision to himself.\n\nAccording to a THISDAY news analysis published yesterday, which quoted a presidency source, \u201cYou also need to understand the process, because there is a process or if you like, protocol to these things. Remember that immediately the bill was forwarded to the president by the National Assembly, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, wrote to the president and advised against it.\n\n\u201cIt was after this that the governors took up the campaign and asked for the aspect of direct primaries to be yanked off, citing many reasons that could not fly in the face of logic. But if the president was going to listen to his AGF or give in to the pressure by the governors, the process is that he would have instructed the AGF to draft a letter of response back to the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThus, if a process like that has been triggered, then you would have known that the president was not going to sign it, following the same channel of communication and as advised by his AGF. But since it was sent to him, the president has just kept quiet and knowing that signing is just about a small ceremony and solely the call of the president, so, he could choose to delay it and just sign whenever he wants for as long as it is before the deadline,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe source, which cited the fact that the National Assembly would proceed on recess today, Thursday, December 16th, further contended that, \u201cIf there was going to be any communication rejecting the bill, he would have triggered the process before they embark on their recess, of which they wouldn\u2019t be back until later in January, and by which time, the process for the Ekiti and Osun States governorship elections would have begun.\n\n\u201cI mean, it belies logic that the president would write to the National Assembly after they had proceeded on recess. Therefore, if he is not writing them between now and Thursday, when they would go on recess, then, it is a deal. He will sign it, since the signing ceremony is his personal business,\u201d the source explained.\n\nBesides, the source, which equally quoted the president at a recent virtual Summit for Democracy organised by the United States President, Joe Biden, where he reiterated his commitment to leaving behind a lasting legacy of credible polls for the nation\u2019s democratic development, added that Buhari was mindful of his commitment to the diplomatic community.\n\n\u201cAs we countdown to our next general election in 2023, we remain committed to putting in place and strengthening all necessary mechanisms to ensure that Nigeria will not only record another peaceful transfer of power to an elected democratic government, but will also ensure that the elections are conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner,\u201d Buhari stated at the summit.\n\nMeanwhile, a political party, the National Rescue Movement (NRM), has accused the president of failing to reciprocate the usual cordial relationship between the Executive and the present National Assembly by his refusal to assent the Electoral Act amendment bill sent to him.\n\nNational Chairman of the party, Senator Saidu Dansadau, who spoke at the end of the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting on Tuesday in Abuja, said the executive was not fair to the National Assembly by President Buhari\u2019s action.\n\n\u201cIf there is any president since 1999 that enjoyed maximum cooperation, it is President Muhammadu Buhari and for National Assembly to respond to the yearnings of majority of Nigerians and passed the bill as requested for by Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAnd we saw on national televisions that APC governors met and said they are against the bill that would ensure free and transparent elections in the country. And they went and lobbied Mr. President to hold his assent by returning it to the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cTo me, he (Buhari) is unfair to the National Assembly. He has not reciprocated their gesture as they have done to him since the past six and a half years. Also, he has not been fair to Nigerians, who voted him into power, because majority of Nigerians are interested in the passage of this bill and this is unacceptable to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI appealed to Mr. President to, in the name of God, assent to that bill without any doctoring and I also appeal to members of the National Assembly to resist any attempt by the president to tinker with what they have done,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Golu, while calling on the National Assembly to encourage Nigerians and assure them that the bill would be signed eventually, said the president has been in touch with various people from the villa regarding the bill.\n\nGolu, who spoke yesterday on the Morning Show of ARISE NEWS Television, said he believed that the National Assembly would stand its ground as they were not doing it for the president or the party but in the interest of democracy.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, you can see the level of joy and excitement. Everybody is watching and listening to what is happening everyday in regards to the the electoral reforms. There is no reason for him not to sign it. We are waiting patiently, because it\u2019s going to be a legacy as this has encouraged a lot of people to start registering in political parties.\n\n\u201cMost Nigerians don\u2019t belong to any political party, because they don\u2019t participate in raising or nominating flag bearers. They only participate at the general election, where flag bearers or ticket holders are imposed on them,\u201d he said.\n\nOn direct primaries, he explained that it was dependent on whether the nation was operating a delegate system or direct primary system.\n\n\u201cWhoever is putting pressure on the president wants to achieve some personal gains but when you look at the bigger picture, I believe that four or three days should not be a problem, because he has signed bills towards the end of the minimum time frame before, so whatever happens, members of the public are there to hold their representatives accountable in case the president decides other wise, which is very unlikely.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the president will be ready to be embarrassed by the National Assembly at that level. The question is: did you win your elections the way it should have been won? Those who do not want it know, those who didn\u2019t want it know what they did to get to the National Assembly,\u201d Golu further stated.\n\nWhile calling on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) witness primary elections as provided by the current provision of the electoral act, noted that political parties contributed to maintaining these things as it was going to be a systematic process with due accreditation.\n\n\u201cI urge them not to allow partisan and I want to believe that in their own conscience, the National Assembly will not toy with what the nation has been looking up to. Nobody should be above the electoral act and constitution,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022To engage government agencies on export promotion\n\nNume Ekeghe\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Chairman of the Bankers Committee, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has disclosed the committee\u2019s resolve to support the federal government to reduce the country\u2019s huge infrastructure deficit by committing more funds to the sector in 2022.\n\nThe CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele disclosed this yesterday at the closing ceremony the 12th Annual Bankers\u2019 Committee retreat.\n\nHe also added that the CBN and Bankers Committee through Infrastructure Company Limited (InfraCo) would facilitate an initial funding of N170 billion for the Lagos- Ibadan expressway, Abuja-Kano Road and the second Niger bridge which would be tolled.\n\nHe also added that as part of measures to increase foreign exchange through non-oil exports, the CBN would engage government agencies and parastatals in the sector so as to enhance export proceeds.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn 2022, the Bankers Committee will be focusing on supporting the CBN and the federal government in developing the infrastructure of the country, reducing the level of infrastructure deficit of the country; realising that there is increasing limited fiscal space to fund capital projects.\n\n\u201cThe president had given approval for the establishment of the Infraco earlier in the year. As we speak, Infraco is already working on three major infrastructure projects in the country \u2013 the Abuja -Kano road; Second Niger Bridge and the Lagos-Ibadan expressway.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cWhat Infraco has done was when the federal government approached us to provide some kind of bridge funding. The bridge funding is N170 billion provided so that those projects can move on. The entire scope of those three projects I\u2019m told is slightly above N1 trillion but the numbers are being worked on.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe by the time the asset managers effectively come on board, the details of those projects and the remaining aspects of those funding would be coming in through debt and that is where the asset managers would come in with entire scope and then we would know the detailed cost of those three projects.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he said the roads when completed would be tolled to recoup the money spent as well as for maintenance.\n\nHe added: \u201cAll of the roads will be tolled. And we know that many other countries in the world, roads are tolled because those projects are commercially viable, they can be refunded with tolls so that maintenance can be done on a regular basis and people will pay for it and enjoy good roads and enjoy good facilities because that\u2019s the only way we can fund the infrastructure of this country, which is the large amount of money needed.\u201d\n\nOn funding of Infraco and how it would be recouped, he added: \u201cWe have already said that N1 trillion out of the 15 is equity, being contributed by the CBN, African Finance Corporation, Nigerian Sovereign investment authority (NSIA) also very visible authority. The remaining N14 trillion would be accessed from debt market. And I must say that we are happy here that these are substantially going to be naira funding.\n\n\u201cThe banks have large pool of funds; the pension administrators have large pool of funds and we are reasonably optimistic that more than 50 per cent or two third of this money is going to be raised locally.\n\n\u201cBefore we begin to think about accessing international finance, we would try as much as possible to limit debt for foreign currencies particularly knowing that some of these projects and revenues are going to be generated with local currency. Where foreign currencies are needed, we will also take those and then be able to use them.\n\n\u201cWhat is important is that we are saying that within the Nigerian financial system, there is a lot of idle capital or idle forms that can be channeled if packaged the way Infraco has set up to give comfort to investors especially our local investors to really put their funds in these projects. This is a brilliant alternative financing methodology that has been brought up and we seek to really look into this. It intends to help government and private sector to raise finance, without necessarily encumbering the balance sheet of the federal government of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

But just as the transaction was nearing completion, it got stuck and the machine failed to dispense.\n\nYet, the amount was deducted from Jwan\u2019s Ecobank account, despite not receiving the cash.\n\nHe lodged several complaints at Ecobank regarding the incident but got no favourable response from the bank.\n\nAggrieved by the incident, he approached the high court in Plateau state to seek redress, with Ecobank and UBA as respondents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJwan requested the sum of N100,020 for special damages and the sum of N500,000 as general damages for negligence.\n\nAt the high court, Jwan\u2019s case was dismissed over his inability to properly discharge the burden of proof placed on him.\n\nTHE LEGAL PRECEDENT\n\nThe decision of the high court did not go down well with Jwan who subsequently proceeded to the appeal court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe appeal court ruled in favour of the appellant and awarded him the sum of N500,000 as damages.\n\nThe appeal court ruled that the respondents \u2014 Ecobank and UBA \u2014 as bankers have a duty to exercise reasonable care, diligence and skill in carrying out the instructions of the appellant, which extend to ATM transactions.\n\nThe appeal court also ruled that ATM cards issued by banks are akin to cheques, which must be honoured on request once there are enough funds in the customer\u2019s account.\n\nThe court added that the failure of the banker to honour the request of the customer in the terms of the ATM transaction is a breach of the duty of care owed to its customer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTherefore, the issuance of the ATM cards by the banks to its customers carries with it the duty to ensure that both the cards and the ATMs work as they are meant to and where there is the failure of these services to a customer, the banks are duty-bound to explain what happened,\u201d the court ruled.\n\n\u201cThis is quite common since the ATMs and their operations are under the control and management of the banks.\u201d\n\nThe verdict has created a legal precedent that bank customers can explore if there is any form of breach of duty by financial institutions.",

But just as the transaction was nearing completion, it got stuck and the machine failed to dispense.\n\nYet, the amount was deducted from Jwan\u2019s Ecobank account, despite not receiving the cash.\n\nHe lodged several complaints at Ecobank regarding the incident but got no favourable response from the bank.\n\nAggrieved by the incident, he approached the high court in Plateau state to seek redress, with Ecobank and UBA as respondents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJwan requested the sum of N100,020 for special damages and the sum of N500,000 as general damages for negligence.\n\nAt the high court, Jwan\u2019s case was dismissed over his inability to properly discharge the burden of proof placed on him.\n\nTHE LEGAL PRECEDENT\n\nThe decision of the high court did not go down well with Jwan who subsequently proceeded to the appeal court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe appeal court ruled in favour of the appellant and awarded him the sum of N500,000 as damages.\n\nThe appeal court ruled that the respondents \u2014 Ecobank and UBA \u2014 as bankers have a duty to exercise reasonable care, diligence and skill in carrying out the instructions of the appellant, which extend to ATM transactions.\n\nThe appeal court also ruled that ATM cards issued by banks are akin to cheques, which must be honoured on request once there are enough funds in the customer\u2019s account.\n\nThe court added that the failure of the banker to honour the request of the customer in the terms of the ATM transaction is a breach of the duty of care owed to its customer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTherefore, the issuance of the ATM cards by the banks to its customers carries with it the duty to ensure that both the cards and the ATMs work as they are meant to and where there is the failure of these services to a customer, the banks are duty-bound to explain what happened,\u201d the court ruled.\n\n\u201cThis is quite common since the ATMs and their operations are under the control and management of the banks.\u201d\n\nThe verdict has created a legal precedent that bank customers can explore if there is any form of breach of duty by financial institutions.",

          "title": "Ventures Platform launches a $40m fund, invites Seni Sulyman as venture partner",
          "text": "As far back as 2005, Kola Aina knew he wanted to invest in companies. He even registered a company name after his MBA program\u2014one which he\u2019s too embarrassed to share and ended up not using. After a number of rejections, unreplied messages, and bootstrapping his first business, Kola Aina launched Ventures Platform, an early-stage pan-African VC firm, in 2016.\n\nToday, Ventures Platform, announced a $40m fund for African tech startups. The new fund which has reached the first close is being led by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).\n\nThe fund features participation from experienced investors and some new leading names in Africa\u2019s technology and corporate ecosystem,, including UAC Nigeria, VFD Group, Gbenga Oyebode, Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, as well as global investors like Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, and Adam Draper. A sizable portion of the fund comes from local partners, Ventures Platform told TechCabal.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Ventures Platform has backed almost 70 startups including Seamless HR, PiggyVest, Mono, and Paystack\u2014which Stripe acquired in October 2020 for over $200m.\n\nThis new fund will allow Ventures Platform to significantly deepen its long-standing presence in Nigeria and West Africa while also investing in select companies in East, North and Francophone Africa that are able to expand across the continent.\n\n\u201cPrior to this fund, we could only write one cheque, then introduce the entrepreneur to our network of investors for a follow-on round. Now we\u2019re not only able to write their first cheque but also write follow-on rounds for our companies,\u201d Kola Aina, founder and General Partner at Ventures Platform, told TechCabal.\n\nThis new capital injection will enable Ventures Platform to double down on existing investments in its category-leading portfolio via subsequent rounds. Aina believes that being able to double down on existing investments means they can assure startups that they have a long-term capital partner. It also helps Ventures Platform defend their ownership stake in the companies, as they can participate in the upside they helped build, which is important from a returns perspective.\n\nAs part of a move to further deepen its expertise, Ventures Platform has also onboarded leading figures across African tech as Venture Partners, including Seni Sulyman (ex-VP at Andela, founder at Black Ops.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very bullish about the market; it\u2019s about the entrepreneur first. Across our portfolio, we now have two companies whose entrepreneurs we\u2019ve funded twice. We funded their first project, it didn\u2019t work; we\u2019ve funded them again,\u201d Aina said.\n\nAina has a heart for entrepreneurs as he\u2019d been one before becoming an investor.\n\nFascinated by the power of capital\n\n\u201cI was just always fascinated by the power of capital. I always wanted to end up being an investor, even when it wasn\u2019t popular.\u201d\n\nWhat attracted Aina to investing? It was the notion of giving people money and seeing them build something meaningful with it.\n\nIn 2009, Aina moved back from the US to Nigeria and co-founded Emerging Platforms, a software company. Initially, they had some customers willing to pay, but the business needed funding. They tried to raise funds but faced rejection at every corner.\n\n\u201cWe wrote a letter to every bank in Nigeria, got introductions but everyone said no. So, we went back to the drawing board and bootstrapped the business.\u201d\n\nThe harrowing experience of fundraising stayed with Aina and ignited the desire to change how people got access to capital in Africa.\n\nMaking new mistakes\n\nFortunately, the bootstrapped business thrived and Aina started angel investing in 2014. Two years later, he had an epiphany that waiting for the government and donors to solve society\u2019s problems was pointless. A better alternative was to find and fund young people using technology to solve these problems.\n\nInspired by Silicon Valley-esque accelerators, Ventures Platform was born in 2016. The initial approach was to get the best entrepreneurs from across Africa to fly into a campus in Abuja for a 16-week acceleration program. They were paired with investors, team members, capital, and mentors.\n\n\u201cObviously everyone told us acceleration is too difficult to do in Africa, but we told them we\u2019ll make new mistakes.\u201d\n\nWhile making new mistakes, they also got a few things right. One of the things Ventures Platform did then that was pioneering and different was that it was fully transparent with its terms of investing in startups. It offered $20,000 for 10% equity.\n\n\u201cAt that time it was one of the fairer deals out there,\u201d Aina said.\n\nThis transparency helped ventures attract talents like Kayode Oyewole, partner at Ventures Platform and Fola Olatunji-David, who later left the firm to become Head of Startup Success and Service at Google. Aina also believes that sharing the firm\u2019s manifesto helped move the market forward in setting the terms of evaluation for pre-seed companies in Africa.\n\nAlongside the accelerator, Aina continued investing and got to invest in startups like Paystack, Kudi, Kangbe (now Reliance HMO), Printivo and Tizeti.\n\nAfter the first year, Aina and his team saw that the accelerator wasn\u2019t ideal for the continent, so they pivoted to an early-stage fund model.\n\n\u201cWith people living together on campus, you\u2019re not just investing and helping people scale their businesses, you\u2019re also dealing with personalities. It was almost like the Big Brother House but for investing.\u201d\n\nNotably, the initial capital used to run the accelerator and invest in startups was Aina\u2019s personal funds. He had to have a conversation with his wife telling her that he needed to raid their savings to support startups.\n\n\u201cWe did over a million dollars in investments in the early days. But, in retrospect, that was a smart decision because it helped us show a track record.\u201c\n\nBy late 2017, Ventures Platform started raising external capital: syndicate funds. This happened because people who were impressed with the performance of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies wanted to invest in Ventures Platform.\n\nThe syndicate style investments continued until mid last year when Aina felt it was time for Ventures Platform to start working on raising its first institutional fund.\n\nWhy did he wait this long to raise an institutional fund?\n\n\u201cI wanted to see evidence that there\u2019s liquidity in this market before I raised an institutional fund. Startups are not just about inspiration or motivational talk. It\u2019s real business. Startup founders sometimes forget that I have to return money to my investors.\u201d\n\nWhy $40m matters\n\n2021 has been a record year for African startups as they\u2019ve raised over $4 billion so far. It\u2019s easy to see $40m, in an era where $100m raises are the new normal and wonder \u201cWhat difference does $40m make?\u201d\n\nAina believes that while the increase in capital inflow is important, the venture capital space needs to be seen as a continuum. For him, Venture Platforms\u2019 role is to find companies early and support them along the way as they gain product-market fit and look to scale.\n\n\u201cThere was a period when a company raising $500,000 was huge. Five years ago, you could count the number of local funds in the market. I think it\u2019s day one for this fund. We must not get ahead of ourselves. We want to stay disciplined. We\u2019re very clear about our thesis and are staying grounded to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The Nigeria Startup Bill (NSB) is a step closer to getting enacted into law as it has now been approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC). The approval was made on December 15, and now, the Presidency will submit the bill to the National Assembly for consideration.\n\nThe NSB aims to create an enabling environment for Nigerian startups to thrive.The three major challenges that the bill is looking to tackle are the lack of an enabling environment, unclear regulatory framework, and inadequate local content support. The bill proposes measures to ensure that these issues are addressed. For example, there will be protection and incentives, like tax breaks and access to an exclusive list of public and private-led funding opportunities, for local entrepreneurs. There will also be incentives to attract local and foreign investors to the Nigerian startup community.\n\nAlthough Nigeria has the highest number of startups on the continent\u2014about 750\u2014and holds the total highest YoY raises, it ranks below countries like South Africa, Kenya, and Tunisia in terms of business friendliness. With bans on cryptocurrency trading, and clampdowns on online investment, trading, and even social media, Nigeria\u2019s startup scene has been rocked by a few disruptive regulatory announcements in recent years.\n\nThe bill is the result of a collaborative effort between the Presidency, the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, the Nigerian Export and Promotion Council and wider government bodies. The initiative was launched in May of this year by the Presidency, in collaboration with 30 tech leaders, including Ventures Platform founder Kola Aina and Future Africa founder Iyin Aboyeji, officials of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), and the Minister of Digital Economy Isa Pantami. Since then, it has garnered almost 300 volunteers, with private sector players participating, including legal firms like TLP Advisory and Aelex, policy advisors Advocacy for Policy and Innovation (API) and Innovation for Policy Foundation, and media organisations TechCabal and Wimbart. Google Nigeria and the UK overnment, through the West Africa Research and Innovation Hub and the UK-Nigeria Tech Hub, are also backing the bill.\n\nSpeaking on recent developments, Oswald Osaretin Guobadia, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Digital Transformation and the NSB Lead said, \u201cThe NSB is one among a series of key activities the Presidency is using to drive the building of a more sustainable ecosystem for young people in Nigeria to thrive and scale.\u201d\n\nKola Aina, Founder and General Partner of Ventures Platform Fund, also added, \u201cThe bill is being proposed to provide an enabling environment for the growth of startups and guard against different challenges faced by startups such as seemingly disruptive regulations, lack of regulatory certainty, and weak infrastructure like broadband, open data, and digital platforms that limit the optimisation of the many benefits of the digital economy.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Edukoya, an African-focused online learning platform that empowers learners and their parents to access high-quality education, has raised $3.5 million in a pre-seed round led by Target Global.\n\nParticipating in the round are angel investors like Shola Akinlade, co-founder/CEO of Paystack, Babs Ogundeyi and Musty Mustapha, co-founders of Kuda, Brandon Krieg and Ed Robinson, co-founders of Stash and Raffael Johnen, CEO of Aux Money\u2014among others.\n\nFounded in May but launched into beta in December this year by former Google Nigeria boss, Honey Ogundeyi, Edukoya says it wants to empower learners and their parents to take control of their learning and make it easier for them to access high-quality learning material and expert help.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSpecifically, the platform is built to target Nigerian secondary school learners. At least that\u2019s its current proposition. Edukoya includes 24/7 exam preparation & homework tutor help, a data-driven question bank with step-by-step solutions and personalised performance tracking systems.\n\nPublic education in Nigeria is not great; there are too many factors warring against it, from low funding to incompetent teachers to bad government policy. So, quality education is only available to a small proportion of Nigerians.\n\nThe seven-month-old startup says it offers a free, supplementary learning platform, as well as subscription packages with premium features, focused on K-12 learning and exam preparation. This offering combination is expected to reduce the uneven distribution of quality education. The platform operates a 100% online model, which promotes self-paced learning that allows learners to save time and money.\n\nEdukoya app\n\n\u201cOur vision at Edukoya is to redefine online education for the next generation of Africans. Africa has the fastest-growing school-age population globally, with over 260 million students and counting,\u201d Ogundeyi, who was also the founding CMO of Kuda Bank, said while speaking on the new investment. \u201cOur goal is to democratise access and make high-quality instruction and content accessible and affordable to every student, regardless of where he or she lives on the continent.\u201d\n\nLina Chong, Investment Director at Target Global, said they [Target Global] are delighted to lead this investment and partner with Ogundeyi and her impressive team of education technology pioneers. \u201cEdukoya\u2019s mission to provide better quality to millions of African students, combined with the team\u2019s ability to execute on this ambition, left an immediate impression on myself and the whole team at Target Global. Their business has the potential to unlock learner potential and improve lives across generations\u2019.\u201d\n\nEdukoya app\n\nThis funding is the biggest pre-seed investment for African edtech and also the biggest investment raised by a Nigerian female single founder. The company plans to use the funds to go from beta to live launch in Nigeria by 2022. It will also accelerate its product and technology as well as expand its online curriculum content coverage and on-demand tutoring feature for secondary school learners.\n\nRegarding funding, the African edtech scene was off to a slow start this year, but its pulse is finally picking up. Even though it\u2019s a large market to serve, competition is getting stronger with the presence of platforms like uLesson that recently secured a $15m check to double-down on the same market segment Edukoya sets its eyes on.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s still too early to know who will emerge as industry leader, regardless of who launches first.\n\nShare this article",

But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nAuthor Mu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 I bully myself because I make me do what I put my mind to.

From someone buying a $2.5 million land to another paying $450,000 to be Snoop Dogg\u2019s virtual neighbour, it appears to be a valuable investment.\n\nWhat makes them valuable? Why so much money is being spent on \u2018real\u2019 estate that cannot be lived in is a mystery. But some people believe it\u2019s the future and what better time to invest than now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, investing in the metaverse isn\u2019t free. If you\u2019re looking to invest through real estate, the cheapest parcel of land on Decentraland \u2014 a blockchain-based virtual universe \u2014 is 3ETH ($12,000).\n\nNestcoin is offering Africans an entry point into the metaverse through gaming. It has launched Metaverse Magna, a gaming guild/community that provides Africans with assets that helps them enter play-to-earn competitions.\n\nGo deeper: Nestcoin\u2019s new product, Metaverse Magna, wants to help Africans earn by playing games in the metaverse\n\nEdukoya\u2019s $3.5m pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrican edtech startups seem to be on a roll. Barely a week after uLesson\u2019s $15 million Series B, Nigeria\u2019s Edukoya is announcing its $3.5 million pre-seed.\n\nThe round was led by Target Global, with participation from an exciting lineup of angel investors, including Paystack Co-founder, Shola Akinlade and Kuda Bank Co-founders Babs Ogundeyi and Musty Mustapha.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Edukoya launched in December 2021 and is currently in beta with plans to go live fully in 2022.\n\nInteresting! Yes, it\u2019s pretty jaw-dropping, but the startup\u2019s founder, Honey Ogundeyi, isn\u2019t a newbie in the tech space. She was the former Country Director for UK-Nigeria Tech-Hub, Kuda\u2019s founding CMO and Founder of online fashion marketplace, Fashpa.\n\nCommenting on the funding, Ogundeyi said the startup\u2019s vision is to redefine online education and democratise access to high-quality content, making it available to all students across the continent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEdtech is growing, but there\u2019s quite a bit that needs to be done. Online education needs the Internet, smartphones and computers to thrive. However, Africa\u2019s Internet penetration rate is still at 39%, lower than the global average of 58%.\n\nIn the words of Boye Oshinaga, Gradely CEO, \u201cThe edtech industry is at its infrastructure-building phase in Nigeria and Africa, where those players that invest in the rails will get a big payoff in the coming years.\u201d\n\nThe future of edtech will be interesting. To get a glimpse of what it could look like, check out Ogheneruemu\u2019s article: Technology, funding, learning models: What is the next frontier for edtech startups in Africa?\n\nA Wowzi funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWowzi-team. Source: TechCrunch\n\nWowzi, a Kenyan startup that connects social media users to businesses, has bagged $3.2 million in funding.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the funding combines a $2 million seed round led by 4DX Ventures and a $1.2 million pre-seed round. Other participants in the round include Golden Palm Investments, LoftyInc Capital and Future Africa.\n\nWhat does Wowzi do? The startup turns social media users into brand influencers. With just 250 followers on social media, Wowzi can help you make money through influencing.\n\nWow! Oh yeah. It categorises influencers from nano, mega, meta, to super.\n\nAccording to Johnny Falla, Chief Development and Growth Officer at Wowzi, \u201cBrands want to have more authentic engagements or endorsements for products, from people who use and love them and can talk about real practical applications. Our campaigns show that nano influencers deliver better sales leads because of higher trust with their following,\u201d\n\nThe startup helps brands filter through influencers based on specific demographics such as age, income level, gender, and location.\n\nSo far, it has worked with 200 brands and carried out 15,000 campaigns since 2019. Wowzi is currently present in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. And the funding will be geared towards expanding into Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nA Barrel of Rotten Apples.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of what the metaverse is or could be still eludes many people.\n\nHowever, millions of dollars are being invested in this virtual universe.\n\nOn November 29, 2021, BusinessToday.in reported that Canadian investment firm, Tokens.com, spent $2.5 million on a virtual land in the metaverse.\n\nThe land was bought on Decentraland, a blockchain-based virtual world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, the land has an address. It\u2019s located in the fashion street district of Decentraland. A place where fashion shows and probably concerts will be held in the metaverse.\n\nWhile the idea still seems unreal, the amount of money being invested is very real.\n\nIn 2017, Decentraland raised $26 million in Initial Coin Offerings (ICO).\n\nIn fact, Facebook, one of the most valuable companies globally, changed its name to Meta and has spent $50 million on research into the metaverse.\n\nAlthough the metaverse might seem like the future everyone should get in on, there are still major barriers to entry, including money and education.\n\nThe cheapest piece of Decentraland land costs 3ETH, roughly $12,000. Besides being expensive, how does one find land in a virtual world?\n\nHowever, lands aren\u2019t the only form of investment on the metaverse; there\u2019s also gaming.\n\nNestcoin\u2019s new product, Metaverse Magna (MVM), is creating a path for Africans that\u2019ll ease them into the metaverse through games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is gaming on the metaverse all about?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxie Infinity homepage\n\nBe it in the metaverse, on a PlayStation, or a mobile game, gaming is pretty much the same thing.\n\nBut in the metaverse, gaming is done a bit differently.\n\nAxie Infinity is, to date, the most established metaverse gaming platform. Unlike regular games, Axie Infinity exists on a blockchain which means you buy and sell characters, upgrades, and power-ups with cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe platform, created in 2018 by a Vietnamese company called Sky Mavis, is currently valued at $3 billion.\n\nKnown simply as Axie, it allows gamers to earn as much as $2,000 monthly.\n\nGamers on the platform grew to 1.8 million in August this year, and about 40% are from the Philippines.\n\nWhere does Nestcoin\u2019s Metaverse Magna come in?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetaverse Magna home paage\n\nTo enter the brightly coloured metaverse with strange-looking game characters on Axie Infinity, you need to own gaming creatures or a variety of things known as assets.\n\nThese creatures, regardless of how weird they look, do not come cheap. According to Rest Of World, game assets can set you back as much as $1,500. That\u2019s over 2000% higher than Nigeria\u2019s minimum wage.\n\nAccording to research by market research and data specialist firm, KLA, only 3% of the people who own crypto in South Africa have up to $3,000 worth of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile expensive Axie assets are a barrier, the metaverse is still in its infancy, and not many people understand how to get in.\n\nNestcoin\u2019s MVM wants to help players get these creatures while getting a percentage of their earnings. Something like AltSchool. for gaming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Metaverse Magna gamers.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, Onyinye Umeaka, MVM General Manager, said, \u201cWe are sponsoring anyone out there with access to the Internet, and just the commitment to improving their quality of life with an opportunity to earn a good living playing crypto games.\u201d\n\nShe said MVM would purchase the assets and create gaming accounts, lend the accounts to players willing to learn, play, and earn.\n\n\u201cAs the players play, they earn cryptocurrency, and based on the earnings, we split it between ourselves and the players, the players get to keep 70% based on performance, and then we get to keep 30%.\u201d\n\nGaming scholarships started in the Philippines\n\nWhile the rest of the world had the pandemic and lockdowns to contend with last year, the Philippines also struggled with typhoons and floods. And when it became almost impossible to get jobs, some people turned to gaming.\n\nPer Rest Of Worlds, \u201cWorkers in the Global South are making a living playing the blockchain game, Axie Infinity.\u201d\n\nIn the Philippines, there are platforms such as MVM that offer scholarships to gamers. For example, there\u2019s Yield Guild Games (YGG), managing up to 4,7000 players or scholars as they\u2019re called.\n\nEven VC\u2019s are investing\n\nYGG raised $4.6 million in August this year to accelerate play-to-earn gaming. Claiming to have earned up to $8.6 million with Axie Infinity, it plans to buy more gaming assets and onboard more scholars.\n\nAlthough nowhere near YGG, MVM is already making moves in crypto gaming.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been running the experiment now for a couple of months. We actually have about 130 plus players already playing the games within our scholarship programme,\u201d Umeaka said.\n\nUnlike YGG, however, MVM is a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO). This means MVM is a community of players, community managers, and development managers.\n\nPlayers are coached and trained on strategies that will help them win games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn MVM gamer, playing games\n\nAlthough MVM seems more centralised than decentralised, Umeaka said it\u2019d be a DAO with its own tokens where gamers and investors will be the stakeholders.\n\nMVM was created in partnership with Old Fashion Research (OFR), a multi-strategy blockchain investment fund.\n\nNestcoin CEO and Co-founder, Yele Bademosi, believes the play-to-earn metaverse could get a lot of Africans out of poverty.\n\nHowever, Middle, Eastern, and Western Africa still have low Internet penetration rates of 26%, 24%, and 42%, respectively. Lower than the global average of 59.5%.\n\nWith the amount of volatility associated with all things crypto-related, it\u2019s only a matter of time before we can say for sure that crypto gaming will continue to be valuable.\n\nAuthor Bolu Abiodun He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "The Nigerian government says it is keen on forming collaborative partnerships with the private sector in a bid to grow the economy using gas, showing a new oil law as evidence of its intention, but operators say more is required.\n\nIn a speech at the Business Forum organised by the Nigeria Gas Association (NGA) on Tuesday, Temipre Sylva, Nigeria\u2019s minister of state for petroleum resources, who was represented by Justice Deferaka, his technical adviser, said, \u201cThe bedrock of the government\u2019s \u2018Decade of Gas\u2019 pronouncement is collaborative partnership to achieve smooth gas transition by 2060 as stated by the president during the Conference of Parties (COP 26).\n\n\u201cWe need to collaborate across a broad spectrum and dimensions that is government industry, academia and professional associations like the Nigeria Gas Association.\n\n\u201cTo make that happen, individual and corporate Nigerians, as well as governments at all levels, must develop a new enlightenment, an energy literacy that includes a profound understanding that energy pervades all aspects of life.\u201d\n\nAccording to the minister, \u201cThe guiding principle for our country in creating an exceptional energy system for the 21st Century must be \u201cresponsible development.\u201d\n\nDevelopment is responsible when it recognises the interests and values involved with energy matters in four dimensions, namely \u2013 economic, environmental, and social and energy security.\n\nAn indication of the government resolve is the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act, which prescribes terms for gas and provides incentives for investors, Sylva said.\n\nRead also: High cooking gas price: 130 Ebonyi households to benefit from clean stove\n\nThe Federal Government\u2019s gas expansion programme seeks to expand gas domestically in transport as in natural gas vehicles, petrochemicals feedstock, in making fertilisers and cutting flaring.\n\n\u201cGas is what Nigeria needs as we face up to a period of profound change,\u201d he said.\n\nFurther evidence of this intention is seen in the fact that the sector is moving towards a willing seller, willing buyer commercial gas arrangement, according to Mele Kyari, Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) group managing director in his remarks.\n\n\u201cWe know that the framework that is on ground today is enough for people to invest their money and get back their investment and also recover their costs,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the NGA at different times in the past has called on the government to liberalise gas pricing, a factor that inhibits investments into the sector.\n\n\u201cThe gas supply industry must be anchored on a willing-seller willing-buyer framework to unlock further investments in gas exploration and delivery infrastructure. There should be a removal of price controls and concessional gas tariffs for sections of the market that are critical to achieving overall economic growth objectives,\u201d noted the NGA in a recent communiqu\u00e9.\n\nThe NNPC boss said the Corporation was getting huge commitments from partners across the globe and even locally to form partnerships. But it remains to be seen how much of these partnerships materialise and translate to value in the economy.\n\nPartnerships with International Oil Companies have led to poor fiscal terms for oil in deep onshore basins before they were reviewed and have precipitated the absence of gas terms after over half a century of oil and gas production. This has led to vast amounts of gas being flared in a country where half the population lack access to electricity.\n\nFaruk Ahme, chief executive for Nigeria Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority, said, \u201cUnlocking the huge investment opportunities inherent in this sector request supportive regulatory frameworks that promote investors\u2019 confidence and sustainable development of the sector.\u201d Only his agency is tasked with creating these policies.\n\nSome operators at the NGA Business Forum harped on some of the limitations of the PIA.\n\nOsagie Osunbor, country chair of Shell Companies in Nigeria, said: \u201cI\u2019m glad that PIA in its present form now recognises gas as a standalone hydrocarbon provides a legal framework for gas activities like exploration, development and production in addition to a new framework for gas pricing, while we commend this act, I\u2019m quick to say the act is not yet perfect.\n\n\u201cFor instance, in the current PIA, gas incentives rely heavily on the amount of liquids than gas thus making non-associated gas reserves, that are low in liquids, ie. Dry Non-Associated Gas (NAG) projects, less attractive for development. This I believe requires another look into by the government and different agencies as well as the industry.\u201d\n\nThe implication is that investors may not be as sufficiently motivated as the government claims.\n\nAccording to data obtained from the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), as at 2016, Nigeria\u2019s proven natural gas reserve stood at 192 trillion cubic feet (tcf), made up of 51 percent Associated Gas (AG), produced as a by-product of the production of crude oil, and 49 percent NAG.\n\nBy 2021, Nigeria\u2019s proven natural gas reserves now stands at 206.53tcf with AG, accounting for 100.73tcf while NAG, now at 105.80tcf has surpassed associated gas. But operators say there is not much incentive for those developing non-associated gas.\n\nThe PIA has sprung gas out of the shadows of oil, set up a new regulatory framework and fiscal terms, legislated cost reflective tariffs for gas transportation assets, has even instituted better incentives for domestic gas supply and sanctions for the non-supply for of domestic gas delivery obligations, a liberalised pricing, the holy grail of investments still falls far short.\n\nThe NGA Business Forum with the theme \u201cPetroleum Industry Act (PIA): Progress & Opportunities In The Decade of Gas,\u2019\u2019 saw industry experts speak on how collaboration taking advantage of the new Petroleum Industry Act has created new investment opportunities that could transform Nigeria\u2019s economy.",

          "title": "Omicron: Event planners, attendees face fresh struggles on Lagos restrictions",
          "text": "Lagos\u2019 fresh ban on social gathering, clad in the form of measures to mitigate the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, has activated new struggles for event planners and attendees, dampening hopes of festivity with impractical guidelines.\n\nIn lieu of the outright suspension of concerts, carnivals, parties, night-clubbing, and restriction on time and occupancy at worship centres imposed in December 2020, the government\u2019s directive this year is that anyone attending an event has to provide proof of partial or full vaccination. Unvaccinated people must provide a negative PCR test result within 72 hours.\n\nThe test is expected to be done either at an event venue or in selected private laboratories 24 hours before an event, a move considered an unrealistic expectation.\n\nEvent organisers are required to request rapid tests at event sites through an application on the Lagos State Safety Commission website: www.lasgsafetyreg.com.\n\nIt is unclear if organisers should foot the bill of the tests out-of-pocket for all attendants or the state government that has failed to make testing accessible to all, with symptoms that fit its case definition of COVID-19 infection will be keen to offer testing to worshippers, party-goers and night-clubbers, among others.\n\nPeople expressing symptoms of COVID-19 in Lagos are often referred from state-run hospitals to private laboratories to pay out-of-pocket for tests.\n\nInformation required on the event safety clearance form provided on the website of the safety commission covers mainly event name, type, start date, end date, start time, end time, name and address of event venue, estimated guests, venue capacity, social centre number of event venue and available parking.\n\nMany are worried that this would dovetail into another bout of selective enforcement on corporate and organised private groups, leaving many informal groups to enjoy festivity inhibited.\n\nPublic health experts, who spoke with BusinessDay, say the motif to block potential super spreader events for COVID-19 infections is proactive but scores the means ineffective and impracticable.\n\nThey say the best measures remain promotion of social distancing, face-masking, and curbing of overcrowded events.\n\nRead also: Management institute tasked on strategies to mitigate impact of Covid-19 on organizations\n\nAkin Osibogun, a professor of Public Health at the College of Medicine, University of Lagos, questions the practicality of testing at all events in a state that is both the melting point of Nigeria\u2019s cultural and entertainment activities and the most populated.\n\n\u201cHow practicable is it? As we are talking now parties are happening at Yaba, Surulere, and Lagos Island. Well, if local governments are active they might be able to monitor them. But to say that party goers will take rapid diagnostic tests is not practicable,\u201d Osibogun said.\n\n\u201cThey need to be clearer as to what they expect. This virus is still mutating. Fortunately, so far, the information we have about the Omicron is that it is not so virulent. But we don\u2019t know what other variant will emerge. If a more virulent variant emerges, then we will be in trouble. So, the best thing is to take precautions,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen BusinessDay contacted Adewumi Okoh, public affairs officer, Lagos Safety Commission, for clarifications and answers on the practicality of enforcing these guidelines at all events at this period, she declined, asking that questions be directed to the director-general via a text or mail.\n\nOkoh later linked this reporter up with Lanre Mojola, the director-general, who explained that the new rule was part of efforts to stem the spread of Omicron and was mainly designed for large events of over 500 people, exempting religious programmes.\n\nHe did not clarify who is to foot the bill, but said there had been an uptick in compliance rate with the Commission moving from registering about 400 events weekly on the average to 1,000 since the state government officially reeled out the new rule.\n\n\u201cIf you are organising an event of over 500 people, your duty is to ensure that people who are not vaccinated do not come into those event. The whole point is for people to go and get vaccinated. In the event that you have not been vaccinated, then we are requesting for a negative PCR test, within 72 hours,\u201d Mojola said.\n\n\u201cOnce you have failed to be guided by the Lagos State Infectious Disease regulation of 2020, we will kick in terms of enforcement,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from testing, the vaccination rate has also been poor with the racing to move the percentage up from 1.6 percent to 30 percent within the next year. The state is targeting 8 million doses for four out of over 20 million residents under its Count Me in Campaign, yet expects that every event attendee this festive season must carry a vaccination proof.\n\nBabajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos State governor on Tuesday, announced that the state was now seeing early indications of a fourth wave with a current positivity rate at 6 percent, from 0.1 percent mid-November.\n\nAs of December 5, Lagos had recorded a total of 78,564 confirmed cases of COVID-19.\n\nWhereas, as of December 27, 2020, confirmed cases were 28,774. It was the beginning of the second wave as average daily cases moved between 100 and 459. The positivity rate was at 16 percent.\n\n\u201cBased on our analysis, the fourth wave was brought by the non-adherence to the laid down protocols to mitigate this pandemic. I would want to use this opportunity once again appeal to everyone to get vaccinated and join hands with the state government in managing this wave of pandemic in this festive season by following the guidelines we have set, especially regarding the use of face masks, public gatherings and travelling in and out of Lagos State,\u201d he said in a press statement.\n\nA film-maker, who asked to be identified as Aquala, assessing the guidelines, said people could be more encouraged to adhere if the government takes on the responsibility of testing.\n\nIf implemented otherwise, the impact will not be limited to the entertainment industry alone but could spread to the entire economy.\n\n\u201cIt means that if people cannot do events, then they will be forced to lay-off staff. I don\u2019t think the government has any economic or welfare plans to cushion unpaid people this festive season. You cannot make a rule that is not economically viable. If you are saying tests should be done, then the tests should be provided by the government,\u201d he said.\n\nOkafor Valentine, chief executive of OVC Entertainment, an organisation that trains models and organises fashion shows, said the policy would affect his business negatively by reducing viewership of his shows, cutting ticket sales.\n\nAlthough he thinks that the wellbeing of his team is of priority and everyone must do what they can to reduce the spread of COVID-19\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fully vaccinated and I\u2019ve advised my team members to do the same. I have friends that died of COVID-19. I also have friends that survived COVID-19. So, if people are saying there is no COVID-19 or they want to turn deaf ears to prevention measures, it is left to them,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nABUJA \u2013 The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) on Wednesday in Abuja, winged four pilots and 12 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operators who successfully completed their Basic Helicopter Pilot Training at the Draken Europe Helicopter Academy, U.K.\n\nThe Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, expressed delight for the additional expertise in the NAF ever-expanding inventory of manned and unmanned aircraft systems.\n\nAmao noted that the training was part of his vison of enhancing and sustaining critical airpower capabilities required for deployment in pursuit of national security imperatives.\n\n\u201dI am glad to note that, through foresight and diligence, we are effectively engaging one of the key drivers of my vision which is to pursue purposeful training and human capacity development.\n\n\u201cThe foregoing is based on the premise that, for NAF to function efficiently, both as a highly technical service and as a fighting force for the effective defence of Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity, it must have the right numerical strength.\n\n\u201cAnd, more importantly, the right quality of manpower in all relevant competencies.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we have continued to train personnel of all specialties both locally and abroad.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, officers, airmen and airwomen of the service are undergoing training in various countries including the U.S., South Africa, India, Belgium, Egypt and Pakistan, among others.\n\n\u201cIn addition, hundreds of personnel across all specialties are being trained locally in spite of budgetary constraints.\n\n\u201cIn the area of pilot training, 11 student pilots are currently undergoing training in South Africa, while three are undergoing Alpha Jet conversion in Egypt.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, 12 student pilots are undergoing Super Tucano training and four student pilots are undergoing helicopter training in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIndeed, two of these student helicopter pilots have completed their training and are expected to graduate very soon.\u201d\n\nThe CAS added that, within the country, 12 student pilots are undergoing Basic Fighter Training while two have recently completed jet conversion at 403 Flying Training School, Kano.\n\nHe added that 12 student pilots were undergoing Basic Transport Training, 32 undergoing Ab-Initio Flying Training and eight undergoing Instructor Training at 401 Flying Training School, Kaduna.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, 22 trainees are undergoing UAV Initial and Basic Training at 401 FTS, while 16 student pilots are undergoing Helicopter Pilot Training at the International Helicopter Flying School Enugu.\u201c\n\nAmao explained that all these efforts were targeted at ensuring combat readiness at significantly higher levels to counter both domestic and foreign threats to the nation\u2019s security.\n\n\u201cIn furtherance of this, we also recently reviewed the curricula for the various schools in the NAF Institute of Technology to meet expected standards, while also conducting instructional training for the instructors to ensure enhanced performance.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the training curriculum for NAF cadets in the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) has been reviewed and new criteria specified for NAF officers that can be eligible for posting to the Academy as instructors.\n\n\u201cIn addition, I authorised the audit of selected ground and flying institutions in NAF by a team of experienced retired senior officers with a view to upgrading the practices and facilities at the institutions to meet international standards.\u201c\n\nAmao noted that the ongoing efforts would go a long way in positioning the institutions as centres of excellence in producing pilots, engineers, technicians and other specialists.\n\nThis, he said, would avail the personnel the opportunity to be well equipped to carry out their constitutional roles more effectively and efficiently in the defence of the territorial integrity of the country.\n\n\u201cSpecial arrangements are also currently being made to upgrade UAV training facilities to enhance the operational capacity of UAV operators in anticipation of increased tempo of air operations with the recently acquired UAVs.\n\n\u201cWhile sustaining capacity building programmes for the NAF Regiment in joint efforts for synergy of air-ground integrated operations with sister services.\u201c\n\nThe CAS congratulated the young pilots and UAVs operators for successfully completing their various courses.\n\n\u201cYou have put in the necessary hard work to get to this stage and your efforts have been recognised with the pinning of wings on your uniforms.\n\n\u201cYou have therefore, left the stage of student aviators and have become pilots and UAV operators responsible for utilisation of national resources in our counter-insurgency and other security efforts.\n\n\u201cIt is expected that you apply and build on your current experiences during your pre-deployment tactical training.\n\n\u201cLike I advised the last set of pilots and UAV

The stakes are too high; we cannot allow Nigeria to continue the way it is going.\n\n\u201cOur great party must come to the rescue and take over the reins of power in this country. What we see ahead is not pleasant at all. I just pray that God Almighty sees us through next year, financially, so that we can even have presidential elections.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI don\u2019t just see how we can continue to be deceiving ourselves. We try to prevent the country from growing by limiting and restricting imports, coming with all forms of phantom excuses to limit people from buying and importing what they cannot produce and need to live.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, they are restricting foreign exchange availability; they are just throwing millions of Nigerians into poverty.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy commitment today is to our great party, the PDP.

Atiku Abubakar is a Nigerian that is committed to this country; his achievements are visible. So, he is eminently qualified to contest the position of President of Nigeria and as you know, at the end of the day, power ultimately comes from God.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Dokpesi commended the governor for his giant strides and transformational projects embarked upon by his administration since he assumed office.\n\nHe noted, \u201cThe way and manner that people are suffering across the country is not acceptable. We have never been so divided as a nation; everybody now refers to us as the poverty capital of the world. All the indices clearly show that we are a failed state.\n\n\u201cEven in Abuja, we are afraid of the possibility of invasion by Boko Haram, bandits, and unknown gunmen.

But I owe a duty to myself and to put the record straight for posterity about the big lie that Bola Tinubu built my house in Lekki for me.\n\n\u201cI therefore deny categorically that my house at Lekki was built with my resources through the sale of 3 developed properties, loan from GTBank and the sale of undeveloped landed property given me by my late leader Chief Obafemi Awolowo of blessed memory.\n\nAdebanjo gave detailed information about how build the said house as follows:\n\n\u201cA 4-bedroom duplex with 2 bedroom flat enclosed with 2 undeveloped plots at plot 4, block 14, Nuru Oniwo Street, Aguda Surulere, Lagos State, this is where I was living before moving to Lekki,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe house was commissioned in 1972 by Chief Obafemi Awolowo.\n\n\u201cA wing of the duplex was once occupied by a staff of the security outfit then known as \u2018special branch\u2019 headed then by the late Alhaji M.D. Yussuf who later became Inspector General of Police when General Olusegun Obasanjo was the Head of State.\n\n\u201cIt was later occupied by one of the wives Chief Pius Akinyelure, who often visit his wife there in company of Senator Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201cThe gate of this property was forced open by Abacha security forces when NADECO was holding a sendoff party for American ambassador Walter Carrington in my house, I took the Federal Government to court for damages and I was awarded #1million naira which has not been paid till today by the Federal Government, Mr. Olisa Agbakoba SAN, was my counsel.\n\n\u201cThe house was sold to St Baths Anglican Church, Aguda, Surulere.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo storey building at Odedola Street, Surulere, Lagos State.\n\n\u201cI bought it through an Estate Agent by name Mr. Shiwoniku who has relocated to UK, he has a brother who is a legal practitioner in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe house was sold to a Ghanaian by name Mr Akappo.\n\n\u201cHe is still alive and he lives in one of the flat in the building.\n\n\u201cFour storey building with a warehouse on the ground floor and six flats on top. It was commissioned by Chief Awolowo in 1977.\n\n\u201cI inherited the plot of 45\u2019X100\u2019 from my mother Salamotu Anomo-Adebanjo, who built a bungalow on it.\n\n\u201cShe bought the land when I was in primary school in 1940 from one Pa. Idowu Onitiri for \u00a320, which she paid by installment of \u00a310, \u00a37, \u00a33. His son Akanbi Onitiri, executed the conveyance for me without extra payment after showing him the purchase receipts from his father, when I was developing it in 1976. Akanbi Onitiri is the father of Sumbo Onitiri, a well known estate surveyor in Lagos.\n\n\u201cThe building was sold to a woman through an estate agent. I then took a loan from GTBank to complete the house in Lekki where I am living now.\n\n\u201cWhen the interest on the loan became unbearable, I was compelled to sell the undeveloped land given to me by Chief Awolowo in Dide-Olu Estate in Maroko Victoria Island. One Mr. Ade Otusanya a friend of my son Femi Ayo-Adebanjo bought the land.\n\n\u201cThe contractor who built my Lekki house is Engr. Hakeem Sulaiman, Senior Partner of Messrs HA associates.\n\n\u201cThe Electrical and Mechanical Contractor is Engr.

His house in Ibadan was also alleged to have been built by the contractor that built the secretariat in Oshogbo, when he was the Governor of Osun State.\n\n\u201cI hereby challenge Chief Bisi Akande to clear the air by disclosing the source of financing these properties as I have done above.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Bola Tinubu, the great philanthropist should also disclose the source of his wealth with which he bankrolled the elections of APC in the Southwest and that of General Muhammad Buhari and his various properties in Lagos.\n\n\u201cHe should also authorize the EFCC to verify such details as I have done above.\u201d",

In these countries, the ongoing pandemic is worsening poverty, undermining growth, and jeopardizing the prospects of resilient and inclusive development.\n\nIt said countries are struggling with falling government revenues; increasing debt vulnerabilities; rising risks to fragility, conflict, and instability; and dropping literacy rates. About a third of IDA countries are facing a looming food crisis.\n\n\u201cTo help countries build back greener, a substantial portion of these funds go to tackling climate change, with a focus on helping countries to adapt to rising climate impacts and preserve biodiversity. IDA will also deepen support to countries to better prepare for future crises, including pandemics, financial shocks, and natural hazards. While IDA20 will support countries globally, resources are increasingly benefiting Africa, which will receive about 70% of the funding,\u201d the World Bank said.",

          "text": "The United Kingdom (UK) government yesterday removed Nigeria and 10 other African countries from the controversial red list under which it banned flights from African countries, following the outbreak of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in South Africa.\n\nThis is even as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has conceded seven slots to Air Peace to end the diplomatic row with Nigeria.\n\nAccording to a statement issued yesterday by the British High Commission in Abuja this decision followed the review of the latest risk assessment from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), stressing that Nigeria and the other 10 countries and territories on the red list will be removed from 4am Wednesday 15 December.\n\nThe statement said that \u201call passengers arriving from Nigeria, Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe will not have to stay in a managed quarantine hotel on arrival in England from this date.\n\nThe UK said further that while all countries have now been removed from the red list, the managed quarantine hotel policy remains in place to act as a crucial line of defence against the importation of variants of concern.\n\nLEADERSHIP had earlier reported that the red list was to be rescinded just two weeks after it was introduced, following intense pressures from Nigerian travelers and the Nigerian government, which threatened retaliation.\n\nThe UK government added Nigeria to the travel red list from Monday December 6, noting that people traveling to the UK from any country will need to take a pre-departure test from December\n\nThe red list was greeted with severe protests from officials in Nigeria and other affected African countries, as travelers in quarantine complained of six-hour journeys to hotels and \u201cgrim\u201d food.\n\nThe red list forced thousands into hotel quarantine at a cost of \u00a32,285 per person for 10 days.\n\nBowing to pressure, the British government noted in a statement: \u201cAll vaccinated passengers arriving in the UK must continue to take a pre-departure test two days or less before they depart for the UK and must take a PCR test on or before day 2 and self-isolate until they receive a negative result.\n\n\u201cThese testing measures are vital in helping to prevent any additional cases of Omicron from entering the UK and stopping people from passing it on to others.\u201d\n\nIt said that as Omicron cases rise in the UK and in countries around the world, the travel red list is less effective in slowing the incursion of the variant from abroad and these temporary measures are no longer proportionate.\n\nIt noted that the red list has successfully served its purpose in delaying the spread of Omicron into the UK to buy time for scientists to learn more about this variant.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical phase in tackling the Omicron and the Government\u2019s focus remains on slowing the spread of the variant in the UK \u2013 through maintaining testing requirements at the border, through the introduction of Plan B measures, and by turbocharging the booster rollout.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday 14th December, UK Ministers made the decision \u2013 based on scientific and public health data \u2013 to remove Nigeria from the UK\u2019s travel red list. The emergence of the Omicron variant is a reminder that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, and like all countries around the world the UK has had to take difficult decisions to protect public health.\n\n\u201cWe took this necessary precautionary action to give us time to understand the challenge we and others faced, and to slow down the spread of Omicron while scientists urgently assessed what impact the variant has on vaccines, treatments and transmissibility.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhen we announced the heightened restrictions we made clear that we would remove them as soon as we could, and that is the decision Ministers have taken today.\n\n\u201cI know this will be welcome news for students, tourists, businesses and families in the UK and Nigeria, although I recognise the impact that these temporary health measures have had,\u201d the statement added.\n\nUK Health and Social Care Secretary, Sajid Javid, also said, \u201cThe red list bought our scientists time to learn more about Omicron and to slow the seeding of the variant from abroad into the UK. Now that there are high levels of community transmission, it is right to remove the red list and focus on our national effort to tackle Omicron.\n\n\u201cWith cases doubling every two to three days we\u2019ve turbocharged our booster programme, we\u2019re asking arrivals to keep testing to limit the spread of new cases, and we are introducing Plan B measures to protect the country from the threat of this new variant.\u201d\n\nJavid however warned that \u201crestrictions will be re-imposed should there be a need to do so to protect public health\u201d.\n\nHe said also that airlines will continue to check all passengers for pre-departure tests alongside their completed Passenger Locator Form, even as passengers will not be allowed to board a flight without providing evidence of a negative test result.\n\n\u201cThe government will take further action if necessary to contain the virus and the new variant, as has been the case throughout the pandemic. The UKHSA continues to monitor the situation closely, in partnership with scientific and public health organisations across the world, and the government is working collaboratively with the World Health Organisation and countries around the world to better understand the new variant,\u201d the statement added.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has conceded seven slots to Air Peace to end the diplomatic row with Nigeria.\n\nThis was after the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) withdrew the ministerial approval granted Emirates Airlines by the Ministry of Aviation over reduction of Air Peace slot to Sharjah Airport.\n\nIt was also gathered that the UAE\u2019s Authority granted the Nigerian carrier the permit to fly directly to Dubai instead of Sharjah Airport, it was learnt.\n\nThe General Civil Aviation Authority, it was learnt, sent a December 13, 2021 letter to Air Peace, though the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not copied in breach of protocol.\n\nThe federal government was however said to have received the letter.\n\nIn a letter obtained by LEADERSHIP yesterday with reference number DCAA/ASA/N-3/014 and addressed to the chairman, Air Peace, Allen Onyema, the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA), the authority said slots have been provided for Air Peace at Dubai Airport.\n\nThe letter signed by the director general of DCAA, Mohammed Ahii, said relationship between the two countries have gone a long way and cannot be allowed to go sour.\n\nThe DCAA said that the slots cannot be provided indefinitely and urged them to respond to the offer on or before Thursday December 20, 2021.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201cWe write in reference to Air Peace\u2019s possible/intended operations to/from Dubai Airports (DXB). We have received information from Dubai Airports, with regard to slot availability at DX8 Terminal 1 and as a gesture of goodwill and in support of UAE and Nigeria relations, in case Air Peace wishes to start their flights, slots have been blocked by Dubai Airports.\n\n\u201cSlots available and blocked for Air Peace are the following: AOSSOLT DOSOOLT \u2013 All days and A0S10LT DOSOOLT \u2013 without day 6 .\n\n\u201cAs these slots cannot be blocked indefinitely, we would highly appreciate it if Air Peace could kindly reach out to Dubai Airports -ACL and inform them of their intentions to operate by Thursday 16th December, 2021 and accordingly confirm the blocked slots.\n\n\u201cDubai Airports have also confirmed that dnata \u2014 the ground handling agents at OXB have sent the ground handling quotation to Ms. Reham Mustafa \u2014 Country Manager and also, Emirates Flight Catering is working on the quotation and should send it out latest by tomorrow morning.\n\n\u201d For landing permissions, they could contact our Air Transport Section as detailed below: Landing Permissions: air.transport@dcaa.gov.\u201d\n\nBut Air Peace has denounced knowledge of any letter offering them seven slots to Dubai.\n\nOne of the managers of the airline who did not want his name in print because he was not authorised to talk on the matter said nothing has changed as the airline can still not fly into the UAE.\n\nAccording to the source, the laid down procedure is for the government of the UAE to write directly to the Nigerian government and not to Air Peace directly, even if such a letter existed.\n\nHe queried the sincerity of the UAE government in ending the fiasco, saying \u201cif they are ready to end the crisis, are they not supposed to write to the Nigerian government? They should write to us because this is a diplomatic issue and the diplomatic procedure is for them to write to Nigerian government and not Air Peace\u201d.",

          "text": "By GBENGA ADEOLA\n\nLASG set to implement monthly tenancy on property occupancy, says Governor\n\nGov vows to eradicate land grabbing menace\n\nIn line with his administration\u2019s commitment to bridge the housing deficit and create affordable accommodation for residents, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Tuesday commissioned and delivered 744 home units at LagosHOMS Sangotedo Housing Scheme Phase I in Eti-Osa East Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of the State.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu said the various homes being delivered to the public in the last two and half years is the administration\u2019s way of building bridges and promoting the emergence of new communities that are resilient and responsive to both communal and individual aspirations.\n\nThe 744 home units in LagosHOMS Sangotedo Housing Scheme (Phase 1), which is the largest housing scheme to be completed by the present administration comprises 62 blocks of 12 homes each made up of a total of 248 one-bedroom, 248 two-bedrooms and 248 three bedrooms apartments.\n\nThe gated estate also has car park space for 492 cars within compounds and 406 at the general car park, external electrification provided from the National grid with an injection station of 15MVA and seven transformers of 500KVA capacity, water treatment and supply with a storage capacity of 192m3 and 680m3 capacity for the overhead and groundwater tanks respectively, sewage system with a treatment capacity of 650m3 per day, street lights and 792 meters of dual carriageway and 856 metres of single carriageway.\n\nSpeaking at the commissioning of the housing project, Governor Sanwo-Olu said the event is a celebration of his administration\u2019s commitment to fulfilling the promise the incumbent government made to Lagosians to reduce the housing deficit in the State by enhancing access to decent and affordable accommodation.\n\nThe Governor also disclosed that Lagos State Government is set to implement the enforcement of a monthly tenancy on property occupancy from next year.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs we can all observe in this housing estate and others that we have commissioned in various parts of the State; we don\u2019t only build houses, we create homes in livable communities. We provide supporting infrastructure within the environment to add value to the lives of our people.\n\n\u201cWe promote a sense of togetherness that transcends our tribal, religious and political differences. This is our own way of building bridges and promoting the emergence of new communities that are resilient and responsive to both communal and individual aspirations.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on his administration\u2019s plan to reduce rent burden through a monthly tenancy agreement scheme, Governor Sanwo-Olu said his government is determined to cater for numerous others who may not have plans or the ability to own homes, but have immediate needs for decent shelter.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are at an advanced stage at enacting what we call the Lagos monthly tenancy agreement scheme. It is a scheme we are ready to develop with some of our financial institutions to be able to have a pull of funds where beneficiaries that are current tenants who are living in houses with flats but who are challenged to pay a yearly rent, would be able to approach the scheme and the scheme would help them pay their one year rent to the landlord. This will ensure that they don\u2019t come cap in hand to borrow.\n\n\u201cWe will look at the tenant\u2019s salary or income and there will be a repayment plan on a monthly basis based on the scheme. The landlord would be happy because he has met his own scheme and the tenant will also be happy because he or she doesn\u2019t need to rush to an uncle or aunty to meet up with a yearly rent.\u201d\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu while speaking on his administration\u2019s plan for those who cannot benefit from the Lagos State housing schemes, said the State Government is deepening its activities in the area of land allocation and speeding up the formalisation procedures for land acquisition and proper title.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu said there should be orderliness and sanity in the housing sector, promising to tackle the problem of land grabbing and prevent the citizens from obtaining improper title on the land they are buying from various communities.\n\nSpeaking earlier, the Commissioner for Housing, Hon. Moruf Akinderu-Fatai said the continuous provision of decent homes for the residents of Lagos State has become a hallmark of distinction of the present administration led by Governor Babajide Sanwo Olu.\n\n\u201cWithin the past 26 months, in line with its pledge and mandate, the State Government has delivered 14 housing schemes in various parts of the State. In addition to the ones delivered, there are still other schemes that are virtually ready and waiting in the wings to be released to the people.\n\n\u201cThis transformational drive which is based on the THEMES agenda is powered by the passion to sustain and surpass the status of excellence already achieved by our dear State. And it is definitely an all-encompassing and continuous work as can be seen in all areas of endeavours in the State. This yearning for further improvement is constantly fueled by an innate and unified desire of the leadership to give the best to the people at all times,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Commissioner for Housing also spoke on Phase II of the LagosHOMS Sangotedo Housing Scheme, which according to him when delivered will be an additional 444 homes to the housing scheme in the area to impact greatly on the housing deficit statistics in the area.\n\nHon. Akinderu-Fatai also encouraged Lagosians to continue to support the State Government in all ways, noting that \u201cOur taxes and other positive involvements provide the necessary ingredients for progressive and peaceful governance.

          "title": "Adebanjo to EFCC: Probe Tinubu, Akande\u2019s sources of wealth",
          "text": "Leader of pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, on Thursday, lambasted former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Chief Bisi Akande, for saying he (Adebanjo) pestered APC chieftain, Bola Tinubu, to build him a house in Lekki, where he now resides.\n\nThe 93-year-old Afenifere leader, who explained how he gathered funds to build his Lekki residence, also asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to probe the sources of the wealth of Tinubu and Akande.\n\nAdebanjo stated this at a press conference in Lagos on Thursday in response to the allegation made against him by Akande in his 559-page autobiography, titled \u2018My Participations\u2019, launched in Lagos last week. In attendance at the book launch include Tinubu; the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.); Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; amongst others.\n\n\u201cOne day, Sir Olaniwun (Ajayi) was launching a book at Muson Centre, Lagos. After the book presentation, Tinubu said I should not go and that he would like to see me. We met in a small room where he also invited Sir Olaniwun Ajayi. \u2018Papa, you can see that this document is old, Tinubu said as he handed over a big envelope to Ajayi. This is your C of O (Certificate of Occupancy)!\u2019\n\n\u201cTinubu told me later that after he presented Adebanjo\u2019s C of O to him, Adebanjo was always pestering Tinubu until he helped built a house on the plot. The street was also named in honour of Adebanjo and he is living in that house now at Lekki Phase One,\u201d Akande had alleged.\n\nReacting at the press conference, Adebanjo said it was shocking that Tinubu had yet to set the records straight on the allegation made by Akande despite that the former Lagos governor once praised him (Adebanjo) for his \u201cincorruptibility and strength of character\u201d.\n\nContinuing Adebanjo said, \u201cA lot has been said in the press and the social media to demolish tantrums. But I owe a duty to myself and to put the record straight for posterity about the big lie that Bola Tinubu built my house in Lekki for me. I therefore deny categorically that my house at Lekki was built with my resources through the sale of 3 developed properties, loan from GTBank and the sale of undeveloped landed property given me by my late leader Chief Obafemi Awolowo of blessed memory.\n\n\u201cThe details are as follows:\n\n\u201c1. A 4 bedroom duplex with 2 bedroom flat enclosed with 2 undeveloped plots at plot 4, block 14, Nuru Oniwo Street, Aguda Surulere, Lagos State, this is where I was living before moving to Lekki. The house was commissioned in 1972 by Chief Obafemi Awolowo.\n\n\u201cA wing of the duplex was once occupied by a staff of the security outfit then known as \u201cspecial branch\u201d headed then by the late Alhaji M.D. Yussuf who later became Inspector General of Police when General Olusegun Obasanjo was the Head of State. It was later occupied by one of the wives Chief Pius Akinyelure, who often visit his wife there in company of Senator Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201cThe gate of this property was forced open by Abacha security forces when NADECO was holding a sendoff party for American ambassador Walter Carrington in my house, I took the Federal Government to court for damages and I was awarded #1million naira which has not been paid till today by the Federal Government, Mr. Olisa Agbakoba SAN, was my counsel. The house was sold to St Baths Aglican Church, Aguda, Surulere.\n\n\u201c2. Two storey building at Odedola Street, Surulere, Lagos State. I bought it through an Estate Agent by name Mr. Shiwoniku who has relocated to UK, he has a brother who is a legal practitioner in Abuja.\n\nThe house was sold to a Ghanaian by name Mr Akappo. He is still alive and he lives in one of the flat in the building.\n\n\u201c3. Four storey building with a warehouse on the ground floor and six flats on top. It was commissioned by Chief Awolowo in 1977.\n\nI inherited the plot of 45\u2019X100\u2019 from my mother Salamotu Anomo-Adebanjo, who built a bungalow on it.\n\n\u201cShe bought the land when I was in primary school in 1940 from one Pa. Idowu Onitiri for \u00a320, which she paid by installment of \u00a310, \u00a37, \u00a33. His son Akanbi Onitiri, executed the conveyance for me without extra payment after showing him the purchase receipts from his father, when I was developing it in 1976.

          "title": "Adebanjo to EFCC: Probe Tinubu, Akande\u2019s sources of wealth",
          "text": "Leader of pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, on Thursday, lambasted former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Chief Bisi Akande, for saying he (Adebanjo) pestered APC chieftain, Bola Tinubu, to build him a house in Lekki, where he now resides.\n\nThe 93-year-old Afenifere leader, who explained how he gathered funds to build his Lekki residence, also asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to probe the sources of the wealth of Tinubu and Akande.\n\nAdebanjo stated this at a press conference in Lagos on Thursday in response to the allegation made against him by Akande in his 559-page autobiography, titled \u2018My Participations\u2019, launched in Lagos last week. In attendance at the book launch include Tinubu; the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.); Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; amongst others.\n\n\u201cOne day, Sir Olaniwun (Ajayi) was launching a book at Muson Centre, Lagos. After the book presentation, Tinubu said I should not go and that he would like to see me. We met in a small room where he also invited Sir Olaniwun Ajayi. \u2018Papa, you can see that this document is old, Tinubu said as he handed over a big envelope to Ajayi. This is your C of O (Certificate of Occupancy)!\u2019\n\n\u201cTinubu told me later that after he presented Adebanjo\u2019s C of O to him, Adebanjo was always pestering Tinubu until he helped built a house on the plot. The street was also named in honour of Adebanjo and he is living in that house now at Lekki Phase One,\u201d Akande had alleged.\n\nReacting at the press conference, Adebanjo said it was shocking that Tinubu had yet to set the records straight on the allegation made by Akande despite that the former Lagos governor once praised him (Adebanjo) for his \u201cincorruptibility and strength of character\u201d.\n\nContinuing Adebanjo said, \u201cA lot has been said in the press and the social media to demolish tantrums. But I owe a duty to myself and to put the record straight for posterity about the big lie that Bola Tinubu built my house in Lekki for me. I therefore deny categorically that my house at Lekki was built with my resources through the sale of 3 developed properties, loan from GTBank and the sale of undeveloped landed property given me by my late leader Chief Obafemi Awolowo of blessed memory.\n\n\u201cThe details are as follows:\n\n\u201c1. A 4 bedroom duplex with 2 bedroom flat enclosed with 2 undeveloped plots at plot 4, block 14, Nuru Oniwo Street, Aguda Surulere, Lagos State, this is where I was living before moving to Lekki. The house was commissioned in 1972 by Chief Obafemi Awolowo.\n\n\u201cA wing of the duplex was once occupied by a staff of the security outfit then known as \u201cspecial branch\u201d headed then by the late Alhaji M.D. Yussuf who later became Inspector General of Police when General Olusegun Obasanjo was the Head of State. It was later occupied by one of the wives Chief Pius Akinyelure, who often visit his wife there in company of Senator Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201cThe gate of this property was forced open by Abacha security forces when NADECO was holding a sendoff party for American ambassador Walter Carrington in my house, I took the Federal Government to court for damages and I was awarded #1million naira which has not been paid till today by the Federal Government, Mr. Olisa Agbakoba SAN, was my counsel. The house was sold to St Baths Aglican Church, Aguda, Surulere.\n\n\u201c2. Two storey building at Odedola Street, Surulere, Lagos State. I bought it through an Estate Agent by name Mr. Shiwoniku who has relocated to UK, he has a brother who is a legal practitioner in Abuja.\n\nThe house was sold to a Ghanaian by name Mr Akappo. He is still alive and he lives in one of the flat in the building.\n\n\u201c3. Four storey building with a warehouse on the ground floor and six flats on top. It was commissioned by Chief Awolowo in 1977.\n\nI inherited the plot of 45\u2019X100\u2019 from my mother Salamotu Anomo-Adebanjo, who built a bungalow on it.\n\n\u201cShe bought the land when I was in primary school in 1940 from one Pa. Idowu Onitiri for \u00a320, which she paid by installment of \u00a310, \u00a37, \u00a33. His son Akanbi Onitiri, executed the conveyance for me without extra payment after showing him the purchase receipts from his father, when I was developing it in 1976. Akanbi Onitiri is the father of Sumbo Onitiri, a well known estate surveyor in Lagos. The building was sold to a woman through an estate agent.\n\n\u201cI then took a loan from GTBank to complete the house in Lekki where I am living now. When the interest on the loan became unbearable, I was compelled to sell the undeveloped land given to me by Chief Awolowo in Dide-Olu Estate in Maroko Victoria Island. One Mr. Ade Otusanya a friend of my son Femi Ayo-Adebanjo bought the land.\n\n\u201cThe contractor who built my Lekki house is Engr. Hakeem Sulaiman, Senior Partner of Messrs HA associates. The Electrical and Mechanical Contractor is Engr. Tokunbo Oshokoya, Senior Partner of Messrs Oshea Projects. The Architect is Mr. Deji Johnson. The Quantity Surveyor is the late Otunba T.B Adebayo.\n\n\u201cThe Lekki property, the house in my village, Isanya Ogbo, and 3 Bedroom flat in a town house, at Omorinre Street in Lekki are the properties I have in the whole world.\n\n\u201cI hereby authorize the EFCC to verify the above facts.\n\n\u201cIt is alleged that Chief Bisi Akande\u2019s building at Ila-Orogun, which I understand is more than double in expanse of my house in Lekki and some other properties he has in Lagos and abroad were financed by Bola Tinubu.

          "text": "By Ifeanyi Nwoko\n\nThe African Development Bank (AfDB) is to train herdsmen and other Nigerians on livestock farming and ranching in the first phase of the initiative to create Special Agro-industrial Processing Zones (SAPZs).\n\nThe initiative is a public-private partnerships aimed at developing priority value chains through developing infrastructure in rural areas and finishing and transforming raw materials and commodities.\n\nAfDB said the bank and partner institutions plan to raise $520 million for the implementation of Phase 1 of the project.\n\nProf. Banji Oyelaran-Oyeyinka, Special Adviser on Industrialisation to the President of the AfDB on Thursday said that livestock farming was one of the areas selected by the states.\n\nThe selected states include: Cross River State \u2013 cocoa, rice and cassava; FCT \u2013 beef and dairy livestock; Imo State \u2013 beef and dairy livestock; Kaduna State \u2013 tomato, maize and ginger; Kano State \u2013 rice, tomato, groundnuts and sesame oil; Kwara State \u2013 livestock; Ogun State \u2013 cassava, rice, poultry and fisheries and Oyo State \u2013 cassava, soybean, rice.\n\nThe AfDB representative added that the livestock farming and ranching will require training for beneficiaries,\n\nHe said that the eight benefiting states were given option to identify their top three crops, saying that apart from livestock, some identified cassava, rice, cocoa among others.\n\nHe said that with the processing zones, it is hope that the era of people carrying cattle about would soon be over.\n\n\u201cSo we are hoping that the processing zone will also create the special livestock zone, including ranching and whenever you see livestock at the heart of it, then you see people making feed stock, veterinary services.\n\n\u201cSo each of them will create significant value chains, solve this problem of insecurity, solve the problem of headers farmers clash, bring harmony to rural communities, raise income and then ensure security,\n\n\u201cSo I think its a good thing that those particular states have identified livestock.\n\n\u201cIn some places like Imo for example, they want to also do a lot of poultry, so its across as I said all the four aspect of agric business, crop, forestry, livestock, fishery.\n\n\u201cSo, we are open to support on all forms, as you know Nigeria is a huge country, and there is no area of Nigeria where you don\u2019t find this kind of resources that we are able to add value to,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stressed that the target of the initiative are the poor and the small holder farmers, adding that there will be a great deal of advocacy to explain to people the rationale.\n\n\u201cLike I said it is not an optimum solution that people are running around, fighting and killing, so we hope our contribution will also help to solve this problem, so yes, so there will be training,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) which is also a co-sponsor of the initiative, will also contribute to training based on their successes with small holder farmers.\n\nHe said that the AfDB will also be partnering other Agric-based institutions that have milestones in the requisite fields to contribute to making the project a huge success.\n\n\u201cSo you will be seeing a lot of things simultaneously going on, capacity development, engaging with all kind of partners, small medium large, those things will be going on in the next couple of months,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Decisive actions taken by President Muhammadu Buhari stopped Boko Haram insurgents from declaring an Islamic State in Nigeria, Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed has said.\n\nSpeaking at a media parley Wednesday in Abuja, the minister who acknowledged banditry and kidnapping posed a great challenge in the nation\u2019s fight against insecurity, however, said the Buhari administration was providing quality leadership to halt the menace.\n\nObasanjo\u2019s \u2018tantrum\u2019\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo had in the week said expecting more from Buhari was like \u201cwhipping a dead horse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is this. President Buhari has done his best. That is what he can do. If we are expecting anything more than what he has done or what he is doing, that means we\u2019re whipping a dead horse and there is no need,\u201d Obasanjo was quoted to have said.\n\nLai replies\n\nAnd in a veiled response to the former president\u2019s comment, the minister said such statement smacks was \u201cuntrue, fallacious and smacks of dirty politicking.\u201d\n\nThe minister said the president had the capacity to do more in addition to what he had done under very difficult economic and social conditions, to tackle insecurity in the country.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cThe polity has recently been awash with heightened commentary on the security situation in the country. The commentary has been triggered by genuine concerns in some circles, and crass politicking or sheer absurdity in others.\n\n\u201cYes, the security situation has continued to pose a great challenge, but amidst the cacophony of voices \u2013 some genuinely concerned about the situation and others ready to exploit it for selfish ends \u2013 it is easy to forget where we are coming from.\n\n\u201cToday, we only look at the current situation, without wondering what would have been had this president not taken the bull by the horns, as far as security is concerned.\n\n\u201cWith the way, the insurgents were going before this Administration came into office, with their control of a vast swath of land the size of Belgium, with their freewheeling attacks in almost a dozen states, including the Federal Capital Territory which was hit at least five times, perhaps they could have achieved their aim of declaring an Islamic State in Nigeria if President Buhari had not acted decisively.\u201d\n\nIn further admitting the rising trend in the nation\u2019s security challenge, Mohammed said: \u201cYes, banditry and kidnapping have added to the state of insecurity, President Buhari has also continued to provide quality leadership in order to ensure that our security agencies decisively tackle the cankerworm of insecurity of any hue.\n\n\u201cNo administration in Nigeria\u2019s recent history has provided the security agencies with the hardware needed to tackle insecurity as that of President Buhari, in addition to raising the morale of our security men and women.\n\n\u201cOnly last week, Mr President commissioned an armada of naval boats and ships in the latest effort to enhance our nation\u2019s maritime security. The army, the air force and the police, among others, have also been receiving modern hardware to strengthen their arsenal.\n\n\u201cThe Administration has not concentrated on the kinetic measures alone. Non-kinetic measures have also been strengthened. The establishment of the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development to coordinate all humanitarian affairs in Nigeria is a major effort at tackling poverty and shrinking the pool of those being targeted for recruitment by insurgents and bandits.\n\n\u201cOf course, the Federal Government\u2019s unprecedented and massive investment in infrastructure is also aimed at boosting socio-economic well-being of the nation and further reducing poverty, which is a major cause of insecurity.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cDespite all this, President Buhari has not relented, constantly presiding over meetings of security chiefs to get an update and also issue necessary directives, and not missing any opportunity to offer succour to his countrymen and women, when necessary. The skewed narrative in certain quarters that the President has not shown enough empathy is glib talk.\n\n\u201cThe President has also continued to work with our neighbouring countries and indeed our Western partners to tackle insecurity, especially terrorism. With the entire Sahelian region experiencing a devastating surge in terrorist attacks, more so in the wake of the Libyan crisis, it has become even more imperative for Nigeria to step up regional cooperation to more effectively tackle insecurity \u2013 and that is what Mr President has been doing.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, President Buhari has done so much, under very difficult economic and social conditions, to tackle insecurity in our country. Not only has he done so much. President Buhari continues to do much more to keep Nigerians safe.\n\n\u201cTo say he has nothing more to offer is untrue, fallacious and smacks of dirty politicking. By boosting the number and capacity of our fighting forces, Mr President is putting them in good stead to tackle insecurity not just during the life of his Administration but long after he would have left office.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari is leaving a legacy of security, infrastructural development, economic prosperity and social cohesion for Nigeria. This may not seem obvious today, amidst daunting challenges, but posterity will be kind to this President.\u201d\n\nSlain Kaduna lawmaker\n\nMeanwhile, Chairman House Committee on Local Government and Rural Development and member representing Giwa West in Kaduna State House of Assembly, Hon. Lirwanu Aminu Gadagau was killed Monday night by bandits.\n\nSpeaker of the House Yusuf Zailani, who confirmed the member\u2019s death Wednesday, said the lawmaker was one of those killed by bandits along Kaduna-Zaria highway Monday night.\n\nSpeaking in a condolence statement signed by his SA Media and Publicity, Hon. Ibrahim Dahiru Danfulani, the Speaker said the body of the lawmaker was discovered in a morgue Wednesday as one of those killed by the bandits on that ill-fated day.\n\nDescribing the lawmaker\u2019s death as devastating and tragic, the Speaker said, \u201che died during bandits attack along Zaria highway. This is tragic and painful. We are in deep grief over this sad incident.\n\n\u201cOur prayers at this time, goes to his immediate family. Honourable Gadagau was a young and dynamic lawmaker, who had a passion for his constituency, state and Nigeria. We will miss his vibrant contributions.\u201d\n\nHe prayed Almighty Allah to grant him Aljannah Firdaus, grant the state, the Assembly and his family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss\n\nZailani also commiserated with the families of others who were killed and those kidnapped by the bandits during the same attack. \u201cOur hearts also go out to those kidnapped in same operation, believing that they would be rescued by security operatives as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\u20265 abducted in Zaria\n\nAlso, the bandits again, abducted five people in Dallatu and Kasuwar Da\u2019a areas of Dutsen Abba in Zaria local government area of Kaduna state.\n\nThis is happening 24 hours after bandits blocked the Kaduna-Zaria expressway and killed three people while abducting scores.\n\nKaduna state Police Command is yet to react to reports of the attack on the two communities but residents said the bandits, who stormed Dallatu village around 1.00am Wednesday, kidnapped two people and proceeded to Kasuwar Da\u2019a village where they abducted six others, amongst them three children.\n\nSources said three children were released Wednesday morning leaving five people in captivity.\n\nBandits had attacked motorists plying the Kaduna-Zaria expressway in an operation that lasted close to three hours and claimed the lives of three commuters.\n\nTaxes to bandits in Niger\n\nIn a related development, t Niger state government has directed citizens in communities under attacks to stop paying taxes and levies imposed by bandits, assuring the administration had intensified efforts to flush out the criminals.\n\nCommissioner of Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Internal Security Emmanuel Umar stated this Wednesday while speaking to journalists in Minna.\n\nHe said the government was aware the bandits had imposed taxes and other levies on farmers before harvest of farm products.\n\n\u201cThese criminals are trying to extort the farmers by imposing taxes to harvest their farm produce. This has to stop immediately. We therefore urge communities to support the security agencies in flushing out the bandits. We also want to assure that we are doing everything possible to ensure that the criminals don\u2019t have space in our communities,\u201d Umar said.\n\nThe commissioner urged farmers in the state to go on with the harvesting of their farm crops, urging them to ignore the criminal threat.\n\n\u201cSome Criminal elements in Rumbun Giwa in Mashegu local government area of Niger state recently wrote under the name Kungiyan Manuma ordering all farmers to pay some specific levies and taxes before they can access their farms to harvest their farm produce,\u201d the commissioner further said.\n\nHe said the state government was very much alive to its responsibilities and putting modalities in place to ensure those behind the threat were apprehended and brought to book.\n\n\u201cSome unpatriotic people are fuelling insecurity and crisis in the state, but Government is up to its responsibility,\u201d Umar added",

If you are finding it difficult to recruit people into the Arm Forces. Have special forces for all these areas and states affected with banditry? Recruit them purposely for this.

          "title": "Three Days to Deadline, Buhari Keeps Nigerians in Suspense Over Electoral Bill",
          "text": "Despite appeals from different quarters to President Muhammadu Buhari, including the diplomatic community, to sign the amended electoral bill forwarded to him by the National Assembly on November 19, the president has continued to keep the people in suspense even when it is three days to the 30 days deadline within which he is constitutionally mandated to assent to the bill or return same to the legislature.\n\nAlthough the president has not hinted at any possibility since he received the electoral bill, the bill has, however, been mired in controversy between those urging Buhari to sign it in order to enhance participatory democracy as indicated through the approval of direct primaries and those who have reservations about that model of electing candidates by political parties.\n\nHowever, while a political party, the National Rescue Movement (NRM), has accused the president of failing to assent, a former member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Timothy Golu, has expressed optimism that Buhari would sign the bill eventually.\n\nRecently, some newspapers\u2019 reports had alleged that the president might have caved in to pressure from some governors of his party, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and withheld his assent to the bill, because of the excuse that direct primaries would be too expensive to run.\n\nBut the presidency and the National Assembly had quickly come out to dismiss it as untrue. While one of Buhari\u2019s spokespersons, Mallam Garba Shehu, said he had not been briefed about such a development and therefore not correct, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, too said it was untrue.\n\nInterestingly, those believed to be pushing for indirect primaries were said to have recently reactivated their agenda, seeing that the president had a few days more to the deadline.\n\nAccording to sources, they have reached an understanding with a section of the National Assembly leadership that they would convince the president to return the bill to them on the grounds that he wanted certain clauses amended, but that once that was done, they should file it away and not treat it till the time of the elections.\n\nAlthough the president, sources claimed, was being convinced to inform the principal officers of the National Assembly that he would withhold his assent for them to also reconsider the timing for the submission of candidates\u2019 list by political parties from 180 days to 90 days as it currently stipulated in the 2010 amended electoral act, it is a decoy to scuttle the whole process.\n\nYet, those who want the president to leave a legacy of sound and enduring electoral system, have insisted that even if he would return the bill on the grounds of a few contentious clauses, including direct primaries, he must ensure that the current effort at reforming the electoral system through many other clauses did not go to waste.\n\nCuriously, however, those in support of the president assenting to the bill as it were and also convinced he would sign it eventually, have argued that the process of returning a bill to the legislature was much longer than merely signing it hence their conviction that the president had only kept the decision to himself.\n\nAccording to a THISDAY news analysis published on Wednesday, which quoted a presidency source, \u201cYou also need to understand the process, because there is a process or if you like, protocol to these things. Remember that immediately the bill was forwarded to the president by the National Assembly, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, wrote to the president and advised against it.\n\n\u201cIt was after this that the governors took up the campaign and asked for the aspect of direct primaries to be yanked off, citing many reasons that could not fly in the face of logic. But if the president was going to listen to his AGF or give in to the pressure by the governors, the process is that he would have instructed the AGF to draft a letter of response back to the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThus, if a process like that has been triggered, then you would have known that the president was not going to sign it, following the same channel of communication and as advised by his AGF. But since it was sent to him, the president has just kept quiet and knowing that signing is just about a small ceremony and solely the call of the president, so, he could choose to delay it and just sign whenever he wants for as long as it is before the deadline,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe source, which cited the fact that the National Assembly would proceed on recess today, Thursday, December 16th, further contended that, \u201cIf there was going to be any communication rejecting the bill, he would have triggered the process before they embark on their recess, of which they wouldn\u2019t be back until later in January, and by which time, the process for the Ekiti and Osun States governorship elections would have begun.\n\n\u201cI mean, it belies logic that the president would write to the National Assembly after they had proceeded on recess. Therefore, if he is not writing them between now and Thursday, when they would go on recess, then, it is a deal. He will sign it, since the signing ceremony is his personal business,\u201d the source explained.\n\nBesides, the source, which equally quoted the president at a recent virtual Summit for Democracy organised by the United States President, Joe Biden, where he reiterated his commitment to leaving behind a lasting legacy of credible polls for the nation\u2019s democratic development, added that Buhari was mindful of his commitment to the diplomatic community.\n\n\u201cAs we countdown to our next general election in 2023, we remain committed to putting in place and strengthening all necessary mechanisms to ensure that Nigeria will not only record another peaceful transfer of power to an elected democratic government, but will also ensure that the elections are conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner,\u201d Buhari stated at the summit.\n\nMeanwhile, a political party, the National Rescue Movement (NRM), has accused the president of failing to reciprocate the usual cordial relationship between the Executive and the present National Assembly by his refusal to assent the Electoral Act amendment bill sent to him.\n\nNational Chairman of the party, Senator Saidu Dansadau, who spoke at the end of the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting on Tuesday in Abuja, said the executive was not fair to the National Assembly by President Buhari\u2019s action.\n\n\u201cIf there is any president since 1999 that enjoyed maximum cooperation, it is President Muhammadu Buhari and for National Assembly to respond to the yearnings of majority of Nigerians and passed the bill as requested for by Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAnd we saw on national televisions that APC governors met and said they are against the bill that would ensure free and transparent elections in the country. And they went and lobbied Mr. President to hold his assent by returning it to the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cTo me, he (Buhari) is unfair to the National Assembly. He has not reciprocated their gesture as they have done to him since the past six and a half years. Also, he has not been fair to Nigerians, who voted him into power, because majority of Nigerians are interested in the passage of this bill and this is unacceptable to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI appealed to Mr. President to, in the name of God, assent to that bill without any doctoring and I also appeal to members of the National Assembly to resist any attempt by the president to tinker with what they have done,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Golu, while calling on the National Assembly to encourage Nigerians and assure them that the bill would be signed eventually, said the president has been in touch with various people from the villa regarding the bill.\n\nGolu, who spoke yesterday on the Morning Show of ARISE NEWS Television, said he believed that the National Assembly would stand its ground as they were not doing it for the president or the party but in the interest of democracy.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, you can see the level of joy and excitement. Everybody is watching and listening to what is happening everyday in regards to the the electoral reforms. There is no reason for him not to sign it. We are waiting patiently, because it\u2019s going to be a legacy as this has encouraged a lot of people to start registering in political parties.\n\n\u201cMost Nigerians don\u2019t belong to any political party, because they don\u2019t participate in raising or nominating flag bearers. They only participate at the general election, where flag bearers or ticket holders are imposed on them,\u201d he said.\n\nOn direct primaries, he explained that it was dependent on whether the nation was operating a delegate system or direct primary system.\n\n\u201cWhoever is putting pressure on the president wants to achieve some personal gains but when you look at the bigger picture, I believe that four or three days should not be a problem, because he has signed bills towards the end of the minimum time frame before, so whatever happens, members of the public are there to hold their representatives accountable in case the president decides other wise, which is very unlikely.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the president will be ready to be embarrassed by the National Assembly at that level. The question is: did you win your elections the way it should have been won? Those who do not want it know, those who didn\u2019t want it know what they did to get to the National Assembly,\u201d Golu further stated.\n\nWhile calling on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) witness primary elections as provided by the current provision of the electoral act, noted that political parties contributed to maintaining these things as it was going to be a systematic process with due accreditation.\n\n\u201cI urge them not to allow partisan and I want to believe that in their own conscience, the National Assembly will not toy with what the nation has been looking up to. Nobody should be above the electoral act and constitution,\u201d he said.\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja, Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos",

          "text": "In a morale-boosting effort, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Executive Council (FEC) on Wednesday approved a new welfare package, including a 20 per cent increase in allowances, for personnel of the Nigeria Police. Minister of Police Affairs, Alhaji Maigari Dingyadi, disclosed this in Abuja while speaking to newsmen at the end of the weekly virtual FEC meeting at the State House, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nDingyadi said the increments would take effect from January 2022.\n\nOther packages announced by the federal government included tax waiver for junior officers with effect from October 2021 and payment of outstanding funds for uninsured personnel between 2013 and 2020.\n\nDingyadi said FEC also approved a review and upgrading of the take home pay of police personnel in Nigeria.\n\nThe pay rise came amid awful revelations and controversies in the wake of the reports and recommendations of the #EndSARS panels set up by state governments to probe the protests, which rocked the country last year.\n\nDingyadi recalled that in October 2020, Nigeria was rocked by #EndSARS protests and Mr. President addressed the country and appealed for calm. He said the president also promised a review of the remunerations of police officers to enhance their take home pay in recognition of the services they rendered to the country in terms of maintenance of peace and order.\n\nThe minister explained, \u201cWe have tried to create a situation where their take home pay will be enhanced through the increase in their allowances.\u201d\n\nDingyadi listed the police personnel allowances and approvals that were reviewed upward to include duty tour allowance, which was raised to six per cent of the new take home pay. Council also approved the payment of N1.12 billion for the settlement of outstanding benefits of personnel for the uninsured period between 2013 and 2020, which had not been covered under the group personal insurance programme.\n\nHe stated, \u201cFEC has also approved the release of N13, 127, 972, 260 (Thirteen billion, one hundred twenty seven million, nine hundred seventy two thousand, two hundred and sixty nine naira) for payment as outstanding death benefits of 5,472 personnel within the uninsured period of 2013 to August 2021, not covered under the Group Life Insurance.\n\n\u201cCouncil has also approved the payment of the sum of 1.2 billion as payment of outstanding burial expenses of personnel period of January 2012 to 2021.\n\n\u201cCouncil has also graciously approved the annual insurance premiums of 750 million naira as well as payment of Four billion, eight hundred and twelve million, five hundred thousand naira for the repairs and replacement of damaged police infrastructure in future budgets, starting from 2022.\n\n\u201cCouncil has also approved a tax waiver in the sum of eighteen billion, six hundred million for personnel, junior officers in the police, in order to increase their take home pay, this is going to take effect from October 2021.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, government has also approved the increase of the current rent subsidy, which is currently between 15 and 20 per cent, amounting to N61 billion, increase is 40 per cent of the consolidated policy salary structure (CONPOST) in the sum of seventy eight billion three hundred million naira, that is to say an increase of about sixteen billion, four hundred million naira. \u201cIt has also approved payment of an additional six per cent shift duty allowance for officers on level 01 to 14 and the supervisors allowances for officers on level 15 and above. This will come out to about ten billion and thirty million naira with effect from 2022. Most importantly, government also approved payment of about 20 per cent of CONPOST, it is peculiar allowances to boost morale, and take home pay of the Nigeria Police.\n\n\u201cThis 20 per cent is percentage of the total salary, known as peculiar allowance. It is a new allowance created to improve their take home pay.\u201d\n\nDingyadi added that all the proposed allowances and salary structure would be compiled and forwarded to the office of the Auditor General of the Federation (AuGF) and Salary and Wages Commission for vetting and proper scrutiny\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is thereafter that the Accountant General of the Federation will be directed to approve the payment. We can see that with this development now, the police would be earning a more attractive pay that will be commensurate with what they\u2019re doing. What we expect the police to do after this is to double their efforts and justify the confidence that Mr. President and FEC have vested in them.\n\n\u201cAs a ministry we will do whatever it takes to ensure that we improve the performance and the relationship between the police and the public to ensure that they justify this good gesture.\u201d\n\nThe minister emphasised that although the proposal may not have been captured in the 2022 Appropriation Bill, it would be taken care of via a supplementary budget that would be sent later to the National Assembly for approval.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, who was also at the media briefing, said the police wage increase was not part of the 2022 budget proposal of federal government currently before the National Assembly. Ahmed assured that the police salary increase would come into effect once the supplementary budget was approved by the legislative arm.\n\n\u201cNo, we are not talking about taking effect in January 2022. But the effective date is still January 2022. When all the problems are sorted out there will be supplementary budget sent to the parliament.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",
