We have also encouraged NEITI to ensure that the MSWG, once reconstituted, endorses the report by the deadline on Dec 31st, 2021,\u201d she said.\n\nMarques, who oversees the development, revisions and implementation of EITI standard, pointed out that stakeholder oversight remains a critical pillar in the EITI process requiring government to work with civil society organisations and companies.\n\nShe harped on the need to NEITI to release the industry reports for 2019, adding that the report which has been in the final stages for a while needs to be out in the public domain as timely information can help inform public debate and use by stakeholders, even as she urged stakeholders to scrutinise the findings of the report and to ensure that recommendations are followed.\n\nShe added: \u201cImproving the management of the oil, gas and mining industry and maximizing revenues from the sector will be key to support Nigeria\u2019s post Covid recovery and to ensure that the country is well braced to address the implications of the energy transition effect on its economy.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Executive Secretary of NEITI, Dr Orji Ogbonnaya Orji, explained that Section 4(3) of the NEITI Act enables the agency to go ahead and release the 2019 audit report after stakeholder consultations in the absence of a board.\n\nAccording to him, further delay in the release of the report will amount to distraction to the NEITI process, urging stakeholders to give consent to the release of the reports since it is in line with the EITI Rules and NEITI Act.\n\n\u201cIt is frustrating that after doing a good work the report has been in the cooler,\u201d Dr Orji stated.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "By Frank Ikpefan, Abuja\n\nA financial and investment expert, Mrs Titilola Oladejo has advised women to tread carefully while seeking what to invest their monies on for financial independence, saying Ponzi schemes promising high returns must be avoided.\n\nShe urged women to build their wealth early, live according to their means and avoid comparisons, noting that with a proper financial plan in place, pressures would reduce.\n\nThe financial expert spoke at a webinar on Skills and Tools on Practical Financial Advice, organised by Mothers United and Mobilised (MUM) on Saturday.\n\nShe said it was worrisome that women still spent huge amounts of their monies and capital on non-essential expenses, calling for an adherence to the 30- day rule of savings.\n\nAccording to her, the rule tells an individual to take the money meant to be spent on an impulse buy and save it in a savings account instead for 30 days.\n\nShe said it was necessary to overcome impulse spending and boost savings over time, saying financial independence for women is key to living a life of fulfillment.\n\nOladejo said: \u201cFinancial independence for women is crucial, we must defer all non-essential purchases like Asoebi, fancy items and others. I am not saying you should be frugal always, but planning is important always to know what is a need and a want.\n\n\u201cWomen must beware of trending Ponzi schemes here and there, most of them attract new investors for nonexistent or failing businesses.\n\n\u201cThey promise high return of investment, be careful not to put your money in such businesses.\u201d\n\nThe expert noted that as the cycle of life of women emerges, there are more financial responsibilities per time, hence the need to cultivate a habit of budgeting and avoid going into debts.\n\nWhile listing active income, passive income and portfolio incomes as revenue sources, Oladejo said women ought to carry out due diligence effectively when planning for investments.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShe said to invest in any business, they should consider its registration, licensing, track record and their credibility, saying assets could be gotten with investments from mutual funds, treasury bills, Bonds among others.\n\nOladejo noted that women who have retired should make short-term investments which had high returns with emphasis on credibility and sustainability.\n\nAccording to her, wealth creation is not a bleak idea, but can be created with the right knowledge and by being innovative, calling for more awareness on how to generate more income for women.\n\n\u201cWomen can generate business ideas by identifying the challenges around them and a need for change, they must be conscious of their environment at all times.\n\n\u201cWomen should be proactive and be futuristic in their thinking, they must take advantage of technological disruptions and unexpected changes around,\u201d she said.\n\nConvener of the webinar, Dr Boluwaji Onabolu, noted that MUM is a group of Nigerian women, taking a stand with the Nigerian Youths, Children, to advocate for a better future through speaking, praying, advocacy and empowerment.\n\nShe said the event was part of MUM\u2019s interventions to reposition and empower women for wealth creation and contribute to social and economic development.\n\nAccording to her, mothers who are united and mobilised can help nurture to ensure rights to safety and development of Nigerian youths.\n\nOnabolu said the group had petitioned the National Human Rights Commission, the Senate and other relevant bodies to insist on accountability and redress regarding the 2020 Lekki Shooting incident.\n\nShe noted that the organisation had given a cash donation of N100,000 to a young widow, Omobolanle Bakare, whose husband was allegedly killed by a Policeman\u2019s stray bullet in Surulere, Lagos State.\n\nThe convener added that plans were on to sensitise women on importance of COVID-19 prevention and vaccination in partnership with the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency.",

          "text": "From Molly Kilete, Abuja\n\nThe bodies of the late Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lieutenant General Attahiru Ibrahim, who died in an ill-fated Nigerian Air Force aircraft crash in Kaduna on Friday, has been laid to rest. He was buried at exactly 4:45 pm local time Saturday.\n\nGen Attahiru died in the plane crash after the aircraft skidded off the runway after a successful landing at the Kaduna International Airport on Friday. He was in Kaduna to attend the Passing Out Parade (POP) of members of 80 Regular Intake at the Depot Nigerian Army, scheduled to take place on Saturday, when he and some of his principal officers met their untimely death.\n\nHe died along with three Brigadier Generals, two Majors, two Flight Lieutenants, two Sergeants and one Aircraft Man.\n\nThe deceased are Brigadier Generals Ahmed Kuliya, OL Olayinka and MI Abdulkadir, Majors N Hamza, LA Hayat, Sergeants O Adesina, Umar and Air Craft Man OM Oyedepo.\n\nThe last ceremony Gen Attahiru attended was the 57 years anniversary celebrations of the Nigerian Air Force, held at Makurdi, the Benue State Capital, to celebrate with the NAF, whose Chief happens to be his coursemate.\n\nGen Attahiru, who has been on tour of army formations across the country, was also at the 2nd Division Nigerian Army, Ibadan, before heading to Makurdi.\n\nNews about the death of the Army Chief began to filter in the news late Friday night.\n\nA statement by the Media Adviser to the President, Femi Adesina, soon made a statement about the death of the COAS. After the statement from the Presidency, the Defence Headquarters and Army Headquarters issued a statement confirming their death late Friday night.\n\nAs soon as the Army confirmed the death of their COAS, it immediately mobilised members of the Nigerian Army Officers Wives Association(NAOWA) to the flag house to condole with his widow, who happens to the the national president.\n\nThe flag house, located at the Niger barracks, soon became a Mecca of sorts, as serving and retired military officers trooped in in large numbers to pay their condolences to Mrs Attahiru.\n\nA similar crowd was witnessed at the homes of the other officers who died alongside the COAS in the crash, while arrangements to convey those not resident in Abuja were made to fly them in to witness and pay their last respects to their loved ones.\n\nThe burial ceremony started after the bodies of the deceased officers arrived at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in a C-130 aircraft, and were received by service chiefs and top military officers, from where they were conveyed to the church and mosque, respectively, for the Christian and Muslims deceased officers for funeral services and prayers.\n\nThe funeral service for the Christian officers was held at the Protestant Church at the NAF base, Abuja.\n\nWith the prayers over, the bodies were then moved to the National Military Cemetery.\n\nMilitary officers in ceremonial dress with black band tied around their arms trooped into the cemetery to pay their last respects. Grave diggers arrived the cemetery as early as 6 am to dig the graves under the supervision of the Guards Brigade of the Nigerian Army, led by its commander, Brigadier General Takuti Usman.\n\nPall bearers who assembled at the cemetery as early as 6 am began to take their position for the ceremony at exactly 12:40 pm for a dress rehearsal awaiting the arrival of the bodies.\n\nThe pall bearers comprised eleven soldiers and eighteen members of the firing party from the Guards Brigade of the Nigerian Army.\n\nThe brial ceremony started with the arrival of very senior retired and serving officers, former Chief of Army Staff Lieutenant General Azubuike Ihejirika, Chief of Defence Staff General Lucky Irabor, Minister of Information Lai Mohammed, President of the Defence and Police Pfficers Wives Association (DEPOWA) NAFOWA president, NOWA president. Others are former Chief of Army Ataff Lieutenant General Dambazau, Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufal, Senate President Ahmed Lawan, Inspector General of Police, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Chief of Staff to the President Ibrahim Gambari, members of the diplomatic corps, among other top dignitaries.\n\nPresident Mohammad Buhari was represented by the Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (retd).\n\nThe bodies of the deceased officers were conveyed in eleven ambulance vehicles, with the staff vehicle of the late COAS decorated with three stars leading the convoy arriving at the cemetery at exactly 14:22 hours.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe ambulance bearing the body of Gen Attahiru was the first to be carried out of the ambulance when the ambulance drove into the burial site at exactly 14:40 hours, and pallbearers, mostly in the ranks of Major General, marched the body to the gravesite.\n\nThe Chief Imam of the Nigerian Army offered the burial prayers for the late Gen Attahiru, after which he made an appeal that the family would prefer a private burial.\n\nThe burial of the other officers started at about 16:30 hours, when senior officers in the ranks of Brigadier General marched in their bodies. Brigadier General JH Abdulasalam read the funeral oration for Brigadier Generals Ahmed Kuliya, OL Olayinka and MI Abdulkadir while Colonel AS Saleh, read the funeral oration of Majors N Hamza, LA Hayat, Sergeants O Adesina, Umar and Air Craft Man OM Oyedepo; while Flight lieutenant UV Edem and Flying Officer C Odili, read that of Flight Lieutenant LT Asaniyi and Olufade, respectively.\n\nAfter the reading of the funeral oration, the next-of-kin for the deceased officers were then called upon for the presentation of the national flag to them, which was done by the Minister of Defence Bashir Magashi, who represented the President.\n\nChaplains and Imams of the Nigerian Air Force and Army offered prayers for the repose of the souls of the deceased officers.\n\nIn his address at the occasion, the Chief of Defence Staff General Lucky Irabor, who said the officers died as a result of their love for the country, said their deaths would not be in vain. General Irabor, who said he received the news of the death of the COAS and the eleven officers with shock, assured that the war on insecurity must be won and called on Nigerians to continue to pray for the Nigerian Armed Forces. He described the late COAS as not just a fine officer but one with passion, professionalism, love for the job and a very dependable colleague.\n\nHe said the death of the officers was painful but would last only for a moment as the Armed Forces would come out stronger.\n\nHe assured the families of the deceased that the Armed Forces, the Federal Government and the country as a whole would not abandon them.\n\nAlso speaking, the Minister of Magashi described the deaths as a huge blow to the country, but assured of the government\u2019s continuing support for the military and their families.",

          "title": "Miyetti Allah leader to Fulani herders: Don\u2019t obey open grazing ban",
          "text": "National President of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Abdullahi Bello Bodejo has dismissed the ban on open grazing declared recently by the Southern Governors Forum. He has also instructed Fulani herdsmen not to obey the directive but to keep grazing their cattle wherever they find themselves in all the states of the country.\n\nIn an interview with VINCENT KALU, the leader of the Fulani socio-cultural organisation stressed that the governors were jokers, accusing them of plotting to take over the cattle business in Nigeria.\n\nHow will Fulani herdsmen cope with the ban on open grazing declared by the Southern governors?\n\nWe are going to follow the law and see how to approach some good leaders in the South-East, South-West and the South-South. We will also approach the Inspector General of Police and other security agencies to protect our people.\n\nIt is not about grazing; it is a plan against Fulani people. Some people want to hijack the cattle business from us. Anywhere you go now, you see Fulani grazing cows and you will think they belong to them. No! The cows belong some people in that area or community. If you go to Benue, the state that first promulgated the anti open grazing law, you can see cows grazing; their owners are Tiv people. Even the governor, Samuel Ortom, has so many cows. They want to chase us away and continue with our business.\n\nWhat these Southern governors are trying to do, some other African countries tried it, but it didn\u2019t work. So, this one will not be an exception. You can\u2019t just wake up without plan B, and say you have banned open grazing. This business has history; we didn\u2019t just wake up and start cow rearing. It is a blessing from God; it is God that blesses us with this business, it is not like farming or palm wine tapping business. This is from the beginning; the only thing is how to transform the business. These governors are confused; they are trying to deny Fulani their rights and means of livelihood. Nigeria has only one constitution, which the governors are breaching. We may approach the court to stop them from carrying out their plans. The process by which they arrived at their decision was wrong. They were supposed to have invited us because we are part of their various states. If you are a governor, you are a governor for everybody living in that state. Since we live in all the states doing our business, it behooved them to have invited us to the meeting. I don\u2019t know who is giving them this evil idea. No state can progress without Fulani being in that state; any state without Fulani is backward and poor. Fulani attract blessing. They don\u2019t have problem, but unfortunately, people attribute kidnapping, robbery and banditry to them. It is not fair. They have not seen their people killing police and other security personnel. How many police stations have Fulani burnt? How many policemen have Fulani killed? But they want to tamper with the business God has blessed us with. The governors are very wrong.\n\nYou said other African countries tried to ban open grazing and it didn\u2019t work, but these governors seem determined to execute it.\n\nI say it categorically that this ban on open grazing by the Southern governors will never work. The only thing that can stop us from grazing in any area is if there are no grasses and water in such place. Fulani don\u2019t have borders or boundaries; they don\u2019t need permission to graze their cows from one area to another area.\n\nThere is no law, no constitution prohibiting them from doing so. Fulani are educated and they believe in leadership. They follow the constitution, which permits them internationally to graze anywhere. ECOWAS permits us to graze anywhere, but any person that commits a crime, let the law of the land be visited upon such a person.\n\nDo these governors want to tell me that in their states, only Fulani herdsmen are their problems? Let them know that what they are doing is against the law. They are confused and they don\u2019t know what they are doing in their respective states. They are confused and also jokers. That law cannot be obeyed. You can\u2019t wake up and ban somebody from doing his legitimate business without providing a Plan B for him. Are they not in Nigeria? If they have a hidden agenda, they should make it open for everybody to see. They don\u2019t have a reason for what they want to do. Governors have powers and if they wake up and decide to do whatever they like with the Fulani, then we shall see. They should remember that before them were some leaders in this country and if all these leaders, Zik, Awo, Ahmadu Bello, etc had toed their line; this country would not have been here for them to be governors. God has blessed some parts of this country with oil, some parts with agriculture and others with cattle rearing. However, we don\u2019t want anybody to tamper with what God has blessed us with.\n\nYou said you are going to petition the IGP. Why?\n\nWe are going to write to the Inspector General of Police to provide enough security to our people wherever they may be in the South because they are under threat. This morning I have received 46 calls from our people there who want to leave, but they are scared of what may happen to them on the way. Since the governors are the chief security officers of their states, they should provide security for them to leave their states. Grazing or no grazing, the Fulani will survive. A Fulani man can trek from Abuja to Cameroun, from Abuja to Somali, Abuja to Central Africa. It is only Fulani that can do that. You can\u2019t dictate to them how to run their business or their lives. You didn\u2019t provide electricity, water, school, hospital to them. Now, people are taking vaccine for COVID-19, you don\u2019t remember them. They are doing their businesses inside the bush and you still want to stop them, and yet they are feeding you with the meat! If we order our people to leave the South, may be the governors will be eating dog meat. I don\u2019t know what they will be eating if we stop our people from going there.\n\nIf you were a farmer, you took a bank facility to plant maize, millet, cassava, and then cows descend on the farm and eat up the crops, what would you do?\n\nIs there any nearby police station in that area? Is there any court in that area? Such a wicked person is supposed to be arrested, prosecuted and jailed. Such person is not a good rearer. In Nasarawa, Plateau states, for example, we have a vigilante that joined hands with the communities. We will send our vigilante to arrest any person who commits this kind of atrocity. If he is a small boy, they will arrest his father and everybody in the house and take them to the police station and force them to pay for the damage done to the farmer. We are good leaders, we can\u2019t support anybody who will go and destroy somebody\u2019s farm. That is what the governors should do. They are supposed to join hand with the good Fulani to deal with those who are spoiling our names, which is better than waking up to ask our people to leave their area.\n\nWill you invite Buhari to mediate over this matter?\n\nWe will like the Federal Government to intervene between Fulani and these governors who don\u2019t like them. They should be made to know that this country is one and forget about those their boys \u2013 IPOB and Oduduwa boys. These boys are joking and we are not part of their joke. We don\u2019t have time for that. They killed Fulani fathers and children. I urge the security agencies to go after these killers.\n\nTalking about killings, last month, some people alleged to be herdsmen killed about 25 people in Ebonyi State. What do you say to that?\n\nIf other people kill some people, they pin it to herdsmen. How many herdsmen have the police in that area arrested? How many herdsmen are in police custody? Herdsmen were not responsible for the killings. They can say Fulani were the ones involved, but how many of them were arrested? I can only believe it if the Commissioner of Police says that they arrested a Fulani or some of them who did the killing. The propaganda is too much. Like a big lie that Ortom told. He said Fulani attacked him and he ran away. How did he recognise a person who wanted to kill him while he was running? Did he have any video to prove they were Fulani? Some people are now learning Fulani language. Like in a video, one boy alleged to be a Biafra person was speaking pure Fulani language and people will take him for a Fulani. If such a person goes to kill, and he speaks Fulani, people will say the killer was a Fulani man. Let the police do their investigation, and thereafter people can draw conclusions. Many people are trying to cause trouble because Buhari is a Fulani man. Everybody is angry with the Fulani.\n\nHow do you mean? The late President Yar\u2019Adua was also Fulani, and there were no such issues\u2026\n\nYes, Yar\u2019Adua was Fulani. He tried to unite the country. He gave the Niger Delta militants amnesty. Buhari is also in the process of uniting the country. Till now, the Federal Government has not looked into our problem. I get very much annoyed and curse such people who say Buhari is backing the Fulani. He has not done anything for us. We are the first people he is supposed to do something for, but he hasn\u2019t done anything for us. See how they are funding rice farmers. See what work he is doing in the South. We are calling on him to wake up and give us our grazing areas. We may consider paying a courtesy visit to Southern governors on this issue and make them see reason to reverse their position. If they can\u2019t invite the Fulani associations, they are supposed to invite the Sultan of Sokoto and other emirs, who are also Fulani for that policy. Some people were educated and went to school through the Fulani, so they are not supposed to treat us in this way. Thank God that the Nigeria\u2019s constitution gives the governors only four years and the highest is eight years. These governors who came up with this evil law, some of them in the next two years will become former governors. We also believe that those who will replace them will change the narrative. We believe in one Nigeria and we want everyone to be one. I\u2019m about going to marry an Igbo girl from Enugu. Then these people shouting Biafra will see that the leader of Miyetti Allah has become their in-law. A Rivers State man is married to my aunt and they have ten children \u2013 some of their names are Kate, Ndidi, Kingsley, etc. If I go to Rivers State, nobody can chase me out because I have cousins there. But it should be pointed out that Igbo and Yoruba cannot stop Fulani from grazing their cattle in their areas.\n\nWe have separatist agitators who want to leave Nigeria. What is your view?\n\nIf the country breaks up, we don\u2019t have any problem. Even if they break it into 32 parts, it is not a problem to us. But let them not forget that the Fulani are cooking their food under the trees in the bush. If you are looking for Fulani trouble, be ready to leave the city and join him to cook your food under the tree. Or else, allow him to be. Don\u2019t touch them. If you chase the Fulani away, you kill their mother, father, and others, do you think you will sleep with both eyes closed? They don\u2019t look for trouble, but don\u2019t look for their trouble.\n\nYou said if Nigeria splits, it doesn\u2019t concern the Fulani. How do you mean?\n\nThe Fulani don\u2019t have borders. If I want to migrate to Ghana now, nobody can stop me. If a Fulani man wants to relocate to Sudan, can you stop him? So, we don\u2019t have a problem if they tear Nigeria apart. But the only thing is that our forefathers suffered to build Nigeria and they treated everybody, Igbo, Yoruba and others equally, and that is why we are saying let Nigeria be one united country. But we are not scared of anything. For Yoruba, if you leave Ogun and Lagos, you cannot see any other Yoruba country again. It is the same thing with the Igbo. Go anywhere, you can see Fulani, even in the 36 states. The only thing is that you can\u2019t appreciate their population because they are inside the bush and don\u2019t care what is going on in the city. How then do you want to chase them out? I\u2019m directing all the herdsmen in the South not to leave or go anywhere and they should continue to graze their cattle in that region because it is Nigeria. They should not mind the governors who have violated the constitution that guarantees everybody freedom to live and do legitimate business in any part of the country. They can\u2019t expect the Fulani to respect their law, which is inferior to Nigeria\u2019s constitution. Let them think on how to provide basic amenities to their people instead of fighting the herdsmen. Fulani are not problem in this country, but some desperate politicians are trying to give them a bad name. Some of these Southern governors have seen that their tenure is ending in two years time and they are not popular among their people to the extent that any candidate they sponsor for election, even for councillorship in 2023 will fail and that may be the reason for the meeting, to cause confusion in the country.\n\nI want to tell these governors, even in their dreams, none of them will be president or vice president in this country. If they have a hidden agenda, let them make it open so that Nigerians will advise them. I don\u2019t know what they are looking for.",

          "title": "Agitators for Biafra, Yoruba Nation are illiterates -Ex Presidential Aspirant, Olawepo-Hashim",
          "text": "Oil mogul and former presidential candidate in 2019, Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim has dismissed those agitating for secession in the country. In an interview with ADETUTU FOLASADE-KOYI, he also speaks on how to resolve the country\u2019s political imbalance and why a referendum, ahead of the 2023 general election is unnecessary.\n\nThere are calls for secession in two regions of the country now. Is that not worrisome?\n\nThis is just nonsense, to be honest with you. It is pure nonsense. Nigeria, in the Independence Constitution that we had, there were democratically-elected leaders. They were not handpicked and they went to the Lancaster conference in 1957 and 1958.\n\nThe Eastern delegates were led by Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the Western delegates were led by Chief Obafemi Awolowo and the northern delegates were led by Sir Ahmadu Bello. And an Independence Constitution was negotiated. One of the critical elements of the Independence Constitution, which remains with all the constitutions that we have had, whether midwifed by the military or whatever, is the principle of indivisibility and indissolubility of the Federal Republic of Nigeria; this was agreed by all the regions.\n\nSo, this theory by some illiterates \u2013 and some of them may be professors \u2013 and they go about talking nonsense as if that is the truth. This theory that Nigeria was put together forcefully by the British is false because the people of Nigeria did negotiate the constitution, led by democratically elected leaders. And, the principle of indissolubility and indivisibility of the Federal Republic of Nigeria was agreed. In fact, it was thoroughly debated at the Lancaster Conference in London, where component regions should have the right to secede or not.\n\nThe South West wanted it, the Northern Region also did not mind it. In fact, the most compelling argument for national unity came from Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe who said that we should have a model constitution like the constitution of the United States of America where secession is an act of treason and that Nigeria should exist in unity in perpetuity!\n\nBut with the present realities, are you telling me Nigerians cannot renegotiate our unity?\n\nI am not convinced that the unity of Nigeria is the problem. What I think is the problem is the mismanagement of our diversity. That is the issue.\n\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\nWell, in the sense that we have not allowed the elements that can guarantee efficient management of state power to operate. We had a coup in 1966 that took powers from the sub-national authorities that would have efficiently managed the situation like security you are talking about. If anything happens in a local government, the people who live in that community will know who the criminals are.\n\nIt is easier when security is managed at that level than when it is managed from the central government. There is always a problem with even trust. People will not volunteer information easily. So, some of the security problems we are having is traceable to the fact that powers that were residing at the local level have been taken away and dumped at the federal level. And, you know, interestingly, a lot of people like to blame the Fulani but, the people who carried out the 1966 coup were not Fulani.\n\nSo it is not about Hausa or Igbo or Yoruba, it is about the fact that we have distorted the most essential element of managing diversity; which is to have a level of control mobilisation and development and two key elements, security and the economy are the most important elements of activities in a society.\n\nAnd when you have taken those powers and dumped them at the centre, then you snuff out creativity and efficiency and the state can no longer function at its optimum. When we decentralise, we will regain our balance and I do not think that the issue is our unity. The issue is that we distorted the essential principles of managing that diversity and now we must restore it. That is the solution, not secession and I have not seen an African country that achieved secession that has been better off. Eritrea is not better off than they were. They fought for almost 30 years to leave Ethiopia; what have they achieved after they left? Look at South Sudan; they are now even fighting and all that.\n\nAnd, let me tell you, Nigeria is more of a blessing than a curse. When people are talking: \u2018let us secede.\u2019 Secede to where?\n\nBefore Nigeria was amalgamated, there was nothing called a Yoruba nation. What you had was Oyo Empire and the various sub-nationalities in the present South West were in 200 years war against Oyo, the Ekiti and all that. They were all fighting Oyo; to be independent of Oyo. There was so much insecurity. This was a war that was fought) for 200 years. So what do they mean by a Yoruba nation? There was no Yoruba nation before the British amalgamated Nigeria. There was Oyo Empire under Alafin and the Egbas had their own flag and they had their own generals fighting Oyo, fighting Ibadan. Ibadan was the city state that was aligned to Oyo. Even the lower flank to the North, Ilorin, that one had broken up from Oyo. It wanted its own independence. Everybody wanted independence from Oyo Empire. So what is the Yoruba nation that they are talking about?\n\nAnd the ones in the East that are talking about Biafra, they didn\u2019t even have a kingdom. They didn\u2019t have any empire. What do you mean by Biafra? Everybody was at the clan level when the British came to that place. The only thing in the South-East and South-South that was a big kingdom was Benin and everybody was either a vassal to Benin directly or indirectly in those areas. Secession is pure nonsense. Secession to where?\n\nSome agitators point at the current imbalance, saying one tribe was favoured over others in appointments. Yet you say our Constitution maintains our indivisibility and indissolubility?\n\nWell, that is the problem with the character of a government; it is not a problem with the character of the country. Yar\u2019Adua was president of Nigeria; were all his appointments from Katsina? So, must you break Nigeria because now you are having issues with appointments? If you are having issues with appointments, there are constitutional remedies to correct that. We have the Federal Character Commission; there is no state in this country that is not represented in the Federal Character Commission. Where is their report? Where are the voices of their state representatives? They all keep quiet; they don\u2019t say anything! Then, apart from the institution such as the Federal Character Commission, where is the party? We have governed this country before, in 1999, and 60 per cent of all federal boards were appointed by the committee set up by the National Regulatory Committee. We zoned every big board appointment!\n\nIn our time, if the chairman of the Nigeria Ports Authority is zoned to the South-South, that of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation cannot be retained in the South-South; it goes to another region. That was how we did it and, at the end of the day, even if (former) President (Olusegun) Obasanjo wanted to do otherwise, it was impossible for him to do. So, one of the problems that you have is not just with the government, virtually all the institutions have collapsed and they have to do with the character of the occupants of those institutions not because those institutions cannot work. Even if you go your way, it is not the guarantee that there will be development in those places. Some people will still be oppressive if you don\u2019t have good leaders. If you don\u2019t have people who are ready to speak up and take up responsibilities that they have signed for, those countries, if they become independent, will not do well.\n\nIn the Second Republic, whenever the party spoke, the state actors toe that line. After 2003, progressively, it is a different ball game for our political parties. Can we go back to that era?\n\nYes we must. Even in countries of Africa that were one party states, the party was strong. All the noise against (late President Robert) Mugagbe, he did not leave until the ZANU PF took a decision and said \u2018okay!\u2019 Mugabe knew it was all over at that point, even as the country was a one-party state. The ANC (in South Africa), when they turned against (former President) Jacob Zuma, that was the end of him. So, you need a strong party.\n\nBut political parties are not as independent as before. How do we go back to that era because moneybags, governors and political state actors have hijacked the parties?\n\nSome of the people who are shouting today, they were the ones who killed the political parties. I was expelled from the PDP in 2000 because we were insisting on the doctrine of party supremacy. Some people in government humiliated those of us who formed the PDP because they wanted unlimited control over government. Myself, (late) Harry Marshal, some of the founding fathers of PDP then, we were all expelled in one day, in a well programmed attack against the national executive committee of the party, by some people who were shouting that they want to be president today, by some people who are crying that democracy is suffering, they were the ones who killed democracy!\n\nThey did not want the party founders; who are great men. I was one of the youngest of the Group of 34 that started PDP and these were great men, those were people who had been in government and they have never stolen money. (Late) Chief Solomon Lar never had a piece of land in Abuja here. (Late) Alhaji Adamu Ciroma never had a house in Abuja here yet, he had been governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria. He had been Minister of Finance. He had seen money more than anybody else had seen. We were inspired by leaders who wanted the best for this country and we respected them, not because they were moneybags. We followed them. We spent our money behind them because we believed in them.\n\nThen, some miscreants came into government and they didn\u2019t want this structure that brought them into government to have any influence on their policies and we were always fighting, it was war from 1999 between the party and some people. Do you know how many times the PDP secretariat was surrounded by armoured tanks? The party itself! They brought armoured tanks to the party secretariat because they wanted to get some people out of the party forcefully. The fight that happened in PDP, between 1999 and 2001 has not happened since then and this was why we lost it. Now, regrettably, the same people who caused the problem are busy jumping about pontificating! One of the problems of Nigeria is that most Nigerians don\u2019t have a sense of history. There is a sense of collective amnesia in this country and people pretend not to even remember things that happened six months ago. So there is no way you can make progress as a country if you don\u2019t have a sense of history.\n\nSo, back to the issue, it is not just about (President Muhammadu) Buhari. It is not about secession, it is not about any Fulani, you need strong institutions to have a functioning democracy. Some of the people that are saying they want to secede, how are their governors managing their states? Some of them don\u2019t have five kilometres of functional local roads. Even with the money that is available right now. Is it Buhari that is doing that one?\n\nSo, we have a lot of issues but where we are is very simple. Let\u2019s first of all deal with issues that we can agree on and then move forward gradually from there and the rest questions will be resolved politically, democratically on the field of the election if we allow programmes to govern our choices.\n\nOnce it is election time now, nobody is focused on the candidates, where is he coming from, who is he, what is his pedigree? You, the media, also have to help to moderate the debate about choices and what issues should govern the political contest. So, we all have our various roles to play in this issue.\n\nIs a referendum necessary now before we go into 2023 elections?\n\nThat will be a distraction. Referendum for what?\n\nWell, referendum to address how to move Nigeria forward\n\nDo we need to complicate issues? Look, Boko Haram and the bandits are in Shiroro (Niger State) and few kilometres from Abuja. There are some bandits in the forest of Kaduna. Is it a referendum that you need now or you need to get those guys out of that place and move them back as much as possible? What we need now is to secure, at least, let us secure the North Central states that are around Abuja and that is what my six-point agenda is all about. We need to immediately guaranty security in the various states and local governments.\n\nAnd we can write our lawmakers now, to amend the sub-sections of the constitution and get concurrence from the states. We can actually do this within the next 60 days. In fact, we can get this done, if there is the will, within the next 30 days. We can actually do it so that the states and the local governments can legitimately raise their local police instead of this vigilante stuff. We need proper police not vigilantes. The vigilantes themselves will become terrors. There must be standard operating procedure that is modern, that even civilised people who want to provide assistance can relate to. A modern structure. I mean, what assistant and support can you get when their insignia is like 15th Century village hunters?",

AA Olufade, Sgt Adesina and ACM Oyedepo.\n\nAttahiru, a Gallant Soldier\n\nAttahiru was named as the nation\u2019s Chief of Army Staff on January 26 this year alongside other service chiefs.\n\nHe was a strong advocate of one Nigeria as evident in his handling of rising cases of agitations by some sectional advocates in the country.\n\nAttahiru was born on 10 August 1966 in Doka, Kaduna North Local Government Area, Kaduna State. He was a graduate of the Nigerian Defence Academy, Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji, and Nigerian Army School of Infantry.\n\nHe had his cadets training in January 1984 and was commissioned into the rank of Second Lieutenant in December 1986 as an Infantry Officer.\n\nHe holds a Master degree in Strategic Management and Policy Studies from the Nigerian Defence Academy.

          "text": "Two weeks after the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) said it had issued 54 million people their national identity numbers, it is in the process of deploying a Device Management System (DMS).\n\nThe NCC said in a statement, \u201cTo curtail the counterfeit mobile phone market, discourage mobile phone theft, enhance national security, protect consumer interest, increase revenue generation for the government, reduce the rate of kidnapping, mitigate the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitate blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices, one of the means to achieve this is through the deployment of Device Management System.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implementation of a Centralised Equipment Identity Register otherwise known as Device Management System will serve as a repository for keeping records of all registered mobile phones\u2019 International Mobile Equipment Identity and owners of such devices.\u201d\n\nDespite the government hinging the policy on fighting insecurity, there are privacy concerns that the government can easily abuse access to such data.\n\nDoes this new requirement infringe on privacy?\n\nAs of March 2020, Nigeria was one of eleven countries with mandatory biometric SIM registration laws. One of the arguments against compulsory registration is that it allows the government to track SIM card owners and makes it easier to track calls and messages.\n\nA Device Management System will take this step even further, allowing the government even more access to what should be private information. While the argument from the government is that it improves security, there\u2019s the risk that the government can spy on its citizens.\n\nGeneralized surveillance in countries like Nigeria with weak security agencies controlled by the executive can become police states where opposition leaders can be tracked and arrested. But with the rise in crime in Nigeria in the past year, it is easy to understand the government\u2019s argument.\n\nDoes the government\u2019s argument make sense?\n\nIn a 2016 paper, \u201ccomplete mobile phone registration has many generalised benefits to the society especially in combating crime.\u201d\n\nWith increasing reports of kidnappings taking place around the country, a centralised registry may help to find bad actors even quicker, and it could help combat the sale of stolen phones. When there\u2019s a central registry for IMEI, the police could identify the owners of lost and stolen phones thousands of times daily.\n\nA critical part of this paper argues for a central database of mobile phones that law enforcement agencies presumably can access. Yet, it is this central assumption that still provides a problem.\n\nWhether Nigerians trust that the government will not abuse access to such critical information remains to be seen.\n\n*An earlier version of this report stated that the NCC asked telcos to register the IMEI numbers of their subscribers; the NCC has now clarified its position",

          "title": "How to build high-performance teams with Chichi Offodile and Seni Sulyman",
          "text": "Exceptional results require a high-performance team but how do you build one?\n\nIn what can be termed a mini-MBA session, Seni Sulyman and Chichi Offodile in an edition of TechCabal Live shared expert advice on how to build high-performance teams.\n\nSeni Sulyman is the founder and community manager of Black Ops, a network of top African operators building great companies and cultures across the world. Before starting Black Ops, Seni helped scale Andela\u2019s operations from series B to series D with over 1,000 team members across US and Africa offices.\n\nChichi Offodile is the COO of Helium Health. She has over 15 years of experience working at EMC/Dell and Deloitte.\n\nTheir Journey at Helium Health and Andela\n\nThe conversation begins with Chichi and Seni talking about their journeys at Helium Health and Andela respectively. They both stepped in when each company had a viable product/service, some traction, and funding.\n\nFor Chichi, she was brought in when Helium Health had figured out what it was doing but was uncertain about how to move forward. Her strength lies in figuring out how to build a sustainable company and that\u2019s what she set out to do via a transformation plan.\n\nSeni joined Andela in 2016 when the company was in only two markets \u2013 Nigeria and Kenya. At that time there had been a few leadership exits and the general employee morale was low. His mandate was to stabilize the ship. Which he did before focusing on operational expansion.\n\nHow do you begin the transformation process?\n\nFor Seni, he believes the transformation process should start with the why\u2014 otherwise known as communicating a vision that galvanises everything. At Andela, he had to create a modified version of the vision that was more compelling to the team.\n\nAfter clearly articulating the vision, decide on the steps to take to achieve the vision. This involves setting performance indicators and reviews, so it\u2019s clear what the goals are and whether people are hitting them.\n\nHow does a high achiever culture permeate a company?\n\nBoth Seni and Chichi believe that it starts with hiring people with the potential to be high achievers and then setting a good example as a leader.\n\nGiving people room to execute the tasks they\u2019ve set out to do is also an important factor.\n\n\u201cI make sure that leadership allows people to be creative. Allow people to execute. If you don\u2019t give people the opportunity to succeed, you\u2019ll be stifling them. I motivate people by allowing them to set their goals and fix a timeline to achieve it,\u201d Chichi said.\n\nBuilding cohesiveness within the team\n\nGreat things are rarely ever done by one person. How do we ensure that the team sticks together?\n\nSeni believes the people have to align on the why. This alignment has to start from the top, there has to be a unified strategy at the top level.\n\n\u201cStrategy is a lot more of what you\u2019re saying No to than what you\u2019re saying Yes to,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting an example of when he had to build cohesiveness within a team, he said that during his time at Bristow he noticed that two senior executives weren\u2019t aligned on the company\u2019s direction. One person wanted a high-end airline, while the other person wanted a low-cost airline.\n\nTo resolve this issue, he had to call both of them together to iron out their differences before the company could move forward.\n\nHow do you get teams to keep going without burning out\n\nA common challenge high-performance teams face is that they experience burnout due to the intense and fast-paced nature of work.\n\nSeni responded to this question by stating that he thinks that the issue with the pandemic and people experiencing burnout is that a lot of people were thrown into remote work without warning.\n\nThe solution to this is to encourage people to take time off work since the line between work and rest can be blurry. As a leader, you have to practice what you preach.\n\nIn order to encourage people to take some time off work, he often schedules his emails sent in the middle of the night to go out by the next morning to avoid creating unnecessary work or a sense of urgency.\n\nAnother activity that helps is social gatherings, it\u2019s important for companies to have occasional fun hours. One-on-one sessions are also helpful. These are open-ended meetings with employees, where the manager finds out how they\u2019re doing as human beings and what\u2019s going on in their lives.\n\nHe ends with a caveat \u2013 it\u2019s a little difficult to build a high-performing team without working really hard.\n\n\u201cYou cannot work 80 hours a week every week, you\u2019ll burn. You also can\u2019t work 40 hours every week and materially change the world.\u201d\n\nYou have to be thoughtful and deliberate in getting work done.\n\nChichi adds that she believes companies also need to do two things.\n\nThey have to be deliberate with capacity planning. If you\u2019re growing as a company, you can\u2019t expect to have the same set of people working at the same level while the company is expanding. You need to hire more people or adjust people\u2019s roles.\n\nBe open about flex working. The output is the most important thing, let people work in ways that work for them.\n\nAt what point should a company hire an operations lead?\n\nChichi\u2019s response to this question is that the first thing to do is to have a thought process to manage operations but as soon as you have funds for it, please hire.\n\nWatch the full conversation here",

          "title": "Stax wants you to enjoy USSD with better design, without ever dialling codes again",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nMost people who started using mobile phones in the 2000s became familiar with USSD through loading and checking airtime balance. With time, mobile banking became a major use case; again for airtime transactions, but also for buying internet data, sending money and paying bills.\n\nUnlike mobile apps that need to be downloaded and installed, USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, if you insist) is lightweight and straightforward to use.\n\nDial the code for the desired service, follow the instructions e.g. \u201cpress 1 to Check Balance\u201d on each page and, provided there isn\u2019t some \u201cconnection failure\u201d or \u201centry error\u201d, your wishes will come true.\n\nA misconception is that USSD is for people who use basic phones but the feature has become mainstream even among smartphone users in Africa. A study of smartphone users in Bangladesh, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa showed that 87% of all financial-related transactions were conducted via USSD, with only 13% via mobile app.\n\nSo, USSD works well. But it still has its fair share of frustrating glitches that you normally wouldn\u2019t encounter on an app. For one, you need to memorise the code for each service you want to access. You could minimise an app to get information from, say, your notes app. But you mostly can\u2019t minimise a USSD session once it\u2019s started.\n\nUSSD\u2019s original design did not foresee \u201chow the introduction of smartphones would bridge the worlds of computing and telecommunications to form an entirely new industry,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi explains.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say we should throw it away. On the contrary, some companies recognise that USSD is here to stay in Africa. As such, they are merging the best of both worlds: stacking the visual appeal and interactivity of smartphones on top of USSD\u2019s simple and efficient backend.\n\nOne such company is Hover, a US-based company, and their solution is called Stax.\n\nMaking USSD smart\n\nStax is a mobile app currently available only to Android users in 10 countries, including Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. It has three use cases: buy airtime, send money, and request money. All without ever dialling any USSD code.\n\nStax\u2019s main promise is that users never have to dial a code again\u2026 while enjoying USSD.\n\nIt\u2019s not a digital wallet or account, so it doesn\u2019t ask for an email address or phone number. But \u2013 and this is an important but \u2013 Stax needs certain phone permissions.\n\nWhat permissions? Three precisely: to make and manage phone calls; send and view messages; and access your contacts.\n\nWith those enabled, you can input how much airtime you want to buy, choose the bank or fintech-powered account you want to debit and input the phone number to credit or select from your phonebook.\n\nIt would be great if this is where it ends but \u2013 somewhat unfortunately \u2013 Stax asks for two other permissions to complete this task of buying airtime. Permission to display on top of other apps on your phone and another to connect with mobile money and telecom services on your behalf.\n\nThis gave me pause and maybe it is because of the copy: \u201cAllow Stax to have full control of your device?\u201d\n\nThree paragraphs beneath that question describe why the permission is needed. But all the bad news I have absorbed about privacy risks over the past four years flashed before my eyes, discouraging me from clicking \u201cAllow.\u201d\n\nJess Shorland, co-founder of Hover, agrees that some work needs to be done to make users more comfortable with the permissions. But she has an explanation for why they are necessary:\n\n\u201cIt allows us to automate the USSD session on behalf of the user. We\u2019ve basically built a different interface for USSD. The user interacts with that interface in a way that is a lot more screen-reader friendly.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one big permission request\n\nIn other words, the accessibility permission is what enables Stax to do these things on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\nWhen a user gives Stax access, the app activates a screen reading functionality and acts as a web browser. USSD is still happening in the background but instead of presenting those USSD screens, Stax\u2019s SDK reads the USSD dialog, runs the functions and shows the user a familiar app interface.\n\nBut what are the risks? Because there is no way to convince a user that giving up control doesn\u2019t somehow make them a little vulnerable. Shorland says Stax only takes the information needed to enable the user complete their transaction.\n\n\u201cEverything happens client side, not on our servers. It\u2019s also what enables us to be offline,\u201d she says, emphasizing that the app is open-source as a sign of transparency.\n\nWho in Africa needs Stax?\n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of cool that Stax, a fintech app, works offline like regular USSD. But with the internet being more central to the digital and financial services space today, why should we cheer for Stax?\n\nHover CEO and co-founder Ben Lyon says they are \u201cbuilding for the world as it is today so that we can bridge it to where it ought to go.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, there were 159 million monthly active mobile money accounts in Africa, according to the GSM Association. Africa represents more than half of the global mobile money usage.\n\nLyon thinks such numbers and smartphone usage \u2013 expected to double to 678 million by the end of 2025 \u2013 will make USSD even more mainstream. \u201cIt is a standard view of the tech industry that USSD is a bygone thing. It is actually just categorically wrong.\u201d\n\nIf that view is wrong as he insists and if USSD\u2019s user experience needs to be modernised for the smartphone age, then solutions like Stax would seem right on time.\n\nStax wants the app to be under 10MB so that it will work easily on every (Android) phone. Average transaction time is supposed to be 12 seconds.\n\nMy airtime purchase this morning took a bit longer. It showed a transaction failure message at the end and my bank debited me two seconds later. But I got the airtime.\n\nStax is\u2026 a work in progress\n\nAs of today, Stax currently supports transactions for eight banks (Access, First, Guaranty, Keystone, Sterling, UBA, Wema, Zenith), OPay and Paga.\n\nBeing in the USSD business in Nigeria means getting into the CBN (banks) vs NCC (telcos) scuffle around who pays for USSD services. What does Hover think about this debate?\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that USSD is about accessibility and inclusion, I believe strongly that consumers should not pay to access the channel,\u201d Lyon says.\n\n\u201cI hope NCC and other players come around to this view that consumers should not pay.\u201d\n\nOutside of that and other potential headaches, Stax\u2019s focus will be on convincing individuals and businesses that the app is reliable for all seasons and geographies, regardless of internet connection, says Peace Itimi, who leads growth for the product.\n\n\u201cWe are not monetizing Stax yet and it\u2019s not on the near term roadmap to monetize it,\u201d Lyon says. \u201cThere is a WhatsApp sized opportunity here and our first priority is to make sure we can seize the opportunity at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBen also name-drops WeChat as a possible inspiration for monetization. With a large user base, Stax could begin enabling discovery and access to third party services, in what could make Stax a super app of sorts.\n\n\u201cWhen people understand what the product can do, they will fall in love with it,\u201d Itimi says.\n\nThat depends: on how they fix those curious accessibility permissions, and if people really feel the need to switch from basic USSD \u2013 which works okay \u2013 to a shinier, app-enabled life.",

          "text": "This might be it!\n\nFinally, a financial app that considers the lifestyle of regular people, the harsh economic situation in the country, and everyday financial challenges that influence how people borrow, save or invest.\n\nCan we pique your interest?\n\nLet\u2019s start with savings. Some of us have been saving from when we were kids and it was cool to have a piggybank. Beyond piggybanks and other traditional ways of saving like Esusu, it has become common to save with banks and almost everyone has a savings account. Some even have up to three. But what value do you get from those savings accounts or the Esusu contribution? How much interest do you earn from them in a month?. Probably nothing. In most cases, you even pay more on annoying charges. The good news is that savings has evolved. It\u2019s no longer enough to just keep money anywhere and call it savings. Financial apps like Branch, PiggyVest and Kuda have shown that your savings can be an investment which allows you to earn actual interest, no matter how small. People hardly have enough to money to meet their financial needs and this clearly influences the service features on majority of these financial apps.\n\nHowever, they all differ in the interest they offer on their platforms. If you\u2019re familiar with all the top ones, a quick research will show you that while several savings and investment apps offer sumptuous interest rates with up to 15% per annum being the highest, Branch sets the pace with 20% interest rate per annum. Branch is also the only financial app so far that offers flexible withdrawals, which means your money doesn\u2019t have to be locked for any minimum duration. Afterall, we save for rainy days, don\u2019t we? So if the rainy day comes you should have access to your money.\n\nAll the things your bank won\u2019t do.\n\nHere are a few more things that sets Branch apart from both your regular banking and other financial apps.\n\nAt your beck and call, for a cost: Trust your bank to be on top of their game when they send you notifications but obviously at a cost. Branch has no such thing as SMS alert fees.\n\nPay, to pay bills: Every month, you pay all sorts of bills like DSTV and PHCN on your regular financial apps and banking apps. But of course, it always comes at a cost \u2013 N100 here, N50 there. Some banks even say this cost is negligible, but everyone knows if you stack up enough N100 notes, you\u2019ll eventually have enough to do something that is not negligible. Again, with Branch, this service is free!\n\nTransfer fees: How many transfers have you made in the last month alone? How many did you make last year? If you add up all the charges you pay for making transfers in a month, you can at least buy airtime or data with it. If you add up all the cost for a year, who knows what you can buy with it. The point is, in the end, all these costs and charges add up to something. So if you can make unlimited transfers for free, why would you rather pay for it? Branch doesn\u2019t think you should pay for it though.\n\nAnybody home? \u2013 Customer service with most banks would leave a sour taste in your mouth. They will put you hold. They will tell you the problem can\u2019t be solved remotely and you should go to a branch near you. When you get to the bank branch, you\u2019ll be in a queue, then you\u2019ll fill forms. Finally, they\u2019ll tell you to go wait at home that it will be done in a few days. That doesn\u2019t happen with Branch. Branch customer service team is available 24/7 and all problems are resolved in-app.\n\nBonus programs: Most financial apps have some form of bonus program but none of them is like Branch. Branch has a second-generation referral system that makes referrals a win-win for all parties. Whereas other financial apps pay one-time bonuses for referrals, Branch pays you N500 when friends you refer pay up their first loan. The friends you invited also earn N500. In addition, you earn N50 for every deposit of N300 and above. How cool is that?\n\nThe money part: Branch gives you up to N500,000 in loans within seconds of applying on the app. No collateral or paperwork required. Start with small loan amounts and get higher amounts the more you repay.\n\nClearly, Branch offers you more flexibility and a lot more profit than other financial apps. So if you\u2019ve been suffering from poor financial services, it\u2019s time to make a switch. Branch can be downloaded on the Google Play Store",

          "text": "Weakest link in cybersecurity chain is people, here\u2019s what SMEs can do\n\nAt the recent Franco Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) virtual conference on cybersecurity and process automation in today\u2019s business environment, experts reveal how small businesses can protect themselves against cybersecurity threats within and outside the business writes ISAAC ANYAOGU.\n\nWith over 3 billion users connected globally, the internet has brought the world together enabling instant communication, remote work, and business facilitation.\n\n\u201cIt is also come embedded with a multitude of vulnerabilities which poses a significant security threat to users and has led to the emergence of a cybersecurity threat,\u201d said Moses Umoru, the director-general of the FNCCI during a recent webinar held May 19.\n\nRead Also: Why cybersecurity lessons are required for Nigerian children\n\nIn Nigeria, it is estimated that the annual financial loss due to cybersecurity breaches was N250billion in 2017, N280 billion in 2018, N288billion in 2019 and 2020, it increased to over N1trillion in damages.\n\nWhat is even more disconcerting is that experts say that 95 percent of security threats are not reported. So if the figures reported are are these huge, it indicates how much threat to businesses, to profits and operations, cybersecurity presents, Umoru said.\n\nIt is getting even more dangerous, as the coronavirus pandemic has shifted many businesses online, with remote working becoming a common trend, it is bringing the threat of malicious intrusion into the networks of businesses closer to home.\n\nThis is why taking control of the human element which constitutes the weakest link in the security chain is vital, analysts at the virtual conference said.\n\nFunmilola Odumuboni, senior manager, risk advisory at Delloite and Touche, in her presentation said cybersecurity encompasses three main things, confidentiality, integrity, and availability, all factors vulnerable to human errors.\n\nConfidentiality implies that customers\u2019 records, phone numbers, account balances, and other sensitive information do not get into the wrong hands.\n\nIntegrity entails an ability to prevent someone from manipulating a customer\u2019s information. It is the correctness of the information a business is processing and relying on to make decisions.\n\nThen availability speaks to systems and processes not failing, being available so as to prevent an outrage because the business cannot render a service. These are the pain points for businesses when cybersecurity is compromised.\n\nThreat landscape\n\nWith many businesses going online, the threat landscape in Nigeria is evolving. COVID-19 has forced many businesses online faster than they normally would. Many struggling to deal with the impact of the virus are making the right investments to protect themselves online making them vulnerable to new threats.\n\n\u201cIf your business needs to grow, you need technology, now we have remote working, remote customers, so you cannot afford to do business without leveraging technology but also the risks increases,\u201d said Odumuboni.\n\nThis has led to the proliferation of bad actors in cyberspace. \u201cSome people go into cyber crimes as a business and they are looking for low hanging fruits like small businesses to attack and there has been a phenomenal increase in attacks on them. Many have shifted to remote work without the facilities to harden their systems,\u201d said Odumuboni.\n\nThe threat landscape includes hacktivists who in the name of a social cause hack into systems of public and private institutions. During the #EndSARS protests in Nigeria last year, some hacktivists hacked into the website of the Nigerian police.\n\nNation-states are investing in cybersecurity both from a defensive and offensive standpoint.\n\nMalicious insiders, according to some experts constitute over 80 percent of attacks. These are people a business has given some level of access through their network and they want to cause harm.\n\nThreats can also come from rogue suppliers and even competitors.\n\nThese bad actors are after sensitive data including corporate information, board reports, financial information, and investor confidential details.\n\nSome cybercriminals also seek to commit financial fraud such as wire transfers and payments. Some seek to disrupt a business or threaten the health and safety of a community.\n\nAccording to Odumuboni, business email compromise has become rife. It is where the attackers take over an email communication between two organisations for financial gain.\n\nOdumuboni explains that in this situation, a company is talking to another on a financial transaction, cybercriminals intercept that communication and change their account detail.\n\nThe parties, oblivious to this intrusion, continue their interaction and when one party pays, they will pay into the attacker\u2019s account instead of paying into the correct organisation\u2019s account.\n\nThis is becoming rampant now because a lot of organisations are using cloud-based systems for their emails and other processes, many on shared cloud service.\n\nTactics\n\nObukohwo Obukonise, senior systems and cybersecurity engineer at Schneider Electric, in his presentation said there are so many hacking tools available online and most do not require a special skill set.\n\nOne common method used in cyber crimes is phishing in which a target or targets are contacted by email, telephone, or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data.\n\nRansomeware is another method that is a type of malicious software that is designed to block access to a computer system until a ransom is paid.\n\nThere are also cloud data breaches that describe incidents that have the potential to disclose sensitive information to an unauthorized party.\n\nAnother common attack is a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack)in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.\n\nIn Zero-day attacks, a computer-software vulnerability unknown to those who should be interested in its mitigation is introduced and until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect programs, data, additional computers, or a network.\n\nMalware, short for malicious software, consists of code developed by cyber attackers, designed to cause extensive damage to data and systems or to gain unauthorized access to a network.\n\nThere has been an exponential increase in the creation of malware. Experts estimate that in the last seven years malware has grown from 470million created in 2015 to over 1.2 trillion on the internet today.\n\nOther forms of attacks include negative social media coverage and impersonation, supply chain attacks, and stolen credentials.\n\nMany companies, even if they have smart cybersecurity systems are still susceptible to attacks due to third-party compromise.\n\nBusinesses have relationships with organisations and share information, sometimes their network is even extended to other organisations because of the kinds of businesses they do and if their partners are not implementing the same security procedures, they could become the weak link.\n\nDevelop a strategy\n\nIn many organisations, cybersecurity threats are issues considered at the board level highlighting how important it has become to the well being of a business.\n\nOdumuboni said that organisations need to have a strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have firewalls, but you need a strategy, based on what my organisation does, this is how I will protect my business.\u201d\n\nShe further recommended that business owners need to be aware of the cybersecurity threat landscape, routinely access their networks for vulnerability, maintain visibility across the system to detect threats before they fester, and develop capabilities to respond quickly to attacks.\n\nAccording to Babatunde Abagun, channel manager, West, East, and Central Africa at \u200eNutanix, said research has shown that defensive capabilities of businesses such as antimalware are being eroded by machine learning and artificial intelligence employed by cybercriminals.\n\nOne organisation in the UK that was recently scammed of over $230,000 in phishing attacks, approved payment based on voice approval from the CEO. It turns out that it was AI software that mimicked the voice of the CEO.\n\nAbagun said businesses should protect their people from themselves. \u201cIf you have a child, you will child-proof the house, similarly you need to security-proof your infrastructure not just for threats available now but for those that will come in the future,\u201d said Abagun.\n\nOne way to do this is to establish technologies that actually automate certain processes. Some concepts like list privilege which means giving every individual the minimum amount of capability they require to perform their job function was highly recommended.\n\nA few years ago, the Twitter account of former US President Donald Trump was briefly deactivated by a disgruntled Twitter staff on his last day on the job. This could be prevented with list privilege.\n\nThe experts also recommend maintaining a zero-trust security process, limiting devices that could be intrusive, effectively training personnel, and writing adequate cybersecurity policies for the business.",

          "text": "The Nigerian economy, which is in dire straits at the moment, is still waiting for the federal government with its intervention in the housing sector as provided for in the economic sustainability plan (ESP) more than 12 months after that plan was inaugurated.\n\nESP is part of the government\u2019s responses to the COVID-19 pandemic aimed to provide stimulus package to businesses and critical sectors. Housing was listed among growth sectors and the strategy was to provide 300,000 housing units yearly.\n\nThe expectation was that the construction of these houses would generate activities in the economy. The strategy envisaged the creation of 1.8 million jobs, starting in 12 months and subsequently creating 1.5 million homes for families across the country.\n\n12 months after, it remains to be seen or heard where these houses, which target low-income earners, are being built. As a result, jobs are not being created, leading to more Nigerians falling into poverty.\n\nAbout 82.9 million Nigerians were in poverty before COVID-19, according to the World Bank. On October 7, 2020, the Bank said that Nigeria, with a poverty rate of 39.1 percent, has the largest poor population (79 million extreme poor) in Sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for 20 percent of the total poor in the region.\n\nRead Also: How Sanwo-Olu is bridging housing deficit in Lagos\n\nThe bank says 10 million Nigerians were forced into poverty as a result of COVID-19, adding that the country\u2019s poor population is set to rise from 82.9 million in 2019 to 90.0 million in 2022 due to natural population growth.\n\nBut with the economic effects of the COVID-19 crisis, the national poverty rate is instead forecast to jump from 40.1 percent in 2019 to 45.2 percent in 2022, implying that 100.9 million Nigerians will be living in poverty by 2022.\n\nThis is an unfortunate and worrisome situation which, in part, would have been solved by the ESP strategy on housing and other growth sectors if it had been followed through as planned.\n\nThe strategy which got a N200 billion lifeline from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is an ambitious one which was why it was hailed by housing sector stakeholders even though the 300,000 housing units, according to them, was like a drop of water in an ocean given a 20-million housing deficit.\n\n\u201cFederal government\u2019s decision to build 300,000 houses across the country and also to spend N2 trillion on rural roads construction is a welcome development that will positively impact the economy in various ways,\u201d Femi Akintunde, GMD, Alpha Mead Group, noted.\n\n\u201cFirst, it is a form of reflationary measure that will stimulate economic output through increased spending in housing and infrastructure development. Such investment will create large-scale employment, increase the stock of housing and the provision of additional road infrastructure will help to improve connectivity and ease our logistics challenges,\u201d he added.\n\nAmong other things, the ESP strategy aims at easing bottlenecks in the delivery of social housing and delivering affordable homes through direct government interventions in housing construction.\n\nIt involves working with state governments to identify land for housing construction in all Local Government Areas and targets 100 percent local input for the construction of 400 homes in each Local Government Area.\n\nThe project elements include standardising the design of homes for cost management and industrialisation of the construction process, identifying and selecting delivery partners formed by groups of professionals and artisanal builders as primary delivery channels as well as creating a \u2018homes warehouse\u2019 to buy completed homes from delivery partners, in the absence of ready off-takers.\n\nSimilarly, there were also plans for encouraging private sector involvement and facilitating maturity of the mortgage market that will cater to the needs of middle-class Nigerians while government addresses the needs of low-income earners and the poor.\n\nAll these underpin the concerns raised so far by housing industry stakeholders on the government\u2019s delay and/or slow take-off of the intervention scheme.\n\nAnalyst\u2019s views on possible causes of this delay are varied. While an economist who did not want to be named explained to BusinessDay that government did not have the needed money to build the projected houses, Akintunde blames structural dislocations in the housing sector financing structure.\n\nVictor Onukwugha, President, Association of Housing Corporations of Nigeria (AHCN), was quoted recently as commending the inclusion of the housing sector in the ESP but faulted the actual execution strategies of the project elements which, he noted, were vague without a clear cut plan and roles for executions.\n\n\u201cIt is a year now that the plan was rolled out and from what we can all see, not much has been achieved in easing bottlenecks in the delivery of social housing aside from the purported release of N200 billion by Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for the project. The second track, which proposes to deliver affordable homes through direct government intervention is still hanging,\u201d he said.",

We are committed to preserving our ecosystem so that all elements are well aligned to meet our developmental needs.\n\n\u201cAs a government, we have undertaken extensive reforms to preserve our forests by engaging with investors in plantation agriculture so that a good cache of our forests is protected and preserved, even as they go about their businesses in a sustainable manner.\u201d\n\nThe governor noted that the theme for this year\u2019s commemoration, \u2018We Are Part of the Solution\u2019 is apt and demonstrates the approach taken by the state in getting all relevant stakeholders involved in preserving the state\u2019s biodiversity.\n\nAccording to UN Secretary-General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, \u201cAs the global community is called to re-examine our relationship to the natural world, one thing is certain: despite all our technological advances, we are completely dependent on healthy and vibrant ecosystems for our water, food, medicines, clothes, fuel, shelter and energy, just to name a few.\n\n\u201cThis year 2021 the theme is \u201cWe\u2019re part of the solution\u201d.

They sang the state\u2019s PDP victory song \u201cStand up for Jesus!\u201d\n\nThe PDP Chairman in Rivers, Desmond Akawor, told Mr Wike and the crowd that the rally was \u201cthe final burial\u201d for the APC in the oil-rich state.\n\n\u201cToday, the pillars of that party (APC), those who left during the hard times, who thought they would have seen greener pastures, they have toiled day and night and they have discovered that there is no other better place than home, and they have decided to come back home (the PDP) today,\u201d Mr Akawor said before receiving the defectors.\n\nOne of the defectors said he went to the APC on \u201cloan\u201d to \u201csave a sinking ship\u201d, while another said that the APC has been destroyed in Rivers because of the \u201cinsincerity\u201d of the party leaders.\n\nGovernor Wike said at the rally that the PDP would continue to win elections in Rivers.\n\nInsensitive?\n\nSeveral Nigerians believe the Port Harcourt rally was a display of insensitivity to the national mourning mood.\n\n\u201cThere is something called national mood,\u201d a Facebook user said of the rally. \u201cWhat is so special about Wike hosting APC decampees today that can\u2019t wait till another day?\u201d\n\nPREMIUM TIMES could not immediately get a comment from the Rivers State government, as the Commissioner for Information in the state, Paulinus Nsirim did not respond to calls from the newspaper.\n\n\u2018Officers\u2019 death colossal loss to Nigeria\u2019 \u2013 Wike\n\nGovernor Wike, in a statement earlier on Saturday, however, described the death of Mr Attahiru and other officers as a \u201ccolossal loss\u201d to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is with profound sadness that I convey the deepest condolences of the Government and people of Rivers State to the Nigerian Armed Forces and bereaved families of Lieutenant General Ibrahim Attahiru and other military personnel on board the ill-fated aircraft.\n\n\u201cWe feel deeply saddened by the colossal loss of these patriotic and thoroughbred officers who sacrificed their lives to make our nation safe. Our thoughts are with the Nigerian Armed Forces and affected families in this hour of grief,\u201d the governor said in the statement from his media aide, Kelvin Ebiri.\n\nMr Wike\u2019s party, the PDP has described the late officers as \u201cheroes who gave their lives for the security of our nation\u201d.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nLeader of apex Yoruba sociopolitical organisation, Afenifere, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, has expressed concern over what he called undemocratic and reckless shoot-on-sight order against agitators in the Southeast zone of the country by the Acting Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba Alkali, noting that it\u2019s an indication that people of the zone are no longer safe.\n\nThe Acting IGP had on Tuesday last week, declared war on pro Biafra agitators and gunmen attacking and destroying police infrastructure in the Southeast and South-South regions and ordered their complete extermination.\n\nThe police boss who spoke on the sideline while addressing the Police Mobile Force and Special Tactical Squad of the Force in Enugu shortly after he launched Operation Restore Peace, directed policemen in the region not to adhere to the rules of engagement while dealing with Biafra secessionist groups, adding that his job was to protect them.\n\nHe went ahead to threaten police officers who fail to carry out his orders and gets killed in the process.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind the media shout; do the job I command you. If anyone accuses you of human rights violation, the report will come to my table and you know what I will do. So, take the battle to them wherever they are and kill them all. Don\u2019t wait for an order,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat another order are you waiting for when Mr. President had ordered you to shoot anybody carrying AK-47 rifle? Quote me, even a dead policeman can be tried and dismissed from the force and his family will not get his benefits.\n\n\u201cSo, don\u2019t seat and wait for them to come; take attack to them and don\u2019t lose your arms to criminals.\u201d\n\nHowever, condemning the order, Adebanjo pointed out that the move is a further escalation of President Muhammadu Buhari government\u2019s hostility towards the Southeast since he took power in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe rising hostility against the South-East Zone since the beginning of the Buhari administration has now become a matter of great concern to Afenifere, as this reality should also become a major concern to other stakeholders in the Nigerian project,\u201d Adebanjo said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe Afenifere leader, who decried the situation where two sets of laws exist in the country; a set of laws where the Fulani go scot free and another, that the lives of others, especially that of the Igbo, do not matter.\n\n\u201cTaking a look at the Security Council, no Igbo man is a member of Buhari\u2019s security architecture. Is that how to run a multi-ethnic multi-religious country like Nigeria?\u201d he queried.\n\n\u201cOne will assume that Nigeria is now a theatre of bloodshed as the streets are now lined with the blood of innocent Nigerians. With this draconian order, no opposition member is safe.\n\nHe said that if the President had no hidden agenda, there were more civilised and democratic ways to beef up security in the South East.\n\nHe urged other leaders in the zones to condemn the shoot-on-sight order to prevent another looming massacre in the South-East zone, saying: \u201cTo prevent yet another looming massacre in the South-East Zone, leaders in other zones should condemn the shoot-on-sight order. The President must be told that if he is sincere about peace and unity of this country, the order should be revoked forthwith. Certainly, if the President has no hidden agenda, there are more civilised and democratic ways to beef up security in the South-East.\u201d",

The risk of death and injury reduces considerably when speeds are lowered.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, people have devised a means to work from home which has decreased their mobility; however the fatality numbers still remain as people still drive at higher speeds.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThese calls for an urgent action to ensure people enjoy a safe road travel as well as have a healthy and green city.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason that GreenLight Initiative is calling on road management agencies such as the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) to enact and implement a 30km speed limit policy in high risks areas such as school zones, streets, and market corridors.\n\n\u201cThe theme for the 6th UN Global Road Safety Week is Street for Life \u2013 \u201cLove30\u201d.The Week is designed to advocate for 30km speed reduction as well as strengthen the efforts to secure political involvement, commitment and policy change for low-speed and liveable communities where people walk, play and live.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a call for an urgent action on the speeds on our streets, worldwide. This call for action is urgent because it saves lives. It promotes healthy lifestyle as it helps reduce carbon emission. It is also urgent for the sake of children and youths as research over the years have shown that they are the most vulnerable to road traffic crashes.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cIt is also pertinent to note that the World Health Organization (WHO) document on managing speed in line with the Stockholm Declaration and the Global Plan for the new Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021-2030 suggests five actions to be carried out to ensure a safe and liveable street for people worldwide.\n\n\u201cThese includes establishing speed limits appropriate to the function of each road, enforcing speed limits, building or modifying roads to include features that calm traffic, Installation of in-vehicle technologies and raising awareness about the dangers of speeding.\n\n\u201cTo mark this year\u2019s 6th UN Global Road Safety Week 2021 in Nigeria, GreenLight Initiative has partnered different organization to implement advocacy campaign programs.\u201d\n\nHe added the programmes seek to highlight the benefits of low-speed streets in urban areas as well as call on policy-makers to limit speeds to 30 km/h on streets where pedestrians, cyclists and others vulnerable road users mix with traffic.\n\n\u201cThe program further strives to support the attainment of the second Decade of Action 2021-2030 and the Global Road Safety agenda.\n\n\u201cGreenLight Initiative (GLI) is a non-profit that strives to improve transportation safety and sustainable development.

Alfred Etta Odok, described Ayade as a good man, who decided to move to another platform to give space for some elements in the party to ventilate properly.\n\n\u201cAgreed that they were the ones, who made Ayade the governor of the state. However, when you make some one a king, you have a responsibility to honour the person as a king and not to ridicule him, otherwise the king would walk away,\u201d Odok said.\n\nOn why the governor turned the PDP secretariat to that of APC since there was an APC secretariat on ground before his defection, Odok said: \u201cIf I have my property and I changed address, will I not go with it.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on the development, Commissioner for Environment, Mr. Mfon Bassey, stressed that there was nothing strange about the conversion, adding that it was Ayade who paid for all outstanding rent on the property due to its owner.\n\n\u201cNothing new about this, the premises is rented and the governor pays the rent. The building which he has rented and paid for is not expected to be used by the PDP,\u201d Bassey said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, the State Police Command has warned against any plan to disrupt the ongoing renovation work on the party secretariat.\n\nThe warning came in a statement issued on Saturday morning signed by the Police public relations officer, DSP Irene Igbo.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt the property is a rented property, the \u201cTenancy\u201d is not in \u2018Contention \u2018\n\n\u201cAs a responsible Command, we will not sit back and watch any person(s) come to disrupt the relative peace we have worked tirelessly to achieve. All are warned to maintain peace, law and order.\n\n\u201cThe current situation is a wake-up call to men of character to rise up, put resources together to enplace structure that will not be contentious in future.\n\n\u201cThe Cross River Police Command will not hesitate to deal decisively with any unlawful action with the full weight of the law,\u201d the police warned.",

          "text": "Two days after the defection of the Cross River State governor, Ben Ayade, to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the once opposition party in the state has taken over the secretariat of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Calabar, the state capital.\n\nGovernor Ayade had dumped the PDP for the APC with thousands of his supporters, boasting that: \u201cIf I move, people would move with me.\u201d\n\nWhen our correspondent visited the former state secretariat of the PDP, painters were seen rebranding the secretariat to APC colours with armed policemen on guard.\n\nSpecial Adviser to the governor on Political Affairs, Evang. Alfred Etta Odok, described Ayade as a good man, who decided to move to another platform to give space for some elements in the party to ventilate properly.\n\n\u201cAgreed that they were the ones, who made Ayade the governor of the state. However, when you make some one a king, you have a responsibility to honour the person as a king and not to ridicule him, otherwise the king would walk away,\u201d Odok said.\n\nOn why the governor turned the PDP secretariat to that of APC since there was an APC secretariat on ground before his defection, Odok said: \u201cIf I have my property and I changed address, will I not go with it.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on the development, Commissioner for Environment, Mr. Mfon Bassey, stressed that there was nothing strange about the conversion, adding that it was Ayade who paid for all outstanding rent on the property due to its owner.\n\n\u201cNothing new about this, the premises is rented and the governor pays the rent. The building which he has rented and paid for is not expected to be used by the PDP,\u201d Bassey said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, the State Police Command has warned against any plan to disrupt the ongoing renovation work on the party secretariat.\n\nThe warning came in a statement issued on Saturday morning signed by the Police public relations officer, DSP Irene Igbo.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt the property is a rented property, the \u201cTenancy\u201d is not in \u2018Contention \u2018\n\n\u201cAs a responsible Command, we will not sit back and watch any person(s) come to disrupt the relative peace we have worked tirelessly to achieve. All are warned to maintain peace, law and order.\n\n\u201cThe current situation is a wake-up call to men of character to rise up, put resources together to enplace structure that will not be contentious in future.\n\n\u201cThe Cross River Police Command will not hesitate to deal decisively with any unlawful action with the full weight of the law,\u201d the police warned.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe remains of the late Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant-General Ibrahim Attahiru, and 10 other officers who died in a plane crash were laid to rest at the National Military Cemetery, Abuja on Saturday.\n\nThe crash occurred on Friday in Kaduna.\n\nThe names of the other officers include Brigadier-General MI Abdulkadir, Brigadier-General Olayinka, Brigadier-General Kuliya, Major LA Hayat, Major Hamza and Sergeant Umar.\n\nOthers are Flight-Lieutenant TO Asaniyi, Flight-Lieutenant AA Olufade, Sergeant Adesina and ACM Oyedepo.\n\nTheir remains were moved from the 44 Nigerian Army Referral Hospital, Kaduna to the National Mosque and the Nigerian Air Force Protestant Church in Abuja for prayers.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe remains were later moved to the National Military Cemetary for the interment ceremony.\n\nThe burial ceremony started around 2.50 pm with a profile of the late COAS read.\n\nA moment of silence was observed after which the fallen officers were honoured with a 21-gun salute.\n\nDignitaries at the event include Senate President, Ahmad Lawan; the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha; the Chief of Defence Staff, General Leo Irabor; the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Oladayo Amao; Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, among others.\n\n\u2018Inclement Weather\u2019\n\nFriday\u2019s air crash was the third military air disaster this year.\n\nAn Air Force jet supporting ground troops fighting Boko Haram terrorists went missing in north-east Borno in March.\n\nIn February, seven officials died after a military plane crashed in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nAttahiru was only appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari last January in a shakeup of the senior command to better fight surging violence and a more than decade-long jihadist insurgency.\n\nBut the president, who offered his condolences just hours after the crash in the northern state of Kaduna, did not attend the funeral, an absence widely criticised on social media.\n\nAttahiru died as news emerged that Nigeria\u2019s Boko Haram jihadist leader Abubakar Shekau had himself been seriously wounded or possibly killed after clashes with a rival Islamic State-allied faction.\n\nThe aircraft went down trying to land at the Kaduna International Airport \u201cdue to inclement weather\u201d, the armed forces said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s military has been battling an Islamist insurgency in the northeast since 2009, a conflict that has killed more than 40,000 and displaced around two million more.\n\nAttahiru had once been in charge of leading the frontline offensive against Boko Haram\u2019s commander Shekau in the northeast in 2017.\n\nLocal intelligence sources said Shekau had been seriously wounded Wednesday when rival jihadists attacked his stronghold in the northeastern state of Borno.\n\nSources said Shekau was wounded when he shot himself to try to evade capture by militants from the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP).\n\nOne intelligence source said Shekau had already died from his wounds in Nainawa village on Thursday, though that was not confirmed by authorities.\n\nNeither ISWAP nor Boko Haram have reported Shekau dead, but analysts said his loss would be a huge blow to his faction and potentially allow ISWAP to consolidate territorial control in Nigeria\u2019s northeast.",

Internet blackouts hampered media coverage in some cities.\n\nThe largely leaderless and politically unstructured Hirak movement was launched in 2019 over then-president Abdelaziz Bouteflika\u2019s bid for a fifth term in office.\n\nThe ailing leader was forced to step down weeks later, but Hirak has continued its demonstrations, demanding a sweeping overhaul of a ruling system in place since Algeria\u2019s independence from France in 1962.\n\nMarches were suspended for about a year due to the coronavirus pandemic, but protesters have returned to the streets since February and given the movement new momentum.\n\nThe interior ministry last week said Hirak protest organisers would have to advise authorities of demonstrations in advance, a move that came amid mounting government pressure on the movement as early legislative elections approach.\n\nHirak has rejected the June 12 vote, and human rights organisations have warned of increasing repression in the lead-up to the polls.\n\nAt least 133 people are currently detained in connection with the Hirak movement or cases related to freedom of expression, according to Algerian Detainees, a journalist-run website.",

          "title": "Israel and Hamas Both Claim Victory as Ceasefire Holds",
          "text": "Israel and Hamas both claimed victory on Friday after their forces ended 11 days of fighting, but humanitarian officials warned that the damage to Gaza would take years to rebuild.\n\nAfter working behind the scenes for days to reach a truce, the White House said Washington had received assurances from the relevant parties that they were committed to the ceasefire.\n\nAs Palestinians and Israelis began to assess the scale of the damage, one Gazan said his neighbourhood looked as if it had been hit by a tsunami. \u201cHow can the world call itself civilised?\u201d Abu Ali asked, standing next to the rubble of a 14-storey tower block.\n\nPalestinian officials put the reconstruction costs at tens of millions of dollars, while economists said the fighting could curb Israel\u2019s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFive more bodies were pulled from Gaza\u2019s rubble, taking the death toll to 248, including 66 children, with more than 1,900 wounded.\n\nThe Israeli military said an Israeli soldier had been killed as well as 12 civilians, including two children. Hundreds were treated for injuries after rocket salvoes caused panic and sent people as far away as Tel Aviv rushing into shelters.\n\nWorld Health Organization spokeswoman Margaret Harris said Gaza\u2019s health facilities were in danger of being overwhelmed by the thousands of injuries.\n\nShe called for immediate access into the Gaza Strip for health supplies and personnel. \u201cThe real challenges are the closures,\u201d she told a virtual UN briefing.\n\nGaza has for years been subjected to an Israeli blockade that restricts the passage of people and goods, as well as restrictions by Egypt.\n\nBoth countries cite concerns about weapons reaching Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza and led the rocket barrage. Palestinians say the restrictions amount to collective punishment of Gaza\u2019s 2 million population.\n\nFabrizio Carboni, regional director of the International Committee of the Red Cross, echoed WHO\u2019s call for urgent medical supplies, adding: \u201cIt will take years to rebuild \u2013 and even more to rebuild the fractured lives.\u201d\n\nUS President Joe Biden said on Thursday that aid would be sent quickly to Gaza, but coordinated with the Palestinian Authority \u2013 Hamas\u2019s Western-backed rival in the occupied West Bank \u2013 \u201cin a manner that does not permit Hamas to simply restock its military arsenal\u201d.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a televised address to Israelis, saying the operation had damaged Hamas\u2019s ability to launch missiles at Israel.\n\nHe said Israel had destroyed Hamas\u2019s extensive tunnel network, its rocket factories, weapons laboratories and storage facilities, and killed more than 200 militants, including 25 senior figures.\n\n\u201cHamas can\u2019t hide anymore. That\u2019s a great achievement for Israel,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe eliminated an important part of Hamas\u2019s and Islamic Jihad\u2019s command echelon. And whoever was not killed knows today that our long arm can reach him anywhere, above ground or underground.\u201d\n\nIsrael said Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other militant groups fired around 4,350 rockets from Gaza during the conflict, of which around 640 fell short into the Gaza Strip. The Israeli military said that 90% of those that crossed the border had been intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defence system.\n\nIran, which does not recognise Israel but supports Hamas and says it has transformed the Palestinian fighters\u2019 arsenal, said they had won a \u201chistoric victory\u201d over Israel. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards warned Israel to expect \u201cdeadly blows\u201d.\n\nHamas chief Ismail Haniyeh cast the fighting as successful resistance to a militarily and economically stronger foe.\n\n\u201cWe will rebuild what the occupation (Israel) destroyed and restore our capabilities,\u201d he said, \u201cand we will not abandon our obligations and duties to the families of martyrs, the wounded and those whose homes were destroyed.\u201d\n\nHaniyeh expressed gratitude to Egyptian, Qatari and U.N. mediators, and to Iran, \u201cwhich has not given up on providing the resistance with money, weapons and technology\u201d.\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged Muslim states in a statement to \u201csupport the Palestinian people, through military \u2026 or financial support \u2026 or in rebuilding Gaza\u2019s infrastructure\u201d.\n\nEzzat el-Reshiq, a senior member of the Hamas political bureau, told Reuters in Doha the movement\u2019s demands included protection for the Al-Aqsa mosque, and for Palestinians threatened with eviction from their homes in East Jerusalem.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas hostilities were set off on May 10 in part by Israeli police raids on the Al-Aqsa compound and clashes with Palestinians during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\nThousands gathered there again for this Friday\u2019s prayers, with many demonstrating in support of Gaza.\n\nIsraeli police fired stun grenades towards demonstrators, who threw rocks and petrol bombs at officers, and Palestinian medics said some 20 Palestinians were wounded.\n\nThe confrontations died down within about an hour, with Israeli police pulling back to the compound\u2019s gates.\n\nCivilians on both sides of the Gaza border were sceptical about the chances for peace.\n\n\u201cWhat is truce? What does it mean?\u201d said Samira Abdallah Naseer, a mother of 11 children sitting near the wreckage of a building near Beit Hanoun in the north of the Gaza Strip.\n\n\u201cWe returned to our houses, and we found no place to sit, no water, no electricity, no mattresses, nothing,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a cafe in the Israeli port city of Ashdod, north of Gaza, student Dan Kiri, 25, said Israel should continue attacking Hamas until it collapsed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time until the next operation in Gaza,\u201d he said.\n\nThe truce, mediated by Egypt, appeared to be part of a two-stage deal, with Cairo sending security delegations to Tel Aviv and the Palestinian territories to agree on measures to maintain stability.\n\nWhite House spokesman Jen Psaki said that \u201cour engagement with the leader of Egypt was a key part of that discussion and a key part of bringing an end to the conflict, given their important relationship with Hamas\u201d. Biden on Thursday made his first call to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as president.\n\nThe biggest obstacle to securing a deal was concern from Israel and Hamas about the public reactions from their own side, and their opponents, if they accepted a ceasefire, two Egyptian security sources said.\n\n\u201cIn our negotiations with the two parties, we depended on the need for each of them to see the scale of the damage done to civilians, and we charged each party with its criminal and international liabilities towards civilians,\u201d one of the sources said.",
