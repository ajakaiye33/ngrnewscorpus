          "text": "The Social Democratic Party, on Monday knocked the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for failing in his promise of ensuring a free and fair election in Nigeria.\n\nThe party said that the President must ensure a level-playing ground for parties during the Ekiti State governorship election.\n\nThe SDP also came hard on Buhari over his boast that the All Progressive Congress will win the forthcoming governorship election in Ekiti State, warning that it might affect the overall credibility of the entire electoral process.\n\nThe party\u2019s National Chairman, Shehu Gaban, stated these in Abuja during the inauguration of the party\u2019s National Convention Organising Committee ahead of its presidential primary election scheduled for June 8.\n\nOther members of the committee included Dr. Olu Agunloye (Secretary); Ibrahim Modibo (Deputy Chairman); Dr. Umar Ardo, Nseobong Akpabio, Emmanuel Ojukwu, Saadatu Abdullahi, Maggie Batubo, Alkali Mohammed and Gift Wada.\n\nGaban said the committee headed by a former governor of Ekiti state and its governorship candidate, Chief Segun Oni, would organise a convention where delegates would elect its presidential candidate.\n\nWhile responding to questions from journalists, he said the President has failed in his promise of leaving Nigerians with a legacy of free and fair elections.\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019m confident that what the President said is a distraction to the APC and not the SDP; the SDP will win Ekiti State. Buhari has no right to intervene in other states and who becomes the governor. The citizens of that state will determine who becomes the governor of the state.\n\n\u201cThis same Buhari has said more than ten times that he wants to leave a legacy of free and fair elections; so far that legacy has not been displayed anywhere even within the APC. The crisis in the APC is because there\u2019s a lack of transparency.\n\n\u201cFor the President to make that remark, maybe it\u2019s simply because we will not allow his party to rig in Ekiti State. So far, they are not close to where we are in Ekiti State.\u201d\n\nGaban added that they have written to relevant authorities including Buhari to ensure a free and fair election in Ekiti State.\n\n\u201cWe have written letters to Embassies in Nigeria, INEC, and the President and Commander in Chief that anything short of a transparent process will not be acceptable. And Ekiti will be a litmus test for this same President who talked about a legacy of free and fair elections.\n\n\u201cWe have written a letter to him that he must ensure that there\u2019s a free and fair election in Ekiti state. Because it is not about him; he doesn\u2019t own Nigeria.\n\nGabam said the SDP was guided by integrity, sagacity, and acumen in the choice of members of the committee, adding that the forthcoming convention would out-perform previous ones\n\nOni, in his acceptance remarks, said for Nigerians to have confidence in the democratic process, the political parties must practice internal democracy\n\nHe said the people of Ekiti are aware that the two major political parties are one and the same, adding that the SDP had been chosen as an alternative to them.\n\nOni said, \u201cI am very confident that we will justify the expectation of the national working committee putting us together. We want to say that this country is ripe for things like this. We have seen democracy still tottering after so many years because the internal part of it, the core of it, we have not gotten it right yet.\n\n\u201cYes, we can all shout democracy! democracy but in the real sense of it, how many parties practice democracy internally and this is where we are starting.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the democracy that is taking to the marketplace must be groomed and consumed by us first before we take it out there and this is why this exercise is very important.\n\n\u201cIt must be transparent and it must be flawless and we must give confidence to everybody, both members and non-members that this is indeed a new Nigeria,\u201d Oni said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Katumi Oboirien disclosed this during a training for selected Almajiri school teachers on human rights and processes to report human right abuses of the Almajiri children.\n\nBar. Katumi said it will train the Almajiri children to become para-legals to report cases of violation of human rights back to the mini-legal clinics for quick and rapid response in order to protect the right of the almajiri children whom often times were look down upon and seen as lesser human being in the society.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWe want to set up a mini-legal clinics and we will train the Almajiri children (those who can read and write) to be para-legals to be taking information on cases of human rights abuses and report it to us. And so, a legal officer will follow-up, investigate and forward to the relevant or appropriate authorities.\n\n\u201cIf it is the one that involves mediation, we will mediate and resolve the issue. And if it is that which is violation and requires going to the police, we will take it to them and ensure that they follow-up the processes to the court and ensuring that their rights are been protected.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see issues where they are been victimized because they are Almajiri children and are seen as lesser human beings who don\u2019t have anybody to stand for them.\n\n\u201cSo for us in PRAWA, we are trying to ensure that their rights are enforced when breached.\n\n\u201cAside this, we have also introduced an Almajiri empowerment series project (skill acquisition) for the Almajiri children because we found out that it is when they go out to get food and small pocket money that they run into trouble. So the aim of the skill acquisition is to give them a means of livelihood.\n\n\u201cWe started with 40 Almajiri children who were been trained on shoe making. Eight of them successfully complete the project and produce 40 pairs of shoes.\n\n\u201cThis is trying to give them a kind of social protection and a means of livelihood so that after the Tsangaya schools they have something to fall back on to keep them going,\u201d Bar. Katumi said.\n\nEarlier, an Almajiri school teacher, Yahaya Umar Adam said the training have exposed them to various processes and relevant authorities to report and follow-up cases of human rights of the Almajiri children.\n\nAdam also said they were taught to be cautious in intake of the Almajiri children without consent of their parents as some hide under acquiring quranic education to tarnish the image of the Tsangaya schools as well as the sanitation and hygiene of the children.",

In contrast to these provisions, the process was hijacked and manipulated.\n\n\u201cThere was no any tentative list neither a screening of the said delegates to ensure their authenticity as substantive ones.\n\n\u201cSome of the delegates were intimidated while others short-changed by Kano State Government officials at the election venue.\n\n\u201cSome of the serving Local Government chairmen were seen commanding delegates to write the name of Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna on the ballot paper contrary to their consent and choices. While others were asked to surrender their ballot papers to one individual who was assigned to write for them by the state Government officials.\n\n\u201cSome of the government officials were among the delegates that voted\n\n\u201cThere were serious harassment and thuggery outside the hall which makes it difficult to access the indoor Hall or move out of the hall in which many party supporters where attacked by hired thugs.\n\n\u201cThere was no internal democracy and fair play in APC primaries conducted at all levels in kano state due monopoly and use of excesses of power in favour of state candidates which make the party in limbo and uncertainties for winning secondary elections.\n\n\u201cThus, we are appealing to our great party All progressive congress (APC), Kano State Primary Election Appeal Committee, 2022 and INEC to consider cancellation of the primary election of governorship for lacking the merit, over voting and other irregularities,\u201d the leader of Groups, Musa however stated.\n\nMeanwhile, the Civil Society comprises of groups such as Youth Mobilization by media, Arewa Youth Political Gladiators, Community Support for sustainable Development initiatives, Democratic Concerns Group, Kano State and Madafa Women Political Mobilization.\n\nWhen contacted for reaction, state Secretary of APC, Hon. Zakari Sarina refuted the allegations, insisting that the claims were baseless, unsubstituted and lacking all elements of fact.\n\nSarina said there wasn\u2019t anytime during the primary when delegates were prevented from casting their votes freely and or, prevented from chosen choice aspirant.\n\nThe state Secretary of APC however, advised the groups to rather channel their grievances to the APC election appeal and petitions committee instead of rushing to the media.\n\nRecall that the Kano State Deputy Governor, Dr. Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna emerged winner of the APC Gubernatorial primaries in the state after scoring 2,289 votes against his opponent, Hon.

It makes me so uncomfortable. It has been there over the years, and it poses serious health dangers to people living around here.\u201d\n\nBut a senior official of the State Environmental and Sanitation Management Agency confided in journalists that the high price of diesel has been affecting their operations.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, however, said they also planned to hire necessary equipment needed for evacuation for the monthly environmental sanitation exercise this weekend to evacuate the piled up refuse as a cost saving measure.\n\n\u201cOur problem is diesel. The high cost of diesel is affecting our evacuation machinery. But we are waiting for this weekend\u2019s sanitation exercise to evacuate them. You know we have trucks but we hire most of the other equipment needed for the evacuation like bulldozers and compactors once a month.\n\n\u201cSo, since the government is the one subsidizing us, we intend to use the opportunity of this weekend\u2019s sanitation exercise to utilize those other equipment that the government will hire to evacuate the refuse although in some areas we are already evacuating.\u201d",

          "text": "Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike yesterday reflected on his outing at Sunday\u2019s presidential primary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and blamed his loss to former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar on his Southern counterparts.\n\nWike said the Southern governors betrayed him by working against their earlier agreement that the Presidency should return to the South.\n\nAccording to him, PDP governors ganged up with some vested interests to derail the quest of the South to produce the next president on the platform of the party.\n\nHe said that those who aligned with \u201ca region (North) that ganged up\u201d against their (Southern governors) own region had inadvertently chosen to remain \u201cperpetual slaves.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who was treated to a grand reception by PDP leaders and members in Rivers State, said he stood firmly by the agreement.\n\nWike recalled that in 2019, he was the only governor in the Southsouth that \u201crefused to negotiate with the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to give them 25 per cent votes..\u201d.\n\nThe governor said he was pleased that he had sent out two clear messages: \u201cEnough is enough\u201d and .that \u201cthis country does not belong to one particular zone.\u201d\u2019\n\nHis words: \u201cI contested in an election(primary)based on the principle and agreement with all Southern governors and leaders of the South that Presidency should go to the South this period.\n\n\u201cWe have done our part. We never betrayed anybody because it is not in our blood to betray. But it is a shame to those people, some of the governors from the South, they are the people that were used to sabotage our course.\u201d\n\nWike said it was disheartening that some governors from the South chose their inordinate ambitions over the collective interest of the people they claim to represent.\n\nHe said: \u201cLook at a region\u2019s gang up ( referring to the North), then you, your own region cannot gang up. You became tools to be used against the interest of your people, and you think you have won, you have lost.\n\n\u201cYou will continue to be perpetual slaves. Rivers people you don\u2019t need to bother yourselves. PDP needs us. If they say they don\u2019t need us, they should wait.\u201d\n\nThe governor explained that he was propelled into the race to offer service and advance the interest of Nigeria.\n\nHe said he was confronted by a few individuals, who wanted somebody they would control and he declined to be such puppet.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe winner(of the ticket) also saw it. They underrated us, but now, they will not underrate us again. We have all it takes to do whatever we want to do.

I said I was not going to sit down with them and negotiate.\u201d\n\nWike said he had told the winner of the PDP presidential primary, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, that most of the people hanging around him lacked electoral value.\n\nThe governor said it was wrong for the party to have allowed the governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, to speak for a second time after the time allotted to each of the aspirants to address the delegates.\n\nIn his remarks, the Speaker, Rivers State House of Assembly, Ikuinyi-Owaji Ibani, described the governor as an emancipator, who had solved a particularly nagging problem in Nigeria, the minority question.\n\nChairman, PDP Rivers State, Ambassador Desmond Akawor, commended Wike for his resilience saying that the entire State and the Niger Delta are happy that he spoke for them.\n\nChairman of Ikwerre Local Government, Samuel Nwanosike, said Wike had demonstrated that Rivers State and the Niger Delta could not be underrated in the political equation of Nigeria.",

You would require a COVID test before you can come in and you would still need to require a day one and day two test. It is only those who are fully vaccinated that do not need to do the test, you just fill in your record locator and travel permit, that is all.\n\n\u201cFor those travelling outside, when you are leaving Nigeria, it is the COVID protocol of the country you are going to that you would abide by. We are hoping that the Federal Government does something about the COVID protocol.

          "text": "\n\n* Atiku begins search for running mate, considers south-south, south-east govs\n\n* Pays Tambuwal \u2018thank you\u2019 visit as Anyim, Ihedioha, others congratulate him\n\n* Southern, Middlebelt leaders say his election an affront on south\n\n* Peterside castigates Wike for wasting Rivers money\n\n\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Udora Orizu in Abuja, Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nNational Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, yesterday told the Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, that he was the hero of the party\u2019s presidential convention, which elected former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar as the PDP presidential candidate for the 2023 general election, weekend.\n\n\n\nThis is as Atiku has allegedly begun consultations in search for a running mate, with the South-south largely in focus, even as he (Atiku) too had earlier paid Tambuwal a \u2018thank you\u2019 visit, for stepping down for him at the convention, a development believed to have aided his victory.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, a former President of the Senate, Anyim Pius Anyim and former Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Emeka Ihedioha, yesterday, joined several other Nigerians to congratulate Atiku on his victory at the convention.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF), has described the emergence of Atiku as the PDP presidential candidate as a brazing affront on the people of Southern Nigeria by the opposition party.\n\n\n\nIn a similar breath, a former Director General, Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr. Dakuku Peterside, has expressed sadness that despite allegedly spending about N30bn of Rivers\u2019 funds, the PDP delegates still rejected the Governor Nyesom Wike of the state.\n\n\n\nAyu, in company of a former Jigawa State governor, Sule Lamido and Ihedioha, among others, had visited Tambuwal to personally thank him for his role in the outcome of the convention.\n\n\n\nTambuwal had announced stepping down at the presidential primary and said he did so for Atiku, a development that saw the former vice-president poll 371 votes to defeat his closest rival, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State with 237 votes.\n\n\n\nBut the decision by Tambuwal to step down for Atiku was allegedly masterminded by top northern politicians as the master stroke that ensured victory for Atiku.\n\n\n\nThus, on his visit to Tambuwal, Ayu who first embraced the Sokoto governor warmly and later shook hands with him, first referred to him as \u201cmy chairman\u201d, but Tambuwal jocularly retorted, smiling: \u201cI\u2019m a small chairman, sir.\u2019\n\nAyu then shook hands with him again and said, \u201cYou are the hero of the convention\u201d, a remark to which Tambuwal replied: \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn his visit to Tambuwal, Atiku, who was accompanied by one of his associates, Senator Dino Melaye, and others, had close discussions, especially, on how to move the Atiku campaigns forward.\n\n\n\nAlso, on the search for a running mate, one of those that followed Atiku on the visit said, the meeting talked about the possibility of early search for a running mate, as the party must ensure it meets the June 17 deadline for all political parties to submit the names of their standard bearers.\n\n\n\nBut this time around, the search for a running mate, THISDAY gathered, would be less controversial as the process would be inclusive as against the case, when Atiku was accused of unilaterally picking Peter Obi as his running mate without enough consultations with other stakeholders.\n\n\n\nThe source said one of the problems of Atiku\u2019s campaigns in 2019 was the accusations from the chairman of Southeast governors forum, Dave Umahi, that Obi was appointed a running mate without much input from the PDP governors.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis time around, everybody will be carried along and an acceptable running mate will be appointed,\u201d the source said.\n\n\n\nOn where the running mate could come from, the source said, it was likely to come from one of the PDP governors from the south, pointing to a South-south in particular.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cThe Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, is top on the list, because other governors from the south are already engaged and aligned\n\n\n\n\u201cThe governor of Abia State, Okezie Ikpeazu, is already a senatorial candidate in Abia State. The Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, won his senatorial ticket to represent Enugu West and so, it is only the Delta State governor that yielded the Delta North senatorial seat to Ned Nwoko.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, by and large, Okowa is among the top contenders, because by 2023, he would be completing his office as a governor for 8 years. Another likely person to be considered could have been Peter Obi, but he has resigned from the PDP and now in the Labour Party. He is out of contention,\u201d the PDP source explained.\n\nHowever, in his message of congratulations to Atiku, Anyim in a statement also commended the 2022 PDP Special Convention Committee for successfully conducting the primary election.\n\n\n\nThe former President of the Senate said he was proud to have fully participated in the race to the end and praised his supporters for being with him to the end.\n\n\n\nHe, however, lamented that voting preferences at the election still reflected old pattern of primordial sentiments, wondering if the national desire to find solutions to her problems would be realised by such actions.\n\nIn the statement personally signed, Anyim said, \u201cI must sincerely commend the PDP 2022 Special Convention Committee for doing a great job. I\u2019m proud to have gone through the race to the end.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, I am shocked that consideration for voting the PDP presidential candidate was not based on burning national issues and how to resolve them, but still on the old primordial sentiments.\n\n\u201cIt appears doubtful if our search for nationhood is yielding any results. I deeply appreciate and thank all those who stood by me throughout this race, especially, those that voted for me at the primary election.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to assure all of you that we shall continue to stand tall until we birth the Nigeria of our collective dreams. Let me also congratulate His Excellency, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar for emerging the PDP flag bearer for the 2023 presidential election,\u201d Anyim said.\n\n\n\nIhedioha, on his part, said. \u201cI urge the former vice president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to swiftly move to reconcile the various interest groups within the party PDP and also call on the party faithful across the country to give their support to His Excellency Atiku Abubakar, former vice-president of Nigeria in line with the desires of Nigerians to actualise the dream for a revamped PDP. I urge him to be magnanimous in victory and unify on all fronts.\u201d\n\n\u2018Atiku\u2019s Candidacy, Brazing Affront on Southern Nigerians\u2019\n\nThe Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF), has described the emergence of former vice-president, Atiku as a brazing affront on the people of Southern Nigeria by the opposition party.\n\nFollowing the release of the guidelines for the 2023 general election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), elders and leaders of Southern Nigeria and the Middle Belt, had made unequivocal proclamations on the need for the presidency to be devolved to Southern Nigeria in 2023, in respect of the time-honoured practice of the rotation and zoning of high political offices between the North and the South by political parties as a way of strengthening national unity, peace and harmony.\n\n\n\nSMBLF further recalled that several engagements were held with various stakeholders across the length and breadth of the country on the subject to foster understanding, mutual respect and oneness.\n\nThe 17 Southern governors, also in a declaration after their meeting in Asaba, Delta State, in May 2021, backed the rotation of the presidency to the South in 2023.\n\n\n\nThus, the Forum in a statement yesterday and jointly signed by Senator Bassey Ewa-Henshaw (PANDEF/South South); Ambassador Okey Emuchay (Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide/South East); Comrade Jare Ajayi, (Afenifere/South West); Dr. Isuwa Dogo (Middle Belt Forum) and Hon. Ken Robinson, (Acting Coordinator SMBLF), expressed regret that it appeared the unity and peace of Nigeria meant little or nothing to a segment of the nation\u2019s political elite.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis was evidenced in the PDP special convention, which was held on Saturday, 28th May 2022, where certain candidates from the North were pressured, coerced, and even intimidated to step down for former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, who eventually emerged as the flag bearer of PDP, in utter derision of the established principle of zoning and rotation of power between the north and south.\n\n\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the singular motive is to perpetuate the hegemony of the North given that President Muhammadu Buhari, a Muslim from the North and of Fulani origin will be completing his full tenure of eight years by this time next year.\n\n\n\n\u201cSMBLF, therefore, totally REJECTS the candidacy of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar of the PDP and calls on our people of Southern Nigeria and the Middle Belt as well as all true lovers of peace and unity NOT TO VOTE for him or any other Northerner in the 2023 presidential election, in the interest of posterity.\u201d\n\nPeterside: Wike Wasted Rivers\u2019 N30billon on presidential primary\n\nA former Director General, Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr. Dakuku Peterside, has expressed sadness that despite allegedly spending about N30bn of Rivers\u2019 funds, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) delegates still rejected the Governor Nyesom Wike of the state.\n\n\n\nPeterside, who also congratulated Atiku in a statement, stressed that the outcome of the PDP presidential primary was a proof that, \u201cWike has shown lack of requisite experience and depth to compete in national politics.\u201d\n\nHe advised Wike to \u201cquickly return home, shade off his toga of pride, and submit himself to Atiku to be tutored on the dynamics of national politics and the angles to hi-wire deals\u201d.\n\n\n\nPeterside lamented that giving away about alleged N10bn of public funds in unsolicited charity to states, and about N20bn pursuing his ill-fated presidential bid, confirmed his earlier stance that Wike\u2019s governorship was among Rivers State\u2019s worst era since 1967.\n\n\u201cThat Wike could dip his hands that deep into Rivers\u2019 treasury to pursue his vaunting ambition is a confirmation of my earlier assertion that Wike\u2019s governorship represents our all-time low moments since the state was created on May 27, 1967.\n\n\n\n\u201cI wonder how Wike sleeps at night with Rivers\u2019 pensioners going to bed hungry, and sizeable number not waking up again out of frustration. For his personal ego and ambition, he preferred to lavish billions of naira on delegates than attend to those senior citizens.\n\n\n\n\u201cRivers State is so blessed yet our people are leaving in untold hardship and experiencing underdevelopment, because of Wike\u2019s visionless administration of state resources.\u2019 Peterside added.\n\nNwobodo: Atiku Capable of Restoring Unity, Security, Economy\n\nElder statesman and former governor of old Anambra State in the Second Republic, Jim Nwobodo, has said the presidential candidate of the PDP for the 2023 elections, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has the ability and tenacity to restore the unity, security and economy of Nigeria if elected president.\n\nIn a congratulatory message to Atiku, Ayu and the stakeholders in the party on the successful conduct of the election and the emergence of Atiku, Nwobodo said the PDP victory was for all Nigerians.\n\n\n\nEncouraging the candidate to follow through with his acceptance speech, Nwobodo, who also served as Senator between 1999 and 2003, enjoined Atiku to reunite all aggrieved members of the PDP, who left the party into their fold just as he asked other contestants of the presidential ticket to rally round him for victory at the polls.\n\n\u201cI congratulate Alhaji Atiku Abubarkar, Waziri Adamawa, on his resounding victory as the flag bearer of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP at yesterday\u2019s primaries. Congratulations to our national chairman, Dr. Iyorcha Ayu, for his leadership in achieving a successful, transparent and peaceful primaries election.\n\n\n\n\u201cI also congratulate the Convention Committee Chairman, Senator David Mark and my Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi and his deputy. I congratulate all the other aspirants, who contested with Atiku for their spirit of sportmanship and appeal to them to rally round the flag bearer, as this success is success for all of them.\n\n\n\n\u201cAtiku\u2019s victory is victory for PDP and victory for Nigeria in general. Atiku has the ability, the temperament and the tenacity to restore the unity, security and economy of Nigeria without which a country does not exist. I encourage him to follow through with his acceptance speech, to reach out to all the aggrieved members of our party who left the party and bring them back to the PDP family\u201d.\n\nElumelu: Atiku\u2019s Popularity Beginning of PDP\u2019s Historic Journey\n\nThe Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, has congratulated former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, on his election as the presidential candidate of the PDP for the 2023 general election.\n\nElumelu, in a statement, commended all the other presidential aspirants at the presidential convention for their courage, patriotism and remarkable spirit of sportsmanship, which they displayed throughout the consultation period up to the convention.\n\n\n\nHe opined that Atiku\u2019s emergence, with his excellent performance record and unmatched popularity across the nation, signaled the beginning of PDP\u2019s historic journey back to power in 2023 to commence the process of rescuing, reuniting, redirecting and rebuilding the nation from the ashes of the misrule of the APC led government.\n\n\u201cThere is no gainsaying the fact that all our presidential aspirants are eminently qualified and that their aspirations were driven by patriotism in line with the mission of the PDP to rescue our nation from the catastrophic misrule of the vicious, corrupt and incompetent All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, the delegates have spoken and resoundingly so in electing His Excellency, Atiku Abubakar as the Presidential standard bearer to lead our Party and indeed Nigerians to victory in the 2023 Presidential election.\u201d\n\nAlso, Elumelu, on behalf of the people of Aniocha/Oshimili Federal Constituency and Deltans in general, congratulated Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State on the occasion of his 7th anniversary in office.\n\nElumelu, said within these seven years, God has used Okowa to bring about all-round transformation in all sectors of the economy of the state, through his intensive implementation of his unique and well-thought-out Smart Agenda and Stronger Delta mantra.\n\nImansuangbon: Atiku\u2019s Candidacy Red Flag to APC, Buhari\n\nA chieftain of the PDP and former governorship aspirant in Edo State, Mr Kenneth Imansuagbon, has described Atiku\u2019s candidacy as a red flat to President Muhammadu Buhari and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), adding that now that the primaries were over, the PDP must come together as a strong and united party to send the rudderless APC government packing come 2023.\n\n\n\nHe also said the emergence of the former vice-president, as the PDP standard bearer signposted the reaffirmation of his nationwide acceptability to rescue Nigeria\n\nImansuangbon, who stated this in his congratulatory statement, made available to newsmen in Benin City, Edo State, appealed to Nigerians to cue behind Atiku to change the negative narrative of underdevelopment and economic woes.\n\n\n\n\u201cI heartily congratulate former Vice president Atiku Abubakar and all our PDP delegates for voting massively for the candidacy of Atiku as our flag bearer. As a party we have demonstrated that PDP is the only true Democratic Party that is desirous to correct all the maladies currently faced by Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe PDP has once again shown by the conduct of its presidential primary in Abuja on Saturday that it is the answer to the setback that Nigerians have encountered with the coming into power of the All Progressives Congress (APC) since 2015.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe cannot wait to see Alhaji Atiku Abubakar assume office as the country\u2019s next president whereby he will bring in his chains of people oriented programmes that are fashioned towards getting us out of the hordes of crisis we face daily.\u201d\n\nObaseki Congratulates Atiku, Says PDP a Transparent Party\n\nEdo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has congratulated Nigeria\u2019s former Vice-President, Atiku Abubakar, on his victory at the PDP presidential primary election, saying the party has proven to be transparent.\n\n\n\nIn his message, the governor hailed other aspirants, who submitted themselves to transparent democratic exercise that has set the PDP as a worthy example to all other political parties in the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cI heartily congratulate His Excellency, Atiku Abubakar (GCON) on his victory at the Peoples Democratic Party Presidential primary election.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe keenly contested process of picking a flagbearer for our great party has again shown the PDP as a party that has enthroned a transparent internal democratic process, which is what our nation now desperately needs for its much-desired rebirth.\n\n\n\n\u201cI also hail all the other aspirants, who have submitted themselves to this transparent democratic exercise that has set the PDP as a worthy example to all other political parties in the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe beauty of it all is that the party has put in clear display it\u2019s maturity, strength and poise and this is now the time for all aspirants and other stakeholders in the party to pull together as we embark on this all-important mission to rescue Nigeria.

          "text": "\n\n*Abdulsalam\u2019s ex-deputy vows to obtain new court orders today\n\n*NLC still in court against Abure, says Falana\n\nSunday Aborisade, Abuja\n\nPlans by former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, to contest next year\u2019s presidential election on the platform of Labour Party (LP) appeared shaky yesterday, as a faction of the party threatened to renew its legal battle this week.\n\n\n\nFormer Deputy National Chairman of the LP, Calistus Okafor, gave the hint in an interview with THISDAY in Abuja.\n\nSimilarly, yesterday, lawyer to Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and Trade Union Congress (TUC), Mr. Femi Falana, confirmed that the case, which the unions instituted against the late Abdulkadir Abdulsalam leadership of the party, now under the Julius Abure faction, was still pending in court.\n\n\n\nOkafor, who leads a faction of LP, wondered why Obi failed to carry out due diligence before he, allegedly, identified with a faction of the party, which the factional national chairman described as the wrong faction.\n\nObi left the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) last week and announced his readiness to pursue his presidential aspiration in the LP faction led by Abure.\n\n\n\nHowever, Okafor told THISDAY that Obi decided to defect to LP without proper information on the fact that the party\u2019s leadership had been a subject of litigation since 2018.\n\n\n\nOkafor claimed that he remained the authentic national chairman of the party. He explained that he got the post by virtue of his position as Deputy National Chairman of the party when the late national chairman, Abdulsalam, was in office. He added that Abure, who is currently leading a faction of the party, was Acting National Secretary, when Abdulsalam, died in 2020.\n\n\n\nOkafor further claimed that Abure announced himself as National Chairman without recourse to the provisions of the party\u2019s constitution, following Abdulsalam\u2019s demise. He said the LP constitution stipulated that the deputy national chairman should act and/or replace the chairman in the event of death or resignation.\n\n\n\nOkafor explained, \u201cThe decision of Abure to make himself chairman, with the active collaboration of some members, actually led to the current leadership crisis in the LP.\n\n\u201cI, Calistus Okafor, approached the court to get a pronouncement to force Abure out and the case has been pending.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe matter will come up tomorrow (today) at the Federal High Court. There is no way we would allow an Acting National Secretary to forcefully take over the party and replace the late national chairman against the provisions of the constitution of the party.\n\n\n\n\u201cI also want to confirm to you that apart from the suit I instituted against Abure and his team, the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) are also in court, to claim ownership of the party.\u201d\n\n\n\nOkafor urged Obi to thread softly, stressing that he LP, under which he intends to realise his aspiration at the moment, is in a deep crisis that may not be resolved before the 2023 presidential election.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe NLC and the TUC actually registered the Labour Party in 2006, but they were not the ones administering it.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeter Obi, at the moment, has been deceived and he is sitting on a keg of gunpowder and it is a pity. He went to wolves in sheep clothing thinking he was discussing with the right people. Staying in the PDP would have been better for him.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe LP has not done any convention since 2014, after the last one it did in Akure, the Ondo State capital.\n\n\u201cIn 2017, after the removal of Abdulsalam as the national chairman, Julius Abure, being the acting national secretary then and myself as the deputy national chairman (South), wrote the Independent National Electoral Commission, to organise a convention for the purpose of electing a new leadership.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlong the line, Abdulsalam went to the leadership of NLC and TUC, as the people who registered the party, to join him in forcing us out.\n\n\n\n\u201cNLC, being smarter than him, demanded a written agreement that he had agreed that the LP actually belonged to the NLC and TUC. He accepted the offer and signed the agreement.\u201d\n\n\n\nOkafor further said, \u201cThe NLC then approached the court to authenticate the agreement. The court ruled that the organised labour could not run the party but should work with us being the administrators to organise an all-inclusive convention.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe inability of the party to organise an inclusive convention made it impossible for former Governor Olusegun Mimiko to contest the 2019 presidential election on the platform of the Labour Party.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was then that Abure dumped our cause and joined Abdulsalam to organise a National Executive Council congress in Akwanga, Nasarawa State, without carrying other stakeholders along.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey then notified the INEC that they had elected some people and removed others from the leadership, when they lacked such powers based on the court ruling.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe crisis lingered until Abdulsalam died and Abure promoted himself to the office of the national chairman, from his position of the acting national secretary.\n\n\n\n\u201cAbure is not qualified to hold the position because in hierarchy, we still have two Deputy National Chairmen and six Vice National Chairmen.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs we speak, I am in court and by Monday (today), I will get an order which I will post on the walls of the LP secretariat and gates.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeter Obi should know that there is no way for him in the LP and that even if I, Callistus Okafor, did not go to court and he wins, the structure that produced him would be challenged.\n\n\n\n\u201cI expected him to investigate properly before joining LP instead of allowing himself to be messed up by hungry wolves.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeveral attempts to get the reactions of the NLC leadership and Abure through phone calls and text messages were not successful at the time of writing this report.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Falana confirmed that the case, which the labour unions instituted against the Abdulsalam leadership, now under Abure, was still pending in Court.\n\n\n\nFalana said, \u201cThe case is still pending in court. The case we have in court is against the Abdulsalam\u2019s leadership.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat of Okafor could be their own internal affair. We are the people that went to court against Abdulsalam and while the case was pending, they went to do convention in Benin.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the court had ruled that parties must have a unity convention and we were not part of it.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, says some southerners worked against the zone getting the presidential ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nHe spoke on Monday, when he addressed PDP supporters in Rivers state.\n\nWike, who contested the presidential primary on Saturday, came second with 237 votes against former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar\u2019s 371 votes.\n\nIn his address on Monday, Wike made references to betrayal, conspiracy, and people who cannot keep to agreement, but he didn\u2019t mention any name in particular.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, there is nothing to worry about. I contested election based on principle and agreement with all the southern governors and the leaders of the south that the presidency should go to the south this period,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have done our own part and we never betrayed anybody, because it is not in our blood to betray. But it\u2019s a shame to those people. Some of the governors from the south are the people they used to sabotage our interest. However, we have shown them that we are not like them. We have the capacity to do whatever is good for us.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about some other people who cannot even win election in their own places. I\u2019ve told them that this election, whoever emerges, I will support, and I am not going to go back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes, it may be painful to you, it may be painful to us, but we cannot abandon the party. And let me also say to those who do not understand, and who take Rivers state for a ride, now they have learnt their lesson. You need us. Forget about these people who have nothing to offer and who make noise up and down.\n\n\u201cI saw one governor who was dancing. Meanwhile, he did not win one delegate. I told Atiku Abubakar this afternoon when he came to see me that \u2018some of the people following you here, they don\u2019t have votes; they re empty.\u2019 I have votes. I have something to offer. Do they have anything to offer?\n\n\u201cIn 2019, I was the only governor from the south-south who never negotiated with the present government. They came and I said \u2018no, I\u2019m not going to be party to that.\u2019 And that\u2019s why APC never had 25 percent in his state. I said I was not going to sit down with them to negotiate.\n\n\u201cWhen you see people, they can\u2019t confront me. They can\u2019t face me. It\u2019s merely envy. If somebody is bigger than you, somebody is bigger than you. I told them \u2018look, it\u2019s not to go back. If they give you vice-president, you need my support. So, you will come to me.\u2019 PDP knows. Three states determine elections in Nigeria \u2014 Lagos, Kano and Rivers. Anybody who tries to say that Rivers state is nowhere, it\u2019s at your own peril. If you want to bury yourself, let it be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, for me, we have done what we are supposed to do. Leave history for those betrayers of their people. History will judge them. They will live and see how betrayers suffer. We have done our best and and the whole world has seen that we have done our best.\u201d\n\nHe also made a reference to a governor who \u201csold out his people\u201d, adding that such people have no right to complain about the south being referred to as the minority.\n\n\u201cShame to those who will sell out their own thing. I\u2019ve never seen a thing like this in my life. A governor? And tomorrow, you\u2019ll say \u2018oh, the south is a minority.\u2019 You are the one making yourself to be the minority. Shame! You\u2019re holding something in trust for your people, and you claim that this is what your people want. Then, you sell out,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo wonder we cannot move on development. Look at a region \u2014 they ganged up, then your own region cannot gang up? You became tools to be used against the interest of your people. And you think you have won? You have lost. You will continue to be perpetual slaves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRivers people, you don\u2019t need to worry yourselves. God\u2019s time is the best. So, we should take it easy, support the party, and work for our party to win in the state and for our party to win at the federal level.\u201d",

Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Stax is making progress with solving USSD's user experience problem",
          "text": "Despite the growing ubiquity of sleek, internet-powered apps to carry out digital transactions, the fact remains that 9 out of 10 mobile transactions in sub-Saharan Africa flow through Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD). TechCabal has written about this persistent protocol before, highlighting its continued reliability not only for those who own feature phones but for smartphone users as well.\n\nLast year, we covered the launch of Stax, an offline mobile app that seeks to give a desperately-needed makeover to USSD\u2019s drab interface and offer users an aesthetically pleasing and seamless experience.\n\nAs Stax, owned by US-based developer Hover, celebrates its first anniversary, TechCabal caught up with its CEO and co-founder, Ben Lyon, to discuss the startup\u2019s commitment to providing offline mobile banking services, its growth aspirations, and upcoming features on its app.\n\nUSSD is here for the long haul\n\nBack in the early 2000s, when many Africans were still getting used to their newly acquired mobile phones, they relied heavily on USSD to check and top up their airtime. It quickly became an important channel for mobile banking, and eventually, users started to use USSD to purchase internet data, send money, and pay their bills. The fact that USSD is accessible on multiple types of phones and functions offline has helped it retain popularity 2 decades on.\n\nOne might assume\u2014understandably so\u2014that USSD exists under constant threat of the internet. It doesn\u2019t help that the design of USSD, despite its proven efficiency, make for a poor user experience, which could compel a user to migrate to more intuitive mobile apps.\n\nStax claimed to possess a deep understanding of USSD\u2019s continued importance in African markets and users\u2019 needs for a smooth and simple mobile banking experience. This understanding was the impetus for the company to build what they hoped would become a universal money app for Africa, where users can link all of their bank accounts and mobile wallets\u2014and, soon, their crypto wallets, too.\n\nThe app\u2019s technology automates the standard USSD menu, meaning, instead of dialling a bank\u2019s USSD code, Stax users simply need to tap a button on the app, while utilising the efficient USSD backend. Lyon said that Stax is looking at possibly creating its own USSD codes through Africa\u2019s Talking, a telecommunication solution provider, and using those codes to access more information services, even when they\u2019re offline.\n\nHover co-founder and CEO, Ben Lyon, told TechCabal over a call that while Stax is currently only available in 9 African countries, it is still pursuing continent-wide opportunities to expand, and as such, it is imperative that it targets USSD, the centre of digital commerce, and tap into users\u2019 strong preference to turn off their mobile data.\n\nHe explained that the types of phones most Africans own\u2014half of which are feature phones\u2014is further reason to focus on smoothening USSD transactions.\n\nTo Lyon, this reality, much like USSD itself, will not change any time soon. Not even increased fintech industry funding and improving mobile connectivity and internet penetration will threaten the need for a USSD-powered solution like Stax.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to see, over the next few years, more data consumption,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we\u2019re actually going to see more data metering, and so I think the size of the offline market is actually growing.\u201d\n\nTo prove his point, Lyon referenced a Caribou Data study that found that 94% of financial digital transactions in Africa are made using USSD, leaving 6% of those transactions to come from elsewhere, like internet-based financial products. That, Lyon said, is what distinguishes Stax from the fintechs pursuing a much smaller opportunity in the 6% internet-facilitated transactions.\n\nOther studies on the rising cost of data in Africa further substantiate the argument on which Stax builds its vision. In a Worldwide Mobile Data Pricing 2021 report from Cable.co.uk, sub-Saharan Africa ranked as the most expensive region, with the average price for 1GB of mobile data coming in at $6.44, followed by Oceania at $5.51 and South America at $5.25.\n\nSince coming out of beta last May, more than 200,000 people have used Stax\u2019s mobile app, and it has seen as many as 40,000 monthly active users. It is focusing on retention and hoping to turn on a growth engine that will see it acquire 45,000-plus new users or more per month.\n\nAfter it secures a Series A funding round, Stax intends to expand its service to tens of markets across Africa.\n\nSolving the fragmentation problem\n\nLyon explained that fragmentation, both of Android phones and USSD codes, was one of the biggest challenges Stax faced in building its product. Stax has to ensure that its USSD technology is compatible with its users\u2019 Android phones. Stax has to ensure that its USSD technology is compatible with its users\u2019 Android phones, but that leads to a lot of work on their end. This has required his team to constantly test their technology on hundreds of makes, models, and versions of Android devices, including Tecno, Infinix, Huawei, and Samsung\u2014all of which are common phone brands in African markets. But this, Lyon believes, made Stax a defensible business.\n\nIn proprietary data, Stax claimed to have purchased from Caribou Data; as of September 2020, 8% of Android users in Nigeria were still on Android version 4. \u201cIf you want to make sure that your product works for those users, you have to do all of this reverse compatibility, so you\u2019re not just building on the latest Android versions, because that won\u2019t work for 90% of the market,\u201d he said.\n\nStax navigated a similar obstacle with USSD. Lyon called it a \u201cfractal problem\u201d, where there are no standards in the use of USSD for digital money across Africa. This forces Stax to do a lot of testing on their own and it tends to be arduous. \u201cYou don\u2019t have standard error codes, standard responses; and services change from one user to another.\u201d\n\nOne solution Stax has built is a USSD directory that gives users a comprehensive view of the global USSD landscape. The directory also has a built-in searchable index of USSD services globally to reduce the friction between USSD and users across Africa.\n\nStax\u2019s aim to prioritise user experience and eliminate or reduce data use to drive growth is not new on the continent. Senegalese unicorn, Wave, got a huge slice of the market already dominated by a telco Orange and a fintech Wari, by delivering an excellent customer experience while consuming very little data and maintaining low prices. In fact, Wave is available to users that cannot afford 3G or 4G subscriptions; and users without smartphones can access the app via QR cards.\n\nStax for Africa\n\nWhile Stax\u2019s offline feature has a continental reach, it currently only operates in 11 countries: Ghana, Zambia, South Africa, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Uganda, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Kenya, and Malawi. The company also caters its marketing to each country based on their unique needs, presenting itself as an app that can coexist with popular banking and mobile money practices in each place. In Kenya, for example, Stax promises users that it can help them better manage their M-PESA accounts, easing the process of moving money from M-PESA to their bank accounts by aggregating them all in one place. In Nigeria, where it\u2019s commonplace for one user to have as many as 5 bank accounts, Stax plays up its feature that allows them to organise all their bank accounts in one app.\n\nLyon is under no illusions about the possibility that, eventually, more fintechs will transition into USSD to capture USSD users on the continent, raising the level of competition with Stax. In fact, it is already happening, he said. African fintechs like Barter by Flutterwave, Opay, and Abeg have all built USSD modes into their apps.\n\nHe maintains, however, that Stax is still better positioned to seize the opportunities in the market due to the years\u2014since it launched in 2017\u2014that the company spent building a core USSD infrastructure. Hover agreed with this, which was why Lyon decided in 2020 to pivot the parent company\u2019s attention exclusively to Stax.\n\nAs an entrepreneur, Lyon welcomes competition and inspiration from other companies. He cited True Balance, an Indian payment app that was initially built for users to manage their phone recharge, bill payments, and balances without remembering complicated USSD codes. The app has since expanded its services to help users pay their mobile and electricity bills, added an e-commerce arm as well as credit services, and in the process amassed 60 million users. Stax, Lyon said, has been eyeing the success of True Balance and taking notes.\n\nWhat are the next steps for Stax? The company hopes to become an offline payment super app by embedding third-party services onto its app. It hasn\u2019t started building the infrastructure for that just yet, but its offline payment play is taking off. Stax currently supports more than 100 bank and mobile money services across 9 markets. In Kenya, it works with 30 different banks, M-PESA, and Airtel Money. In Nigeria, it supports all of the major banks and several of the microfinance institutions (MFIs)\n\nAlthough Stax does not support any cross-border payments, pivoting to crypto will allow it to support international transactions. It plans to launch a self-custody USDC wallet, which will allow users to transfer money to anyone with a public address.\n\nShare this article",

And we\u2019re beginning with Peace Itimi. Peace needs no introduction to players in the digital marketing space. She has built a reputation for herself through her work with several local and international brands, her training programs, and more famously, her YouTube show Founders Connect. She talks about how her career started as an undergraduate, juggling multiple projects, and how she stays productive.\n\nCurrent role : Head of Growth for Stax, an offline payment super-app for Africans\n\n: Head of Growth for Stax, an offline payment super-app for Africans Location : London, UK\n\n: London, UK Current computer : 14\u2011inch MacBook Pro \u2013 Space Grey \u2013 M1 Pro\n\n: 14\u2011inch MacBook Pro \u2013 Space Grey \u2013 M1 Pro Current mobile device : iPhone 12 Pro\n\n: iPhone 12 Pro Camera : Sony Alpha 6400 | APS-C Mirrorless Camera\n\n: Sony Alpha 6400 | APS-C Mirrorless Camera Describe how you work in one word: Efficiently\n\nTell us briefly how you started out and how you got where you are today\n\nBack in school, I was a Google Student Ambassador (GSA). We would attend workshops on Google Business Groups and go back to school to teach people about Google products. So I focused everything I was doing on Google Ads \u2013 Google Adwords at that time. We also applied for some challenge programs like Google Online Marketing Challenge. That\u2019s kind of just really how I got into digital marketing; from being a GSA.\n\nBy the time I was graduating, a lot of people in school knew me as this \u2018Google girl\u2019 \u2013 this digital marketing person. So, I started getting some gigs running ads for businesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t remember how I learnt about Fiverr and Upwork, but at some point, I saw it and I got into it. I started freelancing there, handling social media accounts for people, writing blog articles, and I got an associate job with a company in the US as well.\n\nSo when I graduated in 2015, while I was waiting for service, I went fully into freelancing. I was also working at GTECH Designs as a marketing associate, just really handling social media, running some ads here and there.\n\nWhen it was time for service, because I studied Biochemistry, I didn\u2019t want to get thrown somewhere in the North or in a school to go and teach Biology, or like a medical lab. So, I made a few calls, and I got an internship with Webcoupers, so I could then do my NYSC there and that officially launched my career.\n\nI remember that it was easy for me to pass the interview. I even started working for them remotely when I was still in Benin City at that time. That was about four months before I got deployed for NYSC but they were so impressed with me, and the whole reason why they were impressed was because it was like, for somebody who just graduated, I already had a portfolio, I had a track record, I had run ads. I showed them my Fiverr and Upwork. I had taken lots of online courses \u2013 every Google online course, every Hubspot free course, if it was a free course and it had to do something on digital marketing, I would take it. They were just so impressed that even though they had never worked with anybody remotely, they were willing to try it out with me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does your work entail? Walk us through a typical workday.\n\nI don\u2019t have a typical work day. First, I work remotely and I juggle a bunch of things. I\u2019m the head of growth for Stax. I joined as the first growth hire and I\u2019m just building a growth team and leading go-to-market strategy, user acquisition and retention, anything that has to do with growth, that\u2019s my headache and my job all day.\n\nIt\u2019s a very dynamic role. I do data analytics, a lot of marketing, and I also intersect a lot of products, so I regularly speak with the product team, do Quality Assurance, and sometimes keep track of the roadmap.\n\nI\u2019m always checking out data, I do monthly presentations on what our current analytics is, and then just doing all the marketing with my team, as well. Then on the side, I have a newsletter that I write every now and again, and a YouTube channel to keep track of.\n\nSo, my life itself is very dynamic, but mostly the key element is that my work is very flexible, so there\u2019s no start time and end time. It\u2019s not a fixed nine to five.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m a late sleeper and late riser. I typically will sleep late like around 2 am and will most likely wake up around 7 am, but I don\u2019t get out of my bed until 9 or 10 am, except I have an early morning meeting, which is not often. So, most times, I\u2019ll end up having breakfast and then basically just open my laptop. That\u2019s literally how my day starts.\n\nThe whole day is just me shuffling between different Chrome windows of different things. It\u2019s mostly calls, emails, but sometimes I\u2019m brainstorming, researching, or reading, and other times I\u2019m writing stuff. I usually shoot videos either at the end of my day, if I wanted to, or most times on weekends.\n\nWhat apps, gadgets or tools can you not do without?\n\nMy laptop and my mobile phone are the number one gadgets. Then my iPad and my camera.\n\nSometimes what I do while I\u2019m on my bed in the morning is to go through Slack, emails, and social media. I don\u2019t like using my laptop for those, so I have my Slack and my emails open on my phone. I have an iPad which I use mostly when I\u2019m in the mood to scribble. When I\u2019m brainstorming or thinking, I\u2019m not able to brainstorm and type on my phone because it feels small and my laptop feels too big, but the iPad is in the middle, and I like to scribble a lot.\n\nThe next gadget would be my Camera but that\u2019s not an everyday thing, though it\u2019s a very important part of my life because I\u2019m a content creator.\n\nTalking about apps: Gmail, Slack, YouTube Studio, LinkedIn, Google Ads, Meta Ads Manager, Amplitude, AppsFlyer, Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, and Google Tasks (TasksBoard on web).\n\nWhat would you say is your favourite shortcut or hack for getting things done?\n\nI think it\u2019s a to-do list. It sounds cliche but it\u2019s my productivity hack. Using Google Tasks to put down what I want to achieve each week just helps me stay focused. Any week I don\u2019t have a to-do list set, I\u2019m not very productive because it\u2019s easier for me to get distracted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s a task that you dislike but still have to do?\n\nI dislike anything that is manual and requires me to do them one after the other. Things that cannot be automated or done at scale are quite annoying. And I have a couple of those tasks but they\u2019re very work specific so I may not be able to share examples. Anything like that is something that I typically put off until I absolutely have to do it.\n\nHow do you recharge or take a break from work?\n\nMovies, music, parties, hanging out with friends, just having dinner (I eat a lot these days), and swimming. When I swim, it\u2019s a whole routine though, and it just really helps me decompress. When it comes to hanging out with friends, there\u2019s a bunch of things that we do, so it can be just having a game night, brunch, dinner, going for a party or just staying in somebody\u2019s house to chill. But generally, just hanging out with friends always really helps.\n\nI like to sleep as well. I don\u2019t sleep a lot \u2013 except you count my \u2018sleep late and wake up early\u2019 routine. I also don\u2019t always take naps during the day, so what I do is to make up for sleep over the weekend. I don\u2019t stand up on Saturdays before 1 pm, except I have a call.\n\nI also try not to shoot every weekend. I bulk-create my contents so I can use the other weekends to sleep, hang out, edit the videos, and so on. Also, I\u2019m lucky to have gotten to this point because there was a time when I had to do everything by myself, when I first started. But in the last one year, I\u2019ve built a better support system.\n\nAwesome! So what are you currently watching, reading and listening to?\n\nI\u2019m watching The Royals, a show on Netflix that talks about the British royal family. It\u2019s fiction but is centred around the british royal family.\n\nFor music, you\u2019d either catch me listening to Asa\u2019s album or Kizz Daniel\u2019s album. Those are the two consistent things I\u2019ve listened to in the last one month. They\u2019re also the two people whose concerts I\u2019ve gone to in the last one month.\n\nThere\u2019s Bren\u00e9 Brown, who I\u2019m really a big fan of. She has a TEDx, a couple of YouTube specials, Netflix shows, and she\u2019s the author of Dare to Lead. She has these videos called F*cking First Times (FFTs), and Dare to Lead, so I\u2019m currently just rewatching them as well as her TEDx talk on vulnerability.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best advice you\u2019ve ever received?\n\nI think it\u2019s \u201cfail fast\u201d and \u201cgive yourself grace.\u201d\n\nI was speaking to someone whom I look up to and I was like, \u201cwhat tip would you give to somebody that wants to be like you?\u201d And he said, \u201cfail fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile you\u2019re still at this age, the best thing you can do for yourself is to try as many things and just fail fast.\u201d And I held on to that.\n\nAnd the second one was by my first therapist who used to say, \u201cgive yourself grace.\u201d\n\nPeople will disappoint you, you will disappoint yourself but at the end of everything, always give yourself grace because you can.\n\nWhat\u2019s a problem you\u2019re still trying to solve?\n\nI think one thing that I still want to keep doing, because I don\u2019t think I have done it to the extent where I\u2019m like \u2018I\u2019m done\u2019, is to keep telling stories. That\u2019s because there are just so many stories to tell and everybody\u2019s story is unique. And there are so many ways that these stories can inspire people.\n\nI have done a lot of just teaching and sharing in the last couple of years, just building my personal brand and my career, but I realise that at the core of everything is to be able to tell the stories. Because the more you tell stories, the more you just inspire a whole generation of people who want to work in a similar line.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a problem. I think that it\u2019s just like a gap that exists.\n\nWho would you like to see answer these questions?\n\nMitchelle Chibundu, Product Designer at Wise; Seun Runsewe, Product Manager at Chipper Cash; Aisha Owolabi, a Digital Content Marketer; and Adora Mbelu, founder of Lumination Global Network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamuel Okike I write about media, technology and internet culture.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnyeonghaseyo,\n\nIt\u2019s the end of May! And not to be cliche, but how are your New Year resolutions coming along?\n\nIt seems it was only yesterday we wished our loved ones a Happy New Year and welcomed 2022. While some of us made plans and set goals for the year, others went into the year with vigour, hoping that 2022 would be a good year.\n\nAnd as we approach the halfway point of the year, I hope you are doing well and are still hanging in there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not going to say anything inspiring today; I just want to remind you to keep up the good work. And if you think you need motivation, I\u2019m encouraging you to be your push even when things don\u2019t appear to be moving in the right direction.\n\nToday, I\u2019ve got two stories:\n\nHow Peace Itimi works\n\nStarlink\u2019s approval in Nigeria\n\nHow does Peace Itimi work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore I joined Techpoint Africa, the series, How I Work was the only thing I went through on the website.\n\nI didn\u2019t use the word \u201cread\u201d because reading involves looking at, understanding and mentally interpreting the texts that make up written or printed material. Well, that\u2019s not the case for me.\n\nI do not retain the things I read. How can I when, after \u201creading\u201d one sentence, I\u2019ve forgotten what I saw in the first?\n\nHowever, I went through Samuel\u2019s series, and I liked it. For the record, I went through three or four stories in the series, which was remarkable because I get bored quickly.\n\nThe series, which began in 2019, featured interesting people like Odunayo Eweniyi, PiggyVest Co-founder and Chief Operations Officer; Joseph Akinfenwa-Donus, aka Joeboy, singer and songwriter. We also saw Fisayo Fosudo, content creator; Eyitayo Ogunmola, Utiva CEO, and Dr Ola Brown, founder of Flying Doctors Healthcare Investment Group. All building and doing amazing things.\n\nBut Samuel was unable to continue due to the pandemic. Nonetheless, I came bearing good news, people. \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude01 I know you know it, but I\u2019m still going to tell you anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrum rolls: The series is back!!! And today, Samuel will feature someone you should definitely be interested in. Give it up for Peace Itimi, ladies and gentlemen! (Look at the sky, there are fireworks everywhere.) \ud83d\ude02\n\nBefore we get to how she works, do you know Peace? Before now, I only knew her as a YouTuber who hosts Founders Connect, a platform that documents the stories, journeys and ideologies of leading and emerging African entrepreneurs and operators.\n\nI assumed she didn\u2019t have another job because she is good at what she does and shouldn\u2019t be doing more than one thing at a time? That appears strange now that I think about it. Why box someone, after all?\n\nPlus, last Saturday, I watched her most recent video of Njoku Emmanuel, CEO and Co-founder of Lazerpay, and the dialogue was flawless. So, why does she need a job? That could be a job, too.\n\nWell, I was wrong. Apart from being a YouTuber, she\u2019s currently the Head of Growth for Stax, an offline payment super-app for Africans. She\u2019s also a digital marketing professional and a Udemy trainer. She has two courses titled \u201cCustomer Centric Marketing | Know, Woo & Win Your Audience\u201d and \u201cExcellence in Customer Service.\u201d\n\nWith this, you should know that she has a huge passion for growing people and businesses. So, how does she work? How does she combine all these? Be on the lookout for her story today by 12 p.m. for answers.\n\nStarlink\u2019s approval in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarlink was one of the trending topics on Twitter over the weekend. Even if you don\u2019t use Twitter, I believe you must have heard the word Starlink. You haven\u2019t? Oh, you have, but it\u2019s still not clear? Well, I got you.\n\nFirst off, here\u2019s the gist: Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, a US-based space exploration company, announced that SpaceX\u2019s satellite Internet service, Starlink, has been approved in Nigeria and Mozambique on Friday, May 27, 2022.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the big deal about Starlink? Aside from its unlimited data, Starlink offers low latency and high-speed broadband internet access in areas where it was previously unreliable or unavailable.\n\nThis means that if you\u2019re in a rural area, you will enjoy faster Internet speed. All you need is a clear view of the sky because the Internet is transmitted directly from space rather than fibres.\n\nHow does Starlink work? First off, you have to subscribe to Starlink. You\u2019ll receive a kit that includes a satellite dish and a router when you do that. To make the connection, simply install the satellite dish in your home, and it receives the signal and forwards it to your router.\n\nThere\u2019s an Android and iOS app for Starlink that uses augmented reality to help you choose the best location and position for your receivers.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Starlink Internet costs $599.00 (~\u20a6330,000) for a complete kit that includes a terminal, mounting tripod, and Wi-Fi router, and an additional $110 (~\u20a660,500) when you preorder and for the monthly subscription.\n\nA complete kit of Starlink Business or its Premium plan costs $2,500.00 (~\u20a61.3 million). Its monthly subscription is priced at $500 (~\u20a6275,000).\n\nThis begs the question of how many Nigerians can pay for these services. In a country with 109.2 million Internet users as of January 2022, the average monthly data subscription fee is $50 (\u20a620,761), per TechCabal.\n\nStill, I think Musk and the team will review the price in the country because Nigerians are poor, with over 83 million people living in extreme poverty.\n\nSo, although this approval poses a threat to the country\u2019s existing telco companies, I think it comes at an inopportune time, as they plan to raise data, voice calls, and SMS charges by 40%. Does this imply that telco companies will lower their data rates?\n\nNonetheless, Starlink has the potential to create jobs in rural areas, lifting people out of poverty. But, can they afford it?\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on last week\u2019s stories\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe African Leadership Group and Udacity are offering 5,000 scholarships to African citizens who want to advance their careers in tech. by learning new digital skills.

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday 28th of May, global communications company Infobip, received the Business Efficiency Solutions Provider of the Year award, at the 13th annual Beacon of ICT Awards held in Lagos.\n\nThe Beacon of ICT Awards celebrates the top performers in Nigeria\u2019s ICT sector, giving recognition to best practices and outstanding contributions to the industry. The annual event is organised by Communications Week Media\n\n\u201cThis is a tremendous achievement for Infobip, as it is the second year running that the company has scooped a Beacon of ICT Award, winning the Communication Solution Provider award last year. The accolades are testament to our ongoing efforts in establishing ourselves as one of the top communications providers in the Nigerian market, something we are incredibly proud of\u201d says Infobip Regional manager for West Africa, Olatayo Ladipo-Ajai.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft: Isaac Akanni; Account Executive, Infobip\n\nMiddle: Olatayo Ladipo-Ajayi :Regional Manager, West Africa, Infobip\n\nRight: Oluwashina Aina, Sales Engineer, Infobip\n\nIn addition to receiving the Beacon of ICT Award for Best Communication Solution Provider last year, Infobip was also recognised by the Nigeria Tech Innovation and Telecom Awards (NTITA) as the Innovative Cloud Communication Partner of the Year for 2021.

This, paired with the growing uptake of smartphones and increased internet penetration, could propel private consumption significantly above current levels.\n\nThis trend is expected to drive high demand for business efficiency solutions, underpinned by cloud communications platforms.\n\nLadipo-Ajai notes that this is the start of a continued momentum for Infobip in the African market. The company plans to focus strongly on the west region and ensure that it continues to help businesses transform to be able to build meaningful and rewarding relationships with customers.\n\nAbout Infobip:\n\nInfobip is a global cloud communications platform that enables businesses to build connected customer experiences across all stages of the customer journey at scale, with easy and contextualized interactions over customers\u2019 preferred channels.

Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby Abdullahi Fawale\n\nShort answer? Apply to AltSchool Africa.\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect avenue. Within 12 months, you would have learnt a highly sought-after tech skill and obtained a top-rated diploma. The knowledge and experience gathered during the program adequately prepare you for your first tech job.\n\nReady to begin that journey? Get started HERE.\n\nYou\u2019re reading this for one of two reasons:\n\n1. You\u2019ve made the decision to switch careers and you have your eyes set on the tech space. You\u2019re now on the lookout for key pointers on how to start.\n\n2. You\u2019re yet to decide on transitioning though you\u2019ve been giving it a lot of thought. You however seek more information in the hope that you get all the clarity and green light you need.\n\nA third possibility could be that you know someone who is at that phase of their life\u2014yearning for a career change and real opportunities for growth. This piece answers some of your questions about pursuing a career in tech and how to transition.\n\nBefore we dive in, what is your \u201cWhy\u201d?\n\nThe tech space undoubtedly holds a myriad of opportunities for skilled talent worldwide. Global ecosystems continue to witness exponential growth. In Africa, solution-driven startups keep springing up & raising rounds to help drive growth and expansion.\n\nTech news platforms are often inundated with announcements of funds raised by startups which sometimes run into several millions of dollars. More jobs are getting created. Top tech talents are being enticed with juicy compensation packages and then poached. Junior employees are now taking up more responsibility and securing promotions. It\u2019s Career Christmas!\n\nHowever, it\u2019s quite easy to get distracted by this zeitgeist. Away from the exciting announcements and fascinating Twitter conversations, the growth and successes of these tech ecosystems are powered by the blood and sweat of deeply passionate and hardworking people who put in their absolute best to make things work.\n\nIn other words, working in tech is not a walk in the park. Your \u201cwhy\u201d mustn\u2019t be influenced by the current ecosystem zeitgeist, but by a genuine readiness to learn, contribute and grow.\n\nYou also must define what you want to do going forward. Are you looking for core tech/code roles (e.g Software Engineering) or no-code roles like Product Design, Product Management, Product Marketing, Technical Writing, Customer Success, Recruitment etc,?\n\nHave you looked into what it takes to be successful in this new path and are you ready to give what it takes?\n\nAnswer these questions as truthfully as you can. Don\u2019t worry if you fear your answers aren\u2019t convincing enough at the moment. You can always look up more information on these roles to guide your final decision.\n\nWith that said, here are 5 Proven Tips to Help You Transition Into Tech:\n\n1. What transferable skills do you have?\n\nA sizeable number of people that transition to tech do so by leveraging their previously acquired skills\u2014though these skills are mostly no-code or non-technical. For instance, a Customer Service Representative at a local bank could easily transition to a similar role at a FinTech startup. A journalist or creative writer could try out technical writing and pick up really fast. Human Resource Managers/Recruiters in conventional companies would easily settle in as technical recruiters after a few months of training. The list goes on.\n\nWhat you should do is identify the skills you already possess and see what roles those could get you in tech. If you have your eyes set on an entirely different role (one that doesn\u2019t align with your current skills), check out the skills required for that role and how to go about acquiring them. Then go for it.\n\n2. Search for opportunities in industries where you have prior experience\n\nThis is in many ways similar to what we discussed above\u2014about seeking opportunities in tech where your previously acquired skills are a match. Say you\u2019re a Risk & Compliance Officer at a local bank; you can work the same job at a FinTech startup. A seasoned chartered accountant can head the Accounts & Finance unit at a tech startup. Medical doctors could, for instance, work as consultants at HealthTech startups offering home services. Product Managers can easily function across numerous industries. Conventional journalists and content creators could niche down and focus on reporting/producing content on tech and so on.\n\n3. Take courses & write a certification exam\n\nOne of the sure-fire ways to transition to tech is to learn the skill(s) required to function in specific areas of interest. A great way to achieve this is by taking online courses, registering for and joining boot camps and writing certification exams. Thanks to the internet, there now seems to be unlimited access to information allowing us to learn on our own.\n\nThe democratization of the internet has also brought about a rise in the number of digital platforms that help people acquire knowledge and learn new skills. Within a few months, you can go from being a complete outsider to becoming an entry-level professional, anywhere in the world.\n\nThis is where AltSchool Africa comes in. At AltSchool Africa, you can learn some of the world\u2019s most sought after tech skills and earn a top-rated diploma within 12 months. The school runs a number of coding and no-code learning programs that are stand-alone specialisations under its School of Engineering and School of Product respectively.\n\nFor instance, when you apply to the School of Engineering, you will have to select a specific area of specialisation among the following:\n\nFrontend Engineering Backend Engineering & Cloud Engineering\n\nHowever, for the no-code School of Product, you can choose to learn either Product Design, Product Management or Product Marketing.\n\nIs it possible to land a job in tech by just taking courses without certification? Yes. However, earning a certification badge from an institute of repute certainly opens more doors and gets you in much bigger rooms.\n\n4. Be on the lookout for Internships\n\nMany careers that began as internships have blossomed into highly successful vocations. Some of the most revered, most admired professionals today, started out as interns and managed to build their careers into the success we currently know them to be.\n\nInternships offer great learning opportunities and direct pathways to getting your first job in tech. Not only do you get the opportunity to learn directly from much more experienced professionals\u2013you could also be on your way to getting your first offer of employment. This, of course, is dependent on how well you perform during the period.\n\n5. Network. Network. Network\n\nThe opportunities you seek aren\u2019t coming to pay you a visit in the comfort of your home. You have to get out there and grab them. Your social capital will, to a large extent, influence your career trajectory.\n\nWho do you know? Who do they know? What do they know? What do they do?\n\nUnderstanding the power of networking and actively making time to build connections will help you grow personally and professionally. So, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll do:\n\nIf your LinkedIn has been inactive, it\u2019s time to power it up: That is a good place to start. Find people doing great work in your preferred field and connect with them. Genuinely engage them in conversations and keep an open mind during these discussions.\n\nYou could also look up startup founders and hiring managers in companies you have an interest in: Try to connect with them and send a properly worded message. Briefly introduce yourself and why you\u2019re reaching out. Remember to be courteous.\n\nAttend tech events: These events are the perfect place to network as attendance is primarily physical. You can walk up to stakeholders, politely introduce yourself and tell your story. If you\u2019ve completed all the necessary training and are now in search of a job, that would be a perfect place to pitch to startup founders and execs too.\n\nYou should also consider volunteering: A good number of startups are in the business of building communities and organizing events. Due to the workload which sometimes could get overwhelming, these startups seek to onboard volunteers to help out on a project temporarily. In some cases, volunteers are paid a stipend for the work they do. In reverse scenarios, they aren\u2019t. However, monetary benefits shouldn\u2019t be your primary concern here. Your focus must be on learning as much as you can, gaining insights into the workings of the space, identifying key players and expanding your social circle.\n\nVolunteering, when done right, puts your name on the lips of persons that have the capacity to get you your next job.\n\nJoin Tech Communities: As the ecosystem grows, stakeholders are beginning to appreciate the power of community; the need to bring key players and intelligent outsiders together to look inwards and map out strategies for continued growth.\n\nOne of the strategies designed to ensure said growth is the creation of smaller groups or communities dedicated to knowledge sharing, resource sharing, mentorship and access to opportunities. The primary targets of these communities are entry-level & intermediate professionals who are then guided by more experienced tech talent. Members of these communities often have a shared sense of responsibility to help each other grow.\n\nThere are communities for everyone. So, whether you\u2019re a Software Engineer, Data Analyst, Product Manager or Technical Writer, there is a place for you.\n\nOn a final note:\n\nIt is very much possible to transition into tech within one year. As a matter of fact, some have managed to make the switch in just a few months. Bear in mind that if you must transition and do it fast, you will have to simultaneously employ more than one of the methods mentioned above. For example, you could have direct, transferable skills but you may have to network and volunteer to access even bigger and better opportunities.\n\nThese methods also aren\u2019t set in stone. You could come up with other creative, honest ways to move several steps further and get to work.\n\nIn the meantime, let\u2019s circle back to where we began:\n\nA quick guide on How to Transition into Tech in 1 Year?\n\nApply to AltSchool Africa\n\nApplications to the School of Product are currently open.\n\nReady to begin that journey?

The Northern Alliance comprises 11 states mainly situated in northern Nigeria with the exception of one south western state. The bloc has the country\u2019s most active voters measured by voter turnout. Nearly 5 in 10 people in these states vote, with an average voter turnout of 41 percent. That\u2019s higher than the 28 percent turnout for the Bible Belt and 27 percent for the Rockies.\n\nThe Northern Alliance includes states such as Gombe, Sokoto, Jigawa, Zamfara, Kano, Kebbi, Bauchi, Katsina, Yobe, Borno and Osun. Together they accounted for 25.4 mil- lion voters in the 2019 election.\n\n\u201cThis group of people are not that homogeneous. However, when it comes to politics, they are uniquely united.

          "title": "How each bloc has voted since 1999",
          "text": "With hindsight, the Bible Belt states\u2019 loyalty to PDP first emerged in the 1999 presidential elections, with all 17 states that form the bloc voting for the PDP\u2019s Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nThe Northern Alliance was also largely won by the PDP with the exception of Sokoto, Zamfara, Yobe and Osun states which were won by Olu Falae, who was running on a joint Alliance for Democracy (AD) and All People\u2019s Party (APP) ticket.\n\nThe Rockies states were split between both parties but it was AD/APP that won in terms of total votes by a margin of 1 million.\n\nFormer president Obasanjo would eventually win the election with 18.7 million votes as against the 11.1 million votes garnered by Falae.\n\nEjobe told BusinessDay that the 1999 election data analysis is interesting because even though it looked like it was a PDP white-wash that year, it was purely a representation of certain trends that have already started to occur, some of which may never change.\n\nThe voting patterns were slightly altered in 2003.\n\nThe Northern Alliance at this time had begun to take shape and voted for All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) whose candidate was President Muhammadu Buhari. In the previous election, the Northern Alliance had largely voted for the PDP and the 2003 election would mark the start of the PDP\u2019s failure to win the bloc over.\n\nThe Bible Belt and Rockies went to the PDP, helping Obasanjo to a second term with 24.4 million votes, outperforming Buhari who came second with 12.7 million votes.\n\nThe 2007 election data was not broken down into state voting patterns and as such was excluded in the report presentation by Viisaus.\n\nRead also: Emergence of voting blocs: Northern Alliance, Bible Belt and Rockies\n\nThe 2011 election painted a picture of the established and growing Northern Alliance bloc. Again, the Northern Alliance, with the exception of Osun state, would vote for President Buhari who was representing the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) this time. It would however be the PDP\u2019s Goodluck Jonathan, who captured the Bible Belt (which by now were established loyalists of the PDP) and the Rockies, that would emerge\n\nwinner with an estimated 22.5 million votes, almost double of Buhari\u2019s 12.2 million votes.\n\nThe 2015 election saw a repeat of the trend where the Northern Alliance voted for Buhari. The loyalty of the Bible Belt states to the PDP waxed stronger with victory for the PDP\u2019s Jonathan yet again. The Rockies can be said to have been formed here as the West broke free from the Bible Belt and voted for a different party.\n\nThis time, the Rockies voted in unison with the Northern Alliance, and made history in the pro- cess. For the first time, an incumbent president was defeated with President Buhari emerging winner at the fourth time of asking.\n\nThe Rockies proved to be the game changers for Buhari who had always won the Northern Alliance since he first contested in 2003.\n\n2015 election save for few but instrumental changes, one of which was the drastic drop in voter turnout in the Bible belt states.\n\nEach state that forms the Northern Alliance voted against the PDP for the fifth election running but favoured the APC\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari. That\u2019s in keeping with the trend since 1999 which shows that the Northern Alliance has always voted against the PDP and another trend which shows the bloc has voted for Buhari since 2003.\n\nThe Bible Belt voted for Atiku Abubakar\u2019s People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), similar to 2015 when they also voted for the PDP\u2019s Goodluck Jonathan who\n\nwas seeking a second term against Buhari but would eventually lose out.\n\nSeven out of the nine states that form the Rockies were won by APC in 2019, while the PDP won in Ondo and Oyo. The year before that, in 2015, eight out of nine voted for APC with the exception of Ekiti state.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has called for doctors\u2019 collaboration to sustain reforms in the healthcare sector, ensuring a resilient and equitable system to deliver efficient, quality and affordable healthcare services to Edo people.\n\nObaseki gave the charge when he received the new executives of the Association of Resident Doctors (ARD) at the Hospital Management Agency, who were on a courtesy visit at the Government House, Benin City.\n\nThe governor, who noted that he is pursuing a holistic reform in the sector and putting in place mechanisms to discourage manpower for healthcare delivery from leaving the country, urged the doctors to support the government\u2019s effort at strengthening the system and curbing the brain drain in the health sector.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe need more doctors, particularly with the way the doctors are traveling out for greener pastures. What we need is to strengthen the institutions that produce doctors. We are strengthening our educational system to produce more doctors.\u201d\n\nNoting that his administration is tackling the age-old challenges in the health sector such as dearth of modern medical equipment, decaying healthcare infrastructure, inadequate personnel and poor funding, Obaseki stated, \u201cThe system we inherited and structure put in place at that time was meant for that time but today the society has changed, leading to the reforms in our medical sector. We must rethink the sector we inherited.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cMedical healthcare is global and standardized and as such, we need to measure up. We need to restructure our healthcare system in the state. The COVID-19 pandemic is an eye-opener for us as everyone was restricted from moving around. The lesson is that we must fix our healthcare system.\n\n\u201cWe have insisted on healthcare reforms. This is why I brought down the central hospital to decentralize the healthcare system in the state, ensuring that there is at least one healthcare facility in every community to ensure healthcare is closer to the people.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on how to produce more doctors by strengthening the basic education system and giving quality education to produce more doctors for the state. We need more than 200 new doctors in the system, who will be in the community to take charge of the PHCs across the state and must be motivated and encouraged to stay here.\u201d\n\nReacting to the doctor\u2019s request to be included in the N40,000 new minimum wage, the governor said, \u201cDoctors are special breeds of civil servants and earn more and should not be asking for minimum wage. You are civil servants but the only set of civil servants who earn more than the governor. A consultant in your system earns twice what I earn as a governor. Why should you be asking for minimum wage? What the government did is to help those at the bottom because people go through a lot every day.\n\n\u201cThe wage is to help those at the bottom to pass the poverty threshold. Certainly, there are allowances due to you but subject to negotiation. We don\u2019t like making promises we cannot fulfill as a government. This is one of the quarrels we have with the federal government. You can\u2019t go and negotiate a labour contract and impose it on us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Edo, we respect labour which is why we have not had any strike regarding allowances or wages in the state as the welfare of our workers is important to us,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the leader of the delegation and president of the association, Dr. Uaboi Ovbiagele commended the governor for the holistic reforms in the healthcare sector, pledging their support to sustain reforms in the sector.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "The Lagos State Government owned 32-metric tons per hour Rice Mill in Imota, Ikorodu division, will be ready for inauguration in 10 weeks.\n\nThe state Commissioner for Agriculture, Ms Abisola Olusanya, gave the assurance in Lagos.\n\nAccording to her, the contractors have started testing running the mill.\n\nThere are 16 silos in the mill with a combined capacity of 40,000 metric tons, each having 2,500 metric tons.\n\nThe mill was built with a capacity to produce 2.8 million bags of 50kg bags of rice yearly while generating 1,500 direct jobs and 254,000 indirect jobs.\n\nOlusanya said that the Special Adviser to the Governor on rice, Dr Rotimi Fashola, would ensure the completion by July.\n\n\u201dWe are commissioning by June/July or the end of July. Within the next 10 weeks, that place will be ready for commissioning.\n\n\u201dThe special adviser is working towards that and they were still there yesterday and they have started test running.\n\n\u201dPaddy is already there. we have rice paddy. Thousands of tons are there. I can\u2019t ascertain the figure but what I know is that the silos are being filled right now with paddy.\n\n\u201dThey are already tested running the equipment. Anybody is free to go to Imota, the Special Adviser is there.\n\n\u201dYou can just request, and you will see that within the next 10 weeks that place will be ready for commissioning,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also spoke on whether the mill would crash the increasing cost of rice in Nigeria, adding that such could only occur if the government was in full control of production, processing and marketing.\n\nThe commissioner also said that although getting the paddy at a cheaper price might crash the price, the security challenge in parts of the north also posed a great challenge.\n\n\u201dYou expect a crash when you are also experiencing value chain from the production itself up to processing and marketing; when you are in full control.\n\n\u201dRight now, we are in just the processing part which is the middle labour.\n\n\u201dIf the price at which paddy is being procured is not low enough to crash it except you\u2019re asking for a subsidy which is not sustainable.\n\n\u201dSubsidy is not a sustainable route to go, so the best thing is getting the paddy at cheaper price.\n\n\u201dWhich means that back in the north, how suitable is the environment for them to actually cultivate and grow rice.\n\n\u201dIf right now, there is a lot of issues in the north which border around banditry and all of those things, it is going to affect a lot of people that can actually farm.\n\n\u201dIt is going to affect the quantity of paddy they can get and obviously if there is a scarcity of paddy itself as raw material, prices will be jacked up.\n\n\u201dSo it is not just about the price of rice going up, it is a function of security.\n\n\u201cIf the farmers don\u2019t feel secure up north, you have more of them coming down south to do other things.\n\n\u201dIt means you have fewer farmers, you have less paddy, and it means the little that is available the price is going to be high,\u201d she said.\n\nThe commissioner urged the westerners, South-West states to wake up and get back into agriculture as a full-time business and cultivate commercial size agriculture.\n\n\u201dRice price is not all about a function of just rice as in commodity, it is a function of food generally and security issues happening in the north\n\n\u201dThis is because the south is so dependent on the north when it comes to food, it\u2019s just a matter of time Southerners have to wake up.\n\n\u201dThe westerners, South-West need to wake up, we have to get back into agriculture as a full-time business.\n\n\u201dWe have to go into commercial size agriculture not small old farm agriculture that we are doing that we are really not seeing the impact.\n\n\u201dIn the north, they do commercial size farms and they own commercial size farms; down here in the south, we are not doing so much of that and that one needs to change,\u201d Olusanya said.",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nState and national assemblies aspirants of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State have bemoaned the alleged impunity of the state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, just as they jointly called for the cancellation of the state house of assembly and national assembly primaries of the party, describing it as a sham.\n\nThe aspirants, who include ten house of assembly and two house of representatives aspirants, accused Governor Oyetola of impunity and total disregard to democratic principles in the conduct of the primaries.\n\nAccording to the aspirants, the direct primaries was conducted without any election material or party document like membership register, result sheets, among others.\n\nThe aspirants are: Hon. Waseeu Gbola Adebayo (Olorunda State Constituency) Mr Owoade Ademola Adeyemi (Irewole/Isokan State Constituency), Mr Wahab Kazeem Olanrewaju (Ifelodun State Constituency), Mr Babalola Iqmal Opeyemi (Ede South State Constituency) and Mr. Kolawole Olalere Victor (Ilesa East State Constituency\n\nOthers are: Mrs. Adesola Arawole Adegbite (Odo-Otin State Constituency), Mr. Olaoye Abdulhakeem (Osogbo State Constituency), Mrs. Olaniyi Shariat Olanike (Ayedaade State Constituency), Mr Kasali Nurudeen Adelaja (Iwo State Constituency), Mr Opadola Abdullahi Amobi (Olaoluwa State Constituency), Hon. (Dr) Mr. Komolafe Akinlabi Richard (Ijesha-South Federal Constituency) and Mr Ibrahim Oyekunle (Ayedaade/Irewole/Isokan Federal Constituency).\n\nAddressing a press conference on Monday, the aspirants said results of the primaries were not announced at the various ward and local government collation centres by the factional APC Ward Chairmen who were appointed as Collation Officers by Oyetola.\n\nThey claimed the result sheet of each of the State and Federal constituencies were kept in the Government House where the \u2018Governor\u2019s people\u2019 were allocating figures to their preferred aspirants.\n\nAccording to the aspirants, the failure of the party leadership to declare winner of the State House of Assembly and Federal House of Representatives primaries in each constituency was as a result of the fraud and manipulation of the results as directed by the Governor.\n\nReading the text of the press conference, Hon Adeboye, a two-term state lawmaker, said: \u201cOn behalf of other aspirants to the State House of Assembly and National Assembly positions, we wish to bring to the fore, indeed the attention of the whole world, the charade and sham that Governor Adegboyega Oyetola and his ilk called primary elections in the state.\n\n\u201cAn autocratic and dictatorial regime couldn\u2019t do worse in dragging democracy on the floor than what Governor Oyetola and his collaborators have done on the House of Assembly and National Assembly primaries of our party. The late dark goggle general didn\u2019t bring as much odium to democracy as Governor Oyetola.\n\n\u201cOur people were at the various collation centres and nothing was happening until around 5pm when some factional Ward Chairmen from the Governor\u2019s camp surfaced, claiming to be the Presiding Officer for the primary election. These chairmen did not come to the collation centres with any electoral materials like APC membership register, results sheets, e.t.c. They just asked the party members to raise up their membership cards, queue and without any proper accreditation, did the counting, wrote the results on a PIECE OF PAPER and left.\n\n\u201cEven with such fraudulent and reprehensible conduct, our supporters were more than those of our opponents and we had the highest number. In some wards, there was no counting of APC members at all.\n\n\u201cThere and then, we went to various collation centres for the Local Government where the results for the local government ought to be collated. Nobody showed up at the Local Government Collation Centre till we left there around 8:30, 9pm and 10pm as the case may be.\n\n\u201cThe same scenario was repeated for the House of Representatives primary which took place on Friday 27th May, 2022 and up till this moment, there are no official results for both the State House of Assembly and National Assembly primary elections in Osun.\n\n\u201cMay we note that with the high level of impunity and manipulations involved in the process and shenanigans engaged to get rid of us, the joke has now turned on Governor Oyetola\u2019s group, as all its aspirants in various constituencies are laying claims to victory and confirming it with concocted figures aimed to suite their fraud.\n\n\u201cIt is unheard of, even a shameful experience, that four and three days after the primaries have been held, the Governor and his collaborators in the party are unable to declare winner in the contests.\n\n\u201cFinally, the information at our disposal is that all the results sheets are currently in the custody of Governor Gboyega Oyetola and the results sheets are being filled with the names of the Governor\u2019s cronies who never won the primary elections, hence the need for this conference.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we call on His Excellency, the National Chairman of our party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu to use his good office to correct the current act of impunity and rape of democracy being displayed by Governor Gboyega Oyetola before it is too late.\u201d",

What they have done is a sacrilege and something that have never been done on Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are also urging the Abia State government and security agents in South East to facilitate the release of men of God without further delay and ensure the unconditional release of the Prelate, if they are not part of the criminal act and all the criminal activities in Southeast.\n\n\u201cThe information at our disposal which was made available by M- Branch of IPOB intelligence team revealed that the abductors stay and operate along Okigwe- Isikwuato -Arondiziogu-Umunneochi-Enugu expressway to Lokpanta where Fulani terrorists and kidnappers masquerading as herdsmen have camp and dug trenches waiting for eventuality\n\nMeanwhile, the gunmen who abducted the Prelate and two others from the same church are demanding a sum of N100 million ransom.\n\nAccording to a statement signed by the Secretary of the Conference, Rt.

We never betrayed anybody because it is not in our blood to betray. But it is a shame to those people, some of the governors from the South, they are the people that were used to sabotage our cause.\u201d\n\nThe governor stated that it was disheartening that some governors from the South due to their inordinate ambition could jettison the collective interest of the people they claim to represent.\n\nHe said: \u201cLook at a region ganged up, then you, your own region cannot gang up. You became tools to be used against the interest of your people, and you think you have won, you have lost.\n\n\u201cYou will continue to be perpetual slaves. Rivers people you don\u2019t need to bother yourselves. PDP needs us. If they say they don\u2019t need us, they should wait.\u201d\n\nWike explained that he was propelled into the race to offer service and advance the interest of Nigeria, adding that in the process, he was confronted by a few individuals who wanted somebody they will control and he declined to be such puppet.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cThe winner (of the ticket) also saw it. They underrated us, but now, they will not underrate us again. We have all it takes to do whatever we want to do.\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of you being firm; it is a matter of you being hopeful. There is nobody that is born greater than us in this country, therefore, we cannot answer second-class citizens. We can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWe just used this one to tell them that enough is enough. We made them not to sleep. We made them not to eat. We made all of them from wherever they said they come from to know that there is somebody who can take them on.\n\n\u201cThis country does not belong to one particular zone. If people are afraid of talking, it is their business. I cannot be a second-class citizen in my country.\n\n\u201cSome of them, their in-laws are governors in the ruling party, but they want to interfere in what happens in PDP. Some of them their brothers are governors in the ruling party and they want to interfere in PDP.\u201d\n\nWike stated that with the presidential primary over, and given his pledge to work for whoever emerged, Rivers State will work to deliver PDP and all its candidates in the 2023 general election.\n\nThe governor recalled that in 2019, despite failure of the candidate he supported to clinch the ticket, Rivers State gave PDP massive votes and refused to negotiate with the All Progressives Congress (APC) to give them 25 per cent votes.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn 2019, I was the only governor from the South-South who never negotiated with the present government. They came, I said no, I was not going to be party to that. And that is why APC never had 25 per cent in this state (Rivers).\n\n\u201cBut, all the other States in the South-South, the president got 35 per cent to 40 per cent. I said I was not going to sit down with them and negotiate.\u201d\n\nWike said he has even told the winner of the PDP presidential primary, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, that most of those hanging around him do not have electoral value.\n\nThe governor stated that it would be imperative on such people from states, whether in the North or South, to deliver the kind of votes that Rivers State will deliver in the 2023 general election in order for PDP to win the presidency.\n\nHe said it was wrong for the party to have allowed the governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, to speak for a second time after the time allotted to each of the aspirants to address the delegates.\n\nIn his remarks, Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly, Ikuinyi-Owaji Ibani, described the governor as an emancipator, who has solved a particular nagging problem in Nigeria, that\u2019s the issue of minority question.\n\nAlso, PDP chairman in the state, Ambassador Desmond Akawor, commended Wike for his resilience and that the entire State and the Niger Delta were happy that he spoke for them.",

Unfortunately, recent developments within our party make it practically impossible to continue participating and making such constructive contributions.\n\n\u201cOur national challenges are deep-seated and require that we each make profound sacrifices towards rescuing our country. My commitment to rescuing Nigeria remains firm, even if the route differs.\n\n\u201cI wish to thank you personally for your graciousness and leadership. I wish you well and best of luck in the service of country.\u201c\n\nHowever, defecting to his new party a day after dumping PDP, Obi said: \u201cSince I resigned from the PDP because of issues that are at variance with my persona and principles, I have consulted widely with various parties and personalities to ensure we do not complicate the route to our desired destination.\n\n\u201cFor me, the process of achieving our goal is as fundamental as what one will do thereafter.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I have chosen a route that I consider to be in line with our aspirations and my mantra of taking the country from consumption to production; and that is the Labour Party which is synonymous with the people, workers, development, production, securing and uniting Nigerians as one family.\n\n\u201cI invite all Nigerians to join me in taking back our country. \u201cBe assured that I\u2019ll never let you down.\u201d\n\nIt is worthy to note that the economic expert had in one of his interviews argued that he was not desperate to become Nigeria\u2019s president, but desperate to see Nigeria work for the youths and children.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not desperate to become Nigeria\u2019s president, but desperate to see Nigeria work for the youths and children\u201d he was quoted to have said.\n\nHowever, the question in everyone\u2019s mind is: would Obi emerge the presidential candidate of Labour Party?

          "title": "How APC Cabal Deceived Jonathan, Made Ex-leader Miss Out On Party\u2019s Presidential Aspirants\u2019 List, PDP Convention",
          "text": "Former President Goodluck Jonathan may have been deceived by the Aso Rock cabal that he would get the automatic ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress to contest the 2023 presidential election, a presidential source told News Direct on Monday.\n\nThe cabal comprising some members of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s extended family and friends are the powers behind the throne.\n\nGoodluck Jonathan\n\nThis group led by Buhari\u2019s nephew, Mallam Mamman Daura is said to have the ear of the President, influence policy-making and determine those who get major appointments.\n\nNews Direct had recently reported how Jonathan met with Daura and other cabal members in Abuja where he was promised the automatic ticket of the APC.\n\nHe was told during the meeting that President Buhari would anoint him, while other aspirants will step down as it was done during the March 26 national convention of the APC, which produced Senator Abdullahi Adamu as the chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cHe was deceived by the cabal and he fell for it, he is a joker. With all the promise, his name didn\u2019t even appear on the list of those to be screened. That also prevented him from attending the PDP\u2019s presidential primary election,\u201d the presidential source said.\n\nSpeaking with News Direct, one of Jonathan\u2019s aides confirmed the former President was deceived by the cabal members so he could miss the convention of the Peoples Democratic Party.\n\nHe said Jonathan had agreed to attend the PDP convention held last Saturday after the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, visited him at his Maitama district residence in Abuja on May 17.\n\nThe promise by the cabal and APC National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu however made him shun the exercise organised by the party, despite having his picture in its convention\u2019s programme booklet.\n\n\u201cI think he (Jonathan) was just deceived intensely to ensure he didn\u2019t attend the PDP presidential primary.\n\n\u201cThe APC Chairman told him they had to wait for President Buhari to come back from Malabo. After Buhari returned, they changed the tune and he (Jonathan) was unable to meet Buhari as promised by the chairman and cabal.\n\n\u201cJonathan also travelled last night and will be back on Wednesday. But the problem now is that we heard Buhari is likely to have travelled by that Wednesday as well. So, the former President is confused, he seems to have trusted the cabal so well.\n\n\u201cYou can see that his name is not even on the list that was released last night. The list was released after he left the country. His lawsuit judgement is no longer being considered as well; that was what they used to deceive him initially. This was someone who had assured PDP members that he would be at their convention and they printed his name and picture on their booklet but he didn\u2019t show up, not knowing he was being deceived,\u201d an aide to the former President told News Direct.\n\nA Federal High Court in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State on Friday ruled that former Jonathan was still eligible to contest in the 2023 presidential election on the grounds that he had only been elected into the office once, in 2011.\n\nThe trial judge, Justice Isa Hamma Dashen, in his judgement also held that Jonathan\u2019s right to vie for the office of president again cannot be stopped by any retroactive law.\n\nEarlier, News earlier reported that Jonathan is not on the list of presidential aspirants expected to be screened by the APC despite secretly submitting his N100 million presidential nomination and expression of interest forms to the National Chairman of the ruling party.\n\nNames of the presidential aspirants for screening as listed by APC:\n\n1. Chukwuemeja Uwaezuoke Nwajiuba\n\n2. Badaru Abubakar\n\n3. Robert A. Boroffice\n\n4. Uju Ken-Ohanenye\n\n5. Nicholas Felix\n\n6. Nweze David Umahi\n\n7. Ken Nnamani\n\n8. Gbolahan B. Bakare\n\n9. Ibikunle Amosun\n\n10. Ahmed B. Tinubu\n\n11. Ahmad Rufai Sani\n\n12. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi\n\n13. Oladimeji Sabon Bankole\n\n14. John Kayode Fayemi\n\n15. Godswill Obot Akpabio\n\n16. Yemi Osinbajo\n\n17. Rochas Anayo Okorocha\n\n18. Yahaya Bello\n\n19. Tein Jack-Rich\n\n20. Christopher Onu\n\n21. Ahmad Lawan\n\n22. Ben Ayade\n\n23. Ikeobasi Mokelu\n\nBackground\n\nJonathan had recently rejected the presidential form of the ruling APC purchased for him, purportedly by a group of supporters from the northern region.\n\nSpeaking through his Media Adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, the former president said it was an insult for the group to have bought him the forms without his permission.\n\nHowever, sources had told News Direct that claims by the former President that he did not authorise the purchase of the multi-million-naira forms are far from the truth.\n\n\u201cContrary to his denials, former President Goodluck Jonathan gave over N200 million to the governor of Jigawa, Mohammed Badaru, to purchase the APC nomination and expression of interest forms for him,\u201d a source privy to the arrangement had told SaharaReporters.\n\nInterestingly, the Jigawa governor, Badaru had also joined other interested presidential aspirants to vie for the ticket of the APC by buying the N100 million nomination and expression of interest forms.\n\n\u201cI will join the Presidential race since everyone knows I\u2019m a highly qualified person to do the job,\u201d Badaru was quoted as saying during an APC stakeholders\u2019 meeting held at Government House in Dutse recently.\n\nThe governor was also said to have told the gathering during the meeting that he was pressurised by his colleagues to contest for the presidential seat.\n\nHis media aide, Auwalu Sankara, had said his principal had sought President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s blessings before buying the forms.\n\nBut News Direct learnt that the Jigawa governor had bought the forms and come up with the statements as a ruse to deceive Nigerians; as he was indeed working for Jonathan.\n\nIt was further learnt that Jonathan had backed out of the plan and swiftly come up with the denial after the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, had refused to guarantee that the former President would be the consensus candidate of the ruling party\n\nJonathan was Nigeria\u2019s leader as a member of the PDP, which is now an opposition party.\n\n\u201cThe reason why he (Jonathan) gave him that much money \u2013 over N200 million \u2013 was that he asked the governor to buy himself a form too in order to cover up the deal,\u201d a source had said.\n\n\u201cAnd upon purchasing the form, Jonathan alerted Buhari. Buhari told him to meet with the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, but Adamu said he can\u2019t guarantee him as a consensus candidate.\n\n\u201cAt that point, GEJ (Goodluck Ebele Jonathan) started denying that he purchased the form,\u201d another source had said.",
          "summary": "That also prevented him from attending the PDP\u2019s presidential primary election,\u201d the presidential source said.\n\u201cI think he (Jonathan) was just deceived intensely to ensure he didn\u2019t attend the PDP presidential primary.\n\u201cThe APC Chairman told him they had to wait for President Buhari to come back from Malabo.\nAfter Buhari returned, they changed the tune and he (Jonathan) was unable to meet Buhari as promised by the chairman and cabal.\nBuhari told him to meet with the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, but Adamu said he can\u2019t guarantee him as a consensus candidate.",

The FCMB auto loan supports acquiring brand new and pre-owned vehicles (popularly known as \u201cTokunbo\u201d), with N500,000 as the minimum loan amount that a customer can access for a repayment duration of up to 5 years.\n\nThis affirms FCMB\u2019s commitment to improving the social well-being of individuals and enhancing access to credit for higher standard of living for families.\n\nCommenting on the unique value proposition, Divisional Head, Personal Banking of the Bank, Mr Shamsideen Fashola, said, \u201cvehicle ownership is one of the most exciting moments in a person\u2019s life. Yet, many people struggle to save up for a long time to make this dream come true. To bridge this gap, we created a value proposition that is flexible, convenient and empowers individuals, families and businesses to achieve the dream of vehicle ownership. Nigerians can now finance their dream vehicle with an auto loan from FCMB at a low-interest rate with monthly or yearly payment options depending on their income. We, therefore, urge the populace, including, but not limited to salaried individuals, to take advantage of this opportunity to fulfil their vehicle ownership dream\u201d.\n\nFCMB Auto Loan empowers qualified Nigerians to part-finance the purchase of brand-new and pre-owned vehicles while spreading the repayment between one and five years. The loan, which is dependent on the type of vehicle to be purchased, is open to salaried individuals and self-employed Nigerians.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the number of registered vehicles in Nigeria is 13 million. However, vehicle ownership in the country has been declining because of increased prices. This is due to foreign exchange and importation challenges, leading to a drastic reduction in purchasing power and sales decline in the auto industry.\n\nA purpose beyond profit commercial banking institution, First City Monument Bank is a member of FCMB Group Plc, led by Ladi Balogun as Group Chief Executive. The Bank is committed to COVID-19 recovery, income equality and poverty reduction by easing credit constraints to disadvantaged individuals and small businesses. The intervention of FCMB in the automobile sector aligns with Goals 3 and 10 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which focus on well-being and reduced inequalities.",

The truth remains that people will throw up everything and anything. I am not particularly accepting that the process was monetized excessively, safe for those that can be proven. If you are looking for Political parties that dollarises and criminalises the process, it\u2019s APC. Nobody should try to blackmail or take anything from our primary that is adjudged to be best.\u201d\n\nMr Sowunmi who also spoke on the allegation that emergency of Atiku Abubakar as the candidate of the party is against the clamour for power shift to the South, said \u201cthe whole concept of zoning is a party affairs and must not be seen as constitutional. The country is divided into six zones and we must not just think it is three zones of the South against the north. The emergence of Atiku has not affected Nigeria\u2019s unity, rather the burden of unity lies with APC.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the strengthen of its candidate, Mr Sowunmi stated that Atiku Abubakar is a pan-Nigerian who will represent the interest of all Nigerians irrespective of their tribe or religion.\n\nThe governorship candidate, however cautioned cultural groups like PANDEF, Arewa Consultative Forum, Afenifere and others to steer clear of political matters and allow political parties manage its affairs. \u201d I have advised that PANDEF, Arewa, Afenifere and others need to be told not to jump into political matters as if they are political parties. They should not be seen usurping the powers of political parties.\u201d\n\nOn whether the party has the capacity to manage the fallout of the presidential primary, Mr Sowunmi noted that PDP will reach out to everybody and reconcile all groups, while nothing that there are no dissenting voices.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the party to present a candidate. If there is an equity challenge, nobody should address that to PDP rather the APC, because it has only produced its president from the northwest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am telling Nigerians that politics is not for the lily-livered. What happened at the primary is that delegates voted for a unifier.\n\nOn zoning, Mr Sowunmi said \u201cI have maintained consistently that the place of birth is just an accident of history that no one can repair. The only equity challenge that we have is the Southeast because the region has not been able to produce president.\n\n\u201cSometimes, the political gladiators from the other side will always wish that only crises will exits from the camp of their rivals, but hello, you can go to the bank with this, the political process from \u2018tomorrow\u2019 will show that PDP is a big party. We\u2019ll hug ourselves and unite one another\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am telling Nigerians that your darling party is back, we have given you a darling candidate that you know well, Even with the congratulatory message from Asiwaju, it shows that he knows the worth of Atiku.

          "text": "A former Senator representing Kogi West, Dino Melaye has expressed satisfaction with the conduct and outcome of the 2022 Presidential primary of the People\u2019s Democratic Party.\n\nThe former lawmaker stated this on Monday while featuring on TVC\u2019s current affairs program, Journalists\u2019 Hangout.\n\nMr Melaye equally expressed his confidence in the party\u2019s ability to wrestle power from the APC government in 2023.\n\nAccording to him, the convention produced the best candidate to fly the party\u2019s flag in a free and fair contest that every participant is proud of.\n\nSpeaking about his defeat at the party\u2019s senatorial primary, the former lawmaker said all that happened at the election has become history and doesn\u2019t want to discuss it again. \u201cI have moved on. All that happened in the Senate rerun have become history. I really don\u2019t what to dwell on the past. That primary has gone and I have moved on.\u201d\n\nMr Melaye also spoke about his performance while serving as Kogi West senator. \u201cAs a Senator, in terms of representation, I did my best because I implemented so many projects. In the history of National Assembly, I have the highest number of bills. The records are there, they are incontrovertible. I did my best for my people.\u201d\n\nReacting to question about his switch of support from the former Senator President, Bukola Saraki to former Vice Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, the former lawmaker made it clear that he never switched support. He explained that he supported Saraki 100% while he was with him. \u201c I did not switch support from Saraki to Atiku. I was 100% with Saraki when I was with him. I have no problem with Saraki, I still saw him this morning and we both laughed together.\n\n\u201cI chose Atiku time because I have to stay with the known to the unknown. At this time, we need a unifier, who can unite Nigeria. One who cannot be seen as a Muslim, or Christian. Atiku is a popular person whose name is known every in Nigeria. So I moved from unknown to known. So, I did not switch support but support the man who can make Nigeria great.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Melaye dismissed the rumour that Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal betrayed his colleague and fellow aspirant, Nyesom Wike when the former announced his withdrawer from the contest and directed his delegates to vote Atiku Abubakar. He said governor Tambuwal did not betray Mr Wike as there was no written agreement between the two of them. He added that both former aspirants worked independently in pursuit of their ambition. He equally dismissed the insinuation that there was a gang up by some northern elites against the South.\n\n\u201cGovernor Tambuwal saw the necessity to elect a candidate that can unite Nigeria because our dear nation needs a father figure who can unite everyone. Someone who will be able to unite Nigeria and that person is Atiku Abubakar.\n\n\u201cAlhaji Atiku is sound and healthy, politically sagacious and intellectually sound. Atiku will not fail, he will win with landslide. Whatever APC is going to do in terms of manipulation, Atiku is the next president of Nigeria. Our convention has shown that we are more united that ever. We are on big family,\u201d Melaye said.\n\nThe Kogi-born former lawmaker who also spoke on the economy, said it is obvious to everyone that Nigeria is in serious economic distress as prices of goods and services increase alarmingly everyday. According to him, the prices of common goods such as bread, rice, air ticket among others are increasing almost everyday, thereby making life more difficult for Nigerians. \u201cNigerians have engaged both APC and PDP and they know the difference. So, I am confident Nigerians will vote PDP in 2023.\u201d\n\nEconomically, everything has risen such that cost of living has gone up astronomically.\u201d\n\nOn the fight against corruption, Mr Melaye said in the history of Nigeria, there\u2019s no government that is as corrupt as the present Buhari administration. He alleged that people loot brazenly under Buhari administration without consequence. \u201d It is a known fact that tis government is corrupt, people are looting without limitation. Look at the case of the suspended accountant general of the federation who is accused of stealing more than N80bn. There cannot be such thing under Atiku Administration.\u201d\n\nDefection\n\nSenator Dino Melaye argued that most of the governors who defected from PDP to APC are in their second term. He queried why those governors didn\u2019t do so in their first term in office.\n\n\u201d Those defecting from PDP to APC are doing so to protect themselves because they know once they cross to the party, their sins are forgiven. But I can tell you for sure that APC cannot win counsellorship election in a free fair and credible elections in Nigeria again.\u201d\n\nMr Melaye who boasted that PDP is now one big and united family, said all aggrieved parties will be brought back under one big umbrella because Atiku is a father figure. \u201d Atiku is matured, he will unite Nigerians. Everyone will have a bite of national cake. Everybody will benefit from Atiku\u2019s government not only those in his campaign. He urged Nigerians to come out and vote Atiku in order to bring Nigeria back to the path of development.\u201d\n\nWike vs Atiku\n\nReacting to the insinuations that governor Wike will not give total support to Atiku Abubakar\u2019s ambition, Mr Melaye said he believes Mr Wike is a man of his words who has promised to support whoever emerged candidate of the party.\n\nGovernor Wike says what he meant and mean what he says. I believe he will support his party because he\u2019s a party man. I appeal to journalists not to sow seed of discord in our party. By the grace of God, success awaits us in 2023.\n\nSpeaking on the alleged supremacy battle between North and South at the presidential primary, Mr Melaye accused APC of spreading such fake news. He said contrary to opinions of many, Kano and Katsina voted for Governor Wike while Delta voted for Atiku. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like North versus South in this contest, it\u2019s just the creation of APC. There was no tribal war, the delegates voted according to their conscience.\u201d\n\nOn the strength of his party and its candidate, the former lawmaker said \u201d the least of PDP aspirant will defeat all aspirants in APC. We are not afraid of any aspirants. Both the president and other aspirants on the platform of APC will be defeated by Atiku. He touted Mr Kolade-Otitoju to swear with Bible that PDP did not win the 2019 presidential election.\n\n\u201cWhere in a peculiar time in our history where we have to choose between winning and zoning. We have decided to acquire power before sharing power. So we decided to throw it open to acquire power before sharing power,\u201d Mr Melaye said while reacting to the choice of a northern candidate.\n\nSenator Melaye said former vice president Atiku Abubakar is a strong and mature candidate who is competent enough to deliver on his cardinal objectives which include unity of purpose, security, State building and nation building, devolution of power, economy and restructuring.",

Draft conclusions, seen by Reuters, indicated there would be little in terms of new decisions.\n\nBut EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that \u201cthere will be an agreement in the end\u201d, with a deal on the next sanctions package by Monday afternoon.\n\n\u2018UNCONDITIONAL PRIORITY\u2019\n\nAfter failing to capture Kyiv in March, Russia announced that the focus of its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d was now to seize the entire Donbas region, consisting of two provinces, Luhansk and Donetsk, that Moscow claims on behalf of separatist proxies.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Sunday said the \u201cliberation\u201d of the Donbas was an \u201cunconditional priority\u201d for Moscow. read more\n\nCapturing Sievierodonetsk and its twin city Lysychansk on the opposite bank of the Siverskyi Donets river would give Russia effective control of Luhansk province, a point at which the Kremlin might be able to declare some form of victory.\n\nBut by focusing its effort on a battle for the single small city \u2013 Sievierodonetsk housed only around 100,000 people before the war \u2013 Russia might be leaving other territory open to eventual Ukrainian counterstrikes.\n\nThe past few days have seen initial signs of a potential Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south, where Moscow is trying to consolidate its control of Kherson province, captured in the early weeks after it launched its invasion in February.\n\nKyiv says its forces pushed back Russian troops in recent days to defensive positions in three villages \u2013 Andriyivka, Lozove and Bilohorka \u2013 all located on the south bank of the Inhulets River that forms the border of Kherson.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War think tank said this Ukrainian counterattack so far did not appear likely to retake substantial territory in the near term, but could disrupt Russian operations and force Moscow to reinforce the area.\n\nJust to the north of the Kherson front, a suspected Russian strike damaged the centre of the Ukrainian-held town of Novyi Buh overnight, the town council said on Telegram.\n\nRussia said it had also struck a shipyard in Mykolayiv, a major Ukrainian-held port just west of Kherson.\n\nSeparately, French Foreign Affairs Minister Catherine Colonna was due to meet Zelenskiy in Kyiv later on Monday to offer more support, the French foreign affairs ministry said.\n\nThe Ukrainian government urged the West to provide more longer-range weapons to turn the tide in the war, now in its fourth month.

More than 14 million people have fled their homes, with towns and cities reduced to rubble.\n\nThe fighting is now focused on the Donbas \u2013 the mining belt made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
