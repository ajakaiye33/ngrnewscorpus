          "title": "APC should be ashamed of damage done to Nigeria, says Dele Momodu",
          "text": "A presidential hopeful, Dele Momodu, has said members of the ruling All Progressives Congress should be ashamed of the damage they have done to the country.\n\nAccording to him, they can\u2019t be rescued from the judgment of God for plunging the country and its people into unprecedented misery and penury.\n\nThis is as he lamented the gross incompetence and ineptitude of the current administration which he said was exceptionally high on promises but abysmally low on deliverables and performances.\n\nUrging the main opposition, the Peoples Democratic Party, to make him the party\u2019s flagbearer in the 2023 presidential election, Momodu stated that what Nigeria needs is a fresh leader without all the baggage, misadventure, mishaps and failures of the past.\n\nHe said this in a statement issued on Tuesday, titled \u2018Dele Momodu Asks APC To Apologise To Nigerians.\u2019\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cNigeria is at crossroads and things can no longer continue as business as usual. No God-fearing citizen can excuse and readily dismiss the gross incompetence and ineptitude of a ruling government that was exceptionally high on promises but abysmally low on deliverables and performances. Nigeria deserves massive apologies from the APC apparatchiks who should be ashamed of the magnitude of damage they have wreaked on our long-suffering nation. No amount of fanciful diction, deceptive sophistry, pedantic casuistry or mendacious demagoguery can rescue them from the judgment of God for plunging our country and its people into unprecedented misery and penury.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working hard and praying that our esteemed Party, PDP, and its members, most especially our super delegates, would resist all temptations from highest bidders and put country above pecuniary expectations, and deem it fit to give me the ticket to represent our Party at the forthcoming 2023 General Elections. We must demonstrate to Nigerians, and the world at large, that we are ready to offer our people a fresh beginning in a new world order propelled by education and knowledge.\u201d\n\nThe Ovation Magazine boss urged PDP political gladiators and juggernauts to stop flexing their muscles against one another and think not just about redeeming the lost glory of the party, and country, but also give thought to providing succour and comfort to the teeming masses of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBecoming President of Nigeria should not be about the promotion and elevation of self as a result of previous lengthy political appointments. Getting to be Nigeria\u2019s President should be a matter of offering oneself humbly and honourably in order to serve our Fatherland to the best of our abilities.\n\n\u201cWhat Nigeria needs is a fresh leader, someone shorn of all the baggage, misadventure, mishaps and failures of the past. A charismatic leader and bridge-builder, with global experience and exposure, capable of assembling and commanding a combined and novel team of technocrats and politicians whose sole desire is to change their country for the better, rather than for self-aggrandisement and pillaging. This is the kind of President that is required to lead our country out of the drudgery and doldrums. I believe that I am that person and Leader.\n\n\u201cOur people truly have hope for a better future. They know that this will not come from a rehash or regurgitation of the same old wine in new bottles. They want real change. I have been a change agent most of my adult life. I believe that in the same vein, our reinvigorated Party should entrust me with the role of the change catalyst in Nigeria. I am new and untainted and primed for this task. Together, our future is bright and assured.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Suspended Kano anti-graft boss alleges threat to life",
          "text": "The suspended Chairman of Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-corruption Commission, Barr. Muhuyi Rimingado, has alerted Nigerians to alleged threats to his life and that of his family members.\n\nThis is as he also sought protection against what he described as \u201cunwarranted persecution and harassment\u201d of his person, family, and associates by the Nigerian Police Force in concert with the Kano State Government.\n\nThese were contained in three separate petitions he addressed to the Chairman, Police Service Commission; the Executive Secretary, National Human Rights Commission; and the Inspector General of Police.\n\nA copy of the petition dated April 4, 2022, was obtained by our correspondent.\n\nThe 23-paged document, including evidential annexures, is entitled: \u201cComplaint against the incessant politically motivated persecutions by the Kano State Police Commissioner at the instigation of Kano State Government to me, my immediate family and associates\u201d.\n\nIn the petition, Rimingado now a governorship aspirant in the state on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, chronicled what led to his suspension from office on July 5, 2021, by the state Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, up to his current travails.\n\nHe claimed that the State Government is using the Commissioner of Police, Sama\u2019ila Dikko, to allegedly \u201cpersecute, harass, blackmail, intimidate and threaten his life, family and associates for refusing to do the government bid while in office\u201d.\n\nThe petition read, \u201cMy name is Muhuyi Magaji Rimin Gado. I am one time Vice Chairman of Rimin Gado Local Government Council, the immediate past Chairman of Kano State Public Complaint and Anti-Corruption Commission, and now a gubernatorial aspirant under the platform of PDP.\n\n\u201cI wish to report that since my suspension on the 5th of July 2021, I experience a dramatic shift from the hitherto cordial relationship between me and Mr Samaila Dikko to that of a hostile agent of witchhunt and blackmail based on many facts.\u201d\n\nRimingado, therefore, appealed to the authorities to dispassionately take the following actions based on his submission:\n\n\u201c1. Cause an investigation to be conducted on the circumstance that led to the siege at his house is a peace-loving citizen and who always answer police invitation even though phone calls during weekends, in the night and without following due police protocol. This will prevent criminals from taking advantage of this deviation to perpetrate heinous crimes against innocent citizens by disguising themselves as law enforcement officers.\n\n\u201c2. Since the alleged offence of forgery against me was said to have been committed in Abuja, the appropriate office to handle and investigate or prosecute the matter where necessary is Abuja. And since the Kano State Police Commissioner is not ready to allow due process of law to take its course, \u201cI, therefore, appeal to your good office and conscience in the interest of justice and equity direct that the investigation against me from Kano be transferred to appropriate formation in Abuja, which is better placed with jurisdiction to try the alleged offence.\n\n\u201cSir, I once more, appeal to your good office for prompt action on my complaint against unwarranted persecution, harassment, blackmail, intimidation, and threats to life.\n\n\u201cI count on your positive intervention, please,\u201d he stated.\n\nMeanwhile, Rimingado had also reported a fresh attack on his Sharada residence early Monday, April 11, 2022, by suspicious police agents.\n\nAccording to him, the police commissioner has compromised by carrying out a hatchet job of intimidating him and his family and attempting to arrest him despite a court action and necessary services having been effected on the police.\n\n\u2018\u2019Look as I speak with you, a case is before a Federal High Court in Kano with a motion for stay of execution on a judgment, and the matter has been adjourned to June 3rd. Similarly, a notice of appeal from the Court of Appeal has been served on the police. So why the siege on my house and why would the police be acting on a matter that is still before the court,\u201d he asked?\n\n\u201dIf for any reason, my attention is needed, why would the police not invite me rather than laying ambush for me and intimidating my family,\u201d he told newsmen who called to confirm the latest incident,\u201d Rimingado said in the petition.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We are no longer informed about the court trial proceedings.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s frustrations arose from different recorded audio conversations with the investigating police officer, IPO, at the Delta Command headquarters, Asaba, who cunningly employed assorted tricks to make the family part with money to charter vehicle and convey the suspects to court, register the charge in court, arrest the prime suspect and same monetary demand made by police officers at the office of Assistant Inspector-General of Police, AIG, Zone 5, Benin City, Edo State.\n\nLack of funds\n\nIn one encounter, the IPO had told the elder brother of the deceased, Ese Komone: \u201cWe are set to go to court and it is because Eunice is not available that we have not been able to do so. I (IPO) do not have money to charter a vehicle, we are coming from Asaba to Oleh court. Then from court, we are carrying them to prison again tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I needed cash urgently to run all those things, to register charge and the rest of them. From the day you reached here (Asaba) till today, have you come again? We are talking about how we can get to court now. I expected you to ask how we are going to raise some money now to enable us go to court. You are asking if they have arrested so and so person,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a more revealing conversation with Eunice when she expressed difficulty in raising cash, the IPO had retorted: \u201cSo how do we take the boys to Oleh now? So we (police) will fly from here to court? And same people (victim\u2019s family) who cannot raise one kobo now to carry these two boys who killed your sister to court, are asking us why we have not gone to Ohoro from Asaba to arrest more suspects.\n\n\u201cIs it fair? Are you people not checking it? That we should look for money somewhere to charter a vehicle to go to Oleh court. I have never heard this type of thing before, telling me you are not able to get a place to raise money for us to charter a vehicle. Okay, no problem, thank you.\u201d From that moment, the IPO stopped giving the family situation reports on the case,\u201d he added.\n\nSuspect exonerates another suspect\n\nCommissioner of Police, Delta Command, Ari Muhammed Ali, while parading Onoriode Simon Akpoavirhi, last year at Asaba, had said the prime suspect (fondly called Onos) killed Pat in connivance with one Akpoghene Shoemaker \u2018m\u2019, now at large. However, police later apprehended the said shoemaker, now also in custody with Onos.\n\nBut, in an audio conversation with the victim\u2019s relative one of the days they were brought to appear in an Oleh court, Onos absolved Shoemaker of participation in the killing of Patience, saying:\u201dOur IPO dey delay. The man wey send us to kill that woman so, I know where he dey. Dem no wan make we go there. This man na Lucky. This woman (Patience) na me dey carry her since last year for this pepper business. Na me and Lucky kill her. Dis boy (Shoemaker) no dey. Na vigilante call him name.\u201d\n\nEse, victim\u2019s elder brother said: \u201cI will not be surprised if Onos says the Umeh Vigilante Head knows what transpired. Even when residents were saying they last saw Patience on bike being driven by the prime suspect, who regularly carries her whenever she goes to Umeh, the vigilante head warned us to leave and stop coming during our search for her. He said our sister was not missing in Umeh and we were giving the community bad name.\n\nHe threatened to attack us before Onos was caught in the village.\u201d\n\nAt Zone 5, Police asked for N150, 000 to commence action\n\nShut out on the case by the police at Asaba, victim\u2019s family accepted when a community-based organisation, advocating Urhobo and Isoko unity, led by a former Delta State Assembly member, volunteered to transfer the case to the Benin Zonal Command in a bid to get justice, albeit pro-bono.\n\nEse narrated: \u201cBased on a petition we were not shown, but they said to have written, this group called through the former lawmaker, a lawyer, one day, around October, to say myself and two other family members needed to travel to Benin to start pursuing our case from Zone 5. They said because of the uncooperative manner of those in-charge at Asaba, they were petitioning Zone 5 to take the case over and arrest the suspect at large.\n\n\u201cAt Benin, we were asked to give N150,000 for them to handle our case. The family raised N50,000 and the peace organisation was to make up the balance. That was how the Benin move ended, again, on another note of disappointment. When we called to know what was happening again, they (police) said they were not disposed because those assigned to the case had been drafted to Anambra on election duty. That was the end of the story.\u201d\n\nEx-lawmaker/mediator riled\n\nCorroborating the family experience at Zone 5, the lawyer and former lawmaker, who had mediated between the family and police, stated: \u201cThe family will tell you what was expended the first day on the trip, from the cab hired to take them to Benin, money I paid the lawyer in their presence at ShopRite and the amount I transferred to the police, who initially rejected the case before they eventually took their statements.\u201d\n\nGbemre slams police\n\nSocial justice advocate and Coordinator, Niger-Delta Peace Coalition, Zik Gbemre, who has been monitoring the case of the murder of Patience, on a note of disappointment, said: \u201cWhen we started noticing the desperation to extort the family, we rightly notified the Commissioner of Police. Initially, he was very responsive to the concerns we raised, including our appeal that the detained suspects should not be arraigned immediately until the alleged sponsor was apprehended.\n\n\u201cHe did transfer the case from Oleh to a new team at Asaba. Unfortunately, those assigned in Asaba were even more arrogant and abusive in their demand for gratification. Nigeria is highly corrupt, we know, including the police. But it is hard to imagine the extent some people can drive corruption. An innocent woman selling pepper to train her only child whose father had earlier passed on, was brutally murdered,\u201d he intoned.\n\nWe\u2019ve charged case to court \u2013 PPRO\n\nWhen contacted for update on the matter, Police Public Relations Officer, Delta Command, Edafe Bright, simply told NDV: \u201cThat matter was charged to court.\u201d",

          "text": "There are indications that members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria ( IMN ) also known as \u201cShi\u2019ites\u2019 may be gearing up for another showdown with the Federal Government as they have continued to lament the seizure of the passports of their leader, Ibraheem El-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenah.\n\nThe sect has raised an alarm that their leader\u2019s health and that of his wife were deteriorating, alleging that the government was deliberately holding back their travel documents for no justifiable reason.\n\nThe group took to a statement signed by Mukhtar Abdurrahman Auwal on behalf of the Academic Forum of the movement to lament what they described as an injustice to their principal.\n\n\u201cThe international passports of the cleric and that of his wife have been seized for almost nine ( 9 ) months after the court have discharged and acquitted them of eight counts charge bordering on alleged culpable homicide, unlawful assembly, disruption of the public peace, among others.\n\nSome of the members who staged a peaceful protest in front of the National Human Rights Commission ( NHRC ) building in Abuja, urged the agency to prevail on the government and\n\nrelevant security bodies to release their passport and allow the couple go for medical treatment abroad.\n\nThey told Nigerians and the international community to hold President Muhammadu Buhari responsible if anything untoward befalls the couple.\n\nIn the statement, the sect members insisted that they would not fold their hands while the rights of their leader is violated, vowing to return to the streets until their demands are met.\n\nThe statement read in part \u201d It is pertinent for the public to note that the freedom of Sheikh El-Zakzaky and his wife is still being denied. Isn\u2019t it such flagrant abuse of their fundamental rights to life? General Buhari would definitely be held responsible for anything that befalls the couple; and certainly, we cannot afford to sit at home while the rights of our leader are being abused.\n\n\u201cAfter patiently waiting for 9 months, we have no option but to return to the streets of Abuja, to protest this unholy conspiracy.\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing, we demand the unconditional release of the couple\u2019s international\u201d.\n\nRecall that the Shi\u2019ite movement which has been proscribed by the Nigerian government constituted public disturbance in the nation\u2019s capital in the better part of 2019 and 2020.\n\nMost of their protests were premised on the alleged unlawful detention of their leader, Ibraheem El-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenah in the correctional facility of government for several months.",

He briefed us on his reasons, his thinking and his message.\n\n\u201cAll the governors in attendance graciously came to listen to him. He acknowledged the role of the governors in the last convention of our party, where, according to him, they steadied the party by helping in the evolution of the leadership that is accepted and widely acknowledged as that which we wish for our party.\n\n\u201cWe appreciated him, and his message and we will discuss the message at one of our forum meetings.\u201d\n\nThe PGF chairman faulted the insinuation that the ambition of Tinubu and Osinbajo may be putting the governors in a tight corner. Rather, he said their aspirations have further thrown up the party as a choice party parading competent aspirants.\n\nBagudu stressed: \u201cOn the contrary, we appreciate our party because it has become a party that has endeared itself to Nigerians. We have many brilliant people in our party, some serving and some not serving. The fact that we have people in our party that express a desire to lead the party into the highest office in electoral contests shows how much our party has resonated with Nigerians and our members.\n\n\u201cFor us, it is a hallmark of success that people are showing interest. But, at the end of the day and because they are leaders of the party, they will always put the party\u2019s interest at heart.\u201d\n\nOn the possibility of the party adopting a consensus candidate as its presidential standard-bearer, the PGF Chairman said the party would adopt the best option, insisting that the APC would always go for the best.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget that in the 2015 presidential election primary, President Buhari contested against several others and it was a beautiful contest. There is nothing wrong. Members of the party always want to see consensus if it is possible. But, we are a democratic party.\n\n\u201cIn our last convention, we had consensus in some of the offices and election in some others. There is always misrepresentation of consensus as if people are being snowballed into positions they would rather not take.\u201d\n\nThe former Lagos State governor, who had informed President Muhammadu Buhari about his intention, also embarked on extensive consultations with party stakeholders nationwide.\n\nApart from meeting traditional rulers and opinion leaders in the Southwest, he has met members of the APC National Assembly caucus, Northern monarchs and religious leaders.",

          "text": "\u202278 given mass burial amid fear of further attacks\n\n\u2022Defend yourselves, ECWA charges Nigerians\n\nSeriki Adinoyi\n\n\n\nBloodthirsty terrorists have killed 80 persons and abducted 70 others after an invasion of some communities in Plateau State. The villages, which were attacked on Sunday, included Kukawa, Gyambawu, Dungur, Kyaram, Yelwa, Dadda, Wanka, Shuwaka, Gwammadaji, and Dadin Kowa.\n\nRegrettably, while terrorists soiled the state in blood and danger, Plateau State Governor, Mr. Simon Lalong, was busy in Abuja holding political meetings with a former Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Bola Tinubu, over the latter\u2019s presidential ambition. Observers said this was a reflection of the growing insensitivity of the country\u2019s political leaders.\n\nAs the security situation across the country continued to deteriorate, with lives and livelihoods being helplessly ruined, the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) charged Nigerians to defend themselves from attackers. The charge was contained in a communiqu\u00e9 by ECWA President, Rev. Stephen Panya, and General Secretary, Rev. Yunusa Nmadu, at the end of the 69th General Church Council meeting held at the church headquarters in Jos, Plateau State.\n\nLalong, it was gathered, was the only governor that attended the presidential declaration by Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Amaechi, on Saturday.\n\nAs the governor was attending meetings with Tinubu, alongside other governors, 78 victims of the terrorist attack on the villages in Kanam Local Government Area were being buried in mass graves in their respective communities amid wailing by loved ones and the villagers. Lalong sat pretty at Kebbi Governor\u2019s Lodge to listen to Tinubu speak on his presidential interest.\n\nSome of the residents of the communities, who escaped the attacks, expressed worries that terrorists now lived around them, and called on the government and security agencies to come to their rescue.\n\nOne resident, who preferred anonymity for security reasons, said, \u201cIt is sad that innocent persons were killed without any form of provocation. We no longer feel safe in our homes and communities. We appeal to President Muhammadu Buhari, Governor Simon Lalong, and security operatives to come to our rescue.\u201d\n\nThe villagers narrated that the terrorists invaded their communities on motor bikes in large numbers and shot sporadically, killing and maiming residents of seven communities.\n\nThough presence of security forces has increased, villagers were however seen fleeing the communities for fear of subsequent attacks.\n\nIndigenes in the villages that were attacked said they recovered over 80 corpses from the attacks, adding that more corpses were still being recovered from the neighbouring bushes.\n\nA source from the communities, Mr. Fanya Ali, said, 70 persons might have been abducted, as their whereabouts remained unknown. Ali added that at least 80 houses were burnt.\n\nAli said 36 persons were killed in Kukawa, 27 in Gyambau, 11 in Wanka, and eight in Kyaram. He added that the figures from the other villages were yet to be obtained.\n\nAccording to Ali, many of the injured victims have been admitted at Dengi General Hospital and Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH).\n\nAnother eyewitness, Sariki Bitrus, said many women and children were missing, fearing the terrorists may have abducted them. Bitrus lamented that the people were in dire need of assistance as they have been displaced from their homes.\n\nLamenting the attack, Plateau Elders Forum, in a statement signed by Mr. Jonathan Ishaku, said it was shocked by the heinous assault on the innocent people of Kanam Local Government Area.\n\nIshaku stated, \u201cJust within a week of our press release, in which we condemned terrorist attacks on Miango villages in Bassa Local Government Area and Rantis in Barkin Ladi Local Government Area, bandits have allegedly killed several persons, wounded many and abducted over 70 in Kanam Local Government Area yesterday.\n\n\u201cThis is again very sad and we strongly condemn it. This seeming escalation of violence on our communities further justifies the earlier call the Plateau Elders Forum made on the Plateau State Government, in conjunction with the security forces, to deal drastically with terrorists in the state.\n\n\u201cThe security forces should ensure the immediate rescue of all abducted persons.\u201d\n\nThe member representing Pankshin/Kanke/Kanam Federal Constituency of Plateau State in the House of Representatives, Mr. Yusuf Adamu Gagdi, described the attack as an annihilation scheme. Gagdi commiserated with the victims.\n\nThe lawmaker, who was in Madina for lesser Hajj, called for immediate military presence in the affected communities and those bordering them in order to arrest the surging activities of bandits in his constituency. He expressed worry over the federal government\u2019s negligence and failure to provide security for Plateau communities, despite intelligence reports by the Department of State Services (DSS) about the influx of criminal elements into the state and some neighbouring states.\n\nGagdi stated, \u201cThe federal government, which has exclusive control of security apparatus in the country, has woefully failed in its primary responsibility of protecting lives and property of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHe expressed outrage at the devastating state of security in the country, arguing that somebody has been negligent in the discharge of his duties to Nigerians. He maintained that it was high time the federal government owned up to its inability to discharge this sacrosanct duty it owed Nigerians.\n\nGagdi advised citizens within the boundary communities, particularly in Wase and Kanam local government areas of the state, to be on the alert, as fleeing bandits from Zamfara and other North-west states had been traced to camps within the forests in the local government areas.\n\nMeanwhile, the Plateau State government, in a statement yesterday warned that the state would not be a haven for terrorists and other criminals fleeing from other parts of the country. The statement quoted Lalong as urging the security agencies to go after the terrorists.\n\nThe statement signed by Lalong\u2019s media aide, Makut Macham, said the governor expressed regrets over the dastardly act, saying he has directed security forces to dominate the area after their initial response that put a stop to the carnage.\n\nIt said the State Security Council had adopted far-reaching measures to strengthen security by enhancing the capacity of the security agencies to respond to all situations that cause a breach of the peace in any part of the state.\n\nThe statement also said Lalong sympathised with the communities affected, and promised them justice, saying those behind the attacks would not be allowed to go without punishment. He directed the State Emergency Management Agency and the Peace Building Agency to immediately visit the affected areas, assess the situation, and provide relief as well as trauma management.\n\nThe governor added that the state had already approached the federal government for collaboration to deal with the terrorists hibernating in the general area, once and for all, to enable people go about their legitimate businesses without molestation and harassment.\n\nThe spokesman of the state Police Command, Mr. Ubah Gabriel, said the police could not confirm the figure of casualties at the moment. Gabriel said, \u201cOur men have been there since yesterday combing the forests around affected communities. I would give you the full details of the casualties as soon as get it.\u201d\n\nDefend Yourselves, ECWA Charges Nigerians\n\nAmid the deteriorating security situation across the country, the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) charged Nigerians to defend themselves from attackers. This was contained in a communiqu\u00e9 signed by ECWA President, Rev. Stephen Panya, and General Secretary, Rev. Yunusa Nmadu, at the end of the 69th General Church Council meeting held at the church headquarters in Jos, the Plateau State capital.\n\nOn the unremitting killings and abductions of citizens in Kaduna, Kebbi, Zanfara, Plateau, Niger and other states of the country, ECWA called on government to arrest the situation.\n\nIt decried the failure of government to carry out its constitutional responsibility of securing the lives and property of its citizens, despite the huge amounts being spent on security. ECWA called on all tiers of government to do all they could to secure the release of innocent citizens still being held by terrorists and bandits across Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the council, \u201cit is very worrisome that Nigeria today has continued to witness the increasing activities of radical Islamic terrorist groups, which include Fulani Jihadist militia, Boko Haram, ISWAP, and bandits terrorising the country under the watch of this government, and government is not doing enough to stop it, It\u2019s really unfortunate.\u201d\n\nIn the communiqu\u00e9, the church expressed worry over the deplorable condition of infrastructure in the country as well as forceful occupation of ancestral lands by terrorists. It called on government to ensure that Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) returned to their homes and given farming tools to enable them continue their occupations.\n\nThe council also called on government to intensify efforts towards salvaging Nigeria, adding that the rising wave of corruption and the near total collapse of the economy has left Nigerians struggling for survival.\n\nThe church called on the federal government and striking labour unions, especially the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and Non-academic Staff Union of Education and Associated Institutions (NASU), to put the interest of the nation first and resolve the industrial crisis as soon as possible.\n\nECWA expressed concern over the biting hunger among Nigerians due to the shortage of food supply as a result of insecurity that had paralysed the activities of farmers. It noted with concern the increasing rate of unemployment and called on members of the church to shun political apathy and actively join political parties of their choice to help in building the country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Blames difficult model adopted by DPR for slow progress\n\n\u2022$3bn oil theft in Niger Delta criminal, horrific, says Komolafe\n\n\u2022 Insists security of oil assets outside NUPRC\u2019s mandate\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Funmi Ogundare in Lagos\n\n\n\nAs Nigeria continues to struggle to increase its daily crude oil production, the Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) Mr. Gbenga Komolafe, yesterday said the agency was targeting the first half of 2022 for marginal field awardees to begin drilling in an effort to find their \u201cfirst oil.\u201d\n\nHe said this while speaking on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 monitored on ARISE News Channel.\n\nThe process which commenced in 2020 had been bogged down by bureaucratic challenges, meaning that the actual drilling for oil has yet to effectively take off over a year after the awardees were officially handed award certificates.\n\nOn May 30, 2021, the then Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) had announced the conclusion of the exercise, the first since 2003, with the presentation of letters to the bid winners in Abuja by the industry regulator.\n\nThe regulator had put up 57 marginal fields spanning land, swamp and offshore for lease, with 161 companies eventually shortlisted to advance to the final stage from 591 entities that applied for pre-qualification.\n\nThe Head of the DPR, which has now transformed into NUPRC, Sarki Auwalu, had at the time, stated that the exercise was worth roughly $500 million in signature bonuses.\n\nHowever, a number of the award winners, had decried the slow turn of events, stressing that they had continued to pay heavy interests on the loans that were borrowed to pay for the transactions, despite that the loans have been unproductive for over a year.\n\nBut Komolafe, while responding to a question regarding the issue of the 2020 marginal fields award, said although the commission inherited a difficult situation, it expects that by the first half (H1) of this year, all the issues would be sorted out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical because one of our cardinal objectives is to ensure that we increase the national oil production and of course, we realise that the fields will actually help in enhancing that.\n\n\u201cWe took the issue frontally. It\u2019s really been very challenging to handle the issue in the sense that the model used poses serious challenges to bringing the matter to an end quickly.\n\n\u201cBut I want to assure Nigerians and indeed the awardees that we have been able to, as I speak, tried to bring the issue to a manageable state and device a strategy for bringing the challenge to a close.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we have had over 80 per cent compliance in terms of payment. In fact, one of the challenges we\u2019ve had is that even in forming the SPVs , they are still having challenges working together because of the nature of the model used.\n\n\u201cBut by and large, I want to say that we as a commission, we will learn from this experience, and I want to assure Nigeria that the next marginal bid will definitely not be bogged down by these kind of challenges we experienced in managing the fallout of the 2020 marginal field.\n\n\u201cBefore the first half of the year, we want to see a situation where some of the awardees will be proceeding to field development plan. At the moment again, we have recorded close to 90 per cent of the co-awardees forming their SPV and at that stage, it is the very comfortable stage when the commission can go ahead to issue Petroleum Prospecting Licences (PPLs),\u201d he explained.\n\nKomolafe described the massive theft of crude oil in the Niger Delta as criminal and horrific, stating that while over $2 billion worth of oil was estimated to have been illegally siphoned in 2021, when added to the first quarter of 2022, it may have climbed beyond $3 billion.\n\nRecently, the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Godwin Emefiele, who spoke at the end of the 284th monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting in Abuja, had blamed the trend of oil theft for the inability of Nigeria to meet its oil production quota.\n\nDescribing the situation as unprecedented, he stated that the occurrence had had a debilitating effect on government revenue and accretion to reserves, adding that the global prices have gone up and are compounded by the shortage of supply of petroleum products.\n\nOn their part, the association of indigenous exploration and production companies, the Independent Petroleum Producers Group (IPPG) recently put it succinctly when it described the occurrence as an \u201cexistential threat.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman, IPPG, Mr. Abdulrasaq Isa, speaking at the 5th Nigeria International Energy Summit (NIES) had said the challenge should be tackled before it finally kills the sector.\n\nAlso, weeks ago, Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company (AEEPCO), operators of the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL) pipeline, threatened to exit the facility due to incessant vandalism, sabotage and outright theft.\n\nIn the same vein, THISDAY reported a Co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Seplat Energy Plc, Mr. Austin Avuru as recently calling for a state of emergency in the Nigerian oil and gas sector, revealing that up to 80 per cent of oil pumped in the country, particularly in the East, is stolen.\n\nAvuru\u2019s comments came days after a businessman and Chairman Heirs Holdings, Mr. Tony Elumelu, similarly bemoaned the worsening state of the industry, stressing that about 95 per cent of oil production does not get to the terminal.\n\nLast week, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, warned that Nigeria might go bankrupt if the trend is not checked.\n\nHe also raised concerns over the country\u2019s economic future, warning that Nigeria\u2019s debt to service revenue ratio might pose danger for decades to come.\n\nContinuing, Komolafe stated that it was not the duty of the commission to secure government oil and gas assets, saying the organisation does not, \u201cregulate\u201d criminal activities.\n\n\u201cThe commission does not regulate criminals, that\u2019s not the mandate of the agency. It does not actually extend to dealing with criminal. We do not have the abrasive or the coercive machinery to subdue criminals. Our mandate actually covers technical and commercial regulatory functions,\u201d he argued.\n\nKomolafe noted that whatever affects the oil sector affects the health of the entire nation, reiterating that the upstream and downstream parts of the industry are facing challenges at the moment.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re witnessing has reached a very alarming situation, a very horrific situation,\u201d he lamented.\n\nAccording to him, getting investors to put their hard-earned money into the sector has been very difficult with the existing harsh conditions , including the theft of the commodity by saboteurs. \u201cIt is worrisome due to the activities of these criminals,\u201d he lamented.\n\nBy rough estimates , the NUPRC had said that Nigeria lost more than 115,000 barrels per day (bpd) to oil theft and vandalism between January 2021 and February 2022.\n\nKomolafe reiterated that the NUPRC had established a panel to audit the activities of operators in the upstream sector to ascertain the actual volume of oil lost to the menace.\n\nThe commission\u2019s chief executive further pushed back on insinuations that the Timipre Sylva-led steering committee was slowing down work on the commencement of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), saying that the collaboration has been seamless.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022I\u2019ve insight to complete what APC has started, vice president declares\n\n\u2022TSG: It\u2019s a betrayal of trust\n\n\u2022APC Govs: We appreciate the devt\n\n\u2022Bagudu: APC may opt for consensus candidate for presidency\n\nDeji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja, Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi and Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\n\n\nObviously not expecting one of his political mentees to challenge him to a presidential contest, former Lagos State governor and frontline presidential hopeful, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, yesterday, denied Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as a political son, declaring he has no son grown enough to declare for president.\n\nBut Osinbajo, who announced his intention to succeed his current principal, President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, through a short video uploaded on various social media platforms, said his over seven years of working with Buhari had provided him requisite insights to complete what the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) had started.\n\nThe announcement came as the Tinubu Support Group (TSG) described Osinbajo\u2019s presidential declaration as a betrayal of trust.\n\nHowever, Chairman of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) and governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, described as a welcome development the fact that Osinbajo and Tinubu were seeking to be president of Nigeria. Bagudu said it was an indication of a robust democratic contest within a party that had endeared itself to Nigerians.\n\nThe PGF chairman also stated that APC might settle for the consensus method in the choice of its presidential candidate.\n\nTinubu met with about 12 APC governors at Kebbi State Governor\u2019s Lodge in Asokoro, Abuja, a few hours after the governors\u2019 meeting with Osinbajo at his official residence inside Aso Rock, at the start of the vice president\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nFielding questions from journalists after the meeting, an apparent knee-jerk response to the vice president\u2019s deft pioneering meeting with the APC governors, Tinubu denied Osinbajo outright.\n\nAsked about the declaration of the vice president, a development many of Tinubu\u2019s loyalists reckoned should not have happened, Tinubu declared, \u201cI don\u2019t have a son grown enough to declare\u201d for the office of president.\n\nThe APC leader, who said he met with the governors of his party to seek their support for his ambition, said, \u201cMy mission here is to seek collaboration, support and encouragement of my party, the APC, for my ambition to become the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as replacement for President Muhammadu Buhari after his tenure.\u201d\n\nTinubu\u2019s denial of his erstwhile political prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is a clear indication that the battle line is drawn between both men, and the battle may get more intense and messier in the period ahead.\n\nHowever, speaking earlier, Bagudu described the competitive situation in the party as a welcome development. He said Tinubu told the APC governors about his intention to vie for the presidency in 2023.\n\nBagudu said, \u201cAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, this morning, met members of the Progressive Governors Forum, where he stated what he has made public already \u2013 his intention to seek the office of the president come 2023, which he has already announced publicly. He briefed us on his reasons, his thinking and his message.\u201d\n\nBagudu said Tinubu acknowledged the role of the governors in the last convention of the party, where they helped to steady the party and produce a leadership accepted and widely acknowledged.\n\n\u201cWe appreciated his message and we will definitely discuss the message at one of our meetings,\u201d Bagudu added.\n\nAsked if Osinbajo and Tinubu\u2019s ambitions had put the governors in a tight corner, Bagudu said the governors appreciated the development, because it was an indication that the ruling party had endeared itself to Nigerians.\n\nHe stated, \u201cOn the contrary, we appreciate our party, because it has become a party that has endeared itself to Nigerians. We have many brilliant people in our party, some serving and some not serving.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have people in our party that express desire to lead the party into the highest office in an electoral contest shows how much this our party has resonated with Nigerians and our party members.\n\n\u201cFor us, it is a hallmark of success that people are showing interest, but at the end of the day, and because they are leaders of the party, they will always put the party\u2019s interest at heart.\u201d\n\nOn suggestions that APC might adopt a consensus candidate for the presidency, Bagudu stressed that the governors would always encourage the party to go for the best.\n\nHe said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget that in the 2015 presidential election primary, President Buhari contested against several others and it was a beautiful contest. There is nothing wrong. Members of the party always want to see consensus if it is possible, but we are a democratic party.\n\n\u201cIn our last convention, we had consensus in some of the offices and election in some others. There is always misrepresentation of consensus as if people are being snowballed into positions they would rather not take.\n\n\u201cAPC has done well as a party, President Buhari has led the party ably well and we believe strongly that come 2023, Nigerians will see another President of the APC extraction.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo officially declared his intention to run for president in 2023, yesterday, after meeting some APC governors at his official residence, Akinola Aguda House, within the precincts of the State House.\n\nIn the announcement video posted on his verified Twitter handle and other media platforms, including television, radio and social media platforms, Osinbajo promised to use his seven years insight and experience as the vice president to complete all that the Buhari-led APC government started at the centre since May 2015.\n\nAccording to him, if given the opportunity to lead Nigeria, his experience, insights and opportunities would be used for the benefit of Nigeria and Nigerians.\n\nHe claimed to have practically been to all the local governments in the country and had taken time to listen to the diverse experiences and yearnings of the people.\n\nVowing to transform the security architecture, agriculture and all other sectors for the betterment of the country, Osinbajo assured the citizens that he would build a Nigeria, where everywhere would be home for everyone.\n\nHe sought the support of all Nigerians to be their president in the next political dispensation.\n\nListing some of the challenges he intended to fix, if elected in 2023, the vice president said, \u201cIn this period of seven years, I have served the government in several capacities, and I have, at the direction of Mr. President, represented our country in sensitive high-level international engagements. If by the grace of God and the will of the people, I am given the opportunity, then, I believe that, first, we must complete what we have started:\n\n\u201cRadically transforming our security and intelligence architecture; completing the reform of our justice system, focusing on adequate remuneration and welfare of judicial personnel; ensuring justice for all and the observance of rule of law; rapidly advancing our infrastructure development, especially power, roads, railways and broadband connectivity.\n\n\u201cProviding an excellent environment for businesses to thrive, taking the agriculture revolution to the next level especially, mechanisation and developing the farm to table value chain, making sure that the government, its agencies and regulators serve the business community, creating a tech economy that will provide jobs for millions;\n\n\u201cEnhancing our Social Investment Programme to a full scale social welfare scheme, completing the promise of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty within this decade, completing the task of ensuring that all Nigerians, male and female, attend school, reforming our educational system for relevance to the challenges of this century.\n\n\u201cCompleting the task of universal health coverage for all, and strengthening the capacity of states and local governments to deliver on their respective mandates. Above all, front and centre of our efforts will be the provision of jobs and opportunities for our young people.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo added, \u201cWe will, working together, establish by the grace of God, the Nigeria of our dreams in a few short years. We will build on the foundation laid by our predecessors. We will need to move, with much speed, intentionality, and perseverance, towards the vision of a prosperous, stable, and secure nation. I am convinced beyond doubt, that, we have the creativity, the courage, the talent, and the resources to be the foremost black nation on earth.\n\n\u201cLet us now birth the expectations of greatness conceived generations before us. Let us build a Nigeria, where the man from Nnewi sees the man in Gusau as his brother; where the woman in Warri sees the woman in Jalingo as her sister; where the love of our nation burns alike in the hearts of boys and girls from Gboko to Yenogoa.\n\n\u201cWhere everywhere, in this land, is home for everyone, where our diversities, tribes and faiths unite, rather than divide us. Let our tribes become one tribe; the Nigerian tribe, where all are treated fairly, justly and with respect. Where all are given equal access to the abundant opportunities that God has bestowed on this nation. It\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Head of Media, Tinubu Support Group (TSG), Mr. Tosin Adeyanju, while reacting to Osinbajo\u2019s declaration, said, \u201cHis declaration is a welcome development but a betrayal of trust to the political family he belongs to. However, he does not portend any threat to our camp.\n\n\u201cOur eyes are on the ball and we are counting our numbers. Our consultation continues, as our principal is meeting with governors of the party.\u201d\n\nAdeyanju stressed that Osinbajo\u2019s declaration would further strengthen internal democracy as party members look forward to a transparent primary.\n\n\u201cWe are ready for primaries with any interested person, because our principal is a true democrat,\u201d he said\n\nGroup Commends Osinbajo for Declaring Presidential Bid\n\nA group, Osinbajo Volunteer Movement (OVM), commended the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, for making public his intention to contest for the position of president in 2023. The group said Osinbajo was the right man for the job.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the group, Comrade Kalid Ibrahim, spoke to newsmen in Bauchi yesterday, shortly after a rally held in honour of the vice president. The OVM spokesman recalled how the group had earlier called on Osinbajo to declare interest in the presidency, which he finally yielded to.\n\nHe said Nigeria needed a leader, who was strong physically and intellectually to tackle the many challenges facing the country.\n\nIbrahim stated, \u201cWe are very happy over the official declaration made by the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, to contest for the office of the president come 2023.We are supporting him, because he is mentally fit, has exceptional leadership qualities, and possesses the technical know-how to transform this nation\n\n\u201cThe vice president has been part of this government for the past seven years, he is not a novice when it comes to affairs of this country. He is conversant with challenges facing this country. We are expecting him to consolidate on the work already laid down by President Muhammadu Buhari. This is the reason we are registering our support for him.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo\u2019s Chances Bright, Tinubu Should Allow Him Grow, Says Abba-Aji\n\nFormer Presidential Liaison Officer to the National Assembly, Senator Muhammad Abba-Aji, described as bright the chances of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, following his declaration to contest the 2023 presidency.\n\nAbba-Aji, a member of the Progressive Consolidation Group (PCG), a pro-Osinbajo lobby group, was the liaison officer to the National Assembly during tenures of the late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua and former President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nHe applauded the spontaneous nationwide celebrations that greeted Osinbajo\u2019s declaration for the 2023 presidency.\n\nAbba-Aji stated, \u201cI have been in politics since the early 80s and I can tell you that the Nigerian electorate is now much wiser, much more discerning and sophisticated than what you had in the past. The spontaneous rallies are a show of strength, asserting the power of the real people and it is a strong pointer to Professor Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s very bright chances for ultimate electoral victory.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju is a great leader of our party and his role in bringing about an Osinbajo vice presidency has been vindicated, having performed creditably, impressing President Buhari and millions of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWhen you have brought a great idea, you should allow such to grow and Vice President Osinbajo\u2019s declaration for the 2023 presidency is a reflection of very sound growth and the next step is for Osinbajo to assume the presidency in 2023.\u201d\n\nAbba-Aji added that Osinbajo had impressed Nigerians with his performance during the periods he acted as president.\n\n\u201cHis chances are very bright in the view of most people that I have interacted with. He is better than anyone else but we are in a democracy and others also have a right to present themselves and increase the choices available to the electorate,\u201d he said.\n\nEkiti Group Endorses Osinbajo, Says VP Better Than Tinubu\n\nA group, Osinbajo Grassroots Organisation, has begun mobilisation in Ekiti State for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, saying he is better than other contestants vying for the All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket, including Bola Tinubu.\n\nTo mobilise for Osinbajo, the group, yesterday, marched across the streets of Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, where vehicular and human movements were disrupted for several hours.\n\nIn their hundreds, members of the group chanted solidarity songs in support of the vice president, and moved from the popular Fajuyi park through Ijigbo area to APC secretariat in Ajilosun area, where they were received by the party officials.\n\nAddressing the crowd, leader of the group and a former House of Assembly member, Hon Femi Adeleye, saluted the vice president for accepting to contest the 2023 presidential poll. Adeleye said Osinbajo\u2019s competence and capability stood him out among the aspirants jostling for the nation\u2019s number one seat.\n\nThe former lawmaker noted that Osinbajo had in the last seven years demonstrated unmatched loyalty to the president and the party, saying this has made him acceptable to all Nigerians across party lines.\n\nAccording to him, the group and other citizens of the state would commence massive mobilisation to ensure Osinbajo wins the ticket of the APC, saying with him as the candidate, the party would not lose the presidential election.\n\nHe called on the party under the chairmanship of Abdullahi Adamu to consider picking the vice president as the presidential candidate of APC by all options available to the party.\n\nAdeleye stated, \u201cWe have been pressurising him in the last few years for him to contest. We even decided if he doesn\u2019t declare this week, we would have gone to court to compel him. It is on record that no other vice president in the history of modern Nigeria has had such a crisis-free, corruption-free, robust working relationship with his principal like Professor Osinbajo.\n\n\u201cToday, in Nigeria, Professor Osinbajo\u2019s name is synonymous with loyalty, trust, competence, capacity and faithfulness. He is the one with most capable credentials and disposition of taking Nigeria to the Promised Land. He has long been nurtured for the leadership role of president.\u201d\n\nBagudu: APC may opt for consensus candidate for presidency\n\nChairman of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), and Kebbi State governor, Atiku Bagudu, on Monday said the All Progressive Congress (APC) does not rule out the possibility of a consensus candidate among its Presidential aspirants.\n\n\u201cWe always encourage our party to go for the best. Don\u2019t forget that in the 2015 presidential election primary, President Buhari contested along with several others and it was a beautiful contest.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong. Members of the party always want to see consensus if it is possible, but we are a democratic party.\n\n\u201cIn our last convention, we had consensus in some of the offices and election in some others. There is always misrepresentation of consensus as if people are being snowballed into positions they would rather not take.\n\n\u201cAPC has done well as a party, President Buhari has led the party ably well and we believe strongly that come 2023, Nigerians will see another President of the APC extraction.\u201d\n\nBagudu spoke after former Lagos State governor Bola Tinubu, a Presidential aspirant, met with APC Governors behind closed doors at the Kebbi Lodge, Abuja, hours after vice president, Yemi Osinbajo formally declared his interest to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nGovernors at the meeting with Tinubu included Nasir El-Rufai (Kaduna), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos) Umaru Ganduje (Kano), Atiku Bagudu (Kebbi), Mai Mala Buni (Yobe), Mohammed Badaru Abubakar (Jigawa) and Dapo Abiodun (Ogun).\n\nOthers were Abudlrazaq Abdulrahman (Kwara), Hope Uzondinma (Imo), Abdullahi Sule (Nasarawa) and Isiaka Oyetola (Osun).\n\nAsides from Tinubu and Osinbajo, Minister for Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, former Governors Orji Uzor Kalu and Rochas Okorocha and serving governors of Kogi and Ebonyi states, Yahaya Bello and Dave Umahi are also seeking the ruling party\u2019s ticket.\n\nBagudu explained that the race for the Presidential ticket among the aspirants is a positive one for the party.\n\n\u201cIn fact, in the contrary, we appreciate our party because it has become a party that has endeared itself to Nigerians. We have many brilliant people in our party, some serving and some not serving.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have people in our party that express desire to lead the party into the highest office in the electoral contest shows how much this our party has resonated with Nigerians and our party members.\n\n\u201cFor us, it is a hallmark of success that people are showing interest, but at the end of the day and because they are leaders of the party, they will always put the party\u2019s interest at heart.\n\nTinubu had told journalists that his meeting with the governors was to solicit their support for his ambition to be elected Nigeria president in 2023.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami in 2018 tricked President Muhammadu Buhari to approve $350 million out of the total sum to some consultants, despite repeated warnings on the genuineness of the $478 million judgment debts said to be owed by the states and their local governments with respect to the Paris Club refunds.\n\nDisregarding the warnings including a report by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), against the legitimacy of the debts, Malami in a letter to the President dated 9th October, 2018 and obtained by SaharaReporters said his office had worked out \u201cdisbursement ratio of this amount to the appropriate beneficiaries.\u201d\n\nThe controversial debt arose from various court judgments ordering that some \u201ccontractors\u201d and \u201cconsultants\u201d be paid for certain services and projects executed for the various states and the 774 local governments.\n\nSome of the claimants were said to be consultants who helped the states and local governments to secure recovery of funds over-deducted from their allocations between 1995 and 2002 to service then London and Paris Club loans.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency kindly recall my previous correspondence addressed to the Chief of Staff to the President dated 11th July, 2018 and 1st August, 2018 copies of which are attached herewith a ANNEXURE IA & IB on the need to settle 3rd party claims in respect of the above subject matter,\u201d part of the letter written by Malami to the President read.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency subsequently approved the recommendation for the settlement of this 3rd party via letter dated 29th August, 2018 with Ref. No. SH/COS/08/B/848 addressed to the Hon. Minister of Finance, a copy of which is attached herewith as ANNEXURE II. Consequent upon the approval the Hon. Minister via letter dated 14th September 2018 with Ref. No. FMF/HMF/CBN/PC/FINAL/1/2018 directed f the he Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria to set aside the sum of US$350 million for settlement of Legal,Consultancy Fees, etc. A copy of this letter is attached herewith as ANNEXURE III.\n\n\u201cI wish to draw Your Excellency\u2019s attention to the fact that in the initial refund made to the State, the Hon. Minister of Finance directly instructed CBN to pay the sum of $86,546,526.65 as consultancy fees and N19,439,225,871.11 as legal fees to NGF accounts. The relevant letters are attached herewith as ANNEXURE VII(A) & VII(B). The above payment resulted in EFCC investigations/prosecutions and forfeiture actions. Please see attached media report in ANNEXURE IV. ALGON/LGAs did not benefit from the above sums.\n\n\u201cIt is also instructive to relate that the instant presidential approval is premised solely on the need to settle outstanding court judgments/orders arising from the Paris Club refund in respect of LGAs to avoid future judgment debit liability on FGN. I wish to buttress the above by making references to Paragraph 10(ix) of the letter of the Hon. Minster of Finance addressed to Your Excellencyand dated 5th July, 2018 with Ref. No. FMP/HMF/SH/PRES/FINAL/2018 which clearly state a court order has been secured with regards to Local Government refunds. A copy of this letter is attached to ANNEXURE II.\n\n\u201cI wish to further make references from the Chief of Staff to the President dated 28th June, 2018 with Ref. No. SH/COS/08/B/782 addressed to the HON. Minister of Finance, copied to me (attached herewith as ANNEXURE V, whose paragraph 1(f) stated the President\u2019s directive to me as follows: directed that - in relationship to court case instituted by the 235 Local Government Council against the Federal Government- the Attorney General provides a legal opinion as to the constitutionally and sovereign implications of any 3rd party consultant, such as Linas International Ltd, being eligible for 20% if judgments sum as payments which are to be deducted at sources.\n\n\u201cThis above also shows beyond doubt that the 3rd party claim for which presidential approval was sought is in relation to the judgment obtained in the case instituted by LGCs and not States.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency is respectfully invited to note that: (i) Presidential approval was granted for the sum of US$350 million for settlement of Legal Consultancy Fees, etc based on recommendation made by the FGN Legal Team. (ii) My office has worked out disbursement ratio of this amount to the appropriate beneficiaries. (iii) In the initiate refunds made to the States, NGF was paid the sum of $86,546,526.65 consultancy fees and N19,439,225,871.11 as legal fees while ALGON Legal and Consultancy Fees remain unsettled.\n\n\u201c(iv) Both NGF and ALGON had previously issued letters of no objection to direct payment. ALGON Legal and Consultancy Fees to Linas international Ltd (copies attached ANNEXURE VI(A-C). (v) All beneficiaries are to submit appropriate letters of understanding accepting the payment as final settlement of their claims. (vi) EFFC is better being directed to initiate criminal action against Riok Nigeria Ltd (Prince Nichola Ukachukwu) and Ted Edwards based on the report of its earlier investigation for the extradition of Ted Edwards.\n\n\u201cNOTATION: 8. In view of the foregoing Mr. President is respectfully invited to: (i) Note that the Hon Minister of Finance, Accountant General of the Federation and the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria are to effect disbursement of the approved sum of US$350 million in accordance with disbursement mandate to be issued by the Hon. Attorney General of the Federation.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had in a series of reports exposed wide-ranging legitimacy issues, including non-execution of agreed contracts and backdoor deals raised against the indebtedness from various quarters.\n\nOne of the beneficiaries is one Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards, who was indicted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nDocuments seen by SaharaReporters showed that Edwards did not represent the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) as claimed.\n\nA letter dated August 1, 2018, by former EFCC Chairman, Ibrahim Magu, to the Ministry of Justice/Attorney General Office, indicted him of an attempt to defraud the Nigerian government.\n\nIt said, \u201cThe suspects had filed applications in court to be joined as one of the judgement creditors during the garnishee proceedings and the applications were refused by the Federal High Court. The judge in a ruling delivered on the 27th of June 2016 frowned at Dr Ted Edward for brandishing a judgment purportedly delivered by the Federal Capital Territory on 30th October, 2015 and in fact took a swipe at it.\n\n\u201cBy the Motion Ex parte filed on the 30th of March, 2015, the judgement creditors applied for a Garnishee Order Nisi which was granted on 1st April, 2015 and fixed the return date for 16th April for the Garnishee to show cause why the Order Nisi should not be made absolute.\n\n\u201cThe Honorable Judge in his ruling stated unequivocally that let me state right away that the substantive matter was commenced by me until I entered judgement on the 3rd of December, 2013. I have searched my records up to the date of I entered judgement. I could not find the name of Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards as representing the judgement creditors even for one day nor did I find any process filed by his law firm. How then was that judgement prosecuted?\n\n\u201cAnother point to highlight is the fact that according to the purported letter of engagement being bandied by Dr Ted Edwards, he was engaged on September 15, 2011, long before the matter was filed in court quoting the exact judgment sum.\n\n\u201cWhat this throws up is the fact that the said letter of engagement was done after 3rd December, 2013 and backdated to make it look as if the suspect had been engaged before the case started. There is no evidence to prove that the suspect did any work in relation to the recovery process.\n\n\u201cA careful look at the memorandum of settlement Dr Ted Iseghohi Edwards and Hon Odunayo Ategbero betrays the conspiracy and an attempt to defraud the Federal Government by the suspects.\n\n\u201cPending Actions; Invitation and/or Arrest of the suspect, Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards with a view of confronting him with all the issues raised in the evaluation above. Tracing and filing interim forfeiture order on any property or asset acquired with proceeds of fraud by Dr. Ted Iseghahi Edwards.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that despite the report, Malami persuaded Buhari to approve $159million as legal fees to Edward.\n\nThey also directed the DMO and the Ministry of Finance to release the promissory notes to Edward and others so that they could take their shares, a source had said.\n\n\u201cEdward was the Secretary-General of ALGON when the Paris Club refund case FHC/ABJ/CS/130/2013 was done by Joe Agi (SAN) and his colleagues before Justice Ademola. It is clear that he was not the lawyer to ALGON and this much ALGON has said in writing to Malami and the Chief of Staff, Gambari,\u201d the source had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cThe EFCC in its report to Malami and (Ibrahim) Gambari also established that Ted Edward did not represent ALGON and that Ted Edward in his own handwriting admitted that Joe Agi was the lead counsel for ALGON. He went to one Judge, Baba Yusuf and procured a judgement that he was the lawyer to ALGON in the Paris Club refund case.\n\n\u201cYet Malami who knows this is recommending that Ted Edward be paid $159,000,000 as fees from ALGON instead of the actual lawyer. Will this not amount to double payment whenever Mr Joe Agi demands to be paid? From my investigation, Mr Joe Agi, ALGON and the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum have all gone back to court to challenge the payment of the $418 million including that of Edward through promissory notes.\n\nHow Attorney-General Malami Manipulated Buhari to Approve Payment of $350million to Ned Nwoko, Other Paris... by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\n\u201cShould Malami not take a second look at the suit and see if really there is any fraud as being widely alleged? Instead, he and the Chief of Staff tricked the President and subsequently directed the Debt Management Office and the Finance Office to release the promissory notes to Edward and others so that they can take their shares.\n\n\u201cThe total sum of $418 million promissory note suggested by Malami to be paid is just a tip of the iceberg of what is coming unless he is stopped. Nigeria will become bankrupt before President Buhari leaves office. The anti-corruption war of Buhari has been effectively clipped by Malami and Gambari using their powerful offices to trick the President who really trusted them.\n\n\u201cAll (that is) needed to be done is to allow independent people to go through the whole cases concocted on the advice of Malami and the truth will be seen and Nigeria saved of all these massive stealing.\n\n\u201cWhy is Malami not challenging any of these court judgements? If I may ask; in most of all these claims, the EFCC had investigated, taken statements and established that none of the contracts was executed. The report was submitted to Malami and former Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun by Magu-led EFCC suggested the arrest and interrogation of Ted Edward and one Prince Nicolas Ukachukwu but he and Gambari suppressed the report.\n\n\u201cThe same man suggested to be arrested is who Malami said should be given $159,000,000. ALGON had written several letters to him and (Kayode) Fayemi, who is the Chairman of Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum that all the jobs executed by Edward and others were fake, not executed. Yet Malami in the face of this clear case of fraud tricked the President in a memo and said judgement was given against them.\n\n\u201cHe also negotiated the debt to 50 percent and convinced the President to pay to avoid more damages. It\u2019s high time President Buhari save his anti-corruption war by causing a thorough investigation of his appointees involved in this massive fraud.\u201d\n\nOther beneficiaries include Nwoko, who is laying claim to $142,028,941 via a consent judgment he obtained from the Federal High Court in Abuja in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/148/2017.\n\nThree beneficiaries laying claim to $143,463,577.76 via a judgment of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court in the suit marked FCT/HC/CV/2129/2014 are: Riok Nigeria Ltd, Orji Nwafor Orizu, and Olaitan Bello.\n\nFrom the total money, Riok Nigeria Limited has a share of $142,028,941.95 (about N54 billion), Mr Nwafor is entitled to $1,219,440.45 and Mr Bello has a share of $215,159.36.\n\nA firm, Panic Alert Security System Limited, owned by George Uboh, is also laying claim to $47,831,920 based on another \u201cconsent judgment\u201d it obtained in suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/123/2018, which was filed as recently as 2018.",

Yet Malami in the face of this clear case of fraud tricked the President in a memo and said judgement was given against them.\n\n\u201cHe also negotiated the debt to 50 percent and convinced the President to pay to avoid more damages.

          "text": "A human rights lawyer, Mbasekei Obono, has asked the National Assembly to remove sections of the states\u2019 criminal and penal codes that outlaw blasphemy.\n\nObono made the appeal following the sentencing of one Mubarak Bala, an atheist, by a court in Kano for making a post on Facebook considered to be blasphemous against Islam and Prophet Mohammed (SAW).\n\nMubarak Bala\n\nBala, a 37-year-old President of the Humanist Association of Nigeria, was jailed on Tuesday (April 6) by the court after pleading guilty to all 18 charges and asking for leniency.\n\nHe has been in detention since 2020 after a group of Muslims filed a petition to the authorities accusing Bala of posting uncomplimentary messages about Islam and the Prophet Mohammed on Social Media.\n\nObono in a petition to the lawmakers said the growing trend of sentencing young Nigerians under the pretext of blasphemy must be discontinued.\n\nHe said several others have been sentenced using the same pretext. He said those sentenced were merely exercising their rights to the freedom of thought and religion.\n\n\u201cOmar Farouq who was 13, was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for blasphemy in Kano. The conviction was later upturned on appeal. Yahaya Sharif-Aminu was sentenced to death for blasphemy, and Abduljabbar Nasiru-Kabara is still facing trial.\n\n\u201cMubarak Bala has been convicted and sentenced to 24 years imprisonment for blasphemy. The denial of freedom of thoughts is a denial of mental autonomy. Mental autonomy is greatly needed for a thriving democracy and nation-building, the right lawyer wrote in the petition,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria provides in section 10 that Nigeria is a secular state. The implication of section 10 is that there is no official religion binding on Nigeria. Also, the constitution as a \u201ccommon standard\u201d for human rights, adopted Article 18 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR), Articles 2 and 8 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights among other international instruments that guarantee the right to freedom of religion, thought and conscience.\n\n\u201cBy contrast and in a manner that contradicts the supremacy of the constitution, Sections 204 Criminal Code Law and Sections 210 Penal Code Law both criminalise public insult on a class of people\u2019s religion. It is these laws in both northern and southern Nigeria that state governments depend on to violate the rights of people to freely express themselves.\n\n\u201cThis petition is therefore written to request an amendment of the Criminal and Penal Code laws of Nigeria by the National Assembly and the constitution to guarantee people the right to free expression of thoughts. The idea that only a class of people are permitted to express themselves while others cannot austerely impair their rights to human dignity. The amendment should encompass the right to reveal one\u2019s thoughts, the right not to be penalized for one\u2019s thoughts and the right not to have one\u2019s thoughts manipulated.\n\n\u201cDenying an individual the freedom of thought is a denial of self-esteem, self-respect and grandeur. This is why freedom of thought is protected under international human rights law. It is one of the cardinal principles of a growing democracy. We need laws that will guarantee citizens the ability to think freely because depriving any person of such rights is to completely deprive them of their humanity and existence,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "On Monday, Zainab Ahmed, minister of finance, budget and national planning, launched Project Lighthouse, a debt analytics and reporting platform.\n\nThe \u2018formal launch\u2019 was held in Abuja.\n\nThe project uses advanced data mining and analytics techniques to identify tax defaulters, establish their tax liabilities and send notifications to appropriate authorities for necessary actions.\n\nTheCable understands that Project Lighthouse sprouted from efforts to address policy challenges in the ministry through technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe minister said despite being in technology and data-centric world, Nigeria had no culture of using data and information to guide the formulation, implementation, and impact assessment of its initiatives and policies.\n\n\u201cThis modus operandi presents a number of challenges, firstly, our policies are not usually empirically based. Second, we are not able to effectively track the implementation and impact of these policies, initiatives, programmes, and mandates. Third, we lack data to help guide the revision or optimization of these policies,\u201d she had said.\n\n\u201cIn response to the aforementioned challenges, the Federal Ministry of Finance initiated Project Lighthouse.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe minister said the ministry was leveraging a multi-layer data mining effort to recover huge debts owed to the federal government by various Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).\n\nThrough the efforts of the project, she said, the government had been able to aggregate huge debts of approximately N5.2 trillion owed by MDAs, out of which N53.5 billion had been recovered in the last 12 to18 months.\n\nBefore the launch, Ahmed had, in 2020, inaugurated a steering committee for Project Lighthouse aimed at boosting the revenue drive of the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nWhile she chaired the committee, Mohammed Dikwa, permanent secretary, special duties, ministry of finance, was the deputy chair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy implication, it shows the minister has been making plans for the project launch for two years. With the launching on Monday, Project Lighthouse could be viewed as a novel project originating from \u2018ingenious\u2019 leadership of Ahmed.\n\nBut it is not.\n\nKEMI ADEOSUN\u2019S PROJECT LIGHTHOUSE INITIATIVE\n\nThe initiative first came to being during the tenure of Kemi Adeosun, former finance minister.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdeosun became a minister in 2015 but stepped down from office in 2018 after she admitted to allegations of certificate forgery to evade the mandatory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC).\n\nNonetheless, as a minister, she was tasked with driving President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s agenda for the country\u2019s economic recovery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was said that she saw the establishment of many landmark reforms in the ministry, including the Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS) which gave birth to Project Lighthouse in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2018, the ministry discovered 130,000 tax defaulters under her leadership. Adeosun said it was due to data compiled from Project Lighthouse.\n\nThe same year, she also discovered a N100 billion tax revenue shortfall by contractors through the project.\n\nReforms made under Adeosun include the establishment of an Efficiency Unit (E-Unit) to monitor the MDAs to check leakages in the public finance system; and the introduction of a Whistleblower Policy.\n\nOthers include ensuring compliance with the Treasury Single Account (TSA) within MDAs; Asset Tracking and Management Project (ATM Project), the establishment of the Road Trust Fund (RTF), and the introduction of the Fiscal Sustainability Plans and Budget Support Facility for States of the Federation, and others.\n\nWith that said, does it mean that Zainab Ahmed launched (or relaunched) Adeosun\u2019s Project Lighthouse on Monday?",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "MTN Nigeria, the Nigerian arm of Africa\u2019s largest telecom, today received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria to run a payment service bank.\n\nWith this approval, MTN Nigeria can provide virtually all the services offered by conventional commercial banks with the exception of granting credit and processing foreign exchange transactions.\n\nThis announcement follows a previous approval in principle granted in November 2021, to Airtel Africa Plc and MTN Nigeria Communications Plc to operate a payment service bank in the country. The final approval was subject to the fulfilment of certain standards of the conditions within six months. This hints that, while MTN has gotten its own approval, Airtel Nigeria could be getting its own soon.\n\nDespite being home to Africa\u2019s largest unbanked population, Nigeria has not witnessed the same exponential growth in mobile money adoption and lags behind its regional peers like Ghana and Kenya when it comes to penetration. In January, MTN revealed that MTN Nigeria\u2019s mobile money service had attracted 9.4 million active users since launching in August 2019.\n\nThis approval is expected to spur the adoption of mobile money in Nigeria as the use cases increase. The widespread coverage of MTN will help it serve people all over the country, especially in rural areas and also position the telecom giant as a competitor for the market share and earnings of commercial lenders.\n\nMTN Nigeria, which provides one-third of the MTN Group\u2019s sales, saw revenue climb to a record \u20a61.7 trillion ($3.4 billion) last year, with profit leaping 45.5% to \u20a6298.9 billion ($598 million). Mobile money is a growing contributor to MTN Nigeria\u2019s income, and it\u2019s expected that the new banking licence would allow the company to explore growth opportunities presented by the Nigeria\u2019s unbanked population.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

No, I\u2019m not screaming. Over a million dollars for an already stale video? Isn\u2019t this so-called NFT devoid of integrity? How could a viral video and meme be sold for such exorbitant prices?\n\nPlease read the story here to have a better understanding: The science behind NFTs: How viral coffin dance meme sold for $1.047m\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Bolu, my Blockchain go-to person, has answers to my questions. In today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, he explains why an NFT can be sold for over a million dollars.\n\nSneak Peek: What sells in NFT is the metadata, not the image, video, or item. Whoever is selling sells proof of ownership. Bolu compared an NFT to a painting.\n\nJust like paintings, they can be purchased for exorbitant sums of money. So, why not NFTs? I think it\u2019s time you took NFTs seriously.\n\nWhy? Did you see the NYSC corps member and photographer, Adisa Olashile, who was the talk of Twitter after he gave an elderly drummer, Ayangbenle aka Baba Onilu, \u20a6500,000 ($1,203.02) when he sold a photograph of him as an NFT?\n\nIf this corps member could cash out from a \u201cphotograph\u201d, I believe you can too. You have to know how to get started and get answers to your crucial questions about NFTs.\n\nHave you grasped the concept of Web3? We had a Space titled \u201cMaking Sense of Web3\u201d two weekends ago, which you can listen to here.\n\nMore so, to learn the basics of Web3 and discover how to build a career in Web3 and blockchain, Techpoint Africa is organising an event, Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit, to this effect.\n\nThe Blockchain Summit will be held on May 21, 2022, at Four Points by Sheraton, Victoria Island, Lagos.

This means that MTN Nigeria will act as a commercial bank like Firstbank, Access Bank, and Zenith Bank. However, there is an exception to the services this bank will be offering.\n\nWhat\u2019s the exception? MTN will offer almost all of the services provided by traditional commercial banks but will not grant credit and process foreign exchange transactions.\n\nAccording to a report, the telecom giant began this process two years ago and received an \u201cApproval in Principle\u201d (AIP) from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in November 2021 to operate as MoMo PSB.\n\nMTN Nigeria wants to leverage its size. \u201cWhen we have subscribers of over 70 million spread across Nigeria with our infrastructural spread, we are well-positioned to cover everywhere. That\u2019s exactly what we want to achieve,\u201d the company says.\n\nAccording to Statista, MTN was Nigeria\u2019s largest mobile telecoms operator in June 2020, with a 38% market share. Globacom and Airtel followed closely behind, with 27% and 26% of the market share, respectively.\n\nPremium Times reported that MTN intends to capitalise on the financial inclusion drive by providing people who do not have bank accounts or ATM cards with the opportunity to conduct banking transactions.\n\nMoMo PSB may be able to serve 38 million underbanked adults in Nigeria, as the primary goal of issuing PSB licences is to increase financial inclusion, particularly in rural areas, and to facilitate transactions.\n\nFor more information, please read: MTN receives final PSB approval to kick-start an exciting era for Nigerian fintech\n\n7 skills to learn during ASUU strike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a former Nigerian student of the premier \u2013 first and best \u2013 University of Ibadan, I can state unequivocally that Nigerian students have gone through hell at the hands of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). The same could be said of the relationship between ASUU and the Nigerian government.\n\nWhile I admire ASUU\u2019s tenacity in going on industrial actions \u2013 which have previously failed to yield results \u2013 hoping they can persuade the government to meet their needs, I\u2019m more concerned for Nigerian students.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that ASUU went on strike on February 14, 2022, because the federal government failed to meet the terms of a 2009 agreement.\n\nAccording to the union, no classes will resume in public universities until a renegotiated 2009 agreement, and the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) are signed and implemented.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2020, the union staged a series of strikes that lasted 742 days.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t see the government meeting the union\u2019s agreement anytime soon, I believe students should take advantage of this time to learn new skills and position themselves for ideal job opportunities.\n\nOur Senior Reporter, Oluwanifemi Kolawole, has curated 7 marketable skills you can learn in 30 days as a Nigerian student.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn major reversal, Elon Musk is not joining Twitter\u2019s board.

We were scheduled to start at 5 p.m., but then man proposes, Lagos traffic disposes.\n\nWe eventually started at 5:30 p.m. with Victor Momoh, Co-founder and CTO, pitching Credit Sense, a fintech startup.\n\nCredit Sense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Momoh pitching Credit Sense.\n\nAccording to Momoh, Credit Sense plans to tap into Nigeria\u2019s huge remittance market by providing financial services for Nigerians who receive money from outside the country but have no bank accounts. The startup plans to use blockchain technology and cards to facilitate financial transactions beginning with withdrawals.\n\nThe audience had questions about the viability of using blockchain technology to serve a market that cannot even afford smartphones. There were also questions about its business model and the cost of acquiring customers. Some members of the audience also had suggestions for how to improve the product.\n\nAfiari\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChigozie Njoku pitching Afiari\n\nAfter Momoh was done with his pitch, Chigozie Njoku stepped up to pitch Afiari, an eCommerce startup that helps customers buy foodstuff from major markets close to the customer.\n\nCo-founded by Njoku and George Ebisike, Afiari intends to formally launch its services in April 2022. In addition to buying from major markets close to the customer, Afiari plans to offer 24-hour delivery and use artificial intelligence to predict customer demands.\n\nAt the end of the presentations, we announced plans to form a Pitch Friday Club to offer participants more value beyond exchanging ideas. We\u2019re collating responses from participants, and you can have your say by filling out this form. Participants also had a few minutes to interact with each other.

Search no further.\n\nFirst things first, in the words of Bolu Abiodun, it was definitely an NFT weekend. From the coffin guys to Baba Onilu, the non-fungible token market was on a spree. We \u2014 well, mostly Bolu \u2014 talked about how a \u201cstale\u201d meme was sold for over a million dollars and why we should probably dig up and mint some of our grandparents\u2019 pictures.\n\nWhich, of course, nicely ties in with the buzz surrounding the Web3 and Blockchain. Curious about this? Then we would love to have you in the audience this May at the Techpoint Blockchain Summit. Register to attend here\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all NFTs with telcos like MTN and Econet getting some talking time as well.\n\nSecond things second, MTN has announced that it has received the final approval for its MoMo Payment Service Bank (PSB) from the Central Bank of Nigeria. Will we see the telco\u2019s current dominance translate into its fintech play?\n\nWhile MTN was getting approval, Econet introduced Smart US Dollar Bundles to help Zimbabwean customers buy data, airtime, and SMS products in US dollars. Considering the country\u2019s circular relationship with hyperinflation, this was probably a smart move.\n\nThird things third, DiDi, one of the biggest ride-hailing companies, has pulled out of South Africa. Interestingly, this comes one year after its launching in the country. One thing we also found intriguing was the company\u2019s Chinese roots and how it basically chased Uber out of China.\n\nZooming back in, though. Should you mint your grandparents\u2019 pictures? Well, you can find out as you listen to today\u2019s podcast.\n\nYou can catch up on everything we discussed on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts.

          "title": "Presidency: Osinbajo, Tinubu in fight to the finish",
          "text": "The declaration on Monday by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo of his intention to seek the ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to enable him to run for president in 2023 has pitted him against his political godfather, Bola Tinubu.\n\nOsinbajo had announced his readiness for the contest at a meeting Sunday night at Aguda House, his official residence, attended by Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun, Abubakar Bagudu of Kebbi, Muhammad Abubakar of Jigawa, Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano, Simon Lalong of Plateau, Hope Uzodinma of Imo, Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, Gboyega Oyetola of Osun, Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa, and Hafis Kawu, a former presidential aide and House of Representatives member.\n\nBusinessDay learnt that Sunday night\u2019s meeting with the governors had initially been planned to hold on Thursday but had to be shifted because a number of the governors were unavailable.\n\nHowever, apart from having to wait until after the party convention, the vice-president was also keen to properly manage and choreograph the communication with President Muhammadu Buhari, with whom he had had at least three meetings, the first of which was in January where he sought counsel and guidance. Both men met on Thursday when Osinbajo told his boss about how he planned to meet governors of the party.\n\n\u201cWe have been very deliberate about how the vice-president will step out. Firstly, there was never a question of him not running because of Asiwaju. That was never discussed to the best of my knowledge. So, it was always a matter of timing and sequencing because we wanted to get it right from the very first step,\u201d one source said.\n\nOsinbajo made a deliberate effort to court and extoll governors of the ruling APC when he hosted them, according to those close to the meeting. Emerging details of the meeting showed that the vice-president, who said he had called the gathering to consult them and break news of his desire to seek the presidential ticket of the party, went on to highlight the pivotal place of the governors in the structure of the party.\n\nHe sought the governors\u2019 support and assured them that if given the ticket and he went on to win the election next year, he would ensure that they would be there when the government would be formed and when critical actions would be taken.\n\nOsinbajo, who had been holding separate meetings with the governors for weeks, said he wanted the governors of the party to stand by him all the way.\n\nResponding on behalf of the governors, Abubakar Bagudu, governor of Kebbi State and chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum, thanked the vice-president for reposing confidence on the governors and for sharing with them his ideas for moving Nigeria forward.\n\nHe praised Osinbajo for bringing the governors closer over the years by his tact in handling matters at the regular meetings of the National Economic Council (NEC), which Osinbajo chairs.\n\nBagudu expressed the profound respect of his colleagues for the vice-president who he said had transformed the NEC meetings from a mere monologue into healthy dialogues where governors are treated as parties with a stake in the future of Nigeria.\n\nHe assured their host that the governors would do everything in their power to ensure that APC presented the best candidate and that it went on to win the 2023 presidential election.\n\nIn what some have described as a counter move, Tinubu also held his own meeting on Monday with 12 APC governors at Kebbi State Governor\u2019s Lodge, Asokoro, in Abuja. The meeting was attended by governors from Kebbi, Yobe, Lagos, Nasarawa, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kwara, Imo, Plateau, Osun, Ogun and Kano states.\n\nIt was learnt that some state governors had rejected the idea of the gathering holding at Lagos House in the capital.\n\nBusinessDay also learnt that Tinubu had made himself unreachable to associates of the vice-president who had tried unsuccessfully to get him to speak to Osinbajo before he went into Sunday night\u2019s meeting with the APC governors.\n\nThe vice-president\u2019s campaign team said there had never been a question of the number-two man not running just on account of Tinubu\u2019s expressed desire to contest the same position.\n\nWhat has emerged is that both contestants are fighting for the heart of the party by relying on the powers of the governors to succeed in their efforts to get the presidential ticket.\n\nSome in APC say Osinbajo is better placed to preserve the Buhari legacy. Others who worry about a protracted lame duck presidency for Buhari believe any candidate apart from Osinbajo will lead to massive loss of influence on the part of Aso Rock.\n\nThey point to what happened in the days following Buhari\u2019s election when senior government officials including the Inspector General of Police deserted President Jonathan as they rushed to Daura to pay homage to Buhari.\n\nPundits say that the absence of Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State in both meetings was instructive.\n\n\u201cGovernor Fayemi deliberately shunned the meetings. He will soon declare his presidential ambition. Nigerians must not be fooled any longer. There is no difference between Buhari, Tinubu and Osinbajo. Nigerians must hold three of them accountable for the destruction of the economy. None of them is good enough for the country anymore,\u201d a source who spoke with BusinessDay on condition of anonymity said.\n\nReno Omokri, a former aide of former President Goodluck Jonathan, described the declaration speech of Osinbajo as empty and devoid of any tangible achievements that could spur Nigerians to prefer him as president in 2023.\n\nRead also: Tinubu on Osinbajo: I have no son old enough to declare\n\nOmokri, through his verified Twitter handle @reomokri, on Monday, challenged the vice-president to name the promises they made to the people in 2015 that had been fulfilled in seven years in power.\n\n\u201cOsinbajo fooled us with his empty promises in 2015. Don\u2019t forget how he was doing Trader Moni during the last elections. Did he not abandon it after they rigged themselves to win? For years, Osinbajo posed as an intellectual. So, at the very least, we expected his declaration speech to be filled with his achievements. Instead, all we got are promises because he and Buhari have no achievements to show for their wasted 7 years,\u201d he said.\n\nSome other analysts, who spoke with BusinessDay, advised Nigerians not to lose sleep over the impending \u201cfight\u201d between Tinubu and Osinbajo, as according to them, \u201cThey are birds of a feather.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas it not the same Osinbajo that helped Tinubu in Lagos in some of the Alpha Beta deals that trended some time ago? Osinbajo has been in the Buhari administration since 2015 and the economy is nothing to write home about. Where is Nigeria today? Do we still have a country? What legacy is Buhari leaving behind?\n\nFor me, the President is leaving behind a destroyed nation; should we exonerate Osinbajo? Should Nigerians reward him for destroying their lives by handing the country over to him? That would be the worst decision Nigerians can make in 2023,\u201d an analyst said, craving anonymity.\n\nChristian Okeke, a lecturer with Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka, said: \u201cIt is heart-breaking to listen to the VP say in his speech that he indeed stood where ordinary people in the country stood and sat where they sat, and that he knows their hopes, aspirations and fears. This sounds to me either as insensitivity or mockery.\n\n\u201cCuriously, the vice-president never cried out before now as a strategy for self-preservation. In light of these, the fact that the government he served left the country and her people in this unfortunate condition is going to limit him. He shares in the responsibility of failure.\u201d",

          "title": "Illegal fishing: How Nigeria can stop losing $70m yearly \u2013 Experts",
          "text": "Experts in the Nigerian maritime industry have highlighted what the country needs to do to stop the annual loss of $70 million to illegal fishing.\n\nNigeria has been battling issues of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities largely perpetrated by foreign fishermen who are exploiting West African waters.\n\nThe country has been losing over $70 million yearly to illegal fishing, according to the estimation by the House of Representatives. This includes loss of licence fees, revenue from taxation, and the value that could have been accrued from legitimate fishing to local vessels.\n\nApart from revenue loss, the illegal fishery has created massive economic hardship for Nigeria and other nations in the West and Central Africa region as resources that ought to create jobs and wealth for the citizens in these countries are illegally taken away.\n\nOlisa Agbakoba, senior partner and head of arbitration and ADR practice group in Olisa Agbakoba Legal, said there were other sources that estimated the cost of illegal exploration of Nigerian waters at between $600 million and $800 million yearly.\n\nThe variations in the figure, according to him, not only show the difficulties in calculating the value, but also show the clandestine level of the activity.\n\nAgbakoba said vessels from China, the European Union, and Belize were notable for illegally exploiting Nigerian waters.\n\nNigeria\u2019s coastal waters contain diverse species of fish, which contribute to the food and economic security of its people. They include lobsters, prawns, and sea cucumbers, among others.\n\nIt is estimated that small-scale fishing activities contribute 80 percent of locally produced fish and support the livelihoods of 24 million Nigerians.\n\nTo close the huge gap through which revenue and jobs are lost in Nigeria, Agbakoba proposed that Nigeria must enact the Maritime Zones Bill to take into account the huge aquatic resources estimated at N10 billion, which are currently exploited by foreigners.\n\nRead also: FG must declare Nigeria a maritime nation to drive investments \u2013 NSML\n\nJude Okenwa, a maritime consultant, said for the country to stop foreign trawlers from engaging in illegal fishing activities on Nigerian waters, the Federal Government, through the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, must engage the National Assembly to review relevant maritime laws that would have some punitive clauses for offenders.\n\nAccording to him, only punitive measures will stop the foreign poachers from depleting Nigeria\u2019s fishery resources illegally.\n\n\u201cThe activities of these foreign fish poachers are also impoverishing our fishermen and rendering our youths jobless, thereby increasing insecurity,\u201d Okenwa said.\n\nAnother critical factor that has been driving illegal fishing in the West African region, particularly Nigerian waters, is that foreign fish poachers usually find a market for the stolen fish.\n\nMargaret Orakwusi, a shipowner and a former president of Nigerian Trawlers Owners Association, said, \u201cNigeria is losing billions of naira daily to illegal fishing and illegal exploration of Nigerian waters by foreigners.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, on a scale of 10 to 100 percent, fish trawlers in Nigeria only take 40 percent of what they should be getting while 60 percent is lost to illegal fishermen.\n\n\u201cPoachers irresponsibly steal the fish in Nigerian water, and also find markets for these products running into billions of dollars yearly,\u201d Orakwusi said.\n\nWhile expressing concern on how the poachers find markets for the stolen fish without being found out, she noted that Nigerian fishermen try to follow international standards by having their payments done through their domiciliary account.\n\nAccording to Orakwusi, the markets for the stolen fishes are found in Europe and Asia.\n\nShe, however, suggested that the global financial institutions must be forced to be more prudent in dealing with such people in line with the law of money laundering.\n\nAt the 2019 Global Maritime Security Conference held in Abuja, countries in the Gulf of Guinea agreed to ensure that just like the \u2018blood diamonds,\u2019 international community put mechanisms in place to ban resources that were illegally explored from being sold in any market in the world.\n\nAccording to these nations, the international community needs to put deliberate policies in place to ensure there would not be any market for stolen oil or illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishery.\n\nExperts said this action, if legally binding, would reduce the rate of crude oil theft and illegal poaching of fisheries in the Gulf of Guinea.\n\nBut the decision of the member states in the Gulf of Guinea region is yet to be properly documented as a legal framework.",

          "text": "Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has not only thrown the global oil market in turmoil, it has forced a reckoning about the outsized role of oil in geopolitics, and Western countries are crafting policies that will guarantee them energy security, with implications for oil producers like Nigeria.\n\nThe International Energy Association (IEA), the Paris-based think-tank that crafts energy policy for Western nations, is calling for immediate actions in advanced economies that can cut oil demand by 2.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in the next four months.\n\nSome of the measures are practical and have worked in the past like reducing speed limits on highways, working from home up to three days a week and better investments in public transport infrastructure.\n\nSome other measures are cost-effective like increasing car-sharing to reduce fuel use and cutting business flights in favour of more video conferencing. Some measures even benefit the environment like car-free Sundays in cities and the use of more electric vehicles.\n\n10-point plan\n\nThe IEA says cutting current speed limits on highways by 10 km/h can significantly reduce fuel consumption for cars, light commercial vehicles and trucks.\n\nSpeed limits on highways vary widely among countries but are typically in the range of 100 km/h to 135 km/h across the Western world \u2013 except in Germany, which has no speed limit on some highways.\n\nThe IEA estimates that around 290,000 bpd of oil use can be saved in the short term through a speed limit reduction of just 10 km/h on motorways for cars. A further 140,000 bpd (predominantly diesel) can be saved if heavy trucks reduce their speed by 10 km/h.\n\nBefore the pandemic, the use of private vehicles to commute to work in advanced economies was responsible for around 2.7 million barrels of oil use a day, according to IEA estimates.\n\nYet, around one-third of the jobs in advanced economies can be done from home, opening up the possibility of reducing oil demand while maintaining productivity.\n\n\u201cOne day of working from home can avoid around 170 kb/d of oil use. Three days of working from home avoids around 500 kb/d in the short term,\u201d the IEA said.\n\nCar-free Sundays were first introduced in countries like Switzerland, the Netherlands and West Germany during the 1973 oil crisis. More than 3,000 towns and cities registered for the European Mobility Week in 2021, which included a commitment to a car-free day.\n\nCar-free Sundays help support the uptake of walking and cycling, which can generate a positive spill over effect throughout the week.\n\nIf this were implemented across Western countries, the IEA estimates that it will avoid around 380,000 bpd of oil use in the short term. If only one Sunday per month, the amount drops to 95,000 bpd, it said.\n\nShifting travel demand away from private cars to public transport, micro-mobility options, walking or cycling wherever practical are another recommended measure.\n\nEuropean countries are building cycle lanes along highways. For example, the French government allocated 500 million euros to an \u201cactive mobility fund\u201d to build cycling itineraries.\n\nIt is estimated that short-term measures where feasible and culturally acceptable can avoid around 330,000 bpd of oil use.\n\nAnother counsel from the IEA is that countries should alternate private car access to roads in large cities. This entails restricting private cars\u2019 use of roads in large cities to those with even number plates some weekdays and to those with odd-numbered plates on other weekdays, a measure that was once successfully implemented.\n\nDuring the first oil shock, the Italian government substituted car-free Sundays with an odd/even number plate policy. Since the 1980s, such schemes have been deployed in many cities to tackle congestion and air pollution peaks, including Athens, Madrid, Paris, Milan and Mexico City.\n\nThe IEA estimates that this measure could cut around 210,000 bpd of oil in the short term if alternate car access is applied on two days per week in large cities with good public transport options.\n\nThe counsel for users from different households to carpool for non-urban trips will reduce oil demand and save money. Non-urban car trips are responsible for over 4 million barrels a day of oil use in advanced economies, says the IEA.\n\n\u201cAn increase of around 50 percent in the average car occupancy across advanced economies in 1-in-10 trips and adopting best-practices to decrease car fuel use can save around 470,000 bpd of oil in the short term,\u201d the IEA said.\n\nThe Paris-based think tank is also promoting efficient driving for freight trucks and delivery of goods. Efficiency measures include improved vehicle maintenance and driving eco-driving techniques as part of the tuition and examination processes required to receive a driving license.\n\nIt called for improving the efficiency of truck operations including optimising vehicle loads and reducing empty travelling. Cooperation between companies and widespread use of digital technologies can help achieve these goals, the IEA said.\n\nThe IEA says these measures can avoid around 320,000 bpd of oil use in the short term.\n\nWestern governments have been urged to replace short-distance flights with high-speed rails and night trains. In France, the recent Climate and Resilience law requires the cancellation of flights if alternatives exist to reach the destination within two-and-a-half hours.\n\nThe IEA says companies have already started to cut some flights, including between Paris and cities such as Nantes, Lyon and Bordeaux. It estimates that this measure will cut around 40,000 bpd oil use in the short term.\n\nWhere alternative options exist, Western governments have been urged to avoid business air travel. Several major corporations \u2013 such as HSBC, Zurich Insurance, Bain & Company and S&P Global \u2013 have already announced targets to cut their business travel emissions by as much as 70 percent.\n\nThis measure is estimated to avoid 260,000 bpd of oil use in the short term.\n\nRead also: IEA members agree to release 120m barrels of oil from reserves\n\nThe Paris-based think tank is promoting the adoption of electric and more efficient vehicles. By the end of 2021, it said 8.4 million electric cars were on the roads in advanced economies, building on record sales in Europe in particular.\n\nDemand for electric cars continues to be strong, on the back of plummeting costs of batteries in recent years and government support.\n\nThis is expected to trim more than 100,000 bpd of oil use in the short term, building on expected sales of electric and more fuel-efficient cars over the next four months. Sustained action on supply chains and policy support can help secure further savings, the IEA said.\n\nCounsel from the IEA are not treated like mere suggestions, they form the fulcrum of Western countries energy policy. In the 1970s, the IEA advised western countries to begin stockpiles of crude oil.\n\nThis helped to prevent an energy crisis during the 1990s gulf war when oil prices rose sharply. Last week, they released 120m barrels into the global market to cool oil prices following Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine.\n\nThis development poses existential risks for oil producers who depend on fossil fuels to fund their budget. This explains why OPEC countries are working hard to diversify away from oil.\n\nNigeria currently sells the bulk of its oil to Western countries. A recent NBS data shows that half of the top buyers of Nigeria\u2019s oil are IEA member nations.\n\nAlready Nigeria\u2019s production is challenged by massive crude theft, sabotage and regulatory challenges, a loss of market share will pose a significant threat.\n\n\u201cBig risks lie ahead for the country, if it fails to fix its oil sector,\u201d warns Ayodele Oni, energy lawyer and partner at Bloomfield law firm.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has identified data as a necessity in the socio-economic development of any society, noting that his administration will leverage technology to provide the needed data for proper planning and sustainable development of Edo State.\n\nObaseki stated this while addressing participants during a workshop in Benin City organized by the Edo State Ministry of Physical Planning, Urban and Regional Development, after the recertification exercise, tagged, \u2018Operation Show Your Building Plan\u2019 in the Amagba axis of Benin City, the state capital.\n\nThe programme has the theme, \u2018Physical planning for our communities: The Amagba experience,\u2019 and was attended by top government officials as well as heads of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in Edo.\n\nThe governor said his administration plans to leave data that will serve as a compass for proper planning of the state so as to ensure sustainable development across all communities in the state.\n\nHe noted, \u201cThe only job I have left as governor is to make sure that I put down a compass, a direction that Edo should go, at least in the next 30 years. We are not here to find fault. This is a reality and if we continue like this as a country, we will fail.\n\n\u201cNobody is going to fix it for us; we have to fix it for ourselves. Nobody is coming from Abuja or abroad to help us fix these things. If we don\u2019t, we are the ones most at risk, because we are living in a society where you have no control and anything can happen to you at any time.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why this is so important. I think it\u2019s a foundation that future governments would rest and we would not relent.\u201d\n\nObaseki added, \u201cAs we are going on with the \u2018operation show your building plan\u2019 exercise, we should also take note of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) data too. Look at INEC delineations to see whether when it comes to elections, people are registered and participating in governance. Except we work together, even if we bring all the money in Nigeria, we cannot develop Amagba.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cPeople are asking, what will happen after you leave? What will happen is that we will have it right and the people will know, and then anybody who comes in and does not give them what they want, the person will have to answer to them. So, we can sustain this development if we decide to.\n\n\u201cWe are going to every community in Edo, every local government and every ward. We need to know every village in them and how they are governed. The assignment today is that every agency of government must tell us why they exist and how they are providing services to our people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going for local government elections. We need to open up the space.

          "text": "By ADEBAYO OBAJEMU\n\nAfter what seemed like an unending silence eminent personalities are again warning the administration of President Buhari to do something about the rising insecurity and general uncertainty in the land before it spiral out of control. But the body language of the president and the silence of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) doesn\u2019t suggest any hope of a reprieve for Nigerians who are under the siege of economic distress and insecurity.\n\nDominating the headlines last week was the issue of the Imam of Apo Mosque, Sheikh Nuru Khalid, a fiery preacher who criticized President Buhari\u2019s handling of the insecurity in the country, following the Kaduna train attack, warning that the government was not doing enough and appeared unperturbed.\n\nThe preacher said this in a Friday sermon penultimate week. The following day, he was put on suspension by the Mosque Committee, and was subsequently sacked last week.\n\nHowever, on Thursday, the controversial Imam said he\u2019s not a slave to anybody. He told the BBC that being an Imam doesn\u2019t mean he shouldn\u2019t talk about the killings going on in Nigeria, and no one can treat him like a slave.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not your slave, I won\u2019t keep quiet about the killings in Nigeria because I\u2019m an Imam.\u201d\n\nHe said that the government of Nigeria was not doing well in fighting against insecurity in the country and that\u2019s not good at all.\n\nAs if on cue the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye lamented on the state of insecurity in the country.\n\nSpeaking during his Holy Ghost sermon, he said God has yet to speak to him about the 2023 elections unlike in 2019 when God spoke to him a year before the elections.\n\n\u201cAs of now, I still do not know whether or not there will be an election next year. Do not say that Pastor Adeboye said there will be no election next year, that is not what I said\u2026 Adeboye does not know yet,\u201d he told his congregation.\n\nPenultimate Sunday, Adeboye noted that he is very concerned about the Kaduna killings, oil theft, Nigerias depressing debt profile and other current national challenge.\n\nOn the Kaduna train attack, he said, \u201cyou cannot go to Kaduna by road, air or train. That brings so many questions to my mind as a man of prayers. Why Kaduna? Who is trying to isolate Kaduna? Why? After Kaduna, which next? he asked.\n\n\u201cIt is in the news and nobody has denied it that as of now more than 80 per cent of the oil we are producing is being stolen\u2026 that leads me to several questions, he said.\n\n\u201cWho is stealing the oil? Where is the money going? What do they want to do with the money? Who are the foreign nations buying this stolen oil? How many of these nations of the world are your friends?\u201d\n\nAccording to him, it is an open secret that more than 90 per cent of the money Nigeria gets from crude oil sales is being used to furnish interest accruing on debt.\n\n\u201cWe are borrowing more and according to a friend of mine, we are moving steadily towards a state of bankruptcy a whole nation\u2026\u201d\n\nAs if last week was a season of lamentations over disturbing proportion of insecurity, former President Olusegun Obasanjo, described the security challenges facing the country as a serious situation, calling for concerted efforts by stakeholders to stem the tide. He said that government has been overwhelmed by the security challenge and questioned government\u2019s willingness to stop the crisis.\n\nThe former president spoke at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, in Abeokuta, Ogun State, while receiving a Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential aspirant, Dr. Ugochukwu Williams and his team.\n\nObasanjo, while reacting to the recent attacks on Kaduna-Abuja train, where no fewer than seven persons were confirmed dead and 21 other passengers injured, and 127 missing, said the security challenge in Nigeria has overwhelmed the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration.\n\n\u201cI believe very strongly, and I have said it publicly and I will say it again that the situation we are in this country is not a situation where one man will say yes, he has a solution unless we are deceiving ourselves. I believe we need to sit down collectively and look at the situation.\n\n\u201cA situation where you are not safe on the road, you are not safe on the train, you are not safe at the airport, shows a very serious situation.\n\nI believe that all right-thinking Nigerians must know that we have a situation that has overwhelmed the present administration, but we should not allow that situation to overwhelm Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, government in a quick reaction dismissed his concerns, noting the problem did not start with this government, and everything was being done to solve the problem.\n\nIn the same vein , the Labour Party, LP, last Wednesday, warned that if the escalating wave of terrorism in parts of the country remained unchecked, it has the potential to derail the forthcoming 2023 general elections.\n\nThis came as a legal luminary, Afe Babalola, proposed the convocation of a national dialogue as a catalyst for revamping Nigeria from its incessant security challenges.\n\nLabour party alleged the seemingly impotence of the Federal Government to arrest the situation, makes the whole scenario threatens the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe party, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Arabambi Abayomi, said: \u201cLabour Party condemns in totality the very weak responses of government to terrorism. At least now that the APC government, the security agencies and all the federal might have failed to provide security to the people, it is quite plausible that Nigerians should be constitutionally empowered to carry arms for self defense.\n\n\u201cLabour Party subscribes to the fact that the first and the very most important duty of government is to constitutionally provide and ably guarantee the safety and security of the citizens, but it is unfortunate that the APC led government had left Labour Party with no choice but to strongly condemn the level of its highly shocking and extremely nauseating incompetence shown against the continual killings of the citizens across the nation by the terrorists.\n\n\u201cIt has now come to a stage that as a nation, this must not be condoned anymore. The time has come for the government to do what is standard and needful immediately, as security is the main demand for a truly democratic rule, but this is one area in which the federal government had been found highly wanting.\u201d\n\nThe Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo, in a revealing disclosure last week, spoke between the lines that many African countries were making efforts to make economic mileage out of the country\u2019s security challenge by lobbying companies operating in Nigeria to leave and come to them.\n\nAppearing before the House of Representatives Committee on Public Accounts, Adebayo, leading other agencies under the Ministry to the committee to respond to queries from the Auditor General for the Federation, said one of such countries was Ghana.\n\nConcerned about the nefarious activity of bandits, and the spate of killings and kidnapping, especially the Kaduna-Abuja train attack, Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to seek international help in combating the perennial security crisis in the country.\n\nThe playwright said this at a press conference he tagged Forget the past, forfeit the future: A nation seceding from humanity, on Thursday in Lagos.\n\nHe urged Mr Buhari to take help from the international communities even if it means the UN (United Nations) establishing a unit in the country.\n\nMr Soyinka maintained Nigeria is overqualified for international help and should stop hiding under false pride or national integrity.",

          "title": "Domestic violence: Confusion, rage over Lady Osinachi\u2019s death, husband in Police net",
          "text": "Minister of Women Affairs Dame Pauline Tallen has vowed to ensure justice is served on the death of popular gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu, allegedly killed by her husband.\n\nShe said Domestic Violence is a crime under the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act (2015).\n\nThe minister\u2019s position was contained in a statement Monday by the director, press and public relations of the ministry, Olujimi Oyetomi.\n\nTallen stressed the need for further rehabilitation of the artist\u2019s children, who, according to reports, were allegedly directed by their father to flog their mother while she was tied up by him.\n\nShe expressed disappointment that advocacies against domestic violence, especially Violence Against Women and Girls, persisted when both the federal and state governments had declared zero tolerance to Gender-Based Violence.\n\nThe minister further said the ministry was working with relevant authorities \u201cto set in motion the mechanism to rehabilitate children of the late singer so that they do not grow up damaged and assume that such acts are normal thereby poisoning our society.\n\n\u201cI wonder and ask how such a talented and self accomplished individual who loved God would have been a victim?\n\n\u201cIt is now truly obvious that violence knows no class or creed. It could have been that she cried out to her Church or Pastor or friends or family, but all she got was \u201cit is well\u201d and now that the inevitable has happened, they are speaking out. It is NOT WELL if we carry on with the traditional ways of sweeping bad behaviour under the carpet.\n\n\u201cThe ministry under my watch will prosecute this matter to get justice for Osinachi. It is obvious that her children also need psyco-social support to heal from this trauma if it is true that their Father will go the whole length of tying her up and asking the children to flog her with a cane. This is unbelievable and MUST be condemned in all its ramifications,\u201d Tallen said.\n\nThe minister prayed for the repose of the soul of the late singer and all victims of domestic violence, calling on all to join the ministry in the fight to end every form of gender based violence.\n\n\u201cOur Religious and Traditional institutions, as well as the immediate families must join us in this fight to rid our society of such acts before they become fatal. Please if you see something, speak out, so that together we can save lives,\u201d she urged.\n\nMinister pays condolence visit\n\nSpeaking during a condolence visit to the artiste\u2019s home in Arco Estate, Abuja, the minister said after her private session with the children of the deceased, her findings compelled her to demand for justice for the late \u2018Ekwueme\u2019 crooner.\n\nShe also reiterated the need for full protection for the deceased\u2019s children.\n\n\u201dEven though reports had it that the late singer was hospitalized for throat cancer disease before her death, social media claims would just not go away that she suffered GBV in the hands of her husband.\n\n\u201dThe Honourable Minister, who asked for a private session with the children of the deceased disclosed that her findings compelled her to make the demands for justice for her, and protection for the children for the things they disclosed to her away from prying eyes,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement also said the children of the deceased were presently being cared for by a family friend, Mr. Sunday Achino, from Dunamis Church where the late singer worshipped.\n\n\u201cThere is no smoke without fire! I have confidence in the Police and the Judicial system to ensure justice for the late singer; and I also demand that the children should be offered special protection; those are what the Nigerian women, whom I stand to represent are demanding of this situation,\u201d she added.\n\nOsinachi\u2019s husband arrested\n\nAnd in another twist to the incident, the Federal Capital Territory( FCT) Abuja Police Command, has arrested Peter Nwachukwu, husband of the late singer.\n\nSpokesperson of the commend, Josephine Adeh, confirmed the development to Premium Times on Monday.\n\nAdeh said: \u201cHe is now in our custody. We picked him up yesterday, Sunday, The deceased younger brother reported the matter, and we have commenced an investigation. So we won\u2019t be issuing any statement for now.\u201d\n\nThe gospel music star, who shot into the limelight with the hit \u201cEkwueme\u201d, which has been watched over 72 million times on YouTube, died in an Abuja hospital on Saturday.\n\nInitially, it was reported that the talented Abuja-based gospel artiste died after an unknown illness.\n\nHowever, close friends and associates have suggested that her violent union led to her untimely death.\n\nThey also accused the Ekwuemecrooner\u2019s husband of constantly molesting and beating her.\n\nOn Saturday, her colleague, Frank Edwards, alleged the late singer had an abusive husband, who regularly brutalised her before she died.\n\nFamily reacts\n\nSpeaking on behalf of her family for the first time Sunday, the deceased\u2019s older sister, Favour Made, alleged that her sister\u2019s husband was responsible for her death in an interview with the Vanguard.\n\nMade said her sister\u2019s death was from a cluster of blood gathered in the deceased\u2019s chest due to her husband, who allegedly kicked her recently, and not cancer-related.\n\nShe said: \u201cShe did not die of cancer. Instead, the husband, Mr Peter Nwachukwu, hit her with his leg on the chest. He has been beating her all this while, but my sister hides all that she was passing through from us. Before now, we have told her to come out of the marriage, and we told her that they are not divorcing and that it\u2019s just a separation. But, she felt that God is against divorce.\n\n\u201cWe told her that separation is not a sin but just for her to stay alive and take care of her children. She will always tell us to relax and that the man will change. So when the man kicked her in the chest, she fell, and he took her to the hospital, but he did not even tell us.\u201d\n\nThe late Osinachi was a lead singer at the Dunamis International Gospel Centre. She was featured in several popular gospel songs like \u201cNara Ekele\u201d by Pastor Paul Enenche (Dunamis, Abuja) and \u201cYou no dey use me play\u201d by Emma.\n\nShe is survived by four children and her family.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nFamilies of passengers who were abducted in the Abuja-Kaduna train attack have issued a 72-hour ultimatum to the Federal Government to secure their release.\n\nThey gave the ultimatum on Monday after a meeting, stating that if the government fails to do so they will take a decision on how to rescue their relatives on their own.\n\nIt\u2019s been long weeks of torture and agonising moments for the families whose relatives were abducted when bandits attacked the Abuja-Kaduna-bound train weeks ago.\n\nThe attack which occurred on March 28 at Dutse forest in Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State left eight people killed and 26 others injured while scores of passengers went missing \u2013 suspected to have been abducted by the bandits.\n\nTwo weeks after the victims went missing, their families are hopeful of freedom from captivity, although they have refused to rule out the option of negotiating with the bandits.\n\n[READ ALSO] Kaduna Train Attack: Bandits Parade Kidnapped Victims Including Student\n\nThey have also held regular meetings with anticipated responses from the government but without such news coming yet, they turned to prayers to seek God\u2019s intervention in their predicament.\n\nThere has also been no word from the abductors.\n\nDr Abdulfatai Jimoh, who chairs the group of the relatives of the abducted persons, wants the government to dialogue with the bandits as they have demanded in a recent viral video.\n\nHe said this was necessary and not out of place since the government seemed incapacitated to protect the people.\n\n\u201cThe kidnappers said we should be ready that they would contact us, and we have not heard any communication from them since then,\u201d Jimoh said. \u201cSince this incident happened, we expected that by now, the government, the Nigerian Railway Corporation, and the Federal Ministry of Transportation, are supposed to have identified relatives of the victims to tell us what effort they are making or not to rescue our loved ones unhurt.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, the primary duty of any government is to protect the lives and property of citizens. We believe our government can do it and it\u2019s capable of doing it. Until a few days ago we had been expecting telephone calls from the abductors because that\u2019s what they promised us but when we saw the video, they made it very clear that they want to discuss with the government; that they have something with the government.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what they want from the government. But it\u2019s now an opportunity and a window for the government to rescue our loved ones by opening channel of communication with them (terrorists). This is not out of place. It is done anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nLiving Corpses?\n\nAccording to the families, the government owes the people the responsibility of ensuring their safety at all times, but authorities have continued to be nonchalant and insensitive to securing the release of their loved ones.\n\nThis has worsened their agony as they wonder why the Federal Ministry of Transportation and the Nigerian Railway Corporation have not reached out to them for updates on the efforts being made to ensure the kidnapped passengers return home unhurt.\n\nSome of them have become overwhelmed by their emotions as they appeal to the Federal Government to ensure the speedy rescue of the victims from the hands of their abductors.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what is between them but it is something that can be resolved in the interest of the lives of Nigerian citizens,\u201d Jimoh stated. \u201cLife is very sacred even if it is one life that\u2019s involved.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to Nigeria government to do everything within its powers and it is something that\u2019s not beyond the government to do. We are appealing to them to come out to open a channel of discussion with the bandits and get our loved ones out as quickly as possible.\n\n\u201cWe have been in serious anguish in the past 15 days. Many of us have not been sleeping, we have not been sleeping. We are like living corpses. We have decided collectively that we are giving the government 72 hours to do everything that\u2019s necessary to rescue our loved ones.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, and the nation\u2019s service chiefs had visited Kaduna to sympathise with the families and promised to ensure the return of the kidnapped persons, as well as apprehend and bring the bandits to justice.",

          "text": "The Federal Government has said that it is not opposed to renegotiations of the conditions of service of all workers in the public universities across the country.\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige stated this on Monday while receiving members of the government side of the 2009 Federal Government/University-based unions agreement re-negotiation committee led by the Chairman, Prof. Nimi Briggs.\n\nSpeaking against the backdrop of the ongoing strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities(ASUU), Ngige said as the conciliator, he has been pushing to see that everything contained in the 2020 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by the government and the union was done, including the implementation of the renegotiated positions.\n\nThe minister recalled that the renegotiation commenced in 2017 when the Federal Government was inaugurated. a committee headed by Wale Babalakin SAN who was later replaced by Professor Manzali, but COVID-19 struck in 2020.\n\nHe explained that in the December 2020 agreement, he gave the government side a timeline to return to the university unions who are their employees to sort everything out.\n\n\u201cI started pushing to see that things were done. What the Manzali committee came up with is a proposal. Both Manzali and ASUU did not sign. At our last meeting in February before ASUU proceeded on strike, we said everyone should go back to his principal,\u201d Ngige stated during the meeting.\n\n\u201cI asked the Education ministry several times what they had done with the document. We later got information on areas of disagreement. There is nothing wrong with that. It is bound to happen. I told ASUU to put up a committee, they said Manzali committee had expired.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, I am a parent. I feel it. I didn\u2019t send my children to Igbinedion or Afe Babalola or Cambridge.\u201d\n\nNgige said his daughter as American citizenship could have accessed American education but he refused.\n\nAccording to him, the Nigerian university system produced him and he remains proud of it.\n\n\u201cWhen we went to universities here, I knew the course content and as a medical doctor, the doctors we trained here are better than the ones trained abroad. That is one of the counsels I gave to my children. You can do your first degree. One got admission in Ghana, I said no. Others got in Canada and UK, but I refused. If anybody will be interested in the welfare of workers in Nigerian universities, I am number one. I told my colleagues that what university professors showed us here as their salaries is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe minister said he had commissioned studies on productivity with regards to emoluments and based on the results he got, it was clear that payments done ten years ago when the exchange rate was better, amounted to nothing now with 100 percent depreciation of Naira compared to the Dollar.\n\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t I support if ASUU and their unions now want a renegotiation of their conditions of service, which is the main thing in the proposal by previous Manzali?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Prof. Briggs who is also the Pro-Chancellor of the Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ndifu Alike, Ebonyi State, said the renegotiation committee was consulting all stakeholders with a view to finding a lasting solution to issues in dispute.\n\nThe academics are seeking improved welfare, revitalisation of public universities and academic autonomy among other demands.\n\nOne bone of contention for the academics is the non-payment of university revitalisation funds, which amounts to about N1.1 trillion.\n\nBut the Federal Government has said it doesn\u2019t have the money to pay such an amount, citing low oil prices during the Muhammadu Buhari administration.\n\nThe agreement was reportedly struck in 2009.\n\nAnother is the issue of the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS).\n\nThe academics have proposed an alternative payroll system, the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS).",

          "text": "Nigeria and 12 other countries in Africa are yet to surpass 10 per cent full vaccination of their population against the COVID-19 pandemic, a report released by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has stated.\n\nCiting the World Health Organisation (WHO) statistics, OCHA stated: \u201cThirteen countries are yet to surpass 10 per cent of their population fully vaccinated including two of the most populous countries in the region (Nigeria and Democratic Republic of the Congo).\u201d\n\nAlthough the report did not list the other 11 countries besides Nigeria and DR Congo yet to surpass 10 per cent vaccination of their population, it noted that since the deployment of the multi-partner country support teams in January 2022, there had been good progress in vaccine absorption and uptake in the African region.\n\nAmong countries that reported an increase in vaccine uptake in February and March, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya and Ghana recorded the highest increase in vaccination coverage.\n\n\u201cIn February and March 2022, Ethiopia implemented the second round of a mass vaccination campaign, which further boosted COVID-19 vaccine coverage in the country, with increased numbers of people receiving their second dose, more people starting with their first dose, and increased uptake of booster doses.\n\n\u201cTwo countries \u2013 Seychelles and Mauritius, surpassed the target of 70 per cent of the population fully vaccinated by the end of December 2021. Four countries \u2013 Rwanda, Botswana, Cabo Verde and Mozambique \u2013 are on track to reach this target, having vaccinated between 40 per cent and 70 per cent of their population by the end of December 2021.\n\n\u201cHowever, challenges remain. In the African region, 12.8 per cent of the population were fully vaccinated as of 27th March, 2022 (10.2% at the end of February 2022), compared to 57.5 per cent globally.\n\n\u201cThirteen countries are yet to surpass 10 per cent of their population fully vaccinated including two of the most populous countries in the Region (Nigeria and Democratic Republic of the Congo),\u201d the report stated.\n\nIt added that the COVAX Facility continues to be the leading source of vaccines delivered in the region, accounting for 68 per cent of doses received.\n\nBut the report stressed that the absorption rate of the vaccines received remained at sub-optimal level, with only 54.9 per cent of doses administered of the quantity received.\n\nIt noted that 24 countries out of 46 (52 per cent) had administered fewer than 50 per cent of doses received, adding that vaccine doses administered increased by 23 per cent in February 2022 compared to January 2022, but in March 2022 the number of vaccine doses administered decreased by 35 per cent.\n\nIt noted that on the average, 8,271,347 doses were administered per week in March 2022 compared to 12, 734,357 doses per week in February 2022.\n\nAccording to the report, Sub-Saharan African region needs a twelve-fold increase in the weekly number of doses to be administered from April 2022 to June 2022 to continue to move towards 70 per cent target.\n\nIt further stated that 31 countries out of 46 had reported expired doses, noting that the percentage of expired doses of all doses received was 1.7 per cent among the 31 countries and 0.9 per cent in the African region overall.\n\n\u201cAs a result of mass vaccination campaigns, nine countries out of the 20 priority countries in the WHO African Region recorded an increase in doses administered in February 2022 (Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, GuineaBissau, Madagascar, South Sudan, Ghana, Uganda and United Republic of Tanzania).\n\n\u201cHowever, only three have continued to record increased vaccine uptake in March 2022 (Ghana, Cameroon and South Sudan) in addition to Mozambique, Mali and Burundi. This shows that it is necessary to keep up the momentum in vaccine uptake between mass vaccination campaigns.\n\n\u201cIt is critical for countries to intensify activities aimed at promoting continued use of health facility vaccination sites, as well as implement the provider-initiated vaccination approach in health facilities. In January 2022, WHO, UNICEF and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance launched the COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership (CoVDP) as an inter-agency initiative.\n\n\u201cThis will build on existing resources globally, regionally and in-country in order to accelerate vaccination coverage in those countries most in need of support. CoVDP complies with the principles of one country team, one plan, one budget and one support team.\n\n\u201cIn March 2022, in-depth country calls were held with Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo, Burkina Faso, and Sierra Leone to discuss issues around urgent funding requests, and identify sources of funding, enhance operational planning and improve vaccination service delivery.\n\n\u201cThe first quarter of 2022 has shown improvements in vaccine uptake and coverage across the Region, which is benefiting from the deployment of the WHO AFRO multi-partner country support teams, which started in January 2022.\n\n\u201cAlthough challenges remain, this initiative, along with CoVDP, promises to continue to improve vaccine absorption and uptake and move more countries in the Region closer to the 70 per cent target,\u201d the report stated.",

We have many brilliant people in our party, some serving and some not serving.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have people in our party that express desire to lead the party into the highest office in the electoral contest shows how much this our party has resonated with Nigerians and our party members.\n\n\u201cFor us, it is a hallmark of success that people are showing interest, but at the end of the day and because they are leaders of the party, they will always put the party\u2019s interest at heart.\n\nTinubu had told journalists that his meeting with the governors was to solicit their support for his ambition to be elected Nigeria president in 2023.",

          "title": "Nigeria: Governor Lalong Attending Political Meetings as Terrorists Kill 80, Abduct 70 in Plateau",
          "text": "Bloodthirsty terrorists have killed 80 persons and abducted 70 others in Nigeria\u2019s North-Central region after an invasion of some communities in Plateau State . The villages, which were attacked on Sunday, included Kukawa, Gyambawu, Dungur, Kyaram, Yelwa, Dadda, Wanka, Shuwaka, Gwammadaji, and Dadin Kowa.\n\nRegrettably, while terrorists soiled the state in blood and danger, Plateau State Governor, Mr. Simon Lalong, was busy in Abuja holding political meetings with a former Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Bola Tinubu, over the latter\u2019s presidential ambition. Observers said this was a reflection of the growing insensitivity of the country\u2019s political leaders.\n\nAs the security situation across the country continued to deteriorate, with lives and livelihoods being helplessly ruined, the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) charged Nigerians to defend themselves from attackers. The charge was contained in a communiqu\u00e9 by ECWA President, Rev. Stephen Panya, and General Secretary, Rev. Yunusa Nmadu, at the end of the 69th General Church Council meeting held at the church headquarters in Jos, Plateau State.\n\nLalong, it was gathered, was the only governor that attended the presidential declaration by Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Amaechi, on Saturday.\n\nAs the governor was attending meetings with Tinubu, alongside other governors, 78 victims of the terrorist attack on the villages in Kanam Local Government Area were being buried in mass graves in their respective communities amid wailing by loved ones and the villagers. Lalong sat pretty at Kebbi Governor\u2019s Lodge to listen to Tinubu speak on his presidential interest.\n\nSome of the residents of the communities, who escaped the attacks, expressed worries that terrorists now lived around them, and called on the government and security agencies to come to their rescue.\n\nOne resident, who preferred anonymity for security reasons, said, \u201cIt is sad that innocent persons were killed without any form of provocation. We no longer feel safe in our homes and communities. We appeal to President Muhammadu Buhari, Governor Simon Lalong, and security operatives to come to our rescue.\u201d\n\nThe villagers narrated that the terrorists invaded their communities on motor bikes in large numbers and shot sporadically, killing and maiming residents of seven communities.\n\nThough presence of security forces has increased, villagers were however seen fleeing the communities for fear of subsequent attacks.\n\nIndigenes in the villages that were attacked said they recovered over 80 corpses from the attacks, adding that more corpses were still being recovered from the neighbouring bushes.\n\nA source from the communities, Mr. Fanya Ali, said, 70 persons might have been abducted, as their whereabouts remained unknown. Ali added that at least 80 houses were burnt.\n\nAli said 36 persons were killed in Kukawa, 27 in Gyambau, 11 in Wanka, and eight in Kyaram. He added that the figures from the other villages were yet to be obtained.\n\nAccording to Ali, many of the injured victims have been admitted at Dengi General Hospital and Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH).\n\nAnother eyewitness, Sariki Bitrus, said many women and children were missing, fearing the terrorists may have abducted them. Bitrus lamented that the people were in dire need of assistance as they have been displaced from their homes.\n\nLamenting the attack, Plateau Elders Forum, in a statement signed by Mr. Jonathan Ishaku, said it was shocked by the heinous assault on the innocent people of Kanam Local Government Area.\n\nIshaku stated, \u201cJust within a week of our press release, in which we condemned terrorist attacks on Miango villages in Bassa Local Government Area and Rantis in Barkin Ladi Local Government Area, bandits have allegedly killed several persons, wounded many and abducted over 70 in Kanam Local Government Area yesterday.\n\n\u201cThis is again very sad and we strongly condemn it. This seeming escalation of violence on our communities further justifies the earlier call the Plateau Elders Forum made on the Plateau State Government, in conjunction with the security forces, to deal drastically with terrorists in the state.\n\n\u201cThe security forces should ensure the immediate rescue of all abducted persons.\u201d\n\nThe member representing Pankshin/Kanke/Kanam Federal Constituency of Plateau State in the House of Representatives, Mr. Yusuf Adamu Gagdi, described the attack as an annihilation scheme. Gagdi commiserated with the victims.\n\nThe lawmaker, who was in Madina for lesser Hajj, called for immediate military presence in the affected communities and those bordering them in order to arrest the surging activities of bandits in his constituency. He expressed worry over the federal government\u2019s negligence and failure to provide security for Plateau communities, despite intelligence reports by the Department of State Services (DSS) about the influx of criminal elements into the state and some neighbouring states.\n\nGagdi stated, \u201cThe federal government, which has exclusive control of security apparatus in the country, has woefully failed in its primary responsibility of protecting lives and property of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHe expressed outrage at the devastating state of security in the country, arguing that somebody has been negligent in the discharge of his duties to Nigerians. He maintained that it was high time the federal government owned up to its inability to discharge this sacrosanct duty it owed Nigerians.\n\nGagdi advised citizens within the boundary communities, particularly in Wase and Kanam local government areas of the state, to be on the alert, as fleeing bandits from Zamfara and other North-west states had been traced to camps within the forests in the local government areas.\n\nMeanwhile, the Plateau State government, in a statement yesterday warned that the state would not be a haven for terrorists and other criminals fleeing from other parts of the country. The statement quoted Lalong as urging the security agencies to go after the terrorists.\n\nThe statement signed by Lalong\u2019s media aide, Makut Macham, said the governor expressed regrets over the dastardly act, saying he has directed security forces to dominate the area after their initial response that put a stop to the carnage.\n\nIt said the State Security Council had adopted far-reaching measures to strengthen security by enhancing the capacity of the security agencies to respond to all situations that cause a breach of the peace in any part of the state.\n\nThe statement also said Lalong sympathised with the communities affected, and promised them justice, saying those behind the attacks would not be allowed to go without punishment. He directed the State Emergency Management Agency and the Peace Building Agency to immediately visit the affected areas, assess the situation, and provide relief as well as trauma management.\n\nThe governor added that the state had already approached the federal government for collaboration to deal with the terrorists hibernating in the general area, once and for all, to enable people go about their legitimate businesses without molestation and harassment.\n\nThe spokesman of the state Police Command, Mr. Ubah Gabriel, said the police could not confirm the figure of casualties at the moment. Gabriel said, \u201cOur men have been there since yesterday combing the forests around affected communities. I would give you the full details of the casualties as soon as get it.\u201d\n\nDefend Yourselves, ECWA Charges Nigerians\n\nAmid the deteriorating security situation across the country, the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) charged Nigerians to defend themselves from attackers. This was contained in a communiqu\u00e9 signed by ECWA President, Rev. Stephen Panya, and General Secretary, Rev. Yunusa Nmadu, at the end of the 69th General Church Council meeting held at the church headquarters in Jos, the Plateau State capital.\n\nOn the unremitting killings and abductions of citizens in Kaduna, Kebbi, Zanfara, Plateau, Niger and other states of the country, ECWA called on government to arrest the situation.\n\nIt decried the failure of government to carry out its constitutional responsibility of securing the lives and property of its citizens, despite the huge amounts being spent on security. ECWA called on all tiers of government to do all they could to secure the release of innocent citizens still being held by terrorists and bandits across Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the council, \u201cit is very worrisome that Nigeria today has continued to witness the increasing activities of radical Islamic terrorist groups, which include Fulani Jihadist militia, Boko Haram, ISWAP, and bandits terrorising the country under the watch of this government, and government is not doing enough to stop it, It\u2019s really unfortunate.\u201d\n\nIn the communiqu\u00e9, the church expressed worry over the deplorable condition of infrastructure in the country as well as forceful occupation of ancestral lands by terrorists. It called on government to ensure that Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) returned to their homes and given farming tools to enable them continue their occupations.\n\nThe council also called on government to intensify efforts towards salvaging Nigeria, adding that the rising wave of corruption and the near total collapse of the economy has left Nigerians struggling for survival.\n\nThe church called on the federal government and striking labour unions, especially the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and Non-academic Staff Union of Education and Associated Institutions (NASU), to put the interest of the nation first and resolve the industrial crisis as soon as possible.\n\nECWA expressed concern over the biting hunger among Nigerians due to the shortage of food supply as a result of insecurity that had paralysed the activities of farmers. It noted with concern the increasing rate of unemployment and called on members of the church to shun political apathy and actively join political parties of their choice to help in building the country.",

          "text": "Obviously not expecting one of his political mentees to challenge him to a presidential contest, former Lagos State governor and frontline presidential hopeful, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on Monday, denied Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as a political son, declaring he has no son grown enough to declare for president.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nBut Osinbajo, who announced his intention to succeed his current principal, President Muhammadu Buhari, through a short video uploaded on various social media platforms, said his over seven years of working with Buhari had provided him requisite insights to complete what the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) had started.\n\nThe announcement came as the Tinubu Support Group (TSG) described Osinbajo\u2019s presidential declaration as a betrayal of trust.\n\nHowever, Chairman of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) and governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, described as a welcome development the fact that Osinbajo and Tinubu were seeking to be president of Nigeria. Bagudu said it was an indication of a robust democratic contest within a party that had endeared itself to Nigerians.\n\nThe PGF chairman also stated that APC might settle for the consensus method in the choice of its presidential candidate.\n\nTinubu met with about 12 APC governors at Kebbi State Governor\u2019s Lodge in Asokoro, Abuja, a few hours after the governors\u2019 meeting with Osinbajo at his official residence inside Aso Rock, at the start of the vice president\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nFielding questions from journalists after the meeting, an apparent knee-jerk response to the vice president\u2019s deft pioneering meeting with the APC governors, Tinubu denied Osinbajo outright.\n\nAsked about the declaration of the vice president, a development many of Tinubu\u2019s loyalists reckoned should not have happened, Tinubu declared, \u201cI don\u2019t have a son grown enough to declare\u201d for the office of president.\n\nThe APC leader, who said he met with the governors of his party to seek their support for his ambition, said, \u201cMy mission here is to seek collaboration, support and encouragement of my party, the APC, for my ambition to become the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as replacement for President Muhammadu Buhari after his tenure.\u201d\n\nTinubu\u2019s denial of his erstwhile political prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is a clear indication that the battle line is drawn between both men, and the battle may get more intense and messier in the period ahead.\n\nHowever, speaking earlier, Bagudu described the competitive situation in the party as a welcome development. He said Tinubu told the APC governors about his intention to vie for the presidency in 2023.\n\nBagudu said, \u201cAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, this morning, met members of the Progressive Governors Forum, where he stated what he has made public already \u2013 his intention to seek the office of the president come 2023, which he has already announced publicly. He briefed us on his reasons, his thinking and his message.\u201d\n\nBagudu said Tinubu acknowledged the role of the governors in the last convention of the party, where they helped to steady the party and produce a leadership accepted and widely acknowledged.\n\n\u201cWe appreciated his message and we will definitely discuss the message at one of our meetings,\u201d Bagudu added.\n\nAsked if Osinbajo and Tinubu\u2019s ambitions had put the governors in a tight corner, Bagudu said the governors appreciated the development, because it was an indication that the ruling party had endeared itself to Nigerians.\n\nHe stated, \u201cOn the contrary, we appreciate our party, because it has become a party that has endeared itself to Nigerians. We have many brilliant people in our party, some serving and some not serving.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have people in our party that express desire to lead the party into the highest office in an electoral contest shows how much this our party has resonated with Nigerians and our party members.\n\n\u201cFor us, it is a hallmark of success that people are showing interest, but at the end of the day, and because they are leaders of the party, they will always put the party\u2019s interest at heart.\u201d\n\nOn suggestions that APC might adopt a consensus candidate for the presidency, Bagudu stressed that the governors would always encourage the party to go for the best.\n\nHe said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget that in the 2015 presidential election primary, President Buhari contested against several others and it was a beautiful contest. There is nothing wrong. Members of the party always want to see consensus if it is possible, but we are a democratic party.\n\n\u201cIn our last convention, we had consensus in some of the offices and election in some others. There is always misrepresentation of consensus as if people are being snowballed into positions they would rather not take.\n\n\u201cAPC has done well as a party, President Buhari has led the party ably well and we believe strongly that come 2023, Nigerians will see another President of the APC extraction.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo officially declared his intention to run for president in 2023, yesterday, after meeting some APC governors at his official residence, Akinola Aguda House, within the precincts of the State House.\n\nIn the announcement video posted on his verified Twitter handle and other media platforms, including television, radio and social media platforms, Osinbajo promised to use his seven years insight and experience as the vice president to complete all that the Buhari-led APC government started at the centre since May 2015.\n\nAccording to him, if given the opportunity to lead Nigeria, his experience, insights and opportunities would be used for the benefit of Nigeria and Nigerians.\n\nHe claimed to have practically been to all the local governments in the country and had taken time to listen to the diverse experiences and yearnings of the people.\n\nVowing to transform the security architecture, agriculture and all other sectors for the betterment of the country, Osinbajo assured the citizens that he would build a Nigeria, where everywhere would be home for everyone.\n\nHe sought the support of all Nigerians to be their president in the next political dispensation.\n\nListing some of the challenges he intended to fix, if elected in 2023, the vice president said, \u201cIn this period of seven years, I have served the government in several capacities, and I have, at the direction of Mr. President, represented our country in sensitive high-level international engagements. If by the grace of God and the will of the people, I am given the opportunity, then, I believe that, first, we must complete what we have started:\n\n\u201cRadically transforming our security and intelligence architecture; completing the reform of our justice system, focusing on adequate remuneration and welfare of judicial personnel; ensuring justice for all and the observance of rule of law; rapidly advancing our infrastructure development, especially power, roads, railways and broadband connectivity.\n\n\u201cProviding an excellent environment for businesses to thrive, taking the agriculture revolution to the next level especially, mechanisation and developing the farm to table value chain, making sure that the government, its agencies and regulators serve the business community, creating a tech economy that will provide jobs for millions;\n\n\u201cEnhancing our Social Investment Programme to a full scale social welfare scheme, completing the promise of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty within this decade, completing the task of ensuring that all Nigerians, male and female, attend school, reforming our educational system for relevance to the challenges of this century.\n\n\u201cCompleting the task of universal health coverage for all, and strengthening the capacity of states and local governments to deliver on their respective mandates. Above all, front and centre of our efforts will be the provision of jobs and opportunities for our young people.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo added, \u201cWe will, working together, establish by the grace of God, the Nigeria of our dreams in a few short years. We will build on the foundation laid by our predecessors. We will need to move, with much speed, intentionality, and perseverance, towards the vision of a prosperous, stable, and secure nation. I am convinced beyond doubt, that, we have the creativity, the courage, the talent, and the resources to be the foremost black nation on earth.\n\n\u201cLet us now birth the expectations of greatness conceived generations before us. Let us build a Nigeria, where the man from Nnewi sees the man in Gusau as his brother; where the woman in Warri sees the woman in Jalingo as her sister; where the love of our nation burns alike in the hearts of boys and girls from Gboko to Yenogoa.\n\n\u201cWhere everywhere, in this land, is home for everyone, where our diversities, tribes and faiths unite, rather than divide us. Let our tribes become one tribe; the Nigerian tribe, where all are treated fairly, justly and with respect. Where all are given equal access to the abundant opportunities that God has bestowed on this nation. It\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Head of Media, Tinubu Support Group (TSG), Mr. Tosin Adeyanju, while reacting to Osinbajo\u2019s declaration, said, \u201cHis declaration is a welcome development but a betrayal of trust to the political family he belongs to. However, he does not portend any threat to our camp.\n\n\u201cOur eyes are on the ball and we are counting our numbers. Our consultation continues, as our principal is meeting with governors of the party.\u201d\n\nAdeyanju stressed that Osinbajo\u2019s declaration would further strengthen internal democracy as party members look forward to a transparent primary.\n\n\u201cWe are ready for primaries with any interested person, because our principal is a true democrat,\u201d he said\n\nGroup Commends Osinbajo for Declaring Presidential Bid\n\nA group, Osinbajo Volunteer Movement (OVM), commended the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, for making public his intention to contest for the position of president in 2023. The group said Osinbajo was the right man for the job.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the group, Comrade Kalid Ibrahim, spoke to newsmen in Bauchi on Monday, shortly after a rally held in honour of the vice president. The OVM spokesman recalled how the group had earlier called on Osinbajo to declare interest in the presidency, which he finally yielded to.\n\nHe said Nigeria needed a leader, who was strong physically and intellectually to tackle the many challenges facing the country.\n\nIbrahim stated, \u201cWe are very happy over the official declaration made by the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, to contest for the office of the president come 2023.We are supporting him, because he is mentally fit, has exceptional leadership qualities, and possesses the technical know-how to transform this nation\n\n\u201cThe vice president has been part of this government for the past seven years, he is not a novice when it comes to affairs of this country. He is conversant with challenges facing this country. We are expecting him to consolidate on the work already laid down by President Muhammadu Buhari. This is the reason we are registering our support for him.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo\u2019s Chances Bright, Tinubu Should Allow Him Grow, Says Abba-Aji\n\nFormer Presidential Liaison Officer to the National Assembly, Senator Muhammad Abba-Aji, described as bright the chances of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, following his declaration to contest the 2023 presidency.\n\nAbba-Aji, a member of the Progressive Consolidation Group (PCG), a pro-Osinbajo lobby group, was the liaison officer to the National Assembly during tenures of the late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua and former President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nHe applauded the spontaneous nationwide celebrations that greeted Osinbajo\u2019s declaration for the 2023 presidency.\n\nAbba-Aji stated, \u201cI have been in politics since the early 80s and I can tell you that the Nigerian electorate is now much wiser, much more discerning and sophisticated than what you had in the past. The spontaneous rallies are a show of strength, asserting the power of the real people and it is a strong pointer to Professor Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s very bright chances for ultimate electoral victory.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju is a great leader of our party and his role in bringing about an Osinbajo vice presidency has been vindicated, having performed creditably, impressing President Buhari and millions of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWhen you have brought a great idea, you should allow such to grow and Vice President Osinbajo\u2019s declaration for the 2023 presidency is a reflection of very sound growth and the next step is for Osinbajo to assume the presidency in 2023.\u201d\n\nAbba-Aji added that Osinbajo had impressed Nigerians with his performance during the periods he acted as president.\n\n\u201cHis chances are very bright in the view of most people that I have interacted with. He is better than anyone else but we are in a democracy and others also have a right to present themselves and increase the choices available to the electorate,\u201d he said.\n\nEkiti Group Endorses Osinbajo, Says VP Better Than Tinubu\n\nA group, Osinbajo Grassroots Organisation, has begun mobilisation in Ekiti State for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, saying he is better than other contestants vying for the All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket, including Bola Tinubu.\n\nTo mobilise for Osinbajo, the group, on Monday, marched across the streets of Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, where vehicular and human movements were disrupted for several hours.\n\nIn their hundreds, members of the group chanted solidarity songs in support of the vice president, and moved from the popular Fajuyi park through Ijigbo area to APC secretariat in Ajilosun area, where they were received by the party officials.\n\nAddressing the crowd, leader of the group and a former House of Assembly member, Hon Femi Adeleye, saluted the vice president for accepting to contest the 2023 presidential poll. Adeleye said Osinbajo\u2019s competence and capability stood him out among the aspirants jostling for the nation\u2019s number one seat.\n\nThe former lawmaker noted that Osinbajo had in the last seven years demonstrated unmatched loyalty to the president and the party, saying this has made him acceptable to all Nigerians across party lines.\n\nAccording to him, the group and other citizens of the state would commence massive mobilisation to ensure Osinbajo wins the ticket of the APC, saying with him as the candidate, the party would not lose the presidential election.\n\nHe called on the party under the chairmanship of Abdullahi Adamu to consider picking the vice president as the presidential candidate of APC by all options available to the party.\n\nAdeleye stated, \u201cWe have been pressurising him in the last few years for him to contest. We even decided if he doesn\u2019t declare this week, we would have gone to court to compel him. It is on record that no other vice president in the history of modern Nigeria has had such a crisis-free, corruption-free, robust working relationship with his principal like Professor Osinbajo.\n\n\u201cToday, in Nigeria, Professor Osinbajo\u2019s name is synonymous with loyalty, trust, competence, capacity and faithfulness. He is the one with most capable credentials and disposition of taking Nigeria to the Promised Land. He has long been nurtured for the leadership role of president.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja, Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi and Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti",
