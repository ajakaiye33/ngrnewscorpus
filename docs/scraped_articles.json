          "title": "Air Peace incident: Stranded passengers reschedule flights as FAAN reopens Ilorin Airport",
          "text": "Reprieve came the way of airline operators and passengers on Saturday evening as an Air Peace plane, which lost one of its tyres at the Ilorin International Airport, was evacuated from the runway of the airport.\n\nArik Air, Overland Airways and charter airlines had cancelled their flights to the Ilorin airport on Friday and Saturday, following the closure of the facility by the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria after an Air Peace plane landed at the airport and lost one of its tyres on the runway.\n\nSixty-six passengers and six crew members onboard the Air Peace aircraft from Abuja were said to have \u201cdisembarked safely\u201d when one of the plane\u2019s tyres blew off on landing at the Ilorin airport.\n\nIt was gathered that the incident happened on Friday at 10:30am while the B737-500 aircraft with registration number 5N-BQR was taxiing to the parking bay.\n\nNo one was reportedly injured during the incident and no life was lost.\n\nThe Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, the aviation industry regulators, and the Accident Investigation Bureau, the agency that investigates air accidents, confirmed the incident.\n\nThey, however, said it was not a major incident or accident.\n\nHowever, findings by Sunday PUNCH revealed that several passengers billed to fly out of the airport and into the airport were stranded due the airport closure.\n\nArik Air, Overland Airways and Air Peace passengers became stranded after the carriers cancelled their flights.\n\nFAAN was forced to close the airport because it was reported that the ground handling company meant to tow the Air Peace grounded plane from the airport runway lacked the equipment to do so.\n\nAs such, Air Peace was forced to bring in a new set of tyres from Lagos to Ilorin to replace the burst tyres on the runway on Saturday.\n\nThe plane was later removed after the replacement.\n\nThe NCAA spokesperson, Mr Sam Adurogboye, however, said the aircraft would go through recertification before being released to fly again.\n\nA source at the Ilorin airport said many stranded passengers had started rebooking their flights after the airport was reopened.\n\n\u201cWith this development, flight operations in and out of Ilorin can now commence in earnest,\u201d an official of the airport who pleaded anonymity told Sunday PUNCH.\n\nHe described as untrue claim of plane crash in Ilorin.\n\n\u201cThere was no plane crash at Ilorin International Airport,\u201d he said in a reply to an inquiry.\n\nIt was gathered that the process of moving the plane from the runway was slow because, according to a source, \u201cit is a big aircraft and we have no equipment to effect quick evacuation.\u201d\n\nIn a follow-up statement, Air Peace also debunked reports (not by PUNCH) that its plane crashed at the airport.\n\n\u201cOur aircraft neither crashed nor crash-landed in Ilorin or in any place for that matter,\u201d the statement partly read, adding that \u201cAir Peace is committed to providing peaceful connectivity across cities and relentlessly observing the highest standards of safety in its operations.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Kukah: Stop intimidating Nigerians, Ortom tells Presidency",
          "text": "Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, on Saturday called on the Federal Government to stop intimidating patriotic Nigerians who raise concern over insecurity in the country.\n\nOrtom described as unfortunate the response of the Presidency to the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Bishop Matthew Kukah\u2019s address to the United States Congress Committee on Foreign Affairs regarding the wave of insecurity in the country.\n\nKukah had in a virtual address before the American lawmakers faulted the handling of the security situation in Nigeria by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.).\n\nThe cleric also accused Buhari of nepotism in key appointments, saying his regime favoured Muslims over Christians.\n\nThe governor, in a statement titled, \u2018I stand with Bishop Kukah,\u2019 issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, said as a patriotic Nigerian, he would have said similar things if he were to address the same audience.\n\nThe governor reminded the Presidency that Nigeria today was practising democracy which had no room for repression and dictatorship.\n\nHe explained that the country\u2019s Constitution guarantees the freedom of speech to all citizens, \u201cunlike a military regime which suppresses the right of the people to voice their opinions on challenges facing their country.\n\nOrtom said Kukah was right when he stated that nepotism had been elevated above federal character by the present administration.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cHe (Ortom) expects the Presidency to rather be worried that Nigeria is ranked as the most terrorised nation in Africa with an average of over 2,000 deaths per year on account of terrorism. He emphasises that the combative approach the Presidency has adopted in engaging citizens on issues will not solve the problems confronting the country.\u201d\n\nThe governor said Bishop Kukah was not the first Nigerian to address a foreign audience on the security situation in the country, recalling that in February 2015, Buhari, was at the time the candidate of All Progressives Congress when he delivered a speech at Chatham House in London, where he said, \u201cBoko Haram has sadly put Nigeria on the terrorism map, killing more than 13,000 of our nationals.\u201d\n\nThe statement added, \u201cThe President went on to announce to the world on that occasion that apart from the Civil War era, Nigeria had never been more insecure in the country\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "FG vs Igboho: Nigerians reveal how Yoruba activist got it wrong",
          "text": "The embattled Yoruba nation freedom fighter, Sunday Adeyemo popularly known as Sunday Igboho may have slipped the line while in the struggle to ensure that the Southwestern Nigerians are treated with fairness and equity, leading to his current predicament, a section of Nigerians suggests.\n\nIgboho\u2019s struggle which led to his current ordeal began when he gave an ultimatum to the Fulani herdsmen in Oyo State and some other parts of the region to vacate the forests.\n\nRecall that Sunday Igboho on January 16, issued a seven-day ultimatum to the Fulani community in Igangan, Ibarapa North Local Government Area of Oyo state, over allegations that they are responsible for the rising insecurity and kidnapping in the area.\n\nIgboho made the declaration when he led some youths to the Sarkin Fulani of Oyo State, Alhaji Saliu Abdulkadir, to register their displeasure over the recent killings in the axis.\n\nThe action stimulated controversies across the country as much violence erupted leading to the death of scores of residents.\n\nSubsequently, the secessionist declared the Oduduwa Republic as a sovereign nation for the Southwestern region over the alleged marginalization of the Yoruba people occupying Ogun, Osun, Ondo, Ekiti, Lagos and other states.\n\nIgboho had successfully conducted peaceful rallies in most of the states including Lagos as a movement for the actualization of the Oduduwa Republic. The agitators staged a mega rally in Lagos State on July 3 despite opposition from the government and the security agencies.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that the Department of State Security Services, DSS on July 1, invaded Igboho\u2019s residence in Ibadan the Oyo State capital, gunned down some of his allies and took other activists into detention. He was subsequently declared wanted by the secret police.\n\nThe midnight raid followed allegations that the activist was in possession of firearms. DSS spokesman, Peter Afunaya while confirming the operation said the security agency recovered illegal arms, including seven AK-47 rifles and thousands of ammunition from Igboho\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cOn approach to the residence, the team came under heavy gun attack by nine men, suspected to be Igboho\u2019s guards. Six of them were armed with AK-47 guns and three others with pump-action rifles.\n\nThe DSS accused Igboho and his group campaigning for self-determination, of been \u201cwell-armed and determined to undermine public order. The arrests and seizures are, no doubt, a confirmation of a grand plan by Igboho and his cohorts to wage a violent insurrection against the Nigerian state\u201d.\n\nDAILY POST also recalls that the Oduduwa pioneer was recently caught in a video where he was seen talking to some community leaders and other stakeholders in the region to purchase guns for their youths.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThose who don\u2019t have guns, contribute money and buy guns for them. I am saying it. You can video me. If they don\u2019t know where to buy gun, I will help them to buy them. Buy guns for them.\n\n\u201cNo government can say nobody should carry guns this time. If they are caught with the guns, they should tell them (the authorities) that I, Igboho gave the guns to them. This video, post it that \u2018Igboho bought guns for us\u2019.\n\n\u201cThey should not steal. The guns we bought are to protect ourselves. And we will fortify them with charms\u201d.\n\nFollowing the developments, the activist was on Monday, July 19 nabbed alongside his wife by the International Criminal Police Organisation at an airport in Cotonou, Benin Republic.\n\nIgboho who is currently in the custody of security officials in Cotonou was arraigned for a hearing on extradition to Nigeria at the Court De\u2019appal De Cotonou on Thursday.\n\nThe hearing was, however, adjourned to Monday, July 26. His wife was released by the authority\n\nSome concerned Nigerians who spoke with DAILY POST on the issue, blamed the activist for \u201cgoing too far\u201d by acquiring weapons while agitating for the Yoruba nation.\n\nA social media influencer, Mr Adewale Adegoke told DAILY POST correspondent that the activist may not have been hunted if he had continued with his rightful and peaceful agitation without indication of a crime.\n\n\u201cThis man would have just continued to enjoy his money and the respect been accorded to him by the general public. All was well until he started talking about guns and killings\u201d.\n\n\u201cOf course everyone has the right to agitate for separation but in a civil society like Nigeria, that can only be achieved without weapon\u201d, he added.\n\nA current affairs analyst, Mrs Ojonya Sylvester who spoke to DAILY POST from Makurdi, noted that Igboho should have learnt from the self-acclaimed leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu who is also currently in the custody of DSS after been rearrested in an undisclosed country.\n\nHe said, \u201cIgboho should have followed the steps of other agitators like Nnamdi Kanu. Kanu has never publicly said anything about purchasing weapons for killing anybody even though we all know that such exists.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to use force while trying to attract the attention of international communities towards your agitation. I think that is where he got it wrong. You don\u2019t expect a government whether good or bad to fold its arms and allow such to take place. No. You don\u2019t do agitation by force\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, a civil servant in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT who pleaded not to be mentioned, said Igboho\u2019s actions were birthed by the influence of bad governance.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf Nigeria is working and everybody is been treated equally, no one would be agitating for separation. It is accumulated provocation that is leading to all this agitation here and there.\n\n\u201cIf the Federal Government is angered by the activities of the agitators, they should fix the country, tacked the security challenges, make the economy work again.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stop the agitation by merely arresting everyone when there is hardship in the land. Tackle the cause first\u201d.",

          "text": "Our Reporter\n\nLibyan weapons used by ISIS terrorists\n\nBoko Haram kills seven Cameroonian soldiers\n\nUnited Nations (UN) experts have expressed concerns over incursions of terrorist affiliates from Nigeria into neighbouring countries.\n\nThe panel of experts said in a report to the UN Security Council that the terrorist affiliates are spreading their influence and activities including across borders from Mali into Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Niger and Senegal as well as incursions from Nigeria into Cameroon, Chad and Niger Republic.\n\nThe Institute for Security Studies (ISS) warned that the Islamic State (ISIS) adopts a complex network of communications and roads across West and North Africa to facilitate the movements of its affiliated militants and arms.\n\nReports from Yaounde yesterday said Boko Haram elements killed seven Cameroonian soldiers during an attack in the country\u2019s Far North yesterday.\n\nAfrica, according to the UN panel, became the region hardest hit by terrorism in the first half of 2021 as the Islamic State and al-Qaida extremist groups and their affiliates spread their influence, boasting gains in supporters and territory and inflicting the greatest casualties.\n\nThey said this is \u201cespecially true\u201d in parts of West and East Africa where affiliates of both groups can also boast growing capabilities in fundraising and weapons, including the use of drones.\n\nSeveral of the most successful affiliates of the Islamic State are in its Central and West Africa province, and several of al-Qaida\u00b4s are in Somalia and the Sahel region, they said.\n\nIn the east, the affiliates\u00b4 activities have spread from Somalia into Kenya and from Mozambique into Tanzania, they said.\n\nOne of \u201cthe most troubling events\u201d of early 2021 was the local Islamic State affiliate\u00b4s storming and brief holding of Mozambique\u00b4s strategic port of Mocimboa da Praia in Cabo Delgado Province near the border with Tanzania, \u201cbefore withdrawing with spoils, positioning it for future raids in the area,\u201d the panel said.\n\nOverall, the experts said, COVID-19 continued to affect terrorist activity and both the Islamic State, also known as ISIL, and al-Qaida \u201ccontinued to gloat over the harm done by the coronavirus disease pandemic to their enemies, but were unable to develop a more persuasive narrative.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile ISIL contemplated weaponizing the virus, member states detected no concrete plans to implement the idea,\u201d the panel said.\n\nIn Europe and other non-conflict zones, lockdowns and border closures brought on by COVID-19 slowed the movement and gathering of people \u201cwhile increasing the risk of online radicalization,\u201d it said.\n\nThe experts warned that attacks \u201cmay have been planned in various locations\u201d during the pandemic \u201cthat will be executed when restrictions ease.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe panel said that in Iraq and Syria, \u201cthe core conflict zone for ISIL,\u201d the extremist group\u00b4s activities have evolved into \u201can entrenched insurgency, exploiting weaknesses in local security to find safe havens, and targeting forces engaged in counter-ISIL operations.\u201d\n\nDespite heavy counter-terrorism pressures from Iraqi forces, the experts said Islamic State attacks in Baghdad in January and April \u201cunderscored the group\u00b4s resilience.\u201d\n\nIn Syria\u00b4s rebel-held Northwest Idlib Province, the experts said groups aligned with al-Qaida continue to dominate the area, with \u201cterrorist fighters\u201d numbering more than 10,000.\n\n\u201cAlthough there has been only limited relocation of foreign fighters from the region to other conflict zones, member states are concerned about the possibility of such movement, in particular to Afghanistan, should the environment there become more hospitable to ISIL or groups aligned with al-Qaida,\u201d the panel said.\n\nIn Central, South and Southeast Asia, the experts said Islamic State and al-Qaida affiliates continue to operate \u201cnotwithstanding key leadership losses in some cases and sustained pressure from security forces.\u201d\n\nThe experts said the status of al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri \u201cis unknown,\u201d and if he is alive, several unnamed member states \u201cassess that he is ailing, leading to an acute leadership challenge for al-Qaida.\u201d\n\nISIS terrorists using Libyan weapons in Nigeria\n\nThe Institute for Security Studies (ISS) has warned that the Islamic State (ISIS) adopts a complex network of communications and roads across West and North Africa to facilitate the movement of its affiliated militants, just days after a security report revealed the terrorist organization, ISIS, currently re-deploys its forces in the Lake Chad basin and the African Sahel region.\n\nAccording to a report issued by the ISS, about 120 militants from Libya are expected to be permanently stationed in the region.\n\nThe Geopolitical Research Center in Lagos said that \u201cthese militant and terrorist groups have benefited from the proliferation of weapons due to the conflict in Libya.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that weapons of war are carried by migrants through the desert, passing through Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger.\n\nSeven Cameroonian soldiers killed in Boko Haram attack\n\nBoko Haram militants overran an army base in Cameroon\u2019s Far North region yesterday, killing at least seven soldiers and wounding several others, said military and local sources.\n\nThey hit the base in Sagme locality of the region by 4.00 a.m. local time, two soldiers and a local resident told Xinhua.\n\nThe militants, well-armed, some of them in military camouflage, arrived in a convoy of six vehicles, one of the soldiers said.\n\nAfter several hours of fighting, the commander of the military base was killed alongside six of his colleagues.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers were very brave and defended strongly.",

          "text": "By Yusuf Alli, Managing Editor, Northern Operation and Yinka Adeniran\n\nAn Ekiti State High Court yesterday jailed a former bank cashier, Ebenezer Adeolu Alonge, his wife and mother-in-law for 60 years imprisonment for diverting N21million deposited by customers.\n\nConvicted with him were Isakunle Olamide Oyinlola (wife) and Isakunle Eunice Moradeke (mother-in- law).\n\nThe three convicts were handed over the sentence by Justice Adekanye Ogunmoye following a 12-count charge of conspiracy and stealing brought against them by the Ibadan Zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC).\n\nTheHead of Media and Publicity of EFCC, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, said in a statement that the offences were \u201ccontrary to Section 390(9) of the Criminal Code Laws Cap 16 Laws of Ekiti State,2012.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cThe journey to the dock started when the illicit activities of Ebenezer got exposed through a petition to the EFCC from one of the new generation banks alleging that one of her staff, Ebenezer Adeolu Alonge was involved in fraudulent activities.\n\n\u201cIt was alleged that sometime in February 2018, the bank received a complaint concerning the financial impropriety of the sum of N62, 400.00 in respect of a customer\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cAccording to the petitioner, on February 15, 2017 a customer lodged the said sum into her account but the transaction could not be traced in the customer\u2019s account even after the customer presented a copy of the slip signed by Alonge.\n\n\u201cIn the course of investigation, the said transaction was allegedly traced to Ebenezer Alonge\u2019s wife\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cFurther investigation however, revealed that there was a turnover of over N21million as deposit from other customers in his wife\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cAlso, it was alleged that other sums were traced to his mother-in-law\u2019s account, who was also a beneficiary of the fraudulent act.\u201d\n\nThe EFCC said in the course of trial, it called two witnesses and tendered several exhibits to prove its case.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe statement added: \u201cThe convicts were found guilty on all the 12 charges and sentenced to five years on each count. The cumulative 60 years prison terms will, however, run concurrently.\n\n\u201cJustice Ogunmoye, in his judgment, ruled that the prosecution team led by Abdulrasheed Lanre Suleiman proved their case beyond reasonable doubt and that the convicts had failed to extricate themselves from the self-evidenced proofs before the court.\n\n\u201cThe court also ordered Alonge to forfeit his house, which shall be sold and the proceeds used to restitute the bank.\u201d",

          "text": "By Vanessa Obioha\n\nDespite a technical glitch that delayed the launch show of the sixth season of the Big Brother Naija show, the popular reality TV show still kicked off on a colourful note.\n\nThe Big Brother House which is a main feature of the show dominated conversations on social media for its spectacular decor. Since the return of the BBNaija house to Nigeria in 2019, the multi-purpose facility has gone through several modifications and this season happens to be the biggest yet with a brand new mezzanine floor added to the structure, measuring over 200sqm. This is in addition to the original house, which measures about 1800sqm with an additional 250sqm for support building services such as the presenter and artistes\u2019 lounges and an art room where all the props for the arena games are made.\n\nFor this season, the organisers MultiChoice Nigeria played with colours. From the red and blue bedrooms to the lounge draped with colourful sofas, walls adorned with geometric shapes with an accent of African d\u00e9cor pieces and the new \u2018eye-catching\u2019 door. The Head of House room which is on the mezzanine floor spotted a new look. Measuring over 50sqm, The Victorian-themed room features a gold headboard above the king-sized bed complete with embroidered maroon throw pillows and a vanity table against a wall with gold detailing. The Diary room where Big Brother gets all the juicy details from housemates comes in a dark hue with the chair being the only sparkling element in the room while the HoH chair has a gold lion statue at the foot The kitchen, another popular spot in the house also shares in the opulence with greenery and colourful cabinets.\n\nNew additions to the house include the private Executive Lounge which looks like a rainforest with the green tufted upholstery and matching green walls. For the first time, the house features an indoor games lounge with a trophy cabinet. The outdoor area also features a redesigned patio with a mural painting and jacuzzi. All pieces in the house were locally sourced with close to 75 artisans working to bring this season\u2019s theme to life.\n\nThe addition of the new floor has ultimately seen an increase in the number of cameras in the house. In the BBNaija Pepper Dem edition in 2019, the house was designed to take seven hand-held cameras and 32 que ball cameras. This season now has 14 hand-held cameras and 37 que ball cameras capable of seeing the housemates at all times. The mezzanine floor alone has 11 of those que balls and two hand-held cameras. There are also two times more ambience microphones to capture every conversation in the house.\n\n\u201cA lot goes into the production of BBNaija. We ensure that each season we deliver a great show and this includes the look and feel of the house, which is an integral part of the show,\u201d said Chief Executive Officer of MultiChoice Nigeria, John Ugbe.\n\nThe first launch show also featured a music performance by Ladipoe.\n\nBilled for two nights this weekend, the launch show saw 11 male housemates enter the house on Saturday night. The female housemates will access the house this evening.\n\nThe sixth season themed \u2018Shine Ya Eye\u2019 is the second time the show is holding in a pandemic era. Thus, like last year, no visitors will be allowed in the house, in adherence to Covid-19 guidelines.\n\nThe grand prize for the season is N90 million with abeg as the headline sponsor.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Make fresh demand for six motorcycles\n\nLaleye Dipo in Minna\n\nNo fewer than 116 of the 136 pupils of Salihu Tanko Islamiyya School in Tegina, Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State, abducted by terrorists on May 30 are 56 days old in the dungeons of their kidnappers today, with hope for freedom still distant.\n\nTears continue to flow in many homes in Tegina, as traumatised parents await a miracle for the release of their kids, following the refusal of the abductors to free the pupils after collecting N50 million ransom contributed by sympathisers.\n\nSeventeen of the initial 136 abductees escaped, while three others died in the forest where they are being held.\n\nThe kidnappers had agreed to free the remaining 116 pupils if the ransom reduced from the initial N200 million to N50 million was paid.\n\nLast Monday, sympathisers mobilised N30 million to the kidnappers at an agreed location in the forest, after an initial N20 million was paid in June. But after counting the money, the abductors declared that it was N4.6 million short, and detained the conveyor of the ransom. The pupils were also not released.\n\nIt was the second time the kidnappers will declare ransom incomplete. In the initial N20 million paid in June, the abductors said it was N2 million short after counting it.\n\nThe kidnappers subsequently phoned the parents last Monday to send the N4.6 million balance, plus another N2 million short from the initial payment of N20 million, totaling N6.6 million.\n\nBesides, the kidnappers are also making fresh demand. They want the parents to supply six brand new Bajaj motorcycles before the pupils would be released.\n\n\u201cWe are fed up, we are leaving everything to God\u201d one of the parents told THISDAY yesterday.\n\nWhen contacted, the Head Teacher of the school, Mallam Abubakar Alhassan confirmed the story saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to do next\u201d.\n\nAlhassan said: \u201cAll the parents are now Koboless. We have sold everything we have to raise the ransoms collected by the bandits, yet they refuse to release our children.\u201d\n\nThree of the abducted pupils have died in the dungeons of the kidnappers, and many of the remaining pupils are said to be seriously ill, resulting from hunger, cold and trauma.\n\nThe pupils, some of their teachers and passersby were abducted on May 30, but 17 of the abductees escaped from the clutches of the bandits three weeks after their abduction.\n\nThree pupils also died in captivity few days back. It was gathered that the bandits gave the sad information to some of the parents in a telephone conversation, but they (bandits) did not disclose the names of the deceased pupils.\n\nThe Chief Imam of Tegina also said he made similar announcement after one of the regular Muslim prayers in the town early this week.\n\nAccording to THISDAY findings, the bandits told the parents contacted that they would send the video of the burial of the late pupils and that of the present condition of the others to confirm their state of health. As at press time, the bandits had not sent the video.\n\nSome parents told THISDAY that the Niger State Government promised to help offset part of the ransom but failed to deliver.\n\nHowever, Secretary to the Niger State Government, Alhaji Ibrahim Ahmed Matane, debunked the claim saying, \u201cThere was never a time that government promised to pay ransom to bandits or assist the parents to pay any or part of the ransom. We have a policy not to pay ransom. We still stand by that policy.\n\n\u201cYou know this issue of payment of ransom is not healthy. Government, as a policy, does not do it but I know that because they are engaging with the bandits, they can tell them anything.\u201d\n\nThe SSG also distanced the government from any official pledge that government would pay part of the ransom saying, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know who that government official is because I coordinate security and I am not aware.\u201d\n\nAsked if government was aware that three of the children had died, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not aware that three of the girls have died. You know these people (bandits) can be very deceptive. They raise a lot of emotions and sentiments so that we will accept their bidding.\u201d\n\nThe pupils, all from Muslim homes, spent the Eid-el-Kabir festival in the den of their abductors.\n\nThe mother of one of the pupils, whose name was not given, died early last month as a result of trauma. The remains of the deceased were interred in Tegina according to Islamic injunction.\n\nSome of the kidnapped pupils are between ages four, and 13. The headmaster of the school, whose two children and a sister are among the abducted, said some of the victims were too young for the ordeals they were facing.\n\nHe also indicted both the federal and state governments for abandoning the school and the parents of the students in their moment of despair.\n\nAlhassan, popularly called Mallam by his community, in an emotion-laden interview on June 5, claimed there had been no sympathy from the government, and wondered why the federal government failed to provide the ransom demanded by the bandits.\n\nHe said it was a lie that the government had sent vehicles and motorcycles into the bush for rescue operation, and denied the report that he had prior information of the attack.\n\nThe head teacher disclosed that the abduction had already led to the death of two parents of the victims, warning that more casualties may happen unless the students regained their freedom quickly.\n\nFighting back tears, Alhassan said on June 5: \u201cI have witnessed the funeral prayer of one of the parents here, very close to the school. She died because she had just one child who is our student. She was not around when the incident happened. When she came back, they told her and within 30 minutes, she collapsed and died. That was the day before yesterday.\n\n\u201cA day after the incident happened, another parent died. She had two children. One was sent to the town while the one with her was kidnapped. She died of heart attack.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019m talking to you now, my wife is down. She was put on drip, she didn\u2019t cook; she didn\u2019t eat. My little child at home, who slept with me on my bed, woke up only to begin to shout the name of his elder sister, asking me \u201cBaba, when is she coming back?\n\n\u201cOne painful thing was that my sister called me before the last discussion with the bandits, crying. She swore that the children are sick, they cannot walk. She told me they have removed their hijabs. They have unveiled them. They removed their shirts and they are left with only trousers.\n\n\u201cThere is no food. They gave them kulikuli (groundnut cake). How do you expect them to survive? They took them to unknown environments. I heard people saying they kept them on the floor. When you are talking about floors you are not talking about classrooms or a house. No, they are kept in the bush. They are sleeping on the ground, no leaves, not mat. How do you expect them to live like that?\u201d\n\nAnother parent, a mother, Mrs. Hashimu, in an interview, few days after the abduction said: \u201cThe whole incident was terrifying because everything happened in my presence. I was hearing everything. I saw when the bandits were going away with these children but there was nothing I could do. Government is not helping matters at all saying this, saying that, yet we cannot see anything on the ground.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

They also kidnapped 14 others and set ablaze a military armoured personnel vehicle in the community.\n\nA resident of the community, Nuhu Dansadau, who confirmed the incident to THISDAY in a telephone interview said the bandits invaded the community at about 2:45am and operated till 6:am before they whisked away the 14 residents.\n\nHe said the bandits besieged the community and fired several shots in the air and then went into some houses and abducted the 14 p\n\neople, including children and women, saying several people in the community fled for safety.\n\nHe added that the invaders also injured seven other residents before they burnt the military armoured personnel vehicle, stating that despite the ongoing peace and reconciliation programme being run by the state government, killing and kidnapping of innocent people remained the order of the day in Zamfara.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs we speak, one of the injured victims has been moved to Federal Medical Centre, Gusau. The 14 kidnapped victims include seven children, three women and four men. The military armoured personnel vehicle while trying to fight the bandits hit a pole and the soldiers abandoned it and ran away.

          "text": "*Emir of Daura urges President to remain focused on securing Nigeria\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday warned contractors and businessmen who have enjoyed government\u2019s patronage against bribing him and other top government officials, including ministers.\n\nRather, he advised the affected contractors to be alive to their Corporate Social Responsibilities (CSR) through which they could give back to the immediate community where they operate.\n\nThis is just as the President\u2019s son, Yusuf Buhari, was named the new Talban Daura by the Emir of Daura, Dr Umar Faruk Umar.\n\nThe President, according to a statement issued by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, gave the warning against bribery, while on a visit to the Emir of Daura, urging businessmen, contractors and other privileged Nigerians who are beneficiaries of government\u2019s patronage to always engage in CSR, instead of seeking to favor individuals with gifts.\n\nPresident Buhari said pointedly, \u201cI don\u2019t want your cheque. Go and assist our communities instead of trying to return kickbacks to public officers, including my office.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want cheques from anyone or organisation as returns or influence of any kind. Let them remember their Corporate Social Responsibilities.\u201d\n\nThe President noted that he would love to visit Daura more frequently, but for the high cost of presidential movements and exposing security personnel to the weather, assuring that his heart remains with the people.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are known for farming and I have my farm here. I could come every two weeks and no one can stop me. But the cost of the movement is high. I would rather that it be used to better our schools, clinics and hospitals.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari said the grace of God had kept Nigeria together as a country in spite of differences that led to a 30-month civil war.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe want to thank God always for keeping us together as a country. From January 15, 1966, the country was thrown into political crisis. We had 30 months civil war that resulted in the loss of about a million lives.\n\n\u201cWe still thank God for keeping us together. We remain grateful to all those who showed interest in our unity and progress. May God continue to bless them.\u201d\n\nThe President, who recalled fond memories of his visit to the palace as a military Head of State, expressed happiness that the warmth and hospitality of the traditional institution had been sustained over the years.\n\nIn his remarks, the Emir of Daura, thanked the President for always creating time to visit his hometown and the palace despite his tight schedule.\n\n\u201cYour visit to Daura reflects your good character which we are very proud of. I can assure you that men, women, children, marketers and artisans are always pleased to receive you and they will be praying for you. Today is not for speeches but for appreciation. We have been blessed so much as a community because you are the leader of the country. You have brought honour to our domain.\n\n\u201dAs a community, we have benefited a lot with increased traffic of people and organisations coming to help us here. We know it\u2019s because of you. May the good Lord always go before you and behind you, and remove all obstacles from your path,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Emir enjoined the President to remain focused on getting results particularly in securing the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria is lucky to have you at this time. I am not saying it to please you, but if you had not been in power it would have been very difficult. I doubt if we will be here today.\u201d\n\nEmir Faruk also publicly announced conferment of the title of Talban Daura on the President\u2019s son, Yusuf Buhari.\n\nAccording to him, a date would be announced for the turbaning ceremony of the President\u2019s son, which might likely be before his marriage.\n\nThe Emir also announced the creation of a District in the President\u2019s community, with headquarters in Dimurkol.\n\nHe said the turbaning of young Buhari and creation of the District was to further extend and deepen the long relationship between the Palace and the family.\n\nThe royal father said the decision was in agreement with the kingmakers in Daura Emirate Council.\n\nDuring the presidential visit, the Palace used the opportunity to clarify the difference between two titles, Talban Hausa, given to the President of Guinea, Alpha Conde and Talban Daura designated for Yusuf, the President\u2019s son.\n\nThe Palace explained that Daura, as the linchpin of the Hausa society, had conferred titles that have bearing on the Hausa Kingdom and those that are specific to the Emirate.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "One of the pastors of the Living Faith Church Worldwide, who was recently dismissed, has explained how some of his colleagues were sending fake church attendance figures and church offerings to the state headquarters so as to keep their jobs \u2013 a practice which some of them could not do.\n\nThe pastor, in his account obtained by SaharaReporters, stated that the pastors who indulged in the act had a parley with some of the senior church ministers, who deducted part of their (the pastors\u2019) salaries and remitted back to the church as offerings of the non-existent congregation.\n\nDavid Oyedepo\n\nThe pastor, who did not want to mention his name to avoid victimisation, added that the practice was called \u201cwisdom\u201d since the founder, Bishop David Oyedepo, was not able to go round and ascertain the authenticity of the figures and offerings being entered into the records.\n\nHe said, \u201cWell, they (Living Faith) planted over 10,000 churches before the end of 2020 and they celebrated it. After this were the different issues of no church hall and other necessary materials for the pastors to work. But some senior Pastors keep telling lies that we (the employed pastors) should be patient with them.\n\n\u201cWhile this was going on, we must send reports of the churches to the headquarters through the area church. This was so that they would believe the church existed. Now, guess what number a pastor without church hall would send.\n\n\u201cBut wisdom was what the senior pastors were asking us to use because, Oyedepo could not be everywhere to check. What wisdom was that? Send good figure as the number of the attendance of your assembly; then put money to it from your salary. At the end of the month, half of the money you put would still be paid back to you to support the church you claimed existed. Nobody would ask you how you spend it and all your needs will be attended to quickly from the state headquarters.\n\n\u201cThey call it father and son relationship in the Winners family. It is not by mouth but by envelopes that have cash inside. All these were what we were facing; no church hall and other things but attendance must prove that the church was growing.\n\n\u201cThose of us who could not do that were called lazy, fools, unfruitful, and so on.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had on Friday reported that the pastors said they were being a net salary of only N38,000 as against the over N150,000 being rumoured in some quarters.\n\nSee Also Christianity How Oyedepo's Living Faith Church Paid Graduate Pastors N38,000 Monthly \u2014 Another Pastor Opens Up",

          "title": "CBN regulations holding back mobile money revolution in Nigeria",
          "text": "In Ghana, it would be an \u201canomaly\u201d for a supermarket, small store, or business merchant to not use a mobile money service for transactions. Daniel, a colleague at TechCabal, who visited Ghana two weeks ago said the same during a recent meeting.\n\nMobile money was first introduced in Ghana in 2009. However, it took some time for it to gain traction due to a restrictive Branchless Banking policy of the Bank of Ghana.\n\nNew agent and electronic money guidelines were released in 2014, allowing network operators to run mobile money services, with supervision from the banking regulator.\n\nEver since, players such as MTN have invested heavily in mobile money operations with great success. The telco giant launched its MoMo service in January 2017. By January 2019, over 100,000 merchants were using the service.\n\nUptake in mobile money services and financial inclusion have equally increased across the country. A March 2020 Summary of Economic and Financial Data published by the Bank of Ghana showed that the country had 14.7 million active mobile money accounts and 235,000 active agents.\n\nOn the other end of the cardinal point is M-Pesa\u2019s success in East African countries, particularly Kenya. The mobile money service, owned and operated by telco Safaricom, has significantly contributed to improving the financial inclusion rate in Nairobi.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the government is banking on a mobile money service run by the state-owned network operator, Ethio Telecom, to increase financial inclusion among low-income groups. The service soared to more than 1 million registered users in one week, 4 million in a month, and 6 million in two months.\n\nDespite being home to Africa\u2019s largest unbanked population, Nigeria has not witnessed the same exponential growth in mobile money adoption and lags behind its regional peers when it comes to penetration.\n\nChasing financial inclusion\n\nFinancial inclusion for 200 million Nigerians has been a much-touted priority of Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration and the central bank under governor Godwin Emefiele\u2019s leadership. Still, it\u2019s a goal that has been elusive.\n\nNigeria has a significantly large population without access to financial services. In 2017, it was home to 3.4% of the world\u2019s unbanked people despite contributing 2.6% to the global population.\n\nSome progress has been made over the past decade to bring more Nigerians under the formal financial system, according to a report by EFinA, but the figures remain disturbing.\n\nAt the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked as the central bank missed out on its 80% national financial inclusion target. In addition, just over 40 million out of an estimated 105.5 million Nigerian adults have bank verification numbers (BVN), an important metric for gauging how many people have access to financial services.\n\nThe CBN has adopted several measures \u2013 such as the creation of special Payment Services Banks (PSBs) in 2018 \u2013 to drive financial inclusion.\n\nHowever, the apex bank has shown reluctance towards adopting a framework that has proved to be very effective in improving financial inclusion in many African countries: telecoms-driven mobile money services.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nPayment service banks, not mobile money operators\n\nIn 2018, CBN announced a new regime that would allow non-financial companies to apply for mobile banking licences \u2013 either as PSBs or Mobile Money Operators (MMOs).\n\nUnder the guidelines, mobile network operators are allowed to provide financial services to millions of unbanked Nigerians. However, they can do so only as payment service banks and through a subsidiary separate from their core operations.\n\nPayment service banks are like small-scale banks. While they\u2019re similar to typical banks, the scope of their license is strictly to deepen financial inclusion and the regulator forbids them from engaging in credit risk and foreign exchange operations.\n\nMore than two years after the CBN\u2019s announcement, just three companies (including mobile operators 9mobile and Globacom) have been granted PSB licences. The two other network companies in the country, MTN and Airtel, are yet to get a regulatory nod to launch their Payment Service Banks. Although the former launched an agent network for money transfers in 2019.\n\nThe lack of progress on licences \u2013 particularly for two telcos that have significant mobile money experience in other markets in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 calls into question how dedicated the central bank is to really broaden access to financial services in the country.\n\nSome industry stakeholders blame the issue on lobbying by traditional financial institutions said to be wary of telco-led mobile money services. Banks perceive that network operators would claim their territory if allowed to offer standalone financial services.\n\nAccording to one telecom industry expert who asked not to be named, the \u201cbig banks are fighting back behind the scenes to ensure telcos don\u2019t come to have their lunch.\u201d\n\nWill telcos ever lead?\n\nIn Nigeria, the mobile money landscape is dominated by banks, technology, and financial services companies. Contrary to what is seen in Kenya and Ghana, telecoms operators are not allowed to apply directly for mobile money licences and are instead restricted to the provision of network infrastructure for the use of mobile money operators.\n\nThe regulatory framework is one of the core reasons why mobile money uptake has been relatively slow in Nigeria. As of 2019, there were just over 15 million mobile money accounts in the country, compared to nearly 60 million in Kenya, which is home to fewer than 55 million people.\n\nFintech companies have recorded significant strides towards advancing financial inclusion in Nigeria. Companies such as Paga and Teamapt democratise access to financial services through their agent networks and mobile payments infrastructure.\n\nBut telecoms companies are more positioned to deepen mobile money services due to their subscriber numbers, available infrastructure, and broader agent networks, which outnumber those of banks and fintechs. MTN and Airtel agents can be seen selling recharge cards in nearly every corner of the country.\n\n\u201cThe telecoms industry has ready infrastructure and resources to push financial inclusion all over the country. If you truly want to deepen the use of mobile technology for financial service, the last mile to reach the people is through network operators,\u201d the expert said.\n\nThere have been calls for a more liberalised regulatory framework where telcos lead. However, if the CBN\u2019s latest mobile money regulatory framework published July 9 is anything to go by, network operators will continue to play the second fiddle in Nigeria\u2019s mobile money space under the current administration.\n\nIn the new framework, the banking regulator reiterates its long-held stance that Nigeria will not adopt the model in which telecommunications companies are the drivers of mobile money services.\n\n\u201cThe CBN recognises the importance of Mobile Network Operators in the operations of mobile money services and appreciates the criticality of the infrastructure they provide. However, the telco-led model (where the lead initiator is an MNO) shall not be operational in Nigeria,\u201d the 40-page document reads.\n\nThe framework stated only two acceptable models for the implementation of mobile money services: bank-led (bank and/or its consortium as lead initiator) and non-bank-led (a corporate organisation duly licensed by the CBN as lead initiator).\n\nAlthough the CBN says it recognises the importance of telecoms companies in providing the infrastructure to drive the exchange of messages for mobile payments, it feels compelled to prohibit the Telco-led option. This, according to the bank, is to \u201cretain full control of monetary policy operations, minimise risks and ensure that the offering of financial services is driven by organisations that have been licensed to do so.\u201d\n\nAfter failing to meet its 2020 target, the CBN has revised its financial inclusion goal to 95% by 2024. But with its continued regulatory conservatism towards telecoms-led mobile money, the regulator is likely to find it only more difficult to bring millions of unbanked Nigerians into the financial system.\n\n\u201cCBN\u2019s models will only slow down financial inclusion penetration,\u201d the expert said. \u201cInstead, telecoms companies should be allowed to take the lead in the mobile money space as seen in other African countries. This is the only way speedy coverage and easy access can be achieved and financial inclusion improved.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "This app wants to simplify Twitter giveaways, without bank accounts",
          "text": "Let\u2019s say I wanted to send a surprise \u2018happy birthday\u2019 cash gift to a friend; my first thought would be to ask for their bank account number. I would do this for people I know very well but also for someone I only know on social media.\n\nBut what if my virtual friend, feeling we are not buddies as such or having been scarred by online money doubling scams, hesitates to share such personal information? Can I thrill them on their special day by using public information I have about them?\n\nSometime in June, I tried Vendly, a web app that is trialling a solution for this need (or desire, if you\u2019re not yet persuaded). \u2018Payments made Social\u2019 the landing page declares on a light green background. Bob Nzelu, the brain behind it, described it to me as a way to share and receive items of digital value \u2013 money, crypto, airtime, e-tickets \u2013 over social media.\n\n\u201cLike sending money through email addresses using PayPal, Vendly hopes to replicate that using social media handles,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that is just the basic use case he anticipates, cutting in to assuage my skepticism that money transfer on social media is a compelling enough value to build a (potentially venture-backed) company on. Long-term, Vendly will help social media users monetize their social media presence, the CEO said.\n\nBack to social money vending. Nzelu believes Vendly is similar to Cash App and Venmo because it seeks to simplify transfers between people who don\u2019t know each other. \u201cVendly is not built for chummy friends who have each other\u2019s account details.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor this type of relationship, creating a \u2018vend\u2019 with a social media handle and sharing the link with a beneficiary walks a fine line of not being too personal or invasive while caring.\n\nIt\u2019s the online equivalent of a co-worker dropping a birthday cake with a card at your desk but not inside your drawer.\n\nSomeone who receives a vend can decide to either make a claim for or ignore it by clicking the link in their DM. The message states the amount sent; recipient inputs the bank account where they want the cash to go. And like cakes, the link expires after some time (Nzelu sent me a vend of about $1 as a demo).\n\nVendly stores the recipient\u2019s bank details to make future transfers seamless but the sender never sees the account information. Because a sender can create one vend to go to multiple social media handles, Nzelu thinks it should appeal to brands or influencers who target giveaways at 3 million Nigerian social media users who have a bank account and phone number.\n\nVendly is part of a crop of social gifting apps seeking to delight people online.\n\nA few months ago, after my managing editor promised to get me a book, I got a Tweet from Showlove, a Lagos-based company, with a voucher to claim my books at a particular bookstore (thanks again, KK). Getcards, a product of the cryptocurrency startup Buycoins, was floated last December for people who want to gift services like a Netflix subscription, an Amazon or Delta airlines ticket to friends and family.\n\nLike these two services, Vendly hopes that its first platform for traction will be Twitter, because the platform is the most friendly for services that require people to click links to claim rewards.\n\nBut Nzelu knows that can\u2019t be the long-term plan. After all, Twitter is officially banned in Nigeria at the moment, an event that currently hampers Vendly\u2019s ability to be fully functional. An alternative is to send vends using phone numbers, although that option might raise privacy concerns. Integrating other platforms \u2013 Instagram, Facebook \u2013 is on their roadmap.\n\nRight now, Vendly is a prototype undergoing iteration. It may yet face hard questions about monetization, like Abeg\u2019s mobile app which launched last year to enable peer-to-peer money transfers using social handles. But Nzelu says Vendly will answer most user concerns at launch in a few weeks.\n\nHe\u2019s been working at it for two years now and feels the time is right to tap into the social and creator economy bump that started last year. Being Nigerian, his home country is the market of choice. But if it proves tough for a start, Vendly will seek initial users in Ghana, Kenya and Uganda.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Telecommunications infrastructure owned by several mobile network operators was severely damaged in the rampant looting and destruction of property that rocked South Africa last week.\n\nThe Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) revealed on Tuesday, July 13, that the vandalism included more than 100 mobile network towers in some parts of the country.\n\nAfter the statement, rioters destroyed many more mobile sites, according to multiple reports. Virtually all network providers operating in South Africa reported disruption to service delivery.\n\nMTN alone reported damage to over 100 of its base stations which the company\u2019s technicians could not safely reach the sites to repair.\n\n\u201cOver 1,000 MTN employees can\u2019t get to work, and millions of calls and queries from our customers cannot be attended to, as our primary call centre remains inaccessible,\u201d MTN South Africa chief executive, Godfrey Motsa, said Friday.\n\nAccording to Vodacom spokesperson, Byron Kennedy, there was a connectivity issue that affected customers in many parts of the country. Like MTN, the crisis prevented its staff from fixing a fault in its infrastructure.\n\n\u201cUnrest in these areas meant that it wasn\u2019t safe for technicians to immediately visit affected sites physically to remedy faults,\u201d Kennedy was quoted as saying by MyBroadband. An estimated five to ten of Vodacom\u2019s base stations at malls were also damaged by fires.\n\nData-only operator Rain, which has a lease agreement for using Vodacom\u2019s network towers, also said it has sites in the affected areas that had been vandalised and were down. The network provider operates in South Africa\u2019s major metropolitan areas with 3,000 towers.\n\nChildren are evacuated from a burning building in downtown Durban, South Africa. Image credit: AP via NZHerald\n\nOnly Cell C\u2019s facilities had not experienced significant damage from the unrest as of Friday, according to its chief operations officer Andre Ittman.\n\nJust one of its network towers was vandalised within the Durban area but it did not affect service delivery to consumers.\n\nAccording to Ittman, there are six other sites available within a two-kilometre radius of the damaged site, which helped to absorb the coverage provided to ensure customers stayed connected.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe ongoing unrest in South Africa, said to be the worst since the end of the apartheid regime 27 years ago, was sparked by the imprisonment of former president Jacob Zuma.\n\nLast month, the ex-leader was sentenced to 15 months jail time for defying an order to provide evidence at a judicial inquiry set up to probe high-level corruption during his nine-year tenure (from 2009 \u2013 2018).\n\nProtests swiftly degenerated into violent marches and looting. Hundreds of businesses have been destroyed and more than 200 people have died.\n\nSouth African authorities believe the unrest was deliberately provoked by political opponents to force president Cyril Ramaphosa to pardon Zuma or even step down.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The Pasteur Institute in Senegal will produce rapid antigen tests for diagnosing the coronavirus disease from early 2022 with the help of a new tech transfer agreement.\n\nThe Dakar-based centre is partnering with Bionote, a South Korean company that provides diagnostic solutions for Covid-19, and Mologic, a British biotech company set to be acquired by a Bill Gates-backed consortium.\n\nAn antigen test is regarded as a suitable \u2018first line of defense\u2019 against the coronavirus disease for individuals who have symptoms. It is a simpler and quicker procedure compared to other approaches like PCR testing.\n\nA typical antigen testing takes around 15 minutes to determine whether a patient is infected, although it is less accurate than PCR, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe agreement between Pasteur and the companies was disclosed in a statement from two international health agencies, UNITAID and FIND, a global alliance for diagnostics, as reported by Reuters.\n\n\u201cHigh-quality antigen tests are the primary diagnostic tool for detecting active infection in poorer settings where molecular testing is not available,\u201d the statement read.\n\nUnder the deal, the technology and expertise for making the Covid tests will be passed from the foreign pharmaceutical giants to Pasteur\u2019s DiaTROPIX, a diagnostic test production unit launched in November. The goal is to boost Covid detection in Africa.\n\n\u201cExpanded production capacity in local and regional hubs is critical to ensuring that healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries can implement effective testing strategies to contain the spread of the virus,\u201d UNITAID spokesman Herve Verhoosel, said.\n\nDiaTROPIX will seek regulatory approval in Senegal for the tests transferred from Mologic and Bionote and commercialise them under its own brand. It plans to make 2.5 million tests per month in 2022, according to the statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnprecedented surge in infections\n\nCompared to its regional peers like South Africa and Nigeria, Senegal has seen fewer coronavirus-related cases and deaths.\n\nDakar has so far recorded more than 52,000 infections and 1,220 deaths since the outbreak started. The numbers pale in comparison to South Africa\u2019s (2.24 million infections and 65,000+ deaths) and Nigeria\u2019s (169,000+ infections and 2,000+ deaths).\n\nHowever, the rapid antigen test deal involving the Pasteur Institute comes at a time when Senegal is grappling with soaring coronavirus cases.\n\nAccording to health ministry spokesman Mamadou Ndiaye, the West African nation was seeing an \u201cunprecedented\u201d surge in Covid infections. He said this after a new daily record of 733 cases was recorded, beating the previous record of 529 cases.\n\nMore than 25% of the 2,854 tests carried out in the past 24 hours to Wednesday came back positive, according to Ndiaye.\n\nVaccinations have been slow, making Senegal vulnerable to fresh surges. Out of over 16 million people, only 590,969 have been vaccinated. Senegal lacks enough doses to vaccinate everyone, like most African countries.\n\nSenegalese authorities are expecting 165,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine and 300,000 doses of China\u2019s Sinopharm shots, Ndiaye said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Who invented Chapman?",
          "text": "There are many popular cocktails such as Tequila Sunrise, Pink Mimosa, and also Nigeria\u2019s very own Chapman cocktail, also known as the non-alcoholic punch. The Chapman is known around Nigeria and in many parts of the world and it carries fond memories for many Nigerians. On the occasion of Nigeria at 60, it is important to highlight all things that are dear to Nigerians and the Chapman is one of them.\n\nIf you live in or have visited Nigeria or most parts of the world for that matter, chances are that you have tasted a Chapman or, at the least, heard of it. You can go into any restaurant and ask for a Chapman and the bartender will know exactly what you\u2019re asking for.\n\nBut who holds the rights to this invention and recipe?\n\nThe Chapman is on almost every menu in the country and is loved by millions across Nigeria, Africa, and many parts of the world but unfortunately, like many indigenous inventions, the origin of the Chapman on the internet is overshadowed by a lot of misinformation.\n\nLike many popular dishes and cocktails, there\u2019s a longstanding debate over who actually created this cocktail. One theory that is widely believed is that the cocktail originated in Ikoyi Club, Lagos, Nigeria, and was created by a bartender at the country club who was asked to make something special for his favorite British customer named \u2018Chapman\u2019.\n\nThe beginnings\n\nBefore I go any further, let me take you out of \u2026 the mystery: The Chapman drink was not created in Ikoyi Club and it was not created for or by a Mr. Chapman. The Chapman was created by a man called Mr. Sam Alamutu who was later to become known as Apostle Samuel Alamutu of Ogun State.\n\nHe was one of the select young Nigerians to be offered a scholarship to study in the UK \u2013 as part of Awolowo\u2019s program of educating the Western region \u2013 and studied Catering and Hotel Management at the Huddersfield Polytechnic, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England before returning home in 1958. He later also obtained a Postgraduate Diploma at the Centre for Management Development, University of Cambridge, England, and became a prominent professional Hotelier.\n\nThe kindness of love and the creation of the Chapman\n\nAs a prominent hotelier, Mr. Samuel Alamutu spent most of his time in top Nigerian hotels. The nature of his work and position afforded him many opportunities to wine and dine with his family and friends both at home and in his workplace. Mr.Samuel Alamutu attended a lot of functions and was a connoisseur of top-quality wine and champagne from around the world. According to his daughter Sola Alamutu who provided the context for this piece \u201c, he was quick to pop open a bottle of wine or champagne on special occasions.\u201d Mr. Samuel Alamutu was a family man and when he was out with his beloved wife, she would turn down any offer of alcoholic drink and instead ask for soft drinks \u2013 either Fanta, sprite, or ginger ale.\n\nThis became a huge bother for Mr. Samuel Alamutu, which prompted him to gather a handful of people and decided to create something a little more exotic that his wife could have at functions, especially those functions hosted by him. He started experimenting with different drinks and eventually came up with a mix of lemon and orange drink with a dash of Angostura bitters (which are from Trinidad and Tobago) and always on the rocks! Et voil\u00e0! His wife loved it and so did everyone else. With the positive reviews that he had garnered, he took it a step further and garnished it with cucumber, a lemon slice and topped it off with a cherry on a toothpick, and that is how the famous drink was created and spread across the world, thanks to a man\u2019s love for his wife.\n\nMr. Samuel Alamutu\n\nHow the Chapman spread across the world\n\nAccording to his daughter Sola Alamutu, Ikoyi Hotel in Lagos was the first place the Chapman was created for the public. Samuel Alamutu also introduced it to other hotels across the country, in addition to the Ikoyi hotel and the others in the NHL chain of hotels which he managed covering Jos, Lagos, Kano (Central Hotel), Sokoto, Maiduguri (Lake Chad Hotel), Calabar.\n\nThis is how the Chapman drink started to spread in Nigeria and the world. As a very well-traveled man, he formed relationships with hotels and restaurateurs in countries such as Ghana, Sierra Leone, Gambia, and other African countries. During his travels to the UK, he enjoyed visiting different restaurants and made many friends.\n\nAt the time, many of the top hotels were indeed occupied by British guests, which is the root of the confusion that it is a British invention. Everybody loved the Chapman and many British people did spread the gospel of the infamous drink.To set the record straight, let us clearly state here that the Chapman is a Nigerian invention created by Mr. Samuel Alamutu of Ogun State.\n\nRead also: The fury of floods and food insecurity\n\nAbout Mr. Samuel Alamutu\n\nSamuel Alamutu, MON, FIH (UK), FNHCI also fondly called \u2018Daddy\u2019 Alamutu by his children, was born on the 13th of November 1933, at Ifo Town near Abeokuta, Ogun State. He was the 4th of 5 children of the Late Mr. Ameen Badru Oreitan Alamutu of Mokola, Ilugun, Abeokuta, and the late Alhaja Asimohu Subuol Abeke (nee Akinlawo of Ikija, Abeokuta). He attended primary school at the Holy Trinity and later the famous Abeokuta Grammar School, Oke-Igbein, Abeokuta, Ogun State from 1947 to 1952 under the principalship of the late indefatigable educationist \u2013 Rev. I. O. Ransome-Kuti.\n\nIn December of 1952, he passed the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate Examination when he left Abeokuta Grammar School and worked briefly from 1953 to 1955 at the Nigerian Railway Corporation and the Federal Board of Inland Revenue Department of the Federal Civil Service, respectively, before proceeding to the United Kingdom in 1955 to study with the scholarship obtained from the Western Region Government.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1958, he studied Catering and Hotel Management at the Huddersfield Polytechnic, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England as part of Awolowo\u2019s program of educating the West and mingled with catering specialists such as Ade Adefeso and Wale Akinrinade. He collected an array of impressive credentials before returning home to Nigeria in August 1958. He later obtained a Postgraduate Diploma at the Centre for Management Development, University of Cambridge, England, and became the most prominent professional Hotelier.\n\nIn September of 1958, he joined the Nigeria Hotels Limited (the largest \u2013 Federal Government-owned group in Nigeria) and worked there in various capacities for 25 years of meritorious service, until his voluntary retirement in October 1983 from the position of Managing Director and Chief Executive of the Company. He then became the director of the Lagos Hotels Limited, Hill Station Hotel Limited, Jos, Western Hotels Limited, and Cross River Hotels Limited.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1965 he also served as Training Consultant to the Sierra Leone Government for their Paramount Hotel and Cape Sierra Hotel, Freetown respectively.\n\nHe was also the director of Nigeria Tourist Board and the first National President, Nigeria Hotel and Catering Institute, the Chairman of Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation and the pioneer Chairman, Hotel and Personal Services Employers\u2019 Association of Nigeria.\n\nIn 1978, he was conferred with the National Honours Award of M. O. N. (Member of the Order of the Niger) for his pioneering work and dedication to the Hotel, Catering, and Tourism Industry in Nigeria.\n\nMr. Samuel Alamutu was the longest-serving Managing Director/Chief Executive of the Nigeria Hotels Limited before retiring to establish his own Hotel Management and Consultancy Company \u2013 Modern Hotels Limited \u2013 for which he was Executive Chairman.\n\nBetween 1988- 1998 he owned and managed Park restaurant, in central Lagos. The restaurant was renowned for its haute cuisine and first-class international service. His daughter, Sola Alamutu aka Green queen who, incidentally, also studied Hospitality management like her father, was the restaurant manager.\n\nMr. Samuel Alamutu loved music, which was an integral part of his life. He was also an avid dancer. He had a passion for photography and took pictures of absolutely everything and loved sports, practicing sports such as lawn tennis and swimming but also indoor games such as table tennis, scrabble, ludo, and monopoly. He was loved by his family friends and peers.\n\nDaddy Alamutu passed away on the 17th of December 2011 but his legacy lives on. He leaves behind his beloved and 5 children.\n\nThe volume of misinformation and ambiguity on the origins of this monumental African drink raises many questions: Mainly how do we protect Nigerian/African inventions and intellectual property? How do we ensure that history is properly told and recorded?\n\nThere is a company in the United Kingdom that has patented \u2018CHAPMANS\u2019 as trademarked in the UK, which is unfortunate, as it is not in any way linked back to its real creator. In Africa we continue to have intellectual property issues and I think It will be interesting to see how this story and many other similar ones, evolve.",

          "text": "The breach of essential preventive measures for COVID-19 has contributed to the rise of a third wave in Nigeria, according to the centre for disease control, but this has been poorly communicated.\n\nSeven months ago, in the wake of a second wave that saw COVID-19 cases shooting up from 122 to an all-time-high of 2,314 in January, communication from the government on the state of things was at a relative high level.\n\nThe Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19, in the company of key agencies such as the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPCDA) held frequent briefings, highlighting the danger lurking.\n\nRead Also: With 1,301 new infections, Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 cases rise to 111,305\n\nBut as a third wave looms with more than 100 percent rise in daily caseloads, the convergence of communication from these government bodies has nosedived.\n\nThe presidential committee has stopped meeting for daily briefings and all communications have been split through individual channels of ministries and agencies.\n\nThis is unfortunately a post-Twitter-ban era, when agencies such as the NCDC, NPHCDA or state ministries of health no longer enjoy the widespread visibility that comes with tweeting updates on new case confirmations, deaths or recoveries for all to see.\n\nOsagie Ehanire, the minister of health, admitted to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance on Thursday that the setting up of the PSC with relevant ministries and agencies as a response mechanism had given strong support to the fight against the pandemic.\n\nCommunication for the NCDC, for instance, has reduced to posting updates on its official website, cutting the length of reach to many Nigerians who had become conscious of the data around the pandemic.\n\nThe centre has a lot to say and reiterate to the population as cases keep rising but it seems withdrawn to winking in the dark.\n\nThe last four days have seen cases sustained at over 200, a situation Chike Ihekweazu, director-general, NCDC, told BusinessDay was being fuelled by continued breach of preventive measures.\n\nThis coupled with the faster spread of Delta, the latest variant of concern that is rocking most countries.\n\n\u201cThere are varying factors associated with an increase in COVID-19 cases. Many countries across the world are experiencing periods of surges in COVID-19 infections. In most countries, this has been associated with the Delta variant of the virus, which has increased transmissibility,\u201d Ihekweazu explained in a mailed response to BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, as the virus spreads when people are in contact with others, the resumption of social gatherings with poor adherence to public health and social measures are contributing to an increase in cases,\u201d he said.\n\nThe pandemic is far from over, according to the director-general, and the recent rise in cases in Nigeria highlights the urgent need for people to take personal and collective responsibility.\n\nIf preventive measures such as avoiding large gatherings, wearing a face mask properly in public, regular hand washing with clean water and soap or using alcohol-based hand sanitiser are abandoned for carefreeness, some could suffer the risk posed by the virus.\n\nThe Delta variant is tearing through unvaccinated populations, presenting a huge risk to health workers, older populations and those with underlying conditions.\n\n\u201cIt is also very important to get vaccinated as this provides protection against the disease,\u201d he said, noting, \u201cIt is critical that we do all these now as we still have a window of opportunity to prevent a surge in COVID-19 cases in Nigeria and its devastating impact on lives and livelihood.\u201d\n\nThese vital pieces of information could have been shared on Twitter. But the government has maintained a draconian suspension on the social media application, accusing its management of undermining its sovereignty.\n\nAbubakar Malami, attorney-general of the Federation on Friday, told Nigerians to use alternative media such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Tiktok, among others, whereas most of these important agencies and ministries do not hold official accounts on these apps.\n\nUntil the government rescinds its action, it could be a long walk with a dark view for pandemic communication in the country.",

          "text": "Writing a compelling Curriculum Vitae (CV) is very important especially at a time when the job opportunities in Nigeria are reducing by the day.\n\nTo most recruiters or Human Resource (HR) professionals, a CV is the first advertisement of yourself to show the kind of person you are. This is why having a good, detailed and well written CV can help attract the right jobs.\n\nFive HR professionals polled in a Business Day survey gave tips on how to write a compelling CV that attracts employers.\n\nHere are some of the tips:\n\nJENNIFER OYELADE, director of Transquisite Consulting, an international human resource consultancy and expatriate management services\n\nWhen reviewing a CV to get the right candidates for interviews, I look at result-driven ones that stipulate the achievements of the applicants. Another aspect I pay attention to is the use of English and punctuation marks. That may sound basic, but I have to trash several CVs for this reason. I am a fan of long CVs, because I believe it conceptualises your personal experience.\n\nRead Also: Board readiness- Useful tips\n\nFor example, if I am hiring a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to manage a million dollar organisation, you will not hire a CFO with a two-page CV. So basically I like a CV that tells a story and is thought-provoking. Like why they took that exam, course, what professional development courses they did after their degrees and the reason. This gives the employer an insight into their thought process.\n\nWinnifred Omobolanle, Operations Lead at Utiva, an Edutech company\n\nThe first thing I look at when seeing CVs is neatness and presentation. If it doesn\u2019t tick these boxes, it just speaks to the individual\u2019s lack of excellent communication skills and disorderliness because in almost every job you see out there, communication skills are very important both written and oral.\n\nIt is also very important that people include and briefly explain their responsibilities on their current jobs. It is never enough to simply state the jobs, locations, duration or name of a company. It is helpful to list out the responsibilities you had on that job because employers want to see if a person can match the responsibilities that they want to recruit the person for.\n\nAdditionally, CVs should have the person\u2019s right and complete information. There are a lot of people that have holes in their CVs. For example, I wanted to recruit someone that had the right skills that I was looking for but the person only stated his email address but no phone number. Very sloppy.\n\nUnini Mosimabale, HR at Alles Charis Gas Limited\n\nA CV should have a professional summary of a few lines and should be written in the third person.

          "title": "INTERVIEW: Sex-for-roles not peculiar to Nollywood \u2013 Actress, Angela Eguavoen",
          "text": "Nollywood starlet, Angela Eguavoen, shot into the limelight after she bagged the role of Ivie in \u2018Enakhe\u2019, an Africa Magic original crime drama set in modern-day Benin City.\n\nShe has also starred in other productions like \u2018Inafe\u2019, \u2018Still Born\u2019, \u2018Dry Tears\u2019, \u2018The Clause\u2019, \u2018Old New Friend\u2019 among others. In this interview with PREMIUM TIMES, she speaks about her career and industry.\n\nPT: Can you take us through your acting journey?\n\nAngela: I\u2019ve been acting for a while. Altogether, I\u2019ve been acting for about five years. I\u2019ve done a couple of movies. I don\u2019t know if you guys have seen \u2018Inafe\u2019. I am one of the lead cast. I\u2019m also part of \u2018Blood of Enogie\u2019, which is directed by Charles Uwagbai and I was the main cast there. My character was Osato, \u2018the bad Queen\u2019. I had to stop acting at a time because of school and NYSC, so I started fully between 2016 and 2017.\n\nPT: Why acting?\n\nAngela: I\u2019ve always had an interest in acting after watching a couple of people act. I remember when I was watching TV then and my dad would be like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s your mate that is acting there\u2019, \u2018You can do it too\u2019. So, that was what ignited my interest in acting and for the fact that I\u2019ve always had the talent in me and I\u2019ll love to develop myself in the craft of acting.\n\nI love acting because it affords me the opportunity to be different people. I get to be a lot of different people at different times. That was what made me love this craft. I really love it.\n\nPT: So what was the experience like when you had to face the camera for the first time?\n\nAngela: It\u2019s nothing new to me because I was already acting in school. I studied English Literature Education, so I already know what it\u2019s about. Going into acting and facing the camera wasn\u2019t really a big deal for me. Fine, I hadn\u2019t honed my acting talent perfectly when I started but I got better with time. I had to improve my craft and this took a lot of personal effort.\n\nPT: Who are some of your role models in the industry?\n\nAngela: The people I watched growing up were Rita Dominic, Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde, Genevieve Nnaji, Mercy Johnson, and some other Nigerian actors. Let me not forget Kate Henshaw.\n\nPT: So, who are the actors you\u2019re dying to work with?\n\nAngela: First on the list is Genevieve. I love Genevieve, I really do love her. Next is Mercy Johnson. I can say Omotola and Rita Dominic will complete my Nigerian list. On the international scene, I have lots of actors that I would love to work and I can\u2019t start mentioning their names.\n\nPT: Is there a role that you probably won\u2019t accept, no matter the amount of money involved?\n\nAngela: There is no role I can\u2019t accept because I just feel that as actors while facing the camera, we can break out and fit into any role given to us. So, I feel that if the role is worth it and the money is worth it too, why not?\n\nPT: Even if it\u2019s a role that involves sex?\n\nAngela: When I get to that bridge, I\u2019ll cross it (laughs)\n\nPT: There\u2019s this notion that Nollywood actresses usually sleep their way to get roles or have a sexual relationship with producers to break even in Nollywood. Is this true?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAngela: As for me, Angela Eguavoen, I\u2019ve never had to sleep with any producer to get my roles. I\u2019ve earned every role that I\u2019ve ever played. There might be some people doing it but I don\u2019t believe it. If you sleep your way through with a director or producer and you\u2019re not a good actor, everyone will know that this one didn\u2019t deserve it or she did \u2018runz\u2019 to get to where they are.\n\nSo, I have never had to sleep with any producer and I don\u2019t know if that is the common practice. And then, this is what I\u2019ve always held on to, it is not only in this industry that people have to sleep their way through, it is everywhere.\n\nSex-for-role is just loud in our industry because we\u2019re in the entertainment sector and everybody sees you because you\u2019re in the limelight. If others do it, good for them, but I don\u2019t do it.\n\nPT: So, how do you think social media is impacting Nollywood?\n\nAngela: For actors, I feel social media is your active resume. That is why if you check my social media account, you\u2019ll always see me putting up my work in good pictures. I\u2019m not just all about the glam on my page. I show people that \u2018this is what I do\u2019, \u2018this is my talent\u2019.\n\nSo, show people what you\u2019re capable of doing on your page. Social media has helped me get so many jobs, I cannot deny that. Down to getting roles and getting gigs outside acting, it has been amazing. I am so grateful to the people that created Instagram, Twitter, and every Facebook platform because we\u2019re making money from it.\n\nPT: The government has recently banned Twitter. How is it affecting you as an actress?\n\nAngela: I\u2019m mainly tilted towards Instagram but yeah, Twitter is affecting everyone because there is a show of mine, \u2018Inafe\u2019 that is always viewed every day. We have a page, \u2018AM Inafe\u2019, where the followers talk about how they feel about the show and the performance. I get the chance to see their thoughts and opinions about my cast and every other character there. Now, I can\u2019t see those. Aside from that, I can\u2019t really say I\u2019m personally affected.\n\nPT: So far, have you experienced any challenging roles so far?\n\nAngela: There have been challenging roles. My role as Queen Osato in Blood of Enogie was very challenging. My role as Ovie in Inafe was challenging too. I got to be different people in different acts, it was 260 episodes, so there is no way I can remain the same person throughout. I went through different experiences in the production, suffering, and all of that. It was really tasking too.\n\nThere\u2019s also a film I just finished recently, it\u2019s called \u2018Benediction\u2019. It\u2019s not out yet but it will be showing on Rok TV. I had to play the role of a girl suffering from Amnesia. She doesn\u2019t have the ability to make or form new memories. She had an accident six years ago, so every morning when she wakes up, she thinks she\u2019s the girl she was six years ago and she retains that memory.

          "text": "Going by results from wards and council areas so far, the All Progressives Congress, APC, appears to have a strong chance of winning all of the slots in Saturday\u2019s Local Government elections to elect Chairmanship and Vice-Chairmanship, as well as councilorship officers into 20 Local Government Areas, LGAs, and 37 Local Council Development Areas, LCDAs.\n\nDespite apathy, glitches, and pockets of violence, the exercise was deemed to be mainly calm across the state.\n\nSecurity apparatus were adequately deployed across the polling areas in the metropolis to ensure safety of lives and property of citizens. They were seen moving in convoy patrolling some areas.\n\nCommander of the Rapid Response Team, RRS, of the Lagos Police Command, Chief Superintendent of Police, CSP, Yinka Egbeyemi, led a t of personnel to trouble prone areas to maintain peace.\n\nLASIEC, had earlier stated that the results of the polls would be announced by the presiding officers at each polling unit and subsequently, the final results will be announced by it after collations across councils.\n\nOne of the early results received by NEWS DIRECT showed APC sweeping the votes in Iba LCDA. Ward E, pulling unit 022 update showed councilorship.\n\nAPC 93, APGA 1, PDP. 11\n\nWhile chairmanship recorded APC 98, APGA 0, PDP 3, void 4.\n\nIt\u2019s also gathered that the youngest council chairman, under the APC platform in Coker-Aguda LCDA, emerged winner with an emphatic result. Details of results were still been awaited as of press time.\n\nSame reports of APC winning filtered in from such councils as; Oriade, Oshodi, Apapa, Ono, Amuwo-Odofin, Surulere, Agege, Alimosho, Ikeja, Ikoyi, Ajeromi-Ifelodun, Ikorodu, Epe, Ipaja Mosan -Okunola, riverine areas in Badagry, among others.\n\nSituation reports\n\nMeantime, there was low turn out of voters in a contest with a total of 6,570,291 registered voters across 13,323 polling units in 20 LGAs and 37 LCDAs.\n\nIt\u2019s gathered that on the final list of candidates for the election according to LASIEC on the eve of exercise, a total of 133 candidates will be contesting for the office of the Chairman with 131 Vice Chairmanship candidates.\n\nOf the 133 candidates for the office for the Chairman, 16 are women and of the 131 Vice Chairman candidates, 106 are women. Indicating that the contesting parties fielded more women for the office of the Vice-Chairman.\n\nWhile 15 parties are to contest in the election, it was observed that an average of three political parties was on the ballot papers for both the LGA/LCDA chairman and council election.\n\nWhile experiencing some hitches in logistics, late opening and commencement of polls was a general observation across the state.\n\nSpecifically, Mushin, Ikoyi, Ikeja, Obalende, Amuwo-Odofin, Somolu, Surulere, among other LGAs, recorded late deployment of electoral materials.\n\nIt was observed that officials were still waiting to be deployed to their assigned polling units by 8:16 am. By 10:00 am, only 17 of the polling units visited in Mushin had polling officials present and were concluding set-up to commence accreditation and voting process.\n\nHowever, in Ward C Surulere and in Lawanson, Mushin LGA, most of the Polling Units did not have security personnel on-site as of 11 am.\n\nAdditionally, a few security personnel were seen on the streets of Lagos state.\n\nIt was also discovered that majority of political parties did not deploy party agents to the polls: APC and Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, agents were the only party agents seen in the majority of the polling units visited.\n\nWhile other party agents were seen in few polling units.\n\nCOVID-19 compliance\n\nNo strict compliance with COVID-19 Protocol: Though, it was observed that the provision of hand sanitizers and handheld infrared thermometers across the polling units, there was no enforcement on the usage.\n\nPolling officials and voters were not adhering to the COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical safety protocol and physical distancing.\n\nThere were reported cases of violence following violent disruption of the accreditation and voting process across polling units in Somolu LGA; this was caused by the confusion over the inclusion of a party name on the ballot.\n\nThe aggrieved party faulted the name printed on the ballot which had YP which is not one of the officially recognised political parties. In a few of the polling units, the YPP supporters protested the non-inclusion of their party on the ballot and asked voters to boycott the election.\n\nPre- exercise events\n\nRecall that in the run up to the exercise, People With Disabilities, PWDs, under the aegis of Centre for Citizens with Disabilities, CCD, accused the Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission, LASIEC, of plans to exclude over 2 million of their members from actively participating in the Juiy 24, council polls in Lagos State.\n\nExecutive Director of CCD, Mr. David Anyaele, stated this on Thursday, at a public presentation of findings on the pre-election assessment of LASIEC provisions for PWDs for July 24, 2021 Local Government elections, held in Maryland, Onigbongbo Local Council Development Area, LCDA, Ikeja.\n\nAccording to Anyaele: \u201cWe are worried that LASIEC has decided to exclude over 2 million PWDs in the July 24 council polls in Lagos.\u201d\n\nHe added that despite series of petitions, \u201cLASIEC has not complied with the provision of the law on inclusiveness of PWDs in the exercise.\n\n\u201cOur expectations with reference to election and voting process during the Covid-19 in the state, access should be provided for PWDs in the process and ensure no one is left behind in participating in the electoral process.\n\nAlso, an international election monitoring group, Yiaga Africa, on the eve of the exercise, stressed the need for LASIEC n ensuring free, fair and transparent exercise in order to boost citizens confidence in the council election process.\n\nThe group also expressed fears over possible apathy that could mar the exercise in view of the low sensitization of electorate.\n\nHowever, in situation reports released by YIaga at the end of voting signed by\n\nMr. Eze Nwagwu and Cynthia Mbamalu, both Board members, observed that voters were intimidated, harassed/assaulted in a few polling units during accreditation and voting, in Ward B Badagry LGA.\n\nAccording to Yiaga: \u201cThe findings presented in this statement are based on information received from the Watching The Vote, WTV observers on set-up, and the commencement of voting and accreditation at the polling units, Late opening of polls and deployment of polling materials:\n\n\u201cAs of 8:30 am, Yiaga Africa WTV observers reported that no polling official was seen in 61 of the polling units visited.\n\n\u201cPolling officials were deployed as expected: Majority of the polling units visited had an average of 2 polling officials present as stated in the LASIEC election guideline.\n\n\u201cElection essential materials were adequately deployed: WTV tracked the presence of essential materials such as the register of voters, polling official stamp, voting cubicle, ink pad, ballot boxes, incident form and polling unit booklet in polling units.\n\n\u201cThese materials and many more were seen in most of the polling units that were opened. However, the WTV observers reported that the majority of the Smart Card Readers were not fully charged.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the reports indicate that the Smart Card Readers were not used in some of the polling units visited.\n\n\u201cWTV observers reported that voters were intimidated, harassed/assaulted in a few polling units during accreditation and voting, in Ward B Badagry LGA.\n\n\u201cAttack on WTV Observer: In PU 008, Ward B Badagry, an observer was beaten up for recording an attempt to snatch a ballot box by a party agent.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, YIaga Africa called on all political parties and candidates, LASIEC and security agencies to play their parts in ensuring a credible election.\n\n\u201cYiaga Africa with her citizen observers is observing the election on behalf of the people of Lagos State and Nigeria, to ensure people\u2019s votes are accurately counted,\u201d Nwagwu stated.",

How that right will be given full expression when court proceedings are within the encrypted confines of virtual platforms is really the subject of our conversion today.\n\n\u201cThe Attorneys General of Lagos and Ekiti States deserve our commendation for bringing the matter before the Supreme Court. They asked the court to determine whether having regard to the constitutional requirement that court proceedings, save for some exceptions, must be held in public and whether court hearings by the use of technology, by remote hearings of any kind, whether Zoom or WhatsApp, Microsoft Themes, Skype or any other audio-visual or video-conference platform are constitutional.\n\nProf Osinbajo noted that, \u201cThe Supreme Court while dismissing the suits themselves as premature and speculative nevertheless said that as things stood today virtual proceedings were Constitutional. This wise approach of the Court probably saved our system of justice another catastrophic round of technical decisions around the constitutionality of virtual proceedings\n\nThe Vice President stated that, \u201cIt may also be cautiously taken as a signal that the Supreme Court expects the lower courts to go down this new path with as little attention to technicality as possible.\n\n\u201cSo, we are at a point where at least we know that virtual hearings are legal. This means that the Supreme Court is satisfied that appropriate means can be found to ensure that hearings are public and that the press and indeed members of the public can access the proceedings,\u201d Prof Osinbajo added.\n\nThe event which will be held virtually will also have in attendance Honourable Justice Monica Dongban Mensem, President of the Court of Appeal.\n\nAlso in attendance is the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; Funmi Quadri, Principal of Funmi Quadri SAN & Co; Olumide Akpata, President of Nigerian Bar Association and Haliru Nababa, Comptroller General of Nigeria Correctional Services.",

They are the third tiers of government \u2013 much closer to the people. Our administration will give all the necessary support to them to ensure that they carry out their constitutional responsibilities in line with the resolutions of the Governors\u2019 Forum.\n\n\u201cEverything is going on well. The election is peaceful, no disruption, no violence. People are going about their civil duties responsibly\u201d, he stated.\n\nOn the boycott of the election by a faction of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and some political parties in the state, Abiodun said he was not aware of any boycott, saying the state electoral body has done the needful by recognising the legitimate faction of the main opposition party.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe boycott must have been done by the faction that lost out at the court\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat I was made to understand was that the party that was not recognised headed to the court and the case wasn\u2019t brought up until Thursday. And from what I understand, the court dismissed the suit that was challenging the OGSIEC accepting the other faction and following that, I think, perhaps to save face, the faction that lost out now decided to support a boycott.\n\n\u201cYou cannot boycott an election that you are not a participant in, I really don\u2019t understand that. But I am not a lawyer, I am not OGSIEC and I am not speaking on behalf of any party, I can only speak on behalf of my party and my administration\u201d, Abiodun stated.\n\nThe governor, however, lauded the electoral umpire for being transparent and providing a level playing ground for all political parties in the election.\n\n\n\n\u201cI believe OGSIEC has done everything within its power, their mandate is to be very transparent and to ensure that the playing field is as level as it should be for every single party that expressed desire to be part of this elections\u201d, the governor submitted.\n\nBlueprint reports that the turn out experienced at the various wards visited was very low, as many were seen playing football on the deserted roads.",

          "text": "Senator representing Bayelsa West District in the National Assembly, Seriake Dickson, has described the recently passed Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB , and the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021 by the parliament as offensive and insensitive to concerned Nigerians.\n\nDickson, who addressed journalists yesterday in Abuja over the perceived shortcomings in the two bills, however, warned that the approved three percent Host Communities Trust Fund in the PIB may lead to unrest in the Niger Delta region.\n\nThis is as he justified the backlash being faced by the Senate from Nigerians over amendment made to clause 52(3) of the Electoral Act, which according to him, unconstitutionally subordinated independence of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC to Nigerian Communication Commission, NCC\n\nThe former Bayelsa State governor specifically declared that the PIB passed with 3% for Host Communities Fund, will not in anyway, help Nigeria and investors in the oil and gas sectors .\n\nAccording to him, the 5% earlier recommended by both Committees of the National Assembly which is even lower to the 10% being demanded for by stakeholders across the various oil producing communities, supposed to have been retained in the interest of fairness, justice and equity.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen PIB was first introduced and forwarded to the National Assembly by the late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, 10% was proposed for Host Communities fund and Frontier Basins for exploration of oil as against the Bill recently passed, given 3% for Host Communities and 30% for Frontier Basins.\n\n\u201cThese, as far as the people of Niger Delta or oil producing states are concerned are unjustifiable and look like opening another chapter for unrest in the area which will not benefit anybody.\n\n\u201cImagine the problem the country has been facing with Boko Haram insurgency in the North East for the past ten years , the Armed banditry and Kidnapping also being faced in the North West within the last three to four years as well as agitations being faced in South West and South East, to now be added up with avoidable crisis in the South South.\n\n\u201cThose of us from the area did our best to prevail on our colleagues to listen to us and buy into our demands but number or majority position was used , which in actual fact do not build a nation with diversities like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMight and majority do not build a diversified nation like Nigeria, but presence of justice, fairness. Mere reliance on numbers without fairness, equity and justice is inimical to nation building,\u201d he added.\n\nHe therefore appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari not to assent to the bill, but send it back for more consultation and required Inclusiveness in its proposals.\n\nHe disclosed that he along with other lawmakers from the zone staged a walk out from the dinner night President Muhamnadu Buhari had with the 109 senators and 360 members of the House of Representatives, held before the final consideration and passage of the bill when they discovered that it was 3% being canvassed for host communities.\n\n\u201cIt was a terrible evening for us on account of the 3% proposal, which as a politician of conviction and not that of convenience, led to my walk out from the dinner along with some other senators.\n\n\u201cWe put up the required moves on the floor of the Senate to push it up to 5% as recommended by the joint committees of both chambers but those who rely solely on numbers, have their way,\u201d he further argued.\n\nOn the controversial amendment made by the Senate on Clause 52(3) of the Electoral Act, Dickson said the backlash being received by Senate over the amendment was not unexpected because the original proposal made in the clause had already taken care of whatever exigencies being envisaged on electronic transmission of election results.\n\n\u201cAs a member of the Senate Commitee on INEC, the phrase of where and when practicable used in clause 52(3) was enough to take care of any exigencies , making the amendment which included NCC in the entire process, unnecessary and unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cFortunately a window of striking out that amendment is already provided by the House of Representatives which adopted the clause as originally proposed.\n\n\u201cSo it is expected that the earlier version of the clause, will be the one to be adopted by the confluence Commitee which will be set up by both chambers for the required harmonization of reports before transmitting the bill to the President for assent,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "It started as a largely peaceful religious movement in northern Nigeria. But the violent rhetoric was never inconspicuous. Yet, the government didn\u2019t pay much attention to Boko Haram. Until 2009, when the group\u2019s leader, Mohammed Yusuf, was murdered while in police custody, setting off an inexorable chain of violent events that has threatened the very existence of the Nigerian state. Twelve years later, thousands have died and hundreds of thousands more have been displaced or remain in captivity. Yet, the insurgency is far from over. Here is a timeline of events of Nigeria\u2019s never-ending conflict:\n\n2002: Mohammed Yusuf founds Boko Haram, a group with the aim to \u2018purify\u2019 Islam in Northern Nigeria.\n\nJuly 2009:

          "text": "Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila on Saturday expressed disappointment after the card reader at his polling unit failed during the Lagos local government elections.\n\nMr Gbajabiamila, speaking to Channels Television, said the incident was a sign that Nigeria is not ready for electronic transmission of results, an issue that divided the National Assembly recently.\n\nReferencing election officials, the Speaker said the card reader failed due to poor network coverage.\n\nREAD ALSO: INEC, NCC Should Work Together To Conduct Credible Elections \u2013 Gbajabiamila\n\nThe local government elections had held amid widespread apathy as many voters failed to turn out, according to Channels Television correspondents who monitored the process.\n\n\u2018Most Important\u2019\n\nThe Speaker, who represents Surulere 1 Constituency at the House of Representatives, said local government elections are \u201cmost important\u201d because they are closer to the grassroots.\n\n\u201cThis is the most important election,\u201d he said. \u201cMany will say Presidential, National Assembly elections.\n\n\u201cFor me, it is more important for obvious reasons: the local government elections are where the grassroots is. And as is often said, any house that is built on sand or shaky grounds will crumble.\n\n\u201cYou have to have solid ground to build a solid foundation to build a proper house. And that\u2019s where the local government comes to play. These are the people of Nigeria.

The captured territory includes parts of the southern province of Kandahar, where the Canadian military spent the longest amount of time during its 13-year mission in the country.\n\nAlso on Friday, the US called on the Taliban to negotiate after the group said that there will not be peace in Afghanistan until there is a new government in Kabul and President Ashraf Ghani is removed.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Taliban spokesman, Suhail Shaheen, who is also a member of the group\u2019s negotiating team, laid out their stance on what should come next in a country on the precipice.\n\nShaheen said the Taliban will lay down their weapons when a negotiated government acceptable to all sides in the conflict is installed in Kabul and Ghani\u2019s government is gone.\n\nDuring a news briefing held over the phone, State Department spokesperson Jalina Porter said \u201cwe call on the Taliban to engage in serious negotiations to determine a political road map for Afghanistan future that leads to a just and durable settlement.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki affirmed Biden\u2019s support for the Afghan president. She said Biden was scheduled to speak with Ghani by phone later in the day.\n\n\u201cThe president and the administration supports the leadership of the Afghan people, including Ashraf Ghani,\u201d Psaki told reporters.\n\n\u201cI would note that there are ongoing political negotiations and discussions that we certainly support between Afghan leaders, members of the Afghan government and the Taliban.

          "text": "In a move that pours cold water on the dreams of a few billionaire space explorers, the US has tightened its definition of the word \u201castronaut\u201d.\n\nNew Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rules say astronaut hopefuls must be part of the flight crew and make contributions to space flight safety.\n\nThat means Jeff Bezos and Sir Richard Branson may not yet be astronauts in the eyes of the US government.\n\nThese are the first changes since the FAA wings programme began in 2004.\n\nThe Commercial Astronaut Wings programme updates were announced on Tuesday \u2013 the same day that Amazon\u2019s Mr Bezos flew aboard a Blue Origin rocket to the edge of space.\n\nTo qualify as commercial astronauts, space-goers must travel 50 miles (80km) above the Earth\u2019s surface, which both Mr Bezos and Mr Branson accomplished.\n\nBut altitude aside, the agency says would-be astronauts must have also \u201cdemonstrated activities during flight that were essential to public safety, or contributed to human space flight safety\u201d.\n\nWhat exactly counts as such is determined by FAA officials.\n\nIn a statement, the FAA said that these changes brought the wings scheme more in line with its role to protect public safety during commercial space flights.\n\nOn 11 July, Sir Richard flew on-board Virgin Galactic\u2019s SpaceShipTwo to the edge of space as a test before allowing customers aboard next year.\n\nMr Bezos and the three other crew members who flew on Blue Origin\u2019s spacecraft may have less claim to the coveted title. Ahead of the launch, Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith said that \u201cthere\u2019s really nothing for a crew member to do\u201d on the autonomous vehicle.\n\nThose wishing for commercial wings need to be nominated for them as well. An FAA spokesperson told CNN they are not currently reviewing any submissions.\n\nThere are two other ways to earn astronaut wings in the US \u2013 through the military or Nasa.\n\nThe wings spotted on Mr Bezos and Sir Richard following their flights were custom-made pins by their own companies.\n\nHowever, a glimmer of hope remains for Sir Richard, Mr Bezos and any future stargazers hoping to be recognised as astronauts.\n\nThe new order notes that honorary awards can be given based on merit \u2013 at the discretion of the FAA\u2019s associate administrator.\n\nAstronaut wings were first awarded to astronauts Alan Shepard Jr and Virgil Grissom in the early 1960s for their participation in the Mercury Seven programme.",

          "title": "Family of James Brown Settles 15-year Battle Over His Estate",
          "text": "The family of entertainer James Brown has reached a settlement ending a 15-year battle over the late singer\u2019s estate, an attorney involved in the mediation said Friday.\n\nDavid Black, an attorney representing Brown\u2019s estate, confirmed to The Associated Press that the agreement was reached July 9. Details of the settlement were not disclosed.\n\nLegal wrangling over the Godfather of Soul\u2019s estate has been ongoing since his death at the age of 73 on Christmas Day 2006.\n\nThe performer\u2019s death touched off years of bizarre headlines, beginning with Tomi Rae Hynie \u2014 a former partner who claimed to be Brown\u2019s wife \u2014 being locked out of his 60-acre (24-hectare) estate while photographers captured her sobbing and shaking its iron gates, begging to be let in.\n\nBrown was renowned for hundreds of iconic musical works including hits like \u201cI Feel Good\u201d and \u201cA Man\u2019s World,\u201d and was known around the world for his flashy performances and dynamic stage presence. But years of drug problems and financial mismanagement caused his estate to dwindle.\n\nMore than a dozen lawsuits were filed over the years by people trying to lay claim to the singer\u2019s assets, which courts have estimated to be worth anything from $5 million to more than $100 million.\n\nThe fight over Brown\u2019s estate even spilled over into what to do with his body. Family members fought over the remains for more than two months, leaving Brown\u2019s body, still inside a gold casket, sitting in cold storage in a funeral home.\n\nBrown was eventually buried in Beech Island, South Carolina, at the home of one of his daughters. The family wanted to turn the home into a shrine for Brown similar to Elvis Presley\u2019s Graceland, but that idea never got off the ground.\n\nLast year, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that Hynie had not been legally married to Brown and therefore did not have a right to his multimillion-dollar estate.\n\nJustices also ordered a circuit court to \u201cpromptly proceed with the probate of Brown\u2019s estate in accordance with his estate plan,\u201d which outlined creation of a trust that would use his music royalties to fund educational expenses for children in South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nA 2009 settlement plan would have given nearly half of Brown\u2019s estate to a charitable trust, a quarter to Hynie, and the rest to be split among his adult children. The state Supreme Court overturned that deal in 2013, writing that then-Attorney General Henry McMaster \u2014 now the state\u2019s governor \u2014 hadn\u2019t followed Brown\u2019s expressed wishes for most of his money to go to charity, having instead selected a professional manager who took control of Brown\u2019s assets from the estate\u2019s trustees to settle debts.",

          "title": "Nigeria: 56 Days After, Kidnappers Hold on to 116 Tegina Pupils Despite Receiving $100,000 Ransom",
          "text": "No fewer than 116 of the 136 pupils of Salihu Tanko Islamiyya School in Tegina, Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State, abducted by terrorists on May 30 are 56 days old in the dungeons of their kidnappers on Saturday, with hope for freedom still distant.\n\nTears continue to flow in many homes in Tegina, as traumatised parents await a miracle for the release of their kids, following the refusal of the abductors to free the pupils after collecting N50 million ransom contributed by sympathisers.\n\nSeventeen of the initial 136 abductees escaped, while three others died in the forest where they are being held.\n\nThe kidnappers had agreed to free the remaining 116 pupils if the ransom reduced from the initial N200 million to N50 million was paid.\n\nLast Monday, sympathisers mobilised N30 million to the kidnappers at an agreed location in the forest, after an initial N20 million was paid in June. But after counting the money, the abductors declared that it was N4.6 million short, and detained the conveyor of the ransom. The pupils were also not released.\n\nIt was the second time the kidnappers will declare ransom incomplete. In the initial N20 million paid in June, the abductors said it was N2 million short after counting it.\n\nThe kidnappers subsequently phoned the parents last Monday to send the N4.6 million balance, plus another N2 million short from the initial payment of N20 million, totaling N6.6 million.\n\nBesides, the kidnappers are also making fresh demand. They want the parents to supply six brand new Bajaj motorcycles before the pupils would be released.\n\n\u201cWe are fed up, we are leaving everything to God\u201d one of the parents told THISDAY on Friday.\n\nWhen contacted, the Head Teacher of the school, Mallam Abubakar Alhassan confirmed the story saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to do next\u201d.\n\nAlhassan said: \u201cAll the parents are now Koboless. We have sold everything we have to raise the ransoms collected by the bandits, yet they refuse to release our children.\u201d\n\nThree of the abducted pupils have died in the dungeons of the kidnappers, and many of the remaining pupils are said to be seriously ill, resulting from hunger, cold and trauma.\n\nThe pupils, some of their teachers and passersby were abducted on May 30, but 17 of the abductees escaped from the clutches of the bandits three weeks after their abduction.\n\nThree pupils also died in captivity few days back. It was gathered that the bandits gave the sad information to some of the parents in a telephone conversation, but they (bandits) did not disclose the names of the deceased pupils.\n\nThe Chief Imam of Tegina also said he made similar announcement after one of the regular Muslim prayers in the town early this week.\n\nAccording to THISDAY findings, the bandits told the parents contacted that they would send the video of the burial of the late pupils and that of the present condition of the others to confirm their state of health. As at press time, the bandits had not sent the video.\n\nSome parents told THISDAY that the Niger State Government promised to help offset part of the ransom but failed to deliver.\n\nHowever, Secretary to the Niger State Government, Alhaji Ibrahim Ahmed Matane, debunked the claim saying, \u201cThere was never a time that government promised to pay ransom to bandits or assist the parents to pay any or part of the ransom. We have a policy not to pay ransom. We still stand by that policy.\n\n\u201cYou know this issue of payment of ransom is not healthy. Government, as a policy, does not do it but I know that because they are engaging with the bandits, they can tell them anything.\u201d\n\nThe SSG also distanced the government from any official pledge that government would pay part of the ransom saying, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know who that government official is because I coordinate security and I am not aware.\u201d\n\nAsked if government was aware that three of the children had died, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not aware that three of the girls have died. You know these people (bandits) can be very deceptive. They raise a lot of emotions and sentiments so that we will accept their bidding.\u201d\n\nThe pupils, all from Muslim homes, spent the Eid-el-Kabir festival in the den of their abductors.\n\nThe mother of one of the pupils, whose name was not given, died early last month as a result of trauma. The remains of the deceased were interred in Tegina according to Islamic injunction.\n\nSome of the kidnapped pupils are between ages four, and 13. The headmaster of the school, whose two children and a sister are among the abducted, said some of the victims were too young for the ordeals they were facing.\n\nHe also indicted both the federal and state governments for abandoning the school and the parents of the students in their moment of despair.\n\nAlhassan, popularly called Mallam by his community, in an emotion-laden interview on June 5, claimed there had been no sympathy from the government, and wondered why the federal government failed to provide the ransom demanded by the bandits.\n\nHe said it was a lie that the government had sent vehicles and motorcycles into the bush for rescue operation, and denied the report that he had prior information of the attack.\n\nThe head teacher disclosed that the abduction had already led to the death of two parents of the victims, warning that more casualties may happen unless the students regained their freedom quickly.\n\nFighting back tears, Alhassan said on June 5: \u201cI have witnessed the funeral prayer of one of the parents here, very close to the school. She died because she had just one child who is our student. She was not around when the incident happened. When she came back, they told her and within 30 minutes, she collapsed and died. That was the day before yesterday.\n\n\u201cA day after the incident happened, another parent died. She had two children. One was sent to the town while the one with her was kidnapped. She died of heart attack.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019m talking to you now, my wife is down. She was put on drip, she didn\u2019t cook; she didn\u2019t eat. My little child at home, who slept with me on my bed, woke up only to begin to shout the name of his elder sister, asking me \u201cBaba, when is she coming back?\n\n\u201cOne painful thing was that my sister called me before the last discussion with the bandits, crying. She swore that the children are sick, they cannot walk. She told me they have removed their hijabs. They have unveiled them. They removed their shirts and they are left with only trousers.\n\n\u201cThere is no food. They gave them kulikuli (groundnut cake). How do you expect them to survive? They took them to unknown environments. I heard people saying they kept them on the floor. When you are talking about floors you are not talking about classrooms or a house. No, they are kept in the bush. They are sleeping on the ground, no leaves, not mat. How do you expect them to live like that?\u201d\n\nAnother parent, a mother, Mrs. Hashimu, in an interview, few days after the abduction said: \u201cThe whole incident was terrifying because everything happened in my presence. I was hearing everything. I saw when the bandits were going away with these children but there was nothing I could do. Government is not helping matters at all saying this, saying that, yet we cannot see anything on the ground.\u201d\n\nLaleye Dipo in Minna",
