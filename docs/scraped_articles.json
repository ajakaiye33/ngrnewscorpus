          "title": "Experts differ as Osinbajo says exchange rate artificially low",
          "text": "Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo on Monday called for an official rate that is reflective of market reality.\n\nHe said the current dual exchange rates allowed for arbitrage and blocked inflow/supply of dollars from investors.\n\nOsinbajo said this on Monday in Abuja at the opening of a two-day Mid-Term Ministerial Performance Review Retreat organised to assess progress made towards the achievement of the nine key priorities of the Buhari regime. Experts, however, differed on the vice-president\u2019s opinion.\n\nThis is as he said the country could not get new dollars into the system, where the exchange rate was artificially low.\n\nThe Vice President said the artificially low exchange rate was deterring investors from bringing foreign exchange into the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs for the exchange rate, I think we need to move our rates to be as reflective of the market as possible. This, in my own respective view, is the only way to improve supply.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get new dollars into the system, where the exchange rate is artificially low. And everyone knows by how much our reserves can grow. I\u2019m convinced that the demand management strategy currently being adopted by the CBN needs a rethink, and that is just my view.\n\n\u201cAnyway, all those are issues that when the CBN governor has time to address, he will be able to address in full.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also suggested that the central bank was competing with the fiscal side of the economy, which includes the ministries, departments, and agencies of government.\n\nHe explained, \u201cThere must be synergy between the fiscal and the monetary authority. We must be able to deal with the synergy; we must handle the synergy between the monetary authority, the CBN, and the fiscal side.\n\n\u201cSometimes, it appears that there is competition, especially on the fiscal side. If you look at some of the interventions, you will find that those interventions are interventions that should be managed by ministries.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Industry, trade and investment should handle MSME interventions, and we should know what the CBN is doing.\n\n\u201cIn other words, if the CBN is intervening in the MSME sector; it should be with the full cooperation and consent of the ministry of industry.\n\n\u201cSometimes you will get people who are benefiting more than once because we simply have no line of sight on what is going on, on one side.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on surviving the economic challenges of 2020, Osinbajo said that Buhari deserved the credit for providing steady leadership through the crisis.\n\nHe said, \u201cLet me say on the whole that we have been able to weather the storm of a very, very serious economic challenge.\n\n\u201cI think that is based largely on the steady and stable leadership we received from the president. I think if Mr President had panicked in that period, we would have had a lot of difficulties, perhaps we would be in a much worse situation.\n\n\u201cHe deserves the commendation for providing that steady hand when that was required.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said anything was possible if Nigeria and Nigerians were willing to work together for the same objective.\n\nHowever, experts who spoke to our correspondents offered different opinions.\n\nA professor of capital market at the Nasarawa State University Keffi, Uche Uwaleke, said, the implications of devaluing the naira now were quite scary.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe first casualty will be the 2022 Appropriation Bill. It means the 2022 budget, which is predicated on N410.15 per dollar is dead on arrival.\n\n\u201cThe Vice President obviously means well. But this statement is capable of triggering panic buying and speculation in the forex market (official and parallel) and further complicating things for the CBN.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, devaluation will force down the volume of imports and reduce the pressure in the forex market temporarily. But have we thought of the impact it would have on pump price of fuel and the multiplier effects?\n\n\u201cHow about the knock-on with regard to inflation and interest rates especially at a time when inflation rate remains elevated? Is high inflation rate not inimical to investments whether local or foreign?\u201d\n\nHe said the argument that naira devaluation would incentivise foreign investors remained to be seen as other factors such as insecurity equally play a part.\n\nThe naira, he added, had suffered several devaluations in recent past.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt has neither solved the fundamental problem of helping to diversify the export base nor curbed unbridled imports. Doing so yet again will not change anything. Rather, it is a recipe for high poverty and unemployment levels.\n\n\u201cAgain, suggesting that the CBN should discontinue its forex demand management strategy to the effect that certain items are excluded from accessing the official window has grave implications for exchange rate and the economy. If anything, it negates the import substitution drive of the present administration.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that the CBN has sufficient external reserves to meet genuine demands for forex at the Investors and Exporters window. This much we have been told. The CBN should continue to manage it while joining hands with the fiscal authorities to create multiple sources of forex beyond oil.\u201d\n\nAn economist and lecturer at the Lagos Business School, Dr Bongo Adi, said, \u201cThe exchange rate is a secondary indicator, driven by other economic factors. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, with all due respect, displayed a lack of understanding of the economy.\n\n\u201cWe need to ask why the naira is overvalued. It is simply because we have not been able to improve our export profile.\n\n\u201cWe have not been exporting much, the only thing we export is oil. Even the volume of oil production and oil export has gone down in recent times. Without an enormous export profile, you may not have currency appreciation.\n\n\u201cWe can say our export profile is not that big, and we keep borrowing money from outside. If you keep borrowing, your exchange rate will depreciate.\n\n\u201cThe government has taken borrowing as a way of life, and this has made the naira devalue. When they say the market should drive the exchange rate, why shouldn\u2019t the market drive the economic production and infrastructure in Nigeria?\n\n\u201cThere is another angle which is the consistent depreciation of African currencies, not just the naira. If you compare the African currencies from Naira to the Cedis of Ghana to all of our currencies in Anglophone West Africa and Sub-Saharan African, you will see currency depreciation that has been known since the 1980s. Countries in Africa do not have control over their exchange rate.\n\n\u201cIf you look at how Africa supplies the rest of the world, you have to look at the international dimensions. Unfortunately, our leaders do not have the strategic intelligence to engage with the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, a senior lecturer in economics at the Pan Altantic University, Olalekan Aworinde, supported the position of the Vice President on the revaluation of the naira to attract investors.\n\nAccording to him, the value of the naira against the dollar is currently overvalued, thanks to the managed system adopted by the CBN to control the rate of the domestic currency.\n\n\u201cThe naira as it is overvalued. Enough of this managed system whereby the CBN is trying to control the rate at which the naira is exchanged for the dollar.\n\n\u201cThe VP is saying the truth because if we devalue the naira to its actual value, then the margins that the Bureau de Change relies on will no longer be there.\n\nHe said besides boosting the confidence of investors in the stability of the country\u2019s economy, devaluing the naira would also drive increased exports.\n\n\u201cThe disparity between the official rate and that of the parallel market is likely going to scare away investors because investors don\u2019t want to go to a place that is full of uncertainty.\n\n\u201cIf investors bring in funds and they can\u2019t determine the actual worth of the funds, because of the discrepancies in the value of the exchange rate, so they choose to invest in other countries with unified or stable rates.\n\n\u201cAlso if the exchange rate is devalued, we are likely going to see a situation where there is an improvement in the country\u2019s balance of payment, in the sense that when we do this, imports become cheaper while exports become expensive.\n\n\u201cThat way, we can bridge the trade deficit, as revenue from exports will be greater than what we spend on imports.\u201d\n\nThe Founder of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise and economist, Dr Muda Yusuf, told our correspondent that it was inappropriate to say that the VP was calling for the devaluation of the Naira.\n\nHe said the VP implied that the currency should be market-reflective.\n\n\u201cWhat we are experiencing in the forex market is largely consequences of the CBN fixed exchange rate policy regime and administrative allocation of forex.\n\n\u201cThe NAFEX window is a subsidised window and managing a subsidy regime is typically a herculean task. Suppressing the market is like swimming against the tide.\n\n\u201cThe way out of the forex conundrum is for the CBN to allow the market to function. It is also imperative for the apex bank to de-emphasise demand management and focus on strategies to stimulate forex inflows.\u201d\n\nHe added that a fixed exchange rate was a major disincentive to inflows and creates enormous pressure of demand for forex.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Stop stigmatisation of mental health patients, Psychiatrist charges Nigerians",
          "text": "Says social stigma breeds institutionalised stigma, discrimination\n\nBy Sola Ogundipe\n\nAs Nigeria joined the rest of the world to mark this year\u2019s World Mental Health Day, October 10, Nigerians have been urged to shun all active and passive acts of stigma and discrimination against people with mental health disorders saying it does more harm than good.\n\nAfrica\u2019s premier celebrity psychiatrist and leading mental health advocate and coach, Dr Maymunah Kadiri, who called for an end to stigmatisation of people with mental illnesses, explained that social stigma, if not checked, often leads to institutionalised stigma and discrimination against mental health patients.\n\nKadiri, who is the Founder/Medical Director and Psychiatrist-in-Chief, Pinnacle Medical Services, Lagos, also tasked people suffering from mental illnesses to desist from self-perceived stigmatisation such as negative attitudes and internalised shame about their own condition.\n\n\u201cStigma is when someone views you in a negative way because you have a distinguishing characteristic or personal trait that\u2019s thought to be, or is, a disadvantage (a negative stereotype). Unfortunately, negative attitudes and beliefs toward people who have a mental health condition are common.\n\n\u201cDiscrimination may be obvious and direct, such as someone making a negative remark about your mental illness or your treatment. Or it may be unintentional or subtle, such as someone avoiding you because the person assumes you could be unstable, violent or dangerous due to your mental illness. You may even judge yourself,\u201d Kadiri stated.\n\nExplaning further, the psychiatrist said the stigma associated with mental illness can be social stigma or public stigma that involves the negative or discriminatory attitudes that others have about mental illness, and self-perceived stigma or self-stigma that refers to the negative attitudes, including internalised shame, that people with mental illness have about their own condition.\n\nAccording to her: \u201cInstitutional stigma, is more systemic, involving policies of government and private organisations that intentionally or unintentionally limit opportunities for people with mental illness. Examples include lower funding for mental illness research or fewer mental health services relative to other health care.\n\n\u201cStigma not only directly affects individuals with mental illness but also the loved ones who support them, often including their family members,\u201d she remarked.\n\nAccording to her, common signs of stigma include: \u201cPaying more attention to the symptoms and effects of mental illness than you do on other aspects of yourself.\n\n\u201cCatch yourself over- thinking the words, actions, and nonverbal behaviour of others, knowing that you\u2019re not measuring up; notice self-derogatory thoughts running through your mind among others.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let stigma create self-doubt and shame, don\u2019t isolate yourself or equate yourself with your illness. Then join a support group like local and international groups. Get help at school and speak out against stigma. Also pay more attention to the symptoms and effects of mental illness than you do on other aspects of yourself, \u201d she counselled.\n\nShe identified some of the harmful effects of stigma as reluctance to seek help or treatment, lack of understanding by family, friends, co-workers or others, fewer opportunities for work, school or social activities or trouble finding housing, and bullying, physical violence or harassment.\n\nOthers are health insurance that doesn\u2019t adequately cover mental illness treatment, and the belief that you\u2019ll never succeed at certain challenges or that you can\u2019t improve your situation.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Therefore, anybody still keeping any weapon runs the risk of being arrested and prosecuted and made to face the full weight of the law.\n\n\u201cGovernment will go out to fully implement that directive and ensure that all bandits no matter are discovered and brought to book,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nUzodimma also said it was no longer pardonable for people or any group of people to take the laws into their hands.\n\nHe said banditry, violence, kidnapping and other forms of crime and criminality had been on the increase since the jail break in Owerri that saw criminals return to the streets.\n\n\u201cThe evidence of their activities is manifested in what happened at Izombe Community where one of those who confronted the military was an escapee from Owerri Prisons.\n\n\u201cFortunately or otherwise, the hoodlum was killed by the soldiers in the confrontation,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe governor assured the families of the slain security operatives that the death of the soldiers would not go in vain.\n\nHe reiterated his administration\u2019s commitment to support security agencies to ensure that peace returned to the state.",

          "text": "By Emma Ujah, Abuja Bureau Chief\n\nThe World Bank has advocated debt relief for Low and Middle-Income Countries with a debt stock of over $8.7 trillion, as at 2020.\n\nThe bank, Monday, urged debt reduction, restructuring, and transparency to help low- income countries overcome debt challenges\n\nIt said that governments around the world responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with massive fiscal, monetary, and financial stimulus packages.\n\n\u201cWhile these measures were aimed at addressing the health emergency, cushioning the impact of the pandemic on the poor and vulnerable and putting countries on a path to recovery, the resulting debt burden of the world\u2019s low-income countries rose 12% to a record $860 billion in 2020, according to a new World Bank report.\n\n\u201cEven prior to the pandemic, many low- and middle-income countries were in a vulnerable position, with slowing economic growth and public and external debt at elevated levels.\n\n\u201cExternal debt stocks of low- and middle-income countries combined rose 5.3% in 2020 to $8.7 trillion.\u201d\n\nAccording to the new International Debt Statistics 2022 report, an encompassing approach to managing debt is needed to help low- and middle-income countries assess and curtail risks and achieve sustainable debt levels.\n\n\u201cWe need a comprehensive approach to the debt problem, including debt reduction, swifter restructuring and improved transparency,\u201d said World Bank Group President David Malpass. \u201cSustainable debt levels are vital for economic recovery and poverty reduction.\u201d\n\nThe bank noted that the deterioration in debt indicators was widespread and impacted countries in all regions. Across all low- and middle-income countries, the rise in external indebtedness outpaced Gross National Income (GNI) and export growth.\n\nIt added that low- and middle-income countries\u2019 external debt-to-GNI ratio (excluding China) rose to 42% in 2020 from 37% in 2019 while their debt-to-export ratio increased to 154% in 2020 from 126% in 2019.\n\nIn response to the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic and at the urging of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund, in April 2020, the G20 launched the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) to provide temporary liquidity support for low-income countries.\n\nThe G-20 countries agreed to extend the deferral period through the end of 2021. In November 2020, the G20 agreed on a Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the DSSI, an initiative to restructure unsustainable debt situations and protracted financing gaps in DSSI-eligible countries.\n\nAccording to the bank, overall, in 2020, net inflows from multilateral creditors to low- and middle-income countries rose to $117 billion, the highest level in a decade. Net debt inflows of external public debt to low-income countries rose 25% to $71 billion, also the highest level in a decade.\n\nMultilateral creditors, including the IMF, provided $42 billion in net inflows while bilateral creditors accounted for an additional $10 billion.\n\n\u201cEconomies across the globe face a daunting challenge posed by high and rapidly rising debt levels,\u201d said Carmen Reinhart, Senior Vice President and Chief Economist of the World Bank Group. \u201cPolicymakers need to prepare for the possibility of debt distress when financial market conditions turn less benign, particularly in emerging market and developing economies.\u201d\n\nThe bank said that greater debt transparency is critical in addressing the risks posed by rising debt in many developing countries.\n\nIt said, \u201cTo facilitate transparency, International Debt Statistics 2022 was expanded to provide more detailed and disaggregated data on external debt than ever before.\n\n\u201cThe data now gives the breakdown of a borrowing country\u2019s external debt stock to show the amount owed to each official and private creditor, the currency composition of this debt, and the terms on which loans were extended.\n\n\u201c For DSSI-eligible countries the dataset was expanded to include the debt service deferred in 2020 by each bilateral creditor and the projected month-by-month debt-service payments owed to them through 2021. The World Bank will also publish soon a new Debt Transparency in Developing Economies report that takes stock of debt transparency challenges in low-income countries and lays out a detailed list of recommendations to address them.\u201d",

So, if you look at that, then that means we need to go for the cleanest and safest source of energy that we can deploy to use, which globally it is agreed that natural gas, is the safest source of fuel.\u201d\n\nThe Director made the call during a sensitization workshop on the National Gas Expansion Project organized by The Ministry of Petroleum Resources in conjunction with the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board to engage and plan for the rapid rollout of Micro Distribution Centres in Katsina State.\n\nAccording to the Director, the essence of the Micro Distribution Centres is to make LPG accessible, affordable and to bring it closer to the citizens, particularly the locals who are yet to embrace it for cooking in their homes and restaurants.\n\n\u201cSo, the essence of this programme is to roll out and throw more light on the importance of the Micro Distribution Centre and to highlight the concept of putting up the micro distribution centres as part of the National Gas Expansion Project.\n\nWith a Micro Distribution Center, it will be easier for whoever wants to use gas to access it because the centres are near to you. Is Just to take your gas cylinder to the macro distribution center and refill it\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Director General Katsina State Investment Promotion Agency,\n\nIbrahim Tukur Jikamshi, said the MDC will help to reduce the level of unemployment in the state. He further said the MDC will be established across the state and the youths selected will be provided with the required training needed to run the centres effectively.\n\nHe further said that the programme will also look at the possibility of training people on how to convert their vehicles, generators and other machines from using petroleum to the use of gas.",

Every year, millions are forced into wedlock with men who are often much older, robbing them of an opportunity to keep learning, be children, and in many cases, to survive.\n\n\u201cChildbirth is the number one killer of teenage girls because their young bodies aren\u2019t ready to bear children. The health risks of children having children cannot, and must not, be ignored. Governments must prioritise girls and ensure they\u2019re protected from child marriage and premature childbirth-related deaths. This can only happen if girls have a say in the decisions that affect them.\u201d\n\nInger made the disclosure on Monday while presenting the SCI\u2019s Global Girlhood Report on the International Day of the Girl-Child.\n\nAccording to the report, over 22,000 girls die annually from childbirth pregnancy with Africa suffering the worst hit.\n\n\u201cWith 9,600 deaths annually, West and Central Africa has the highest rate overall of child marriage-related deaths globally, translating to 26 deaths per day,\u201d the report revealed\n\nThe report also disclosed that teenage maternal mortality rate is four times higher in Africa than anywhere else in the world.\n\nThe report said 44% of girls in Nigeria are married before their 18th birthday, one of the highest rate of child marriage globally.\n\nAccording to the report, the situation is not getting any better as Nigerian girls are subjected to difficulties as a result of the ongoing armed conflict, humanitarian crisis, kidnapping, natural disaster, displacement, COVID-19 pandemic and economic recession.\n\n\u201cThe lives of millions of girls are threatened as they are being pushed into the basket of deprivation, including reduced access to education, nutrition, lack of protection and lack of access to basic social services,\u201d the SCI global report unveiled.",

Ejike Mbaka, has warned President Muhammadu Buhari that the fighter jets he is acquiring will be used to destroy the country.\n\nThe cleric who spoke on Sunday during a sermon at Adoration ground in Emene advised the president to rather focus on building more industries to absorb unemployed youths.\n\nRecall that President Buhari, last week, confirmed receipt of new fighter jets which he said will be deployed against any form of insecurity in all parts of the country.\n\nMbaka however warned that: \u201cThe jets you are buying are going to be used to collapse Nigeria. Please, the first person to meet President Buhari after this message, should tell him that all these jets he is buying will be used to destroy Nigeria. God told me to tell him that all these jets are going to be used to restroy Nigeria. Let him stop buying more jets and begin to build more industries.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to hear that our children are being killed. Those that are being bombed are Nigerians. Nobody is going to give award to a mother or a farther for killing his or her children. The solution is simple. Put the round peg in the round hole and banditary will die.\n\n\u201cPeople are not agitation for nothing. Listen to the reason for their agitation. Because even in the military their is agitation. In the police, their is agitation. In the church their is agitation. In the families people are agitating. Drivers are agitating, businessmen are agitating.\n\n\u201cUse the money and solve the problem otherwise, you are buying jets that aggrieved people will take up and scatter you people. If it doesn\u2019t happen soon, it will happen later. Do you know how many billions are used to buy these jets? If they put some of these billions into job creation, the youths will be busy, parents will be happy that their children are going to work and coming back.\n\n\u201cThe spirit of God is not happy with our leaders no matter how they will want to paint it. If all the men of God will be silent, the spirit of God will not be silent.

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nFormer Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, has called on Igbo in the diaspora to offer their strong voice against violent agitations. He also urged them to bring their influences to bear in the search for security and stability in Igbo land.\n\nEkweremadu\u2019s admonition is coming, almost two months after the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, was arrested in Kenya and clandestinely brought to Nigeria.\n\nEkweremadu, in a statement signed by his media adviser, Uche Anichukwu, gave assurances that the South East Caucus of the National Assembly, where he serves as the leader, was also working towards defusing tension in the region, as well as finding a political solution that would result in the release of Kanu.\n\nEkweremadu blamed the agitations by various parts of the country on a flawed federal system, injustice, poor management of the nation\u2019s diversity, failure of the federal government to secure lives and property, and needless clampdown on self-determination agitators when dialogue and giving every part of the country a sense of belonging could have sufficed.\n\nHe, however, insisted that violent agitation was not the answer.\n\nThe lawmaker bared his mind in a lecture entitled: \u201cThe Igbo in Diaspora: A Perspective\u201d that he delivered virtually at the Igbo Heritage Lectures and Ugwumba Excellence Award event, which held in Pretoria, South Africa, Sunday evening.\n\nHe observed that one of the worst things that could happen to Ndigbo at this time was to allow their homeland to be turned into a theatre of war.\n\n\u201cThe injustices and marginalisations are palpable and must be addressed. But by all means, we must ensure the stability of Igbo land because only by so doing can Alaigbo (Igbo land) prosper economically and also elicit local and international support and sympathy over their plights.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened in Alaigbo in the past few months is odd, \u2018un-Igbo\u2019, and sacrilegious. Destruction, waste of human lives, and economic losses have been the lot of our region. In particular, the sit-at-home has hemorrhaged Igbo lives and economy and it is good the IPOB has said they are no longer interested in the sit-at-home. No wise man brings war into his home. Our people prosper on industry, commerce, and the informal sector. Most of them survive on daily income.\n\n\u201cTherefore, while we are at liberty to employ every legitimate and democratic means to press for justice and equity, we must all work together to condemn and end the violence, irrespective of whatever quarters it is coming from.\n\n\u201cThis is a special appeal to Ndigbo in South Africa, in particular, to wade into the orgy of violence in Igboland and help to restore normalcy. Ndigbo at home expect the Igbo in diaspora to lead the campaign against violent agitations and insecurity in our region because threats to Igbo businesses, the peace, security, and stability of the South-East are threats to our very existence as Ndigbo,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs the intellectual bank of Ndigbo with extensive exposure to liberal and progressive democratic ideals, and access to international resources, the Igbo in diaspora are well positioned to elevate the intellectual content of the Igbo struggle for justice and equity.\n\n\u201cHow best can we address the issues of exclusion, imbalances, detention of many Igbo sons and daughters in various correctional centres across the country, the issues of clampdown on unarmed protesters, and the challenge of extra-judicial killings in Igbo land without recourse to violent agitations?\u201d\n\nOn Kanu, Ekweremadu said: \u201cLet me also assure you that the South East Caucus of the National Assembly is not resting on its oars. We are working quietly and surely to address these issues, including finding a political solution to the Mazi Nnamdi Kanu matter.\n\n\u201cWe did it before in the case of Chief Raph Uwazuruike in 2007. We also did it in the case of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in 2017. And God willing, and with your support and prayers, we will succeed again in the matter of Nnamdi kanu to promote peace and stability in our region.\u201d\n\nEkweremadu, however, enjoined the Igbo in diaspora to show interest in leadership recruitment in Igbo land.\n\n\u201cThe Igbo diaspora must show more than a passing interest in leadership recruitment at all levels in Alaigbo. If possible, please, come home and run for elective offices. Those who cannot come home should prompt and support other candidates of their choice. The bottom line is to ensure that our local, state, and federal political offices are occupied by our best and those who have Igbo at heart. That to me, is the beginning of the real emancipation struggle for Ndigbo because charity begins at home,\u201d he concluded.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "2022 Budget: 0.43% allocation insufficient for dilapidated airport facilities, aviation experts warn",
          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nExperts have expressed concern over the allocation of N71.3 billion for capital projects for the Ministry of Aviation in the 2022 budget presented by President Muhammadu Buhari last week.\n\nSpeaking to Daily Sun, they said the amount which is approximately 0.43 per cent of the N16.39 trillion which makes up the 2022 budget is grossly inadequate as the industry was the most hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of N78,992,731billion which is 0.48 per cent of the total budget was mapped out for the Ministry of Aviation out of which N71,300,182 is for capital expenditure.\n\nDuring a State House briefing in Aso Villa last Thursday, the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, said that N20billion would be required for the construction of a second runway at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. He also said that the Federal Government plans to spend N400million as working capital on a national carrier, describing it as an ongoing project.\n\nExperts , who spoke to Daily Sun, said the funds allocated to aviation is inadequate as the sector is in dire need of human and capital development as many airports nationwide are under straits.\n\nPresident of National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), Abayomi Agoro, said: \u201cThe amount is grossly inadequate to pay sufficient attention to a sector that\u2019s worst hit by the pandemic. Our aviation agencies are being underfunded and the BASA funds needs to be reinvested in some of this important capital projects. Some airports facilities need urgent attention. For example, air navigation facilities, communication and landings aids can\u2019t be ruled out. Now that the sector is gaining restoration, it is very important to invest in human capital development, trainings . The industry deserve more funding than less a digit appropriation.\u201d\n\nWhile the chairman of the Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (ATSSSAN), Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) branch, Danjuma Ahmed said, \u201cEnergising the industry doesn\u2019t depends on government spending on the industry, rather it\u2019s determined by free movement which is dependent on the opening up of the sky by countries, the only impact from the budget is capital project initiation or completion which will positively affect the supply value chain. The projects needed are renovation and expansion of the GAT terminal, completion of runway lighting of 18L, upgraded of the Navigational Aids at Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos and Abuja and possibly the relocation of Abuja tower and the second Abuja runway.\u201d\n\nThe president of the National Association of Airline Pilots and Engineers (NAAPE) Galadima Abednego, told Daily Sun that \u201cThe amount allocated is grossly inadequate considering the capital intensive nature of aviation infrastructure. It also important for government to appreciate the catalytic business nature of aviation and a second Abuja runway is very critical.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Operating Officer of Tropical Arctic Logistics (TAL), Femi Adeniji, said the most important project that the minister should focus on is ensuring that there are sufficient facilities in all the airports and advised that money should not be wasted on setting up another airline.\n\n\u201cThe minister should focus on airport rehabilitation which include equipment such as the luggage belt, passenger arrival/departure bridges that has been unserviceable for years (this is why aircraft are towed to the bridge after shutdown), runway lights on both domestic 18L/18R, etc. This would prevent tacking to and fro International airport for take-off and arrival before sunrise and after sunset, saving operators fuel burn. He should completely forget about wasting funds on NG Eagle and airport concession but focus on holding FAAN/NCAA management responsible instead of politics. He should commission of board of the agencies which should have the free hand to monitor and ensure that the agencies portray the good image of the country.\u201d\n\nCaptain John Ojikutu said what is needed for now is periodic maintenance of safety infrastructure and facilities in all the federal airports. \u201cWhat we need the budget for now is periodic maintenance of safety infrastructure and facilities in all the federal airports; these should include the Air routes navigational landing aids like radar, ILS, runway/taxiway resurfaces, markings and lightning\u2019s, upgrading airports fire services to meet the challenges of the numbers of newer aircraft; airports security in the midst of incessant violent attacks from our homegrown terrorists; enhance the perimeter fences for security defence otherwise buildup security fences to complement the perimeter fences. All these are aeronautical services that are the responsibilities of the government under its commitments to ICAO that cannot be part of the planned concessions. The budget can be spent on these and not on non-aeronautical services like terminal buildings and its allied services,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, says God can give power to anyone he wishes to give.\n\nTinubu said this in Lagos on Sunday, as he reunited with his political associates and proteges at a welcome-back event and prayer, hosted by Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu.\n\nThe event is Tinubu\u2019s first outing since his return from the U.K. on Friday night, after three-month absence from the country.\n\nThe APC National Leader said that what God expects from anyone he gives power to is that such a person uses the power for humanity.\n\nHe said that the prayer event was an emotional one for him, being overwhelmed by good wishes from Nigerians while he was away.\n\nAccording to him, all prayers showered on him are taken as valuable compliments.\n\n\u201dI am a little emotional now but I am happy. God is the giver of life and the only one who can take life.\n\n\u201dAnd He (God) says, if I grant you power and the privilege in this life; I am the only one who can take it from you if you don\u2019t use it in the way and manner that promotes humanity.\n\n\u201dIt is the same God that has spared us till today and has given us the privilege, that I give glory to because I am standing before you hale, hearty and well.\n\n\u201dToday is a day of joy for me, having fixed today for this great event. We are here giving praises to God. May God bless all of you in attendance. I am grateful. I cannot say more than that today. Thank you all,\u201d he said.\n\nSanwo-Olu said that Tinubu\u2019s return was more than cheery news for his supporters across the country, noting that the APC leader had been rejuvenated with renewed vigour for his next political move.\n\nHe said that there were countless reasons to be grateful to God for bringing Asiwaju back home, fully rejuvenated.\n\n\u201dSince Friday when our leader and father came back, it has been a joyful moment for the teeming residents of Lagos, his supporters and Nigerians across the country.\n\n\u201dWe give glory to God who brought you (Tinubu) back with sound health and stronger vigour.\n\n\u201dOn behalf of all political office holders, party leaders and faithful, we welcome our leader back and we give praises to God on his behalf that the intention of evil-minded people who spread malicious rumour against our leader did not materialise.\n\n\u201dThis event shows Asiwaju is healthy and possesses more energy to embark on his next move in politics,\u201d the governor said.\n\nDeputy Gov. Obafemi Hamzat said that Tinubu\u2019s return deepened his associates\u2019 belief in God, as the APC National Leader\u2019s full recovery from the knee surgery was a sign of strength and favour from God.\n\n\u201dNow that Asiwaju is back, we are ready for work. The work has started and we are committed to doing it,\u201d Hamzat said.\n\nThe event was attended by all elected office holders and political appointees in Lagos, including the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Femi Gbajabiamila, and Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mr Mudashiru Obasa.\n\nMembers of the State Executive Council, Governor\u2019s Advisory Council (GAC) and council chairmen were also in attendance.\n\nGbajabiamila, who spoke on behalf of the National Assembly members, described Tinubu as \u2018an eagle\u2019, who was focused and always ahead of the game.\n\nThe Speaker said that he wondered why a \u2018simple knee surgery\u2019 became a national issue, but the solidarity shown towards Tinubu across ethnic divides indicates that the APC National Leader is an enigma.\n\nObasa called Tinubu a teacher and benefactor, saying his return has put the malicious rumour against him to rest.\n\nChairman of Conference 57, Mr Kolade Alabi, described the event as \u2018symbolic\u201d, adding that members of the Conference were ready to join Tinubu in his next political move.\n\nPrayers were offered for Tinubu by Muslim and Christian clerics.

          "text": "*Insists Nigeria better off united, optimistic nation will overcome challenges\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, said at the weekend in London that President Muhammadu Buhari was the only politician in Nigeria at this time with the charisma and credibility to rally the whole country behind the patriotic push to rise above its current challenges.\n\nOsinbajo stressed the need for Nigeria to remain an indivisible country, assuring that its challenges would soon be overcome.\n\nThe vice president spoke during an interactive session with top officials of the Nigerian High Commission in London.\n\nHe declared, \u201cIf you look at all of us sitting here, we represent all the geopolitical zones. This is the Nigeria that will succeed; anything else doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nDescribing Buhari\u2019s popularity and credibility as a crucial factor in galvanizing the entire system to resolve the challenges, Osinbajo said, \u201cThe president is possibly the most popular Nigerian politician that we ever had in generations. He is possibly the only person, who can go into a place or somewhere without bossing people to gather and they will come and listen to him speak.\n\n\u201cWe need that level of credibility to be able to solve problems in our country. And I think because of his level of credibility, despite everything, he is still the only one that can call everyone, and even people, who do not necessarily agree with him know that he is a man of his words.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo urged Nigerians at home and in the diaspora to promote the message of one country, noting, \u201cAnybody, who looks at how Nigeria operates will recognise that we are better off in this system, and that is the truth.\n\n\u201cYoruba are not better off on their own. Igbos are not better off on their own. The North is not better off on its own. We are better off as one nation, that is why we are strong and that is why we can face the world.\u201d\n\nFurther stressing the need for unity, he stated, \u201cIf you read of the economics of smaller nations, they are looking for how they can become stronger by aligning with other nations. How does a country with all the potential and everything that we have, think that the best way is to break up?\n\n\u201cWe are at a point in time in our history, where we have security challenges; we have economic challenges, and if you talk about security, there are so many dimensions to it. If you look carefully, all of these could happen to any government and I think we are in the very best position to solve the problems that face us today.\n\n\u201cSecurity challenges that we have didn\u2019t show up in one day but it is the government, the people, the men and women that will handle them.We happen to be that government, and I am very convinced that we are entirely capable of handling these challenges. I think we are in the best possible position to solve these problems.\u201d\n\nOsinbjo enjoined staff of the High Commission to remain good ambassadors of the country and endeavour to promote justice and fairness in their activities, even as they make more efforts to promote government\u2019s programmes and policies.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe must promote one country. But, of course, everybody talks about justice, fairness and balance, and that is what we must try to do on a continuous basis.\n\n\u201cLet us not be discouraged, let us be very confident, because our country will come out of all these problems and emerge stronger. So, I urge every person, who represents our country, to ensure that we represent the country well and be able to speak up at the right forum about the country and what we are doing.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Tinubu made the remarks on Sunday at the Lagos House, Marina, in his \u201cThank you speech\u201d during a reception to welcome him back home, organised by Governor Bababjide Samwo-Olu of Lagos State, on behalf of the state government. \u201cI am standing before you hale and hearty,\u201d the former governor declared at the event tagged, \u201cWelcome Back Home Asiwaju.\u201d\n\nTinubu, who returned to the country on Friday night after a successful surgery on his right knee, spent over three months in London. His arrival to the country came barely 24 hours after a campaign group, South West Agenda (SWAGA 2023), was launched in Lagos by Governor Sanwo-Olu to champion Tinubu\u2019s presidential ambition ahead of the 2023 polls.\n\nThe reception featured prayers for Tinubu, who expressed gratitude to God for bringing him back to Nigeria safely. He also thanked all the political leaders and groups that had wished him well.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am a little emotional, but I am happy to be back home. God is the giver of life and He alone can take it. I\u2019m grateful to Him for giving me the privilege to be alive. I\u2019m Hale and hearty, I can\u2019t but praise and thank Him.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Sanwo-Olu, his deputy, Obafemi Hamzat; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila; and Senator Adeola Olamilekan, said in their speeches that they were working to ensure Tinubu\u2019s mandate in 2023.\n\nSanwo-Olu said, \u201cOn behalf of the teeming Lagosians that cannot come to this premises to welcome you back home. Today, being the 10th of October, God has brought you back home.\u201d\n\nThe governor thanked those who had prayed for the safe return of Tinubu, saying, \u201cThe best is yet to come.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila, too, prayed, saying, \u201cFrom today, the best days of your past will be the worst days of your future.\u201d\n\nHe added that the northern caucus of the House of Representatives\u2019 visit to Tinubu in London was a strong statement, and that the southern caucus had planned to make similar visit before Tinubu\u2019s arrival on Friday.\n\nGbajabiamila said, \u201cWhere you are going, is destined. We are ready in the National Assembly. There are men and there are men. The history of Nigeria cannot be written politically without you occupying three quarters of the pages.\u201d\n\nSpeaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, said, \u201cIt is a great honour to be here and be part of this gathering, particularly, to welcome our leader and mentor. We told them you are hale and hearty. We thank you for your guidance, we pray, we will continue to enjoy your mentorship.\u201d\n\nHamzat said, \u201cIt is only God that is constant; He cannot sick. Any human being can be subjected to anything but we thank God that our father has come back.\u201d\n\nRepresenting Lagos Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Stephen Adegbite, quoting Psalm 91 from the Holy Bible, prayed copiously for Tinubu\u2019s good health and his 2023 ambition, saying, \u201cWe are praying for you. You will get there. You will not die.\u201d\n\nOthers at the reception included wife of the state governor, Mrs. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu; Tinubui\u2019s wife, Senator Oluremi; former Lagos Deputy governors, Mrs. Idiat Adebule, and Abiodun Ogunleye; members of the Governor\u2019s Advisory Council (GAC); local government chairmen; Secretary to the State Government, Folasade Jaji; Chief of Staff, Tayo Ayinde and other members of the state Executive Council, members of the House of Representatives; members of the Lagos State House of Assembly; party chieftains, clergymen, and market leaders.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nSenior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr. Femi Falana, has written to the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, demanding the immediate enforcement of the judgment of the Supreme Court directing the federal government to recover the sum of $62 billion from six International Oil Companies (IOCs) over wrong sharing formula.\n\nFalana in the letter dated October 8, 2021, also threatened legal action against the AGF if he refuses to enforce the said judgment.\n\nHe wrote on behalf of his clients Professor Omotoye Olorode and Jaye Gaskia of the People\u2019s Alternative Political Movement (PAPM).\n\nThe letter titled: \u201cRequest For Compliance with Judgment of The Supreme Court of Nigeria in Suit No SC. 964/2016 Between Akwa Ibom and 2 Ors vs Attorney General of the Federation, is not unconnected to a recent statement credited to the Minister of State for Petroleum, Mr. Timipre Sylva, to the extent that it is near impossible for the federal government to recover the said sum from the IOCs.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court had in a judgment delivered on October 20, 2018, directed the federal government to immediately take steps to recover all revenues lost to oil-exploring and exploiting companies due to wrong profit-sharing formula since August 2003.\u201d\n\nFalana\u2019s client claimed that based on the aforesaid judgment, Malami had \u201crequest for the immediate payment of the sum of $62 billion owed by the six International Oil Companies with joint operating agreements with the NNPC.\u201d\n\nThe affected companies were: Shell Petroleum Development Company, Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited, Chevron Nigeria Limited, Nigeria Agip Oil Company, TotalElf Nigeria and Pan Ocean Oil Company.\n\nBut Falana\u2019s client had quoted Sylva as saying, \u201cWell, we have started discussions. Let us consider that as a lost opportunity, the money was not in a cupboard, they have taken it.\n\n\u201cNobody can bring out that kind of money, I mean we can\u2019t get $62billion. We can maybe get something from them but not $62billion. It\u2019s an opportunity we have lost. We have already started discussions with them but what is clear is that it is a lost opportunity really.\u201d\n\nBased on this they have now instructed Falana to request that Malami uses his good office to ensure that the said sum of $62 billion was recovered from the IOCs and paid into the federation account without any further delay.\n\n\u201cHowever, if you fail or refuse to accede to the request of our client we shall not hesitate to approach the Federal High Court to seek an order to compel you to comply with the judgment of the Supreme Court in accordance with section 287(1) of the Constitution which provides that the decisions of the Supreme court shall be enforced in any part of the Federation by all authorities and persons, and by courts with subordinate jurisdiction to that of the supreme Court.\n\n\u201cAs we await your reply to this letter please accept the assurances of our highest esteem and professional regards\u201d, the letter added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He is on the run.\n\nA young army captain and Marxist-Leninist, Sankara came to power in a coup in 1983 aged just 33.\n\nHe changed the country\u2019s name from Upper Volta, a legacy of the French colonial era, to Burkina Faso, which means \u201cthe land of honest men.\"\n\nHe lobbied with a socialist agenda of nationalisation and prohibited female genital mutilation, polygamy and forced marriages.\n\nLike Ghana\u2019s former leader Jerry Rawlings, he became an idol in left-wing circles in Africa, applauded for his radical policies and defiance of the big powers.\n\nBurkina Faso has long been burdened by silence over the assassination \u2013 during Compaore\u2019s long time in office, the subject was taboo \u2013 and many are angry that the killers have gone unpunished.\n\n\u201cThe trial will mark the end to all the lying \u2013 we will get a form of truth. But the trial will not be able to restore our dream,\u201d Halouna Traore, a comrade of Sankara and survivor of the putsch, said in a TV interview.",

          "title": "China\u2019s growing influence is transforming African tech",
          "text": "In 2013, M-Pesa, Africa\u2019s largest mobile money platform, was faced with a major challenge: Its users couldn\u2019t settle insurance premiums and make bank payments in real-time. Payments made to Kenya Power took 48 hours before reflecting in the company\u2019s systems; other payments, like the one to the National Hospital Insurance Fund, experienced longer delay times, often taking three days before they were acknowledged.\n\nAmong the many reasons for these lengthy settlements and transfer times was the fact that M-Pesa\u2019s mobile money platform could only handle between 200 to 300 transactions per second. But that needed to increase by at least tenfold to make transactions more seamless.\n\nDesperate for a way out, the Vodacom and Safaricom-owned M-Pesa turned to Chinese tech giant Huawei, which helped migrate M-Pesa\u2019s 12.8 million active users over the space of 18 months to a better-performing mobile money platform.\n\nEight years later, M-Pesa has scaled operations to cater for its 50 million active users in the seven African countries it operates in \u2013 Kenya, Tanzania, Lesotho, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Mozambique and Egypt. It now processes over a billion transactions every month.\n\nMostly working in the background, Beijing Murong Technology, a Chinese financial software company, also collaborated with Huawei over the years to introduce some features to M-Pesa.\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\n\n\nSuccess begets success\n\nM-Pesa\u2019s success meant that when Ethiopia\u2019s state-owned telecoms company Ethio telecom decided to build the country\u2019s first mobile money platform, TeleBirr, they turned to Huawei.\n\nLaunched in May 2021, TeleBirr caters to the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. In just two months since its launch, TeleBirr has added six million users to its mobile payment system without a hitch.\n\nFor Huawei, these feats highlight its shift from providing solely telecommunications infrastructure to now providing its network customers with technology to run mobile payment applications in as many as 19 African countries. Encouraged by its accomplishments, Huawei also recently announced its intention to build an innovation and research centre in Tunisia, head of the company\u2019s North Africa region.\n\nThe success of M-Pesa and Telebirr has enhanced Huawei\u2019s reputation as the poster child for China\u2019s enterprising tech sector. Meanwhile, the collaboration between Huawei and Beijing Murong Technology highlights a bigger trend: Beyond building bridges, rail lines, airports and roads across the continent, Chinese companies are increasingly building digital infrastructures in Africa.\n\nWhy Africa? The African market offers Chinese companies and investors a growing young population expected to reach 1.7 billion by 2030. Presently, about 50% of this growing population is excluded from the financial system and less than 40% have access to the internet. This presents a massive opportunity to boost financial inclusion and connectivity.\n\nThe indispensable player\n\nThe presence of tech companies like Huawei and ZTE in Africa dates back to the 1990s. Their expansion to Africa was fueled by the desire to fill a vacuum left by the growing disinterest by Western companies and countries to invest in Africa. These Chinese tech companies decided to establish a stronger presence in Africa despite the political and economic instability. In the long run, this move has paid off and the results are glaring.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that you wouldn\u2019t have a thriving African tech ecosystem today without the Chinese,\u201d said Eric Orlander, Managing Editor of the Chinese Africa Project, a media organisation dedicated to exploring every aspect of China\u2019s engagement with Africa.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese were not there, Africa would be 15 years behind at least. Think about it, about 50% of the phones in Africa are controlled by one company: Transsion.\u201d\n\nOrlander cites the success of Transsion, Africa\u2019s leading mobile phone maker which went public on a $7 billion valuation, and more recently Opay, a fintech platform with over 5 million users, which raised $400 million at a $2 billion valuation from investors like Softbank.\n\n\u201cThese Chinese companies are challenging the assumption that you can\u2019t make money in Africa and that the African tech ecosystem isn\u2019t really that big.\u201d\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\nBeyond just making money, once these Chinese companies strike gold, they go on to invest in other upcoming Chinese startups. In 2018, Transsion led a $40 million seed investment in PalmPay, a digital payment service, with participation from China\u2019s NetEase and Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek. PalmPay offers peer-to-peer money transfers, airtime purchase and bill payments in Nigeria and Ghana with plans to expand to other African countries.\n\nRiding on Transsion\u2019s wings, in 2020, PalmPay came pre-installed on about 20 million units of Transsion phone brands \u2013 Tecno, Infinix and itel. Likewise, from June 2021, Huawei Mobile Kenya users were able to make in-app purchases via M-Pesa.\n\nChinese tech giant, Alibaba Group, hasn\u2019t been left out of the action. Its online and mobile payment platform Alipay collaborated with Vodacom to develop VodaPay, a super app positioned to drive financial inclusion and economic growth in South Africa. In June 2021, VodaPay was unveiled, with 70 companies already signed up on it.\n\nNotably, Wapi Pay, a Singapore-based Kenyan fintech startup powering the Africa-Asia cross-border payment, uses Huawei\u2019s mobile money services. An indication that contemporary fintech startups are also relying on Chinese tech.\n\n\u201cChinese technology is the foundational technology in Africa. I call it the indispensable player in the African tech space. You take the Chinese piece out and African tech falls apart,\u201d Orlander said.\n\nCaution, concerns and the reality\n\nThe proliferation of Chinese enterprises in Africa has attracted a great deal of scepticism from academics, policymakers and other observers in recent years. Of particular concern is the relationship between Chinese companies and the Chinese communist party as well as how the data from Africa is used.\n\nJili Bulelani, a South African researcher at Havard with research interests in Africa-China relations, is concerned about this.\n\n\u201cThe question a lot of the time is how deep Chinese companies like Huawei are involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt some level, we can see them supporting fibre optics, cloud storage and mobile money projects. But there are questions around who owns this data and the legal ramifications around people securing themselves and their data.\u201d\n\nThese issues around data usage are worsened by the fact that there aren\u2019t effective data laws in Africa to protect its citizens. About 50% of countries on the continent don\u2019t have data protection laws backed by legislation.\n\nWhile Orlander agrees that the answer to these questions about Huawei\u2019s practices is relatively opaque, partly because Huawei does not communicate well enough about this, he also clamours for a practical look at the situation.\n\nHe believes that, from a practical standpoint, African countries are better served by these Chinese companies because their products are cheaper and more tailored to the African market. Africa is a difficult place to do business, and as such, most African countries and companies are not in a strong negotiating position.\n\n\u201cWhen the Americans told the Kenyans that they should not use Huawei for 5G networks, the answer from Safaricom was, \u2018Okay, but what do we do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFor African countries, the choice at the end of the day is not between Nokia, Alcatel, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. Oftentimes, it\u2019s between Huawei and nothing.\u201d\n\nHe also points out that the accusations against Huawei aren\u2019t about the performance of their products and services. A testament to the fact that they make quality products that meet the needs of their clients.\n\nHenry Tugendhat, a senior policy analyst with the China team at the US Institute of Peace, is of the opinion that if Africans are really concerned about cybersecurity then they have to start with the assumption that everybody is interested in our data and communications.\n\n\u201cUntil African countries manufacture their own equipment, they\u2019ll always be susceptible to international organisations having access to their data,\u201d Tugendhat said. \u201cTo manage the situation it\u2019s going to come down to how African countries can legislate and how they enforce that legislation.\u201d\n\nIs there room for competition?\n\nDespite the immense contribution of Chinese tech to the African fintech space, there\u2019s still room for growth. Per the GSMA report 2020, less than 50% of the African population have a phone. This pales in comparison with the US (81%) or even China (63%).\n\nThe race is still on for the different players building digital infrastructure for the African fintech space. Iginio Gagliardone, author of China, Africa, and the Future of the Internet is of the opinion that there might not be much room left for competition in the next few years.\n\n\u201cChina tends to approach projects with a longer time horizon. With it making headway in the physical and digital infrastructure space, it could use its pervasiveness to lock in standards against competitors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they keep creating at this momentum, it\u2019ll be difficult to unbundle and pull the plug. I\u2019m a bit more worried about the future,\u201d Gagliardone added.\n\nIn the past decade, China has become a central player in Africa\u2019s development. Having a strong Chinese presence in African tech has clearly been very beneficial; a monopolistic dominance is what\u2019s worrying.\n\nTechCabal contacted Huawei for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate",
          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at a leading e-commerce company,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "At the first virtual Google for Africa event today, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made huge strides together over the past decade \u2014 but there\u2019s more work to do to make the internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d Sundar Pichai said.\n\nTo provide affordable internet access in Africa, Google is building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Its subsea cable Equiano will run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena and connect the continent with Europe.\n\nAs part of Google\u2019s commitment to supporting Black-led startups in Africa, the company announced the launch of an Africa Investment Fund. Through this fund, it will invest $50M in startups and provide them with access to Google\u2019s employees, network, and technologies to help them build meaningful products for their communities. This is in addition to Google\u2019s existing support through the Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, which has helped more than 80 African startups with equity-free finance, working space and access to expert advisors over the last three years.\n\n\u201cI am so inspired by the innovative African tech startup scene. In the last year we have seen more investment rounds into tech startups than ever before,\u201d Nitin Gajria, Managing Director for Google in Africa said.\n\n\u201cI am of the firm belief that no one is better placed to solve Africa\u2019s biggest problems than Africa\u2019s young developers and startup founders. We look forward to deepening our partnership with, and support for, Africa\u2019s innovators and entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nTo cater for small businesses and entrepreneurs, Google is collaborating with non-profit organisation Kiva to provide $10M in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa get through the economic hardship created by COVID-19.\n\nNonprofits haven\u2019t been left out of this, Google.org is expanding its commitment to support nonprofits working to improve lives across Africa, with an additional $40M to help more partners organisations. In the case of the Airqo team at Makerere University, who use AI and sensors to monitor poor air quality, a leading cause of premature death. Google is providing $3M in new grant funding to expand this pioneering work from Kampala across 10 cities in 5 countries on the continent.\n\nThe announcement of the $1bn investment is commendable and a testament to Google\u2019s commitment to supporting digital transformation in Africa. Since 2017, Google has trained 6 million young Africans and businesses in digital skills. Google has also supported more than 50 nonprofits across Africa with over $16 million of grants and enabled 100 million more Africans to access internet services for the first time through Android.\n\nShare this article\n\nAdegoke Oyeniyi | Author @seunadegoke01",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe underrepresentation of women in the tech space continues to be a prevalent phenomenon in most parts of the world. A 2020 study by AnitaB.Org shows that of all hires made by tech companies in the US, 29.4% were women, while 69.9% were men.\n\nCloser to home, Techpoint Africa\u2019s West African Startup Decade Report 2020 corroborates the story in the US. It estimates that between 2010 and 2019, only 10% of West African startups with a female co-founder raised $1 million.\n\nIn Africa, the girl child\u2019s access to education is still quite low. According to UNESCO 52 million girls are out of school.\n\nWhile these might seem like just numbers, it encompasses the story of many women who perceive the tech space as one reserved just for men. In Yanmo Omorogbe\u2019s \u2014 Co-Founder, Bamboo \u2014 opinion, seeing more women do things in tech might encourage more women to come in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs male-dominated as the tech space is, however, some women are making their mark, serving as a source of encouragement for more women to dive in.\n\nTo celebrate this year\u2019s International Day for the Girl Child, Techpoint Africa spoke to four tech women about their work, life and how they\u2019re navigating a male-dominated ecosystem.\n\nMuthoni Masinde, Founder ITIKI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProf. Muthoni Masinde, Founder, ITIKI\n\nThe idea behind Prof Muthoni Masinde\u2019s startup is rooted in the history of the Kenyan village where she grew up. Masinde transformed ancient knowledge into a technology that has been of immense help to her people.\n\nHer startup, ITIKI, was built from the understanding of nature that her people have gathered through many generations. They could predict, almost accurately, what the weather would be by observing the demeanour of their cattle and the unique croaks of a toad that said the rain was coming.\n\nShe combined this indigenous knowledge with tech to birth ITIKI. The startup created a drought prediction solution for small-scale farmers and has moved beyond predicting droughts to locust attacks.\n\nStarting in a Kenyan village\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProf. Muthoni Masinde, CEO of ITIKI. Source: Supplied\n\nMasinde\u2019s journey from peasant farmer in a remote Kenyan village to globally recognised academic and founder of a transformative agritech startup is an inspiring one.\n\nAlthough she describes her childhood as normal, she admits that looking back now, it was very hard. \u201cWhen you go to the city, and you look back, you realise those people are doing really difficult work.\u201d\n\nAt that time, education was a luxury for a female child growing up in Masinde\u2019s village. But luckily for her, she had a father that believed strongly in educating every child, regardless of gender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe would tell beautiful stories of very tall buildings in Nairobi. Personally, he\u2019ll tell me, \u2018my daughter can become a doctor,\u2019\u201d Masinde said with an expression that was perhaps the same one she had while her father told her those stories back then.\n\nShe combined having an understanding father with hard work to make a name for herself. While her peers were getting married, Masinde says she doubled down on school, and it paid off.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t without its challenges.\n\n\u201cThere was no electricity, so we never really studied at home. In the village setting, girls get more chores than boys, so we\u2019ll be busy until bedtime. Sweeping, cooking, or depending on the season, you either help with weeding or harvesting. Extremely busy life, but I think we enjoyed it.\u201d\n\nMaking it through school\n\nMasinde says she owes some of her academic success to being gifted. With few comprehension problems, she excelled at her favourite subjects like maths, physics, and chemistry.\n\nShe recalls a moment that inspired her greatly. \u201cI remember when my mom escorted me to school, carrying those big iron boxes. She told me, \u2018my daughter, the best gift you can give to us is working hard.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd that stuck with Masinde through high school and university, even to founding her startup.\n\nBuilding ITIKI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall-scale farmers using ITIKI solution. Source: Supplied\n\nPursuing a career in tech as a woman can be tricky. While Masinde admits things were easy for her, there were a few times she felt marginalised as a female, especially at the hands of male farmers while trying to explain her technology.\n\n\u201cThe more educated people are, the less likely they\u2019re going to look down on people. Every time we went to speak to the farmers, addressing men as old as your dad, they don\u2019t listen because they are not used to women being the ones up there.\u201d\n\nIn her opinion, culture plays a role in why tech and other major sectors have fewer women. From a tender age, girls are fed with information that makes them believe some dreams are only meant for a specific gender.\n\nA situation that leaves women at a disadvantage. She says women also need to be given equal chances as men, as most structures that are currently in place only favour men.\n\nTo women, Masinde says that for every tech opportunity that comes along, \u201cgo for it!\u201d\n\nYanmo Omorogbe, Co-Founder and COO, Bamboo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYanmo Omorogbe, Co-Founder and COO, Bamboo\n\nGrowing up in Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria, Osayanmo Omorogbe never had the intention of being an entrepreneur, let alone building a startup. And although she describes the journey towards building fintech startup, Bamboo, as a series of lucky stumbles, she was well equipped to make the best of them.\n\nFrom school days to finding tech\n\nAn ardent fan of the American soap opera Days of Our Lives, she always spared time from schooling activities to watch her favourite show.\n\nShe was fond of school and is still close to some of her best friends from Grange Schools, Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nAlthough she runs a fintech firm currently, she never had any interest in tech during her formative years.\n\n\u201cI was a Nigerian child that liked math and chemistry. I wanted to be a chemical engineer and work in Shell or something.\u201d\n\nHer \u201clucky stumbles\u201d into tech and finance began when she studied Chemical Engineering and discovered she didn\u2019t like it.\n\nThis led to an interest in finance and working with a private equity firm in Lagos. She learned more about finance and investing and even became a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) holder \u2014 a professional designation considered the gold standard for financial analysts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith her knowledge of finance and investing, she tried to get shares in companies like Apple and Google. But she couldn\u2019t. This difficulty birthed Bamboo; a means for Nigerians to invest in foreign stocks from the comfort of their phones.\n\nOmorogbe grew up knowing she could pursue any career. Having a mother who was a law professor and a grandmother who was one of West Africa\u2019s first female doctors, she needed no further reassurance that she was capable of anything.\n\n\u201cThere just wasn\u2019t any room for me to assume that women couldn\u2019t do whatever they wanted. \u201d\n\nIn contrast with this belief, she encountered people who felt some of her aspirations or career choices were reserved for men.\n\n\u201cI remember when I first said I wanted to study engineering, some random person was like, \u2018aren\u2019t engineers boys?\u2019 And I remember telling my dad, and it made absolutely no sense to him.\u201d\n\nAs the Co-Founder and COO of Bamboo, she faced this once again.\n\nNavigating the tech space\n\n\u201cI was talking to a would-be investor, and he was asking things along the lines of, \u2018Am I getting married soon? Am I thinking about having children soon? Because he won\u2019t invest in any business with a newlywed lady.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told someone I\u2019m running a fintech, and they were shocked that I\u2019m not into fashion.\u201d\n\nBut she\u2019s surrounded by women that continue to inspire her, from her sister, who\u2019s also her best friend, to her friends and family.\n\nFor those unlucky in finding a tight circle of fearless women who defy societal constructs, Omorogbe believes society has to make the tech space more comfortable for women.\n\n\u201cAs a society, we need to make it easier for women to become founders, to enter tech, to start learning to code, or know what other opportunities are available.\n\n\u201cSpaces need to be safer for women. Women are over mentored and underfunded. They don\u2019t need another seminar; give them a check.\u201d\n\nAddy Awofisayo, Head of Music, YouTube and YouTube Music (sub-Saharan Africa)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddy Awofisayo, Head of Music, YouTube and YouTube Music\n\nAddy Awofisayo\u2019s role as YouTube\u2019s Head of Music for sub-Saharan Africa is a perfect fit for her. Growing up, she had a flair for the arts, loving nothing better than storytelling.\n\nFrom finance to tech\n\nI could tell she was good at it by how she narrated the story behind the name Addy. It was coined by someone she met while at the University of Virginia, Virginia, US, from her original name, Adeola.\n\nHowever, despite her love for all things creative, she pursued a career in finance because \u201cthe smart people were doing accounting and finance, and I thought let me do accounting and finance,\u201d she says with a laugh.\n\nShe thrived in finance nonetheless, taking up jobs at renowned organisations such as PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) and Goldman Sachs. But, \u201cI hated it. I was like, \u2018this is not for me.\u2019\u201d\n\nAwofisayo wasn\u2019t enjoying the finance life, but all the smart people were doing, and she wanted to be part of the \u201csmart\u201d people.\n\n\u201cI realised I didn\u2019t want to do investment banking, and I didn\u2019t want to do public accounting. So if I still want to do this accounting and finance career, what do I do?\u201d\n\nHer question was answered by a fellow alumnus who was the CFO of the Windows division at Microsoft. He introduced her to building a career in finance in tech companies, and she welcomed the idea.\n\n\u201cI applied and got into the finance rotation program at Microsoft.\u201d And her tech career began.\n\nBut growing up, Awofisayo didn\u2019t like tech. \u201cIn high school, I thought all the science students were geeks and nerds. I always thought, to be in tech, you needed to be a science person, be good in computer science, and that just wasn\u2019t me.\u201d\n\nAlthough she found it odd combining finance and tech, she thought it was worth a try.\n\n\u201cOnce I started at Microsoft, I truly enjoyed it. It was very different from my Goldman Sachs and my public accounting experience that was very corporate.\u201d\n\nShe immediately fell in love with the tech culture. \u201cWhen I went for my interview at Microsoft, I wore a suit, and the person that was interviewing me had on jeans and a t-shirt. And I was like, am I at the right place?\u201d\n\nIt was then Awofisayo realised she had a knack for the tech life.\n\nAlthough the space was male-dominated, Awofisayo never felt intimidated. Like Omorogbe, she grew up knowing she could do whatever she wanted.\n\n\u201cMy mom is one of the strongest women I know, she spent a lot of her years championing her career, so I had that as a role model to let me know I could do whatever it was I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nAnd she did. After combining tech with finance, she pivoted to tech and creativity, something she has always had a passion for. She has worked with some of Africa\u2019s biggest music artists and creatives, and she\u2019s even more excited about the upcoming ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddy Awofisayo presenting silver play award to afrobeat artiste D\u2019banj. Source: Pulse.ng\n\n\u201cThe African music space is blowing up. Whether it\u2019s from songs like Essence or Nwatiti, it\u2019s not even your Wizkids and Burnas and Davids anymore. It\u2019s Temz, Ckay, Omah Lay. It\u2019s the next voice and the next generation that\u2019ll really take African music to the next level.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddy Awofisayo (left) andNaira Marley. Source: This Day\n\nAnd to women planning on venturing into the tech space, Awofisayo says, \u201cBe curious, chase that curiosity, seek out people, and don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\n\nIre Aderinokun, Co-Founder and COO, Helicarrier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIre Aderinokun, Co-Founder Helicarrier (Buycoins)\n\nHelicarrier (formally Buycoins) Co-Founder, Ire Aderinokun, was always drawn to tech growing up. She usually played with her parents\u2019 phones and really enjoyed gaming, attributes she says fostered her love for tech.\n\nThe road to tech\n\nSurprisingly, she didn\u2019t study a tech-related course in school.\n\n\u201cI was doing it as a hobby as a teenager. It was kind of on and off, and I didn\u2019t really know about computer science as a degree, so I ended up studying psychology for my undergraduate, and I did law for my masters.\u201d\n\nShe felt the boat to learning tech formerly had sailed, so she started learning independently and gave herself a year to see if she could forge a career out of learning coding on her own.\n\nStarting as a freelancer, she took on gigs but quickly found it frustrating, so the job hunt began.\n\nShe worked for a small web design company before moving to Big Cabal Media, where she met one of her co-founders \u2014 Timi Ajiboye \u2014 and they started building Helicarrier accidentally.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a backend developer. I\u2019m a front-end developer. So it just made sense to do a bunch of stuff together.\u201d\n\nHelicarrier started as one of their side projects. \u201cFor me, I wasn\u2019t necessarily thinking of it like, this was going to be our company. It was just like this is a really interesting project to work on.\u201d\n\nThey put months of work into the project and eventually launched it as a company. But it still seemed like a side project until Y Combinator came calling, and they realised things were getting real.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were all just working out of Timi\u2019s house. I\u2019ll just stroll in whenever. But when we had to actually fly to the US to do the interview with YC, that\u2019s the point we knew; this is something we\u2019re taking seriously.\u201d\n\nCreating tech opportunities for women\n\nAlthough she didn\u2019t face pushbacks as a woman in tech, she\u2019s actively creating opportunities for women to get into tech.\n\n\u201cAt a certain point, I got a bit tired of being the only woman wherever I went. It didn\u2019t really make sense cause I know there were plenty of women who are very interested in tech and are very capable, but we don\u2019t have access to some things.\u201d\n\nAderinokun is creating that access with her scholarship program that gives women free access to Udemy courses that\u2019ll help them advance their career in tech.\n\n\u201cI have the money to give scholarships and fund some people, so why not just try and do it. And it has grown over the years, and I hope it\u2019ll continue to grow.\u201d\n\nThrough the scholarship, she has seen females enter the tech space. One of the beneficiaries currently works with Aderiokun to run the programme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEver wondered how brands like Netflix, Bumble, Pinterest, Duolingo, Airbnb made it to the billion-dollar club? In three words \u2014 product-led growth (PLG).\n\nBut, what does product-led growth actually mean? On the surface, it may seem simple \u2014 building a great product with the right product-market fit. But that\u2019s not all! There\u2019s a lot more to PLG than meets the eye.\n\nA couple of years back, the path users took to \ufb01nding information on a product involved getting in touch with a customer care executive, waiting on the line to connect, and only hoping to get the relevant answers to all their queries.\n\nHowever, the narrative today is quite di\ufb00erent. In today\u2019s day and product-led age, the product plays the protagonist.\n\nThere\u2019s been a titanic shift in the way users engage with products. Users don\u2019t want to spend too much time learning about the product or seeking access to it. To stay ahead of the curve and keep up with the user\u2019s expectations, it\u2019s vital for brands to \ufb01re up their product in a way that lets customers fully experience and discover the product\u2019s value in a short period.\n\nThis playbook is your pocket guide to understanding product-led growth in depth and uncovering key strategies to embracing and implementing a product-led strategy.\n\nA user-centric module\n\nIt\u2019s about creating happy customers who are your biggest fans. PLG focuses on understanding what users want from a product, building that into your product roadmap, devising new features users demand, and updating existing ones to constantly improve upon the product. The pocket ace of a PLG approach is that it actually lets users experience the product \ufb01rst and pay for it later.\n\nAn emphasis on activation and retention as opposed to only acquisition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser acquisition is no longer the end game. PLG takes on a retention-first approach. Adopting a product-led strategy means building products in a way that lets users uncover features, discover the product\u2019s value quickly, making the entire app journey seamless. Going down the PLG route means putting constant e\ufb00ort into improving the product experience that gets users quickly activated on the product and become power users.\n\nA mindset\u2026\n\nA successful PLG strategy requires buy-in from all teams across the organisation. It\u2019s not something that you plan overnight and implement the following morning.\n\n\u2018Product-led is a mindset that needs to trickle down right from the product to the marketing teams. The topmost priority of every team should be delivering value to the users by solving their pain points. Product-led companies (the successful ones) are those where all teams look through the lenses of product-led growth and hit their business outcomes/goals by letting the product take the front seat.\n\nCommon myths about product-led growth\n\nIt\u2019s a B2B/SaaS thing\n\nYou will be surprised to know that up until recently, the concept of product-led growth was not commonly known/practiced, with the exception of a few brands, including Slack, Airtable, Salesforce, Calendly, Zapier, and their counterparts. Product-led growth has been a timeless strategy. B2C mobile apps have been implementing solutions to improve in-app user experiences without realising that these strategies tie back to product-led growth.\n\nProduct teams own product-led growth\n\nThe success of a PLG strategy is a lot about the product itself and a little less about the product teams. The answer to the question \u201cwho really owns product-led growth\u201d is \u201ceveryone\u201d\u201d.PLG may start with the product team having to build a superior product, however, it\u2019s about how the other teams are leveraging the product to accomplish business outcomes/goals and creating a great product experience for the users.\n\nA great product doesn\u2019t need a PLG strategy\n\nSimply having a great product is not synonymous with being product-led. Building a self-serving product \u2014 intuitive, o\ufb00ering users the desired value, guiding users through their journey without being intrusive \u2014 are all building blocks of a product-led strategy. The product sets the groundwork for PLG. However, there\u2019s more to the story of product-led growth. The tools/techniques employed to adopt and implement PLG, KPIs tracked to map the success of PLG, and imbibing a PLG mindset across every function of the organisation are equally important factors in truly driving product growth.\n\nLearn more about PLG\n\nOn October 14th, in partnership with Techpoint Africa, Netcore will be hosting an hour-long physical founders\u2019 meet and greet in Lagos to share more insights on a product-led growth guide, while taking founders through their ecosystem of products.

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe International Day of the Girl Child\n\nPayday\u2019s $1m pre-seed\n\nMy love for bread\n\nSquid Game and startup founders\n\nHappy International Day of the Girl Child\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, tech ecosystems are male-dominated; this makes it unsurprising that most startup founders are men.\n\nAccording to Techpoint Africa\u2019s West African Startup Decade Report 2020, only 10% of startups with a female co-founder have raised $1 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite these statistics, some African women have defied the odds and are gradually turning the tables in the tech scene.\n\nTo celebrate this year\u2019s International Day for the Girl Child, our reporter, Bolu Abiodun, showcases four incredible African women leaving a mark on Africa\u2019s tech history.\n\nListening in on the interviews and watching him prepare his story has been an exciting journey, and I can\u2019t wait to read it.\n\nPlease don\u2019t take my word for it though, watch out for his story later today.\n\nPayday raises $1 million pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavour Ori, CEO, Payday. Source: benjamindada\n\nWhat\u2019s going on? Cross-border payments platform, Payday has announced the close of its $1 million pre-seed.\n\nWith over 20 investors participating in the round, some include MAGIC Fund; Emergence Capital; Volition Capital; LoftyInc Capital; Edmund Olotu, Founder of Bloc; Prosper Otemuyiwa, Co-founder of Eden; and Abdul Hassan, Co-founder of Mono.\n\nLaunched in June 2021 by TalentMatch, a talent recruiting company, the platform facilitates cross-border payments from Africa, enables payments between foreign employers and clients, issues virtual cards, and eases payment of tuition and other fees in the US, Canada, and the UK.\n\nLaunched initially as a product under the TalentMatch umbrella, Payday has since evolved into a fintech company currently registered in the US, Canada, and Rwanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter its launch in June, Payday says it had over 5,000 users and processed over $1.4 million transactions within the first three weeks, with most of its users coming through referrals and \u201cword of mouth\u201d.\n\nAccording to Bosun Tijani, a member of Payday\u2019s advisory board, \u201cPayday\u2019s solution is extremely timely, and it backs up Africa\u2019s agenda of a single market. Making it seamless and easy to pay people in their local currency and through multiple checkout options is a strong boost for AfCFTA.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s bread scarcity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@sonderquest?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Sonder Quest</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/africa-market?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a></span>\n\nFirst fun fact: I love bread\n\nSecond fun fact: I recently found out that me and Emmanuel \u2014 Techpoint\u2019s Senior Reporter \u2014 share an uncommon love for bread. If you like bread \u2014 or any other flour-based products \u2014 like the two of us, then you might want to read this.\n\nIn April 2021, The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced plans to place wheat and sugar on the list of foods banned from accessing foreign exchange to conserve national dollar reserves and encourage local production.\n\nAnd in June, Bloomberg reported that Nigerian wheat buyers had to turn to the parallel market to get dollars.\n\nLast week, on Monday, October 4, 2021, rumours surfaced that the CBN was closer to implementing these plans, as the apex bank is looking to cut back Nigeria\u2019s annual spend of $2 billion on wheat imports.\n\nSo, what does that mean in a country where as of August 2021, food inflation rates stood at 20.03%?\n\nData from the National Bureau of Statistics reveal that the average bread prices in Nigeria increased by 20.71% for unsliced bread and 17.25% for sliced bread year on year. As Nigerians \u2014 read I and Emmanuel \u2014 mourn this rise in cost, Intelligence by Techpoint considered the average bread prices over the past 24 months.\n\nYou can see this here.\n\nSquid Game lessons for startup founders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last few weeks, it seems the Internet broke after Netflix\u2019s original movie, Squid Game premiered on September 17, 2021. Written and directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk, the film has received a lot of attention since it was released.\n\nSo, full disclaimer: I haven\u2019t seen it yet. But I found a thread on Twitter by Joshua Wong, co-founder, Tokyo Coding Club, about lessons for startup founders and thought I should share. Also, there might be spoilers.\n\nFirst mover advantage? From Episode 1: Red Light, Green Light, Wong draws his first lesson. First mover advantage means that you get to the finish line faster without much competition, but this also means that competitors will learn from your mistakes and play better.\n\nIt\u2019s all in the strategy: One of the six games contestants played was the honeycomb cookie game, where players had to carefully draw out a shape from the cookie without breaking it.\n\nAnd just like participants\u2019 strategy determined if they were successful or not, Wong says this applies to startups as well. He, however, cautions that it might not always work while advising patience in execution.\n\nYou can check out the other four lessons here\n\nWhile trying to make sense of the movie, I found some interesting titbits. Want to make your honeycomb \u2014 dalgona (or ppopgi in Korean) \u2014 cookie?

          "title": "Criticism trails Nigeria\u2019s failure to recognise fully vaccinated citizens",
          "text": "Fully vaccinated Nigerians returning to the country from abroad are not being recognised by the country\u2019s travel protocol, as they have to take PCR test and self-isolate for seven days.\n\nTravellers have, therefore, expressed concerns on why Nigeria is refusing to recognise COVID-19 vaccines it has given to its citizens, yet asks the United Kingdom (UK) Government to remove it from the travel blacklist on the back of the same vaccines.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s checks show that the travel portal filled on entry into Nigeria doesn\u2019t differentiate between unvaccinated and fully vaccinated persons.\n\nAll travellers are required to self-isolate upon arrival for seven to 14 days whether fully vaccinated or not. They are also asked to make compulsory payment for COVID-19 tests which must be taken seven days after arrival.\n\nRecall that when the United Kingdom (UK) relaxed its COVID-19 vaccine policy for more than 50 countries, Nigeria was initially missing from the list. This met condemnations from the Nigerian Government and travellers.\n\nThe UK Government later reviewed the policy to allow fully vaccinated travellers from Nigeria into the UK without needing to provide a pre-departure test, undertake a day-8 test or self-isolate for 10 days, although they still need to book and pay for a day-2 test.\n\nTravellers are, therefore, worried that the Nigerian Government, which criticised the UK\u2019s initial restrictions, is doing the same to its own citizens.\n\nRead Also: UK changes travel rules for fully vaccinated travellers from Nigeria\n\nIkechi Uko, travel and tourism expert described Nigeria\u2019s action towards its vaccinated citizens as \u201chypocrisy,\u201d noting that Nigeria demands reciprocity and respect, but does not offer such privilege to its own citizens.\n\n\u201cIf the COVID-19 PCR test at the airport is not a racket, then Nigeria should at least recognise its own vaccination process.\n\n\u201cThe biggest disincentive for travelling now is the PCR process. The vaccination cards were introduced to ease this logjam, but I guess the Nigerian Government knows some people will not vaccinate, but get the card. Like we do with the fever yellow card,\u201d Uko said.\n\nHe explained the PCR test adds to the stress and cost of travelling now that it is difficult to package a tour for a family without contemplating the cost, time and inconvenience of the tests.\n\nSindy Foster, principal managing partner, Avaero Capital Partners said Nigeria likes to shout about reciprocity when it feels it is the victim of discrimination, adding that any attempt by any country to create policies that they perceive to negatively target Nigerians is rightly frowned at, but when Nigeria is the discriminator, it is silent on that topic.\n\n\u201cThere was uproar on all fronts when the UK Government included Nigeria in the not fully vaccinated category (before the verification of the vaccination certification process). People were calling for Nigeria to reciprocate. But at the time, I pointed out that Nigeria does not recognise any vaccination programme from anywhere in the world.\n\n\u201cThere is no difference in the travel requirements for fully vaccinated or unvaccinated in Nigeria, yet there were calls demanding the Nigerian Government to retaliate. In reality, it had nothing to do with the vaccine, or Nigerians or non-Nigerians. The policy affected all travellers from Nigeria equally,\u201d Foster said.\n\nWhile the Federal Government may argue that it is in the public interest for the status quo to remain so they can continue to keep COVID-19 in check domestically, BusinessDay\u2019s checks show that Nigeria has only fully vaccinated 1.1 percent of the population to date, while the UK has fully vaccinated 67.2 percent of its population.\n\nFoster said if Nigeria were to reciprocate, there would be no change to non-vaccinated inbound passengers or indeed the payment they collect for inbound fully vaccinated passengers.\n\n\u201cThey currently collect payment of one test fee for inbound passengers. This would remain the same. But the financial burden would be less for the passenger because of not needing to pay for an initial PCR test before departure to Nigeria or UK,\u201d she explained\n\nShe noted that Nigeria would need to look at the demographic profile of the visitors to Nigeria to work out how many would be fully vaccinated visitors. Given that ethnic minorities are reported to have below-average uptake of vaccines, it is likely it would not have as big an impact on the relaxation of rules for fully vaccinated.\n\nThe UK policy is expected to see an increase in trips from Nigeria to the UK for leisure and business.\n\nSusan Akporiaye, president of the National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies, (NANTA), told BusinessDay that discussions are ongoing to recognise fully vaccinated citizens and there would be some reconsiderations on that because if the UK can consider fully vaccinated travellers and remove some requirements for fully vaccinated Nigerians, likewise all other countries should do same.\n\n\u201cThe UK is trying to encourage more travels from Nigeria and the vaccine campaign and Nigeria should do the same,\u201d Akporiaye said.\n\nAccording to Seyi Adewale, chief executive officer \u2013 Mainstream Cargo Limited, Nigeria generally operates from the principle of bilateral reciprocity with the UK, however, this is currently being aligned and the latest information via the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) reveals Nigeria is setting up a single portal to verify fully vaccinated Nigerians.\n\nThe UK Consulate is partnering with responsible local agencies to assist Nigeria in fast-tracking the process of this portal through advisory and technical support, Adewale said.",

          "title": "Remote working fails to reduce prime office rents in Nigerian cities",
          "text": "Prime office rents in Nigerian big cities recorded a marginal increase in the first quarter of 2021 (Q1 2021), showing that working from home (WFH) triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic failed to reduce the cost of renting such properties.\n\nThe rent increased the most on Aba Road, in Port Harcourt; Yaba, in Lagos, and Wuse Zone 2, in Abuja, according to the latest report on the Nigerian Real Estate Market by Northcourt Real Estate.\n\nOther submarkets where there were increases are Central Business District in Abuja; Ikoyi, Victoria Island and Lekki, in Lagos. Olu Obasanjo Road in Port Harcourt also saw an increase.\n\nThe average prime office rent on Aba Road was N15,000 per square in 2021, up from N13,000 per square metre in 2020, representing a 15 percent increase. Similarly, in Yaba, rent rose from N22,000 per square metre in 2020 to N25,000 per square metre in 2021 which is about a 14 percent increase. In Wuze Zone 2, it was N65,000 per square metre in 2021, up from N58,000 per square metre in 2020, representing a 12 percent increase.\n\nOther market nodes in the identified big cities also recorded an increase in rents despite many companies preferring their staff to work from home. For instance, in Lagos, rent was also sticky in Ikeja with average rent up 12 percent between the first half of 2020 and 2021. In 2020 it was N25,000 per square metre, but increased to N28,000 per square metre in 2021.\n\nRead Also: Office space demand drops to 5-year low\n\nThe Central Business District in Abuja saw 9 percent rent increase within the period under review as it moved from N52,000 per square metre in 2020 to N62,000 in 2021.\n\nIkoyi and Victoria Island in Lagos, which are home to over 70 percent of the estimated 1.4 million square meters of total office stock in Nigeria, recorded a low increase in rent. Both had a 4 percent increase apiece.\n\nPrime office rents in Nigeria\n\nWhile rent increased from N169,000 per square metre in 2020 to N176,000 in 2021 in Ikoyi, the increase in Victoria Island was from N175,000 in 2020 to N182,000 per square metre in 2021. Lekki, another island location in the city, recorded a higher rent increase at 6 percent.\n\nThese statistics, as contained in the Nigerian Real Estate Market report by Northcourt Real Estate, show where opportunities exist for investors who have not just patient capital, but also a long-term view of the market.\n\n\u201cDevelopments have begun to progress beyond pre-pandemic levels, except where fused into a mixed-use development, in which case development has been more accelerated,\u201d Tayo Odunsi, Northcourt CEO, noted.\n\nBesides Purple Capital and Agility which are bullish with mixed-use developments despite the pandemic, there are also pockets of developers who are doing developments, intent on tapping into the opportunities offered by the emerging hybrid workplace experience.\n\nGapstone Developers Limited, one of such developers, is building one-of-a-kind mixed-use facility known as Zirconia Heights. This is a 10-floor mixed-use development that promises a total of 62-unit apartments comprising 1, 2 and 3-bedroom apartments.\n\n\u201cThe development also has both office and retail components, each designed specifically with specialised amenities to serve residential and commercial needs. There are also fibre optic internet, CCTV and automatic car access,\u201d Adetoro Bank-Omotoye, the firm\u2019s managing director, explained.\n\nOdunsi noted that the increase in WFH technology has contributed to changes in residential demand, rents, and the repurposing of office space, adding that high skilled knowledge workers operating from their homes survived the hardest points of the pandemic.\n\nAccording to him, post-COVID\n\nprojections are that private offices would see the highest demand, followed by open-plan space types with everyone having their own space. \u201cThe amount of floor space per user will be higher as COVID-19 safety protocols are likely to continue into mid-2022,\u201d he reasoned, pointing out that businesses would need to redefine the amount of space new-normal occupiers would require.\n\n\u201cCo-working operators have been one of the acquirers of vacant office space globally. How often (and how many) employees will work from home, will also influence the changes in demand for individual offices and consequently, entire buildings,\u201d he said.\n\nLandlords, he noted, were further along on modernising their assets by setting up infrared checkpoints, installing anti-viral surface coatings, health and wellness features and full COVID-19 access protocols.\n\n\u201cWhile these are expensive range of activities, they are, however, non-negotiable requirements to international occupiers.\n\nIt is expected that companies will prefer to rent serviced offices to the classic open-plan co-working space as a cost-efficient strategy while enhancing employee productivity,\u201d Odunsi said.",

          "text": "The debt burden of the world\u2019s low-income countries rose 12 percent to a record $860 billion in 2020, according to a new World Bank report.\n\nDebt reduction, restructuring, and transparency needed to help low-income countries overcome debt challenges, the World Bank said on Monday.\n\nGovernments around the world responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with massive fiscal, monetary, and financial stimulus packages. While these measures were aimed at addressing the health emergency, cushioning the impact of the pandemic on the poor and vulnerable and putting countries on a path to recovery, the resulting debt burden of the world\u2019s low-income countries rose 12 percent to a record $860 billion in 2020, according to a new World Bank report.\n\nEven prior to the pandemic, many low- and middle-income countries were in a vulnerable position, with slowing economic growth and public and external debt at elevated levels. External debt stocks of low- and middle-income countries combined rose 5.3 percent in 2020 to $8.7 trillion. According to the new International Debt Statistics 2022 report, an encompassing approach to managing debt is needed to help low- and middle-income countries assess and curtail risks and achieve sustainable debt levels.\n\n\u201cWe need a comprehensive approach to the debt problem, including debt reduction, swifter restructuring and improved transparency,\u201d said World Bank Group President David Malpass. \u201cSustainable debt levels are vital for economic recovery and poverty reduction.\u201d\n\nThe deterioration in debt indicators was widespread and impacted countries in all regions. Across all low- and middle-income countries, the rise in external indebtedness outpaced Gross National Income (GNI) and export growth. Low- and middle-income countries\u2019 external debt-to-GNI ratio (excluding China) rose to 42 percent in 2020 from 37 percent in 2019 while their debt-to-export ratio increased to 154 percent in 2020 from 126 percent in 2019.\n\nRead also: The numbers behind Nigeria\u2019s unproductive debt binge\n\nIn response to the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic and at the urging of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund, in April 2020, the G20 launched the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) to provide temporary liquidity support for low-income countries. The G-20 countries agreed to extend the deferral period through the end of 2021. In November 2020, the G20 agreed on a Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the DSSI, an initiative to restructure unsustainable debt situations and protracted financing gaps in DSSI-eligible countries.\n\nOverall, in 2020, net inflows from multilateral creditors to low- and middle-income countries rose to $117 billion, the highest level in a decade. Net debt inflows of external public debt to low-income countries rose 25 percent to $71 billion, also the highest level in a decade. Multilateral creditors, including the IMF, provided $42 billion in net inflows while bilateral creditors accounted for an additional $10 billion.\n\n\u201cEconomies across the globe face a daunting challenge posed by high and rapidly rising debt levels,\u201d said Carmen Reinhart, Senior Vice President and Chief Economist of the World Bank Group. \u201cPolicymakers need to prepare for the possibility of debt distress when financial market conditions turn less benign, particularly in emerging markets and developing economies.\u201d\n\nGreater debt transparency is critical in addressing the risks posed by rising debt in many developing countries. To facilitate transparency, International Debt Statistics 2022 was expanded to provide more detailed and disaggregated data on external debt than ever before. The data now gives the breakdown of a borrowing country\u2019s external debt stock to show the amount owed to each official and private creditor, the currency composition of this debt, and the terms on which loans were extended. For DSSI-eligible countries the dataset was expanded to include the debt service deferred in 2020 by each bilateral creditor and the projected month-by-month debt-service payments owed to them through 2021. The World Bank will also soon publish a new Debt Transparency in Developing Economies report that takes stock of debt transparency challenges in low-income countries and lays out a detailed list of recommendations to address them.\n\nInternational Debt Statistics (IDS) is a longstanding annual publication of the World Bank featuring external debt statistics and analysis for the 123 low- and middle-income countries that report to the World Bank Debt Reporting System (DRS).\n\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Bank Group has deployed over $157 billion to fight the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic, the fastest and largest crisis response in its history. The financing is helping more than 100 countries strengthen pandemic preparedness, protect the poor and jobs, and jump-start a climate-friendly recovery. The Bank is also supporting over 50 low- and middle-income countries, more than half of which are in Africa, with the purchase and deployment o",

So, he became worst and the police clinic couldn\u2019t handle it. He is here in AE-FUTHA since this morning.\n\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t diagnose anything at the police clinic but he was in serious crisis.

          "text": "Governments around the world responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with massive fiscal, monetary, and financial stimulus packages. While these measures were aimed at addressing the health emergency, cushioning the impact of the pandemic on the poor and vulnerable and putting countries on a path to recovery, the resulting debt burden of the world\u2019s low-income countries rose 12% to a record $860 billion in 2020, according to a new World Bank report.\n\nEven prior to the pandemic, many low- and middle-income countries were in a vulnerable position, with slowing economic growth and public and external debt at elevated levels. External debt stocks of low- and middle-income countries combined rose 5.3% in 2020 to $8.7 trillion. According to the new International Debt Statistics 2022 report, an encompassing approach to managing debt is needed to help low- and middle-income countries assess and curtail risks and achieve sustainable debt levels.\n\n\u201cWe need a comprehensive approach to the debt problem, including debt reduction, swifter restructuring and improved transparency,\u201d said World Bank Group President David Malpass. \u201cSustainable debt levels are vital for economic recovery and poverty reduction.\u201d\n\nThe deterioration in debt indicators was widespread and impacted countries in all regions. Across all low- and middle-income countries, the rise in external indebtedness outpaced Gross National Income (GNI) and export growth. Low- and middle-income countries\u2019 external debt-to-GNI ratio (excluding China) rose to 42% in 2020 from 37% in 2019 while their debt-to-export ratio increased to 154% in 2020 from 126% in 2019.\n\nIn response to the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic and at the urging of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund, in April 2020, the G20 launched the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) to provide temporary liquidity support for low-income countries. The G-20 countries agreed to extend the deferral period through the end of 2021. In November 2020, the G20 agreed on a Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the DSSI, an initiative to restructure unsustainable debt situations and protracted financing gaps in DSSI-eligible countries.\n\nOverall, in 2020, net inflows from multilateral creditors to low- and middle-income countries rose to $117 billion, the highest level in a decade. Net debt inflows of external public debt to low-income countries rose 25% to $71 billion, also the highest level in a decade. Multilateral creditors, including the IMF, provided $42 billion in net inflows while bilateral creditors accounted for an additional $10 billion.\n\n\u201cEconomies across the globe face a daunting challenge posed by high and rapidly rising debt levels,\u201d said Carmen Reinhart, Senior Vice President and Chief Economist of the World Bank Group. \u201cPolicymakers need to prepare for the possibility of debt distress when financial market conditions turn less benign, particularly in emerging market and developing economies.\u201d\n\nGreater debt transparency is critical in addressing the risks posed by rising debt in many developing countries. To facilitate transparency, International Debt Statistics 2022 was expanded to provide more detailed and disaggregated data on external debt than ever before. The data now gives the breakdown of a borrowing country\u2019s external debt stock to show the amount owed to each official and private creditor, the currency composition of this debt, and the terms on which loans were extended. For DSSI-eligible countries the dataset was expanded to include the debt service deferred in 2020 by each bilateral creditor and the projected month-by-month debt-service payments owed to them through 2021. The World Bank will also publish soon a new Debt Transparency in Developing Economies report that takes stock of debt transparency challenges in low-income countries and lays out a detailed list of recommendations to address them.\n\nInternational Debt Statistics (IDS) is a longstanding annual publication of the World Bank featuring external debt statistics and analysis for the 123 low- and middle-income countries that report to the World Bank Debt Reporting System (DRS).\n\nWorld Bank Group Response to COVID-19\n\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Bank Group has deployed over $157 billion to fight the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic, the fastest and largest crisis response in its history. The financing is helping more than 100 countries strengthen pandemic preparedness, protect the poor and jobs, and jump start a climate-friendly recovery. The Bank is also supporting over 50 low- and middle-income countries, more than half of which are in Africa, with the purchase and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines, and is making available $20 billion in financing for this purpose until the end of 2022.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "A group promoting the leadership virtues of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo (SAN), the Osinbajo Grassroots Organisation (OGO) on Monday, October 11, 2021, commenced the distribution of educational materials to students of public secondary schools in some states across the Federation.\n\nLeader of the group, Mr. Sylvanus Foluso Ojo, said the group carried out the exercise to commemorate the Independence Day celebration with students of Government Secondary School, Guruku, Mararaba and Community Secondary School, Suleja both in Nasarawa and Niger States respectively, who were on holiday during the October 1 celebration.\n\nExplaining the rationale behind the gesture, Ojo said the organisation decided to celebrate the nation\u2019s Independence Day with the young citizens by propagating the exemplary attributes of Prof. Osinbajo, manifesting in his undying love for education and this passion for the young people, especially the downtrodden.\n\nThe OGO leader noted that the outreach was targeted at extending such love to the younger ones, and for them to absorb the leadership qualities which are seeds to prepare them as responsible and patriotic leaders in the future.\n\nOjo also emphasised that younger people of high school age signify transitional leadership age-grade and they are the hope and the future of the nation, stressing that they must be guided early in life to adopt excellent qualities, which he said are derivable through mentoring to guarantee brighter future.\n\n\u201cWe believe that these younger people will one day control the leadership space in this country. It is then important to let them see the beauty of patriotism, loyalty, education, humility, inclusiveness, and tolerance which the Vice President represents for their own good and continued unity and survival of our country.\n\n\u201cIf we miss out on this, then we have lost the opportunity to rightly groom a successor generation that will drive this nation after current sets of leaders may have vacated the scene.

This, in my own respective view, is the only way to improve supply.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get new dollars into the system, where the exchange rate is artificially low. And everyone knows by how much our reserves can grow. I\u2019m convinced that the demand management strategy currently being adopted by the CBN needs a rethink, and that is just my view.\n\n\u201cAnyway, all those are issues that when the CBN governor has time to address, he will be able to address in full.\u201d\n\nThe vice president added that CBN was competing with the fiscal side of the economy, which includes the ministries, departments, and agencies of government.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThere must be synergy between the fiscal and the monetary authority. We must be able to deal with the synergy, we must handle the synergy between the monetary authority, the CBN, and the fiscal side.\n\n\u201cSometimes, it appears that there is competition, especially on the fiscal side. If you look at some of the interventions, you will find that those interventions are interventions that should be managed by ministries.\n\n\u201cThe ministry of industry, trade and investment should handle MSMEs interventions, and we should know what the CBN is doing. In other words, if the CBN is intervening in the MSME sector, it should be with the full cooperation and consent of the ministry of industry.\n\n\u201cSometimes you will get people who are benefiting more than once because we simply have no line of sight on what is going on, on one side.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said Buhari deserve the credit for providing steady leadership through the economic crisis last year.\n\n\u201cLet me say on the whole that we have been able to weather the storm of a very very serious economic challenge.\n\n\u201cI think that is largely on the steady and stable leadership we received from the president. I think if Mr. President had panicked in that period, we would have had a lot of difficulties, perhaps we would be in a much worse situation.\n\n\u201cHe deserves the commendation for providing that steady hand when that was required,\u201d Osinbajo added.",

          "text": "President of the African Development Bank Group (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina said Nigeria has a debt challenge, with debt service gulping 73 percent of government revenue.\n\nHis position is diametrically different from that of President Buhari and Nigeria\u2019s finance minister Zainab Ahmed who interpret the challenge before the nation as revenue generation, amid ballooning national debt.\n\nAdesina spoke today at a midterm retreat for ministers. President Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo were among the audience.\n\nAdesina said Nigeria\u2019s debt service to revenue ratio is high at 73%.\n\nand urged the government to decisively tackle the challenge.\n\n\u201cNigeria must decisively tackle its debt challenges. The issue is not about debt-to-GDP ratio, as Nigeria\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio at 35% is still moderate. The big issue is how to service the debt and what that means for resources for domestic investments needed to spur faster economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe debt service to revenue ratio of Nigeria is high at 73%. Things will improve as oil prices recover, but the situation has revealed the vulnerability of Nigeria\u2019s economy. To have economic resurgence, we need to fix the structure of the economy and address some fundamentals.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s challenge is revenue concentration, as the oil sector accounts for 75.4 % of export revenue and 50 % of all government revenue.\u201d\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, the country\u2019s external obligations stood at $33.468 billion, according to the Debt Management Office (DMO).Domestic debt was $53.2 billion.\n\nIn Naira terms total national debt was N35.5 trillion.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Total Public Debt as at June 30, 2021\n\nAkinwumi further stated that what was needed for sustained growth and economic resurgence is to remove the structural bottlenecks that limit the productivity and the revenue earning potential of the huge non-oil sectors.\n\n\u201cNigeria should significantly boost productivity and revenues from its non-oil sector, with appropriate fiscal and macroeconomic policies, especially flexible exchange rates that will enhance international competitiveness,\u201d he said, according to a report by Leadership newspaper.\n\nThe AfDB President further said Africa should be producing and not begging for vaccines.\n\nAccording to him, the African Development Bank will invest $3 billion in support of local pharmaceutical industries in Africa, including in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNigeria must build quality health care systems that will protect its population, today and well into the future.\n\n\u201cNigeria must also build world-class local pharmaceutical industries, able to effectively tackle the production of therapeutic drugs and vaccines.\n\n\u201cNigeria must revamp its local pharmaceutical industry and launch strategic investments for local vaccine manufacturing.\n\n\u201cAfrica should not be begging for vaccines; Africa should be producing vaccines.\n\nAdesina also further stated the government should not be decongesting the ports in Nigeria, rather \u201cwe should be transforming the ports.\n\n\u201cThis must start with cleaning up administrative bottlenecks, most of which are unnecessary with multiple government agencies at the ports, high transaction costs or even plain extortions from illegal taxes, which do not go into the coffers of the government.\n\n\u201cNigeria should rapidly modernise and transform its ports. Ports are not there for revenue generation.\n\n\u201cThey are for facilitating business and exports, and stimulating industrial manufacturing, and competitiveness of local businesses and exports,\u201d Adesina said.\n\nHe also said it is not the lack of rain that is leading to low food production.\n\n\u201cA little, maybe. That it is insecurity. Yes, maybe, to some extent. That it is middlemen. A little, maybe.\n\n\u201cBut, Mr. President, the main reason is that farmers no longer have access to quality improved seeds, fertilizers, and farm inputs at scale.\n\nFarmers across the country are asking for the Federal Government to restore in their words \u201cthe popular Growth Enhancement Support Scheme and the e-Wallet system.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to urge, Your Excellency Mr. President, please relaunch the \u2018Growth Enhancement Scheme\u2019 and the e-wallet system and put millions of farmers at the heart of agriculture \u2014 at scale. If this is done, and run well, I can assure you that you will see a dramatic turnaround in national food production,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Kenneth \u2018Klef\u2019 Ofigho better known by his stage name \u201cBig Klef\u201d is a California based Nigerian artiste. He is also a singer, songwriter, digital audio engineer and the originator of AfroTrap Music. He burst onto the Nigerian music scene in 2013 with his hit single \u201cIDIAGBON\u201d. Since then he has been opportune to work with a couple of upcoming and established artistes both within and outside Nigeria and the Bay Area of California. Our reporter recently had a chat with him about his music and plans for 2021.\n\nWho is Big Klef and how did the name come about?\n\nMy name is Kenneth Ofigho but most people know me by my stage name \u2018BIG KLEF\u2019 or simply Klef.\n\nGot the name in primary school in Nigeria. At first I didn\u2019t like or answer it. But my class mates in JSS2 in Warri continued the name and it stuck, since then everybody has been calling me Klef.\n\nBig Klef seems to be in his own lane. You are hardly involved in the usual drama like other artists, is this a strategy or are you always chilled and laid back?\n\nI am never worried about what the person in the other lane is doing. I also believe that talk is cheap like they say, so I prefer to let my work speak for itself.\n\nYou have come a long way in the industry with your music. You are rated as one of the artistes to look out for. How do you handle the pressure?\n\nI was born ready. Nothing feels like pressure to me. I just Like to enjoy the process and always believed what\u2019s meant to be will happen with time. And it\u2019s a beautiful process.\n\nYou have a lot of engineering credits for several artistes, why have you been keeping a low profile about being an engineer?\n\nI\u2019ve engineered and co-written a lot of music for both hiphop legends and rising stars. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of artistes either on the engineering and/or the music collaboration side. Artistes like, Dru down, Too Short, Snoop Dogg, Mistah Fab, Ajala, Guapdad4000 (in the early stages of his career), Trap Beckham, Young Fyah, Bills & Erigga the list goes on.\n\nYou are known as the originator of Afro trap, how did that come about? What\u2019s motivated you to step away from afrobeat to create afro trap?\n\nAfrotrap started from the first project in 2011 when I came up with the sound / concept. Which is Making African hiphop music that talks about the African hustle, my personal stories growing up in the Niger Delta of Nigeria & the struggle of the masses. I eventually released the first AfroTrap Project in 2013 on old school Datpiff.com. The rest has been history and a lot of growth after that.\n\nLooking at how far you have come and the success recorded, what comes to your mind now when you look at the rate the industry keeps producing artists?\n\nThe industry is fast growing and as everything is evolving, I\u2019m always learning to adapt with everything going on as well.\n\nIDIAGBON is like your signature track and since then you have released several other singles, EPs and albums, yet Idiagbon seems to be the song most people still know you with. How did the song come about?\n\nThe song was inspired by Late Brigadier General Tunde Idiagbon and also a slang that means anything that\u2019s fly, clean and dope. Whatever you want it to mean as long as it\u2019s LEGIT!\n\nYou have worked with a couple of Nigerian artistes? Who was your favorite to work with and why?\n\nOne of my favorite Nigerian artiste I worked with was Erigga. We are both from the same region and his style of music embodies the meaning of the Phrase \u201cKeeping is 1000\u201d, his music is real & motivational at the same time.\n\nWhat is your greatest motivation as an artiste and producer?\n\nMy greatest motivation is my Mom and late Dad, and the legacy they\u2019ve built coming from where we from. It\u2019s super hard to make it out. They started from ground zero and made a good life for themselves with scarce resources and till took care of us kids. That\u2019s all the motivation I need.\n\n2020 was a tough year for many in the music industry because of the COVID-19 necessitated lockdown. How did you handle the lockdown?\n\nBeing a creative is a blessing and it helped a lot during the lock down, because it gave me time to reflect, create more music and also spend more time with loved ones.\n\nWhat advice do you have for producers and artistes out there?\n\nYou have to learn to adapt and grow in your own lane and sometimes you have to show versatility as much as you would like to remain in your zone.\n\nIf you are asked to choose which do you prefer, being an engineer or just an artiste/songwriter?\n\nI wanna do it all. Whenever I can. I don\u2019t like to stay in one pocket. I love being both and I can\u2019t choose just one or the other.\n\nWhat should your fans expect from you this 2021, do you have anything in stock for them?\n\nYeah I have a lot of good music coming out soon and most like an album after a few bangers. And also dropping AfroTrap 2 album which has a lot of BIG TUNES in it.",

Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo are members of same party. Osinbajo regards Tinubu as a respected leader of a political family to which he belongs and will therefore not for any reason endorse an endeavour that seeks to pitch them against each other.\n\n\u201cWe are not unaware of some people who may want to foist a crack among our leaders. Such an attempt is abortive. Osinbajo and Tinubu\u2019s relationship dates way back and it shall continue to wax strong.\n\n\u201cLet me, therefore, call on individuals and media houses engaged in this act to desist from doing so. The APC remains one single, indivisible party and Osinbajo remains a loyal member of the party who respects both the party structure as well as its leadership.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the INEC has not given a go-ahead yet for politicking towards 2023. As a law-abiding citizen, Osinbajo will not commence any act in this regard until INEC blows the whistle, and in any case the VP has not indicated interest in the 2023 elections\n\n\u201cWhile appreciating individuals who are clamouring for him to contest, we however want to plead that they should not draw him or allow themselves into an unnecessary and precipitous controversy.\u201d\n\nOjudu also welcomed Tinubu back to Nigeria after a three-month medical trip to the United Kingdom, while wishing him \u201cgood health, long life and prosperity\u201d.",

          "text": "A member Board of Trustees (BoT) Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Dr Raymond Dokpesi has said for equity, fairness and justice, the party must zone its presidential ticket for the 2023 general elections to the North.\n\nHe also believed the \u2018violation\u2019 of the federal character principle by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led federal government is responsible for the present state of the nation.\n\nTherefore, Dokpesi believed \u201cthe person\u201d that would right the alleged wrongs is from the North.\n\nAt its recent National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting in Abuja, the PDP adopted the report of the Governor Ifeanyi Ugwunayi-led zoning committee which amidst some protests, recommended the zoning of the party\u2019s national chairmanship seat to the North.\n\nAlthough the report was silent on the presidential ticket, stakeholders believed it simply implied the party\u2019s presidential ticket is coming from the south.\n\nAnd at the NEC meeting, former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar and the PDP presidential candidate in the 2019 general elections, had told stakeholders that while the party has the right to determine its rules, Nigerians also have the right to elect whom their leader is.\n\nThe former VP\u2019s statement, some analysts believe, is a subtle protest by northern stakeholders within the party who feel short-changed by the decision.\n\nNotwithstanding the protest, the party at the end of the NEC meeting, said it stood by the Ugwuanyi committee report.\n\nDokpesi faults party\n\nBut faulting the party\u2019s position, Dr. Dokpesi argued that with the south having 14 of the 16-year PDP rule, it would be unjust for the south to still take another short at the party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nDokpesi, founder Ray Power and Daar Communications, stated this weekend at a media parley with some select journalists in Abuja as part of activities marking his 70th birthday anniversary coming up October 25.\n\nGoing memory lane, he said: \u201cIn 1998, when the People\u2019s Democratic Party was being established, after the G-34 had confronted the military, elder statesmen who believed in one Nigeria and who went through the trauma of military rule. The constitution of the PDP states very clearly that there shall be rotation and zoning of offices, both for the party and political office. And I have remained very consistent in my argument since 1998.\n\n\u201cAt the G-34 meeting, Alhaji Lawan Keita had moved that Alex Ekwueme should become the president. But Ekwueme said it is a group, not a political party, that when it transforms into a political party, you can canvass whether I can be president or not.\n\n\u201cWhen the party came into being, it was agreed by all, including all the northerners that because of the injustice done to the South West, they should be allowed to produce the president because agreement has been reached on zoning and rotation.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget that in 1995 draft constitution, it was envisaged that the 6 geo-political zones will have a turn of 5 years so that in 30 years, we will end the issue of zoning and would have been one united country. From there, we can start exploiting four-year rotation.\n\nContinuing, the PDP BoT member said: \u201cWhen Obasanjo came in, there was an expanded party caucus where it was canvassed that the PDP programmes could not be fully implemented within 3 years. Again, all the founding fathers, including Ekwueme, Ogbemudia and other big wigs of the party were present at the meeting. And again, it was the northern delegates who said they had no objection, they will exercise patience. We will allow Obasanjo to have another 4 years, but there should be a proviso that if you do 8 years, we will do 8 years. Let it be understood, that is the foundation and everybody said \u201cyeah\u201d.\n\n\u201cBy that agreement, power was supposed to have rotated back to the north. But I was a member of the S/South Assembly; I led the delegation to say the S/South has not had any opportunity, that the S/South should be given. I travelled round, I did not fight, I did not shout, I did not quarrel, I did not carry gun, all I did was to engage the Nigerian public. By the time we got to the Convention, Obasanjo said \u2018look Peter Odili, you have done very well, if we go into the conventions, you are going to win but we have an understanding with the north, please let the north be the president.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat is how Yar\u2019Adua came in. Yar\u2019Adua, unfortunately did not live long to see the 8 years. He did only two years, in fact, two and half years. I agitated at that time to continue with the principle already established, let us have the north complete the remaining term of four years, so that we can be done with the northern presidency, so that we can come back to the South.\n\n\u201cSome people in the S/South said no, it\u2019s not possible. You cannot be so close to power and relinquish it. Crisis set in, so Jonathan (Goodluck, former president) did another 4 years. We came to 2015, the PDP had done 16 years in power, if you like, 14 years of the South, two years of the north. That is the situation up till today.\u201d\n\nFurther arguments\n\n\u201cNow you say, you believe in justice, fairness and equity. The north has done 2 years, the South has done 14 years, is that balance? The APC came into being in 2014, they don\u2019t have a history. Now, in 2015, when we fielded in PDP, Jonathan, the north had started clamouring, agitating, saying it is their turn. You have spent 14 years, so allow us to complete our 4 years and we said no, we were very smart, and that is what plunged the country into this crisis. That is why we are in problem.\n\n\u201cSo, I am PDP, I am guided by the constitution of the PDP, which in its preamble said, for unity, for stability, for the growth of the country, we must rotate such that every part of the country will not be neglected. The APC, on its own, came in and also said, we are adopting zoning and rotation. And in their own situation, they chose to pick a northern candidate knowing full well that the agitation of the north. They fielded a northern candidate against us. I believe everyone here knows my position and what my comments were at that time.\n\n\u201cIf in my own party I want to win an election, I cannot win an election when there is injustice, when there is unfairness. We are not guided by certain rules. In the PDP, all I am agitating for is that let us be fair and just. Let us put ourselves in the shoes of ourselves. Let us as one family, as the party started l, still remain one and in doing so, let us choose a candidate from the north. Some people have come to meet me to say, how can we allow them to do another 8 years again? I say, sorry, in 2019, we fielded a northern candidate recommended by Ike Ekweremadu report. But again, the PDP was outmanoeuvred.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t agree that Atiku lost that election but INEC has said so, and as a citizen of Nigeria I must live by the rules. But I cannot as a PDP person go and adopt APC conditions and situations. So, for me very clearly, I want an undiluted, a properly organized party.\n\n\u201cIt is the APC policy of lack of adherence to the federal character principles that has brought us to this level of suspicion in the country. And the person that can bring back that principle of fairness, justice is from the north. We Southerners had the opportunity to be in power and we threw it away, so we can now monopolise everything and that is what gave birth to APC. If we were fair, we were just, we were rational, we won\u2019t have been in this problem.\u201d",

          "text": "The need to open more access to digital literacy for girls so that they can compete favorably with their male counterparts has been emphasized.\n\nEmpower Her 4 Africa, a gender-based not-for-profit organization, brought this to the fore Monday on the occasion of the 2021 International Day of the Girl Child.\n\nSpeaking with journalists at the event, founder and Executive Director of Empower Her 4 Africa, Mrs. Charlene Makai Yusuf, asserted that there\u2019s no limit to the possibility of what girls can do with technology if given equal access like their male counterparts.\n\nMrs. Yusuf said, \u201cIt is important to bridge the digital gender gap so that our girls can live their full potentials and be part of the unfolding new world order of digital compliance.\n\nAlso speaking, Consultant on girl child rights to Empower Her 4 Africa, Mrs. Abosede Oladayo, decried the poor rate of enrollment of girls in tech-related courses such as Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths, STEM.\n\nAs part of activities lined up to commemorate the day, the NGO staged a road walk procession in the city of Abuja to sensitize Nigerians and create awareness on the need to bridge the gender digital divide between boys and girls as well as the importance of digital literacy and skills in tech-related courses for the girl child.\n\nThe group also organized a digital Training session for girls at Govt Junior secondary school Damagasa in Lokogoma Abuja.\n\nEmpower Her 4 Africa in its usual practice, equally enrolled and paid school fees for ten adopted indigent girls at the school.\n\nRecall that October 11 of every year is designated as the International Day of the Girl Child by the United Nations, UN, to bring to fore issues and challenges faced by the girl child, that hinders her well-being and a better quality of life and how to proffer solutions to them.\n\nThis year\u2019s theme: \u201cDigital Generation. Our Generation.\u201d emphasizes the imperativeness of digital literacy and inclusivity for the Girl Child.\n\nAccording to experts, the Covid-19 pandemic has migrated the world from physical engagement to a virtual platform.\n\nThe pandemic has also transformed the world into a digital village as school learnings, business earnings, and social connecting are now being done via digital platforms.\n\nThis has also transformed the future of work as existing jobs are being modified, and new ones are emerging at the frontiers of our economies, which require knowledge and skills in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM).\n\nBut over 2.2 billion people below the age of 25 (mostly girls) still do not have access to the internet at home, meaning girls are most likely to be cut off.\n\nAlso, the gender gap for global internet users grew from 11 percent in 2013 to 17 percent in 2019 while in the world\u2019s least developed countries, it hovers around 43 percent.\n\nThe implication of this is that girls are also less likely than boys to use and own devices, and gain access to tech-related skills and jobs.\n\nExperts believe addressing the inequity and exclusion that spans geographies and generations is vital as we seek to usher in a digital revolution for all, and with all.\n\nEmpower Her 4 Africa, therefore, called on government and relevant authorities to increase access to digital education and devices for girls, while also demanding that all schools be equipped with functional state-of-the-art digital laboratories to boost access to digital literacy for girls.",

This is to ensure, among others, protection, assistance and strategic provision of sustainable and durable solutions for persons of concern.\n\nThe Project Zero Hunger Initiative will fight food insecurity and stem the threat of famine in our land. The Project will additionally assuage the growing burden of hunger amongst persons of concern. This critical and practical initiative will also tackle the challenges of inconsistent and inadequate food supply to persons of concern. It will address their fundamental needs in terms of sustainable and timely provision of food and non-food items, whilst eliminating waste observed in previous distribution processes to persons of concern.\n\n\u201cI also commend the Honourable Federal Commissioner and her team for their efforts in developing this Project. I see that much has been done through partnerships with critical stakeholders for appropriate support to mobilize and deploy resources to provide a pedestal of success for the Project Zero Hunger Initiative.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of our persons of concern, I hereby launch Project Zero Hunger and pray that it positively impacts on the lives of the intended beneficiaries.\u201d",

          "text": "A military court in Ouagadougou on Monday began the long-awaited trial of 14 men, including the former president, accused in the assassination of Burkina Faso\u2019s left-wing leader Thomas Sankara 34 years ago.\n\nThe slaying of Sankara, a pan-Africanist icon, has for years cast a shadow over the poor Sahel state, fuelling its reputation for turbulence and bloodshed.\n\nSankara and 12 others were riddled with bullets by a hit squad on October 15, 1987 during a putsch that brought his friend and comrade-in-arms Blaise Compaore to power.\n\nCompaore, the chief accused, announced through his lawyers last week that he would boycott the trial.\n\nHe ruled the country for 27 years before being deposed by a popular uprising in 2014 and fleeing to neighbouring Ivory Coast, which granted him citizenship.\n\nHe and his former right-hand man, General Gilbert Diendere, who once headed the elite Presidential Security Regiment, face charges of complicity in murder, harming state security and complicity in the concealment of corpses.\n\nDiendere, 61, is already serving a 20-year sentence for masterminding a plot in 2015 against the transitional government that followed Compaore\u2019s ouster.\n\nHe appeared in court dressed in military uniform and looked relaxed.\n\nAnother prominent figure among the accused is Hyacinthe Kafando, a former chief warrant officer in Compaore\u2019s presidential guard, who is accused of leading the gunmen. He is on the run.\n\nCompaore has always rejected suspicions that he orchestrated the killing.\n\nHis lawyers last week announced he would not be attending a \u201cpolitical trial\u201d that they said was flawed by irregularities, and insisted he enjoyed immunity as a former head of state.\n\nAfter several hours, proceedings were adjourned until October 25 after defence lawyers said they were confronted with 20,000 documents and had had little time to prepare their case. They requested a one-month postponement but were granted a stay of two weeks by judge Urbain Meda.\n\nLeft-Wing Hero\n\nA young army captain and Marxist-Leninist, Sankara came to power in a coup in 1983 aged just 33.\n\nHe tossed out the country\u2019s name of Upper Volta, a legacy of the French colonial era, and renamed it Burkina Faso, which means \u201cthe land of honest men\u201d.\n\nHe pushed ahead with a socialist agenda of nationalisations and banned female genital mutilation, polygamy and forced marriages.\n\nLike Ghana\u2019s former leader Jerry Rawlings, he became an idol in left-wing circles in Africa, lauded for his radical policies and defiance of the big powers.\n\nBurkina Faso has long been burdened by silence over the assassination and many are angry that the killers have gone unpunished.\n\nDuring Compaore\u2019s long rule, the question of Sankara\u2019s bloody death was taboo.\n\nAfter his ouster, the interim government in 2015 launched an investigation into the episode, and the following year issued an international arrest warrant for him.\n\n\u2018Day of Truth\u2019\n\nSankara\u2019s widow Mariam, who lives in southern France, came to Ouagadougou for the opening of the trial.\n\n\u201cThis is a day of truth for me, my family and all Burkinabe,\u201d she said, referring to the name of Burkina citizens.\n\nThe family\u2019s lawyer, Stanislas Benewende Sankara \u2014 who shares the same name but is not a relative \u2014 said Compaore\u2019s absence was a \u201cslap in the face\u201d to Burkina Faso\u2019s justice system.\n\nThe trial \u201cmay not be the end of the tunnel, but we are reaching a very important phase, judicially speaking,\u201d he said.\n\nAn association called Justice For Thomas Sankara, Justice for Africa said it feared the trial would not shed light on suspected international involvement in the turbulence of the 1980s.\n\nSankara\u2019s fiery rhetoric against capitalism and corruption won him many young admirers in Africa at the time, but it also angered leaders in the United States, France, Ivory Coast and Togo.\n\nOne of the world\u2019s most impoverished countries, Burkina Faso has also been battling a jihadist insurgency since 2015 that has claimed more than 1,400 lives and forced 1.3 million people from their homes.\n\nAFP",
