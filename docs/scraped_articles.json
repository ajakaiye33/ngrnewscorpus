          "text": "The Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions of the Senate has suspended the investigation of the alleged assault on a security man, Clement Sargwak, by Chairman of the Code of Conduct Tribunal, Danladi Umar.\n\nThe committee had sat for the continued hearing on the matter in Abuja on Tuesday, when the Chairman, Senator Ayo Akinyelure, ruled that the exercise be suspended indefinitely based on the legal action taken by Umar.\n\nThe Senate, President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; the committee and the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), were joined in the suit.\n\nLawyer to the petitioner, Timzing Venyir Ramnap, however, protested against the decision by the committee.\n\nRamnap dismissed the originating summons from Federal High Court Abuja, which was forwarded to the committee by counsel fo the accused, as mere court processes.\n\nThe lawyer said, \u201cThe document before this committee, as read out by the chairman, is not an order from any court but a mere court process served on the Senate. Were it to be a valid order from a court of competent jurisdiction, the Senate may back out. But since it is not, the Senate through this committee still has its constitutional powers on the case and can forge ahead with the investigation.\u201d\n\nAkinyelure, however, stated that efforts were being made by somebody to circumvent the probe, which would be challenged in the court.\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is a clear case of circumventing the constitutional powers of the Senate after submitting himself to us for investigation and begged for time to study the allegations made against him. He appeared at the first sitting, sought a week to study allegations of assault levelled against him. We gave him three weeks for that. Thereafter, at the second and third sessions, he sent representatives, that he could not come due to ill health; only for him to inform us through his lawyers at the fourth sitting two weeks ago that he was already in court.\u201d\n\nRecall that in the suit, Umar challenge Senate\u2019s powers to conduct investigation and the purpose for which it is exercisable.\n\nThe CCT chairman, among others, asked the court to interpret the constitutional power granted the Senate or House Committees on Ethics and Public Petitions, and to determine whether it covered public assaults, which his lawyers argued, were part of the functions of the police and the courts.\n\nThe petition was brought to the floor by the Senator representing Plateau North, Istifanus Gyang.\n\nGyang had said, the petitioner, who was also the victim of the attack, Clement Kargwak, wanted the Senate to get justice for him.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Calls for urgent intervention\n\nBy Arogbonlo Israel\n\nFollowing the outcome of the just concluded Council elections in Lagos, a chieftain of the All Progressive Congress, APC, Prince Idris Balogun, has called for urgent intervention over the crisis in Alimosho Federal Constituency of the State.\n\nHe gave the advice in a letter written to APC Lagos Secretariat and the party National Leader Bola Tinubu respectively.\n\nIn the letter dated July 27, 2021, Hon Balogun said the happenings in the political arena in Alimosho call for serious concerns and attention.\n\nCommenting on the crisis in the party, Balogun narrated how some group of people in the guise of working for the Federal Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola took over the affairs of the party, due to their closeness with the minister, who according to him had the ears of Asiwaju (Tinubu).\n\nHe however claimed the centres have since then failed to hold after the emergence of the group tagged Alimosho G-18 (in charge of nominations of the Chairmen, Councillors, Assembly members both at the State and Federal).\n\n\u201cAfter the general elections in 2019 in which Alimosho displayed a total failure of votes cast, contrary to what we were known for, the National Leader of our great party publicly tagged Alimosho APC, a failure \u2013 the video is everywhere. This caused an immense embarrassment to us and many other party members felt it was time to redeem our political image, restore hope to the party members, give them the sense of belonging, compel our elected officials to use the money statutorily meant for the development of our community directly to them, and stop diverting public funds meant for development to service the so-called G-18 leaders,\u201d he alleged.\n\nHe further stated that his faction met with some stakeholders of the party in the state to address some of their grievances in the interest of the party.\n\n\u201cAs part of our resolutions, the party agreed that there should be decentralisation of party leadership, freedom to contest elections, and independence of elected officials.\n\n\u201cOur efforts eventually paid off as the party leaders in their magnanimity agreed that the just concluded local government elections should be the launchpad for the settlement and resolve of our agitations. It was agreed that, we the Liberation/Veterans should accept 2 Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) and 1 Local government. While the other faction should take the remaining structures,\u201d he opined.\n\nHe added; \u201cWe later heard that our National Leader (Tinubu) had instructed that all first-term Chairmen across the State should go back for their second terms. This effectively put aside the earlier agreement, hence we had to go back to the drawing board for another agreement, because 1 LGA and 3 LCDAs are beneficiaries of the new order.\n\n\u201cIt was later agreed that Igando-Ikotun LCDA where the Chairman is completing her two term tenure should be given to us while we have 14 Councillors, and 3 vice-chairmen, while we wait to get SLGs and Supervisory Councillors.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut to our surprise again, we were shortchanged, as the number of Councillors given to us was reduced to 10. Our hopes of having the vice-chairman in Mosan-Okunola and Egbe-Idimu LCDAs were dashed again. We complained to the State-Organized Reconciliation Committee and they promised to look into this abnormality and make the necessary corrections. During the meetings with the reconciliation committee, Alhaji Abdullah Enilolobo, the leader of the G-18 group professed that Igando-Ikotun LCDA had been given to us through HE Adejoke Orelope Adefilure.\n\n\u201cThe next wonder of the world was that our candidate for that office in Igando-Ikotun LCDA, Hon. Oseni Ahmed olajide, who had his name pasted by LASIEC, went for screening and did all that was necessary got replaced shortly after the Local Government elections.\n\n\u201cIt all started as a rumour to us, but it became a reality that, Hon. Ahmed Olajide Oseni\u2019s name which was cleared for the 24th July election, after winning the election. What we later heard was that, his name has been substituted the night before the election. We did not find this laughable but highly provocative and insulting. Who authorized the changes? What does the law say about the changes of names and substitutions? Why are we in the dark about the changes? What were the parameters that warranted his substitution after the election?\n\n\u201cWith Utmost respect to the party (APC) National hierarchy in our dear country Nigeria, we write to express our displeasure on the political oppression, sidelining and imposition of undeserving candidate in person of Hon. Mutiu Adebiyi, the current vice Chairman of Egbe-Idimu LCDA against the party\u2019s agreed candidate for vice-chairman, Hon. Lukman Idowu Ishola under the leadership of our amiable leader, Mrs Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire, the Senior Special Adviser to the President on Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).\n\n\u201cHon Idowu who had paid his dues politically and socially to be the second citizen of the council in the next administration and the youth have confirmed that Idimu and Isheri constituents have not been represented in the present administration because both the incumbent Chairman, Hon. Kunle Sanyaolu Olowoopejo and his vice, Hon Mutiu Adebiyi are from Egbe, which is just a fraction of the entire LCDA.\u201d\n\nHe therefore appealed to the leadership of the party to intervene as looking away could be detrimental to the growth and popularity of APC at large.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Tuesday swore-in the 57 newly elected Local Government and Local Government Development Council chairmen and vice chairmen in the state.\n\nSpeaking during the swearing-in ceremony at Lagos House, Ikeja, Sanwo-Olu urged the new council executives to always put the residents first in all that they do because they were elected to serve the people.\n\nSanwo-Olu said that the new council bosses had a responsibility to ensure that they do not let the people down in any way or form.\n\nAccording to him, the only way they can reciprocate this trust is to give their best and ensure that the welfare and wellbeing of the people take precedence in all their decisions.\n\n\u201dRight from your first day in office, I implore you to start thinking about the kind of legacy you would like to leave behind when your tenure ends.\n\n\u201dAs we all know, public office is a position of trust that no one holds forever \u2013 we hold it for a time and then we pass on the baton to others.\n\n\u201dLet me use this opportunity to emphasise the need for continuity and progress in governance. I urge you all to ensure that you build on the good legacies laid by your predecessors.\n\n\u201dAlso, ensure that you surpass the legacies and the expectations of the people who have very enthusiastically elected you,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor said that this was not the time to alienate some people because of political difference, but time to give and make all citizens feel good governance.\n\nHe said that the local government chairmen were assuming their roles at a very challenging time in national life, due to the disruptive coronavirus pandemic, which had disastrous consequences for jobs, livelihoods and economies.\n\nAccording to him, residents will continue to clamour for and expect good governance; policy-making and implementation that will enable them to navigate these difficult times and emerge from it.\n\n\u201dIt is our responsibility and our burden as leaders they have elected to live up to their expectations. I therefore say to you that they are expecting much from you.\n\n\u201dMore than ever before, achieving this requires cooperation among all levels and arms of government.\n\n\u201dIt is expected that you will work in unity with other tiers of government to bring to bear the dividend of democracy to the people in all the relevant areas.\n\n\u201dThese are in areas of construction and maintenance of inner roads, waste management, primary education, healthcare, security and welfare programmes that touch the lives of people.\n\n\u201dLet me assure you of our commitment at the state government level. We will continue to provide you with the much-needed support to discharge your responsibilities,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his welcome address, Dr Wale Ahmed, the Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs, said that the chairmen\u2019s victory at the polls was a testimony to the solidity, strength, internal democracy and unity of APC.\n\nAhmed said that now that they had clinched the coveted seats, work should begin in earnest.\n\n\u201dYour re-election/election is another call to a season of service, dedication and selflessness to our people.\n\n\u201dTherefore, the task ahead of you is to sustain or even surpass the tempo of performance of previous administrations in your respective council areas,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chairman, Igbogbo-Bayeiku LCDA, Mr Sesan Daini, who spoke on behalf of the newly sworn-in 114 chairmen and vice chairmen, pledged that they would key into the T.H.E.M.E.S agenda of the Lagos State Government.\n\n\u201dOn behalf of the whole newly sworn-in chairmen, we will not disappoint you and I promise again that we will key into the T.H.E.M.E.S agenda of Mr Governor.\n\n\u201dI want to assure the governor that we are going to give you total support and cooperation. We will give guidance to our councillors that are going to work with us.\n\n\u201dWe are going to be a team that you will never regret supporting. I promise total support and loyalty,\u201d Daini said. (NAN).\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

He clarified that Nigeria government never charged him to a court or jailed him for any offence. He was never invited to any Police Station.\n\n\u201cIgboho said he never had any criminal record in Nigeria. He told the judge that the Nigerian government was after him, because he was defending the Yoruba race against killer Fulani herdsmen.\n\n\u201cHe said that he ran away from Nigeria because the government was after his life.\n\n\u201cHe was asked when he got to Benin Republic, how he got in and how long it took him. Igboho replied that he left Nigeria on Sunday, got into Benin on Monday and attempted to leave to Germany on Monday night before he was arrested.\n\n\u201cThe judge asked him where he stayed, who drove him and how he escaped security checks. He replied.\n\n\u201cWhat is surprising, is that the judge said he was not arrested because he committed an offence. He said he breached Benin rules and he should be investigated.\u201d\n\nIgboho appeared in court last Thursday and Monday.\n\nThe activist was arrested alongside his wife, Ropo, on Monday, July 19, 2021, at the Cadj\u00e8houn Airport in Cotonou, Republic of Benin on their way to Germany.\n\nSunday Igboho\u2019s lawyer prefers agitator dies in Cotonou prison than be extradited to Nigeria",

          "text": "The Muslim Rights Concern, MURIC, has asked the leading Yoruba social-political organisation, Afenifere, to tender an unreserved apology for comparing popular activist, Sunday Igboho, to Prophet Muhammad (SAW).\n\nAfenifere had recently compared the activist\u2019s current travail in Benin Republic to that of Prophet Muhammad in Madinah.\n\nBut MURIC, in a statement signed by Professor Ishaq Akintola, attacked Afenifere, saying that the statement by the socio-cultural group not only sacriledgious but outrageous and audacious.\n\n\u201cYoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, has compared Sunday Adeyemo, a.k.a. Igboho, to Prophet Muhammad. This is totally unacceptable.\n\n\u201cIt is not only sacriledgious but outrageous and audacious. Afenifere has manifested categorical desertification of discernibility coupled with an alarming height of tramadolised hero-worshipping. It is provocative, preposterous, repugnant and nauseating,\u201d the organisation said.\n\n\u201cThe circumstances surrounding the migration of Prophet Muhammad in 622 C.E. to Madinah differ a lot from those that sent Igboho to Benin Republic in July 2021.\u201d\n\nMuhammad was invited to Madinah by the Madinese whereas Igboho was not invited by the people of Cotonou. Muhammad was a prophet of God, Igboho is not. Muhammad\u2019s constituency is the whole world while Igboho\u2019s activities are restricted to South Western Nigeria.\n\nMURIC said it was therefore an exercise in excessive exaggeration for Afenifere to have compared Igboho to a universal prophet whose followers in their billions spread across all the continents and countries of the world.\n\nAccording to the Muslims rights group Afenifere\u2019s action is geared towards diminishing the immense popularity of Prophet Muhammad and whittle down the influence of Islam on the world as a whole and trivialise the essence of the Abrahamic faiths.\n\n\u201cAfenifere did not stop at comparing Igboho to Muhammad. It also compared him to Moses (Prophet Musa, peace be upon him). Moses was a prophet of God for crying out loud. But is Igboho a prophet?\n\n\u201cWhat does Afenifere want to turn Igboho to? Another prophet? Afenifere\u2019s goal is to exert influence on Igboho and to gain total control of him. Afenifere should leave Igboho alone. It should stop playing politics with the young man\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nSunday Igboho was recently arrested in Benin Republic alongeith his wife, Ropo as they attempted to escape from Nigeria to Germany.\n\nIgboho\u2019s attempt to escape to Germany followed deadly attack at his Soka, Ibadan residence by men of the Department of State Services, DSS, who also gunned down some of his side and arrested many others.\n\nHe is currently being prosecuted by the Government of Benin Republic for obtaining fake passport with which he tried to travel to Germany.\n\nDon\u2019t compare Buhari to Jesus Christ \u2013 Primate Ayodele attacks Islamic group",

          "text": "The Igbos in Spain, under the aegis of the Igbo General Assembly (IGA) has condemned what it termed as unlawful strategy to delay the trial of the leader of the Indigeneous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe Assembly lamented that failure of the Department of State Services (DSS) to produce Kanu in court on Monday, sends a wrong signal to the kind of justice he is likely to get in the course of the trail.\n\nIt said that Kanu\u2019s alleged abduction by the Kenyan government and the subsequent handing over to the Nigerian government was a violation of international law and the basic principles of the rule of law.\n\nThe group stressed that Igbos have been wrongly and unfairly treated which the likes of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu led IPOB have consistently frowned, expressing deep disappointment over the marginalization of Igbo nation under the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration.\n\nThe Igbo General Assembly (IGA), in an open letter demanded fair trail for the successionist leader in the treasonable felony charges preferred against him by the Nigerian government.\n\nThe sociopolitical group also urged the Federal Government of Nigeria not to see this as an opportunity to clamp down on agitators anywhere, but as a political issue that should be addressed amicably for the interest of the nation\n\nThe open letter was jointly signed by the IGA President, Chief Kingsley Ndibe, Vice President, Mazi Iroegbu and Ifeanyi Okongwu, Political Strategist, and sent to DAILY POST on Tuesday.\n\nThe Assembly also expressed its disappointment over the inability of South-East Governors to end the perilous security situation in the zone.\n\nAccording to the IGA, it is shocking and alarming that Igbos in their various communities are no longer safe, as large numbers of Igbos are being murdered and abducted in their ancestral land, describing the situation as catastrophic.\n\nThe group lamented the recent massacre of innocent Igbo villagers by suspected Fulani herdsmen at the Obie Aku farm settlement in Uzo-Uwani Local Government of Enugu State on Sunday night, killing many in the process.\n\nIt further lamented that South-East governors have failed to protect Igbos, adding that under this cataclysm, Igbo welfare and well-being are threatened.\n\nThe group further added that the crux of the existing Nigerian structure is the influx of killer herdsmen and bandits to Igboland, stressing that it engenders the culmination of widespread massacres of the Igbo people.\n\nIt also frowned at what it termed unserious setting up of Ebubeagu, describing the security outfit as a sell-out of Igbo security interests with subordinate attachment to the federal structure, of which it posited, Igbos have no confidence in its composition as their security outfit.\n\n\u201cFolks are constrained to engage in their legitimate occupations as violence and death wreak havoc on our people. This is no acceptable choice for our people. Igbo interests have been jeopardized, while with docility, South-East governors condone the emasculation of our people. Killer herdsmen inflict mayhem on Igbo men, women and children, to the extent that they invade our communities unimpeded.\n\n\u201cNo Igbo state has been spared from the atrocities of these bandits, and our people are slaughtered and butchered in their homes and farms; our women and child-girls raped and abducted; our properties looted or destroyed; our homes and communities incinerated; our forests and sacred places occupied or desecrated, etc.\u201d\n\nThe IGA expressed worry that Igbos are prohibited from carrying firearms, while armed killer herdsmen roam about the country, unrestrained, alleging that the prohibition was a part of the central government\u2019s anti-Igbo agenda.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad that the present-day government\u2019s ultimate objective is to subjugate our people and repeat the pogrom on the Igbo nation. This policy will reduce Igbos to the status of subjects with no rights under Fulani suzerainty.\n\n\u201cDisturbing is the recent mandate by the Inspector-general of Police, to cops in the South-East to \u2018shoot at sight. This is a cruel authorization by the police boss.\u201d\n\nThe Igbo General Assembly said that Igboland is cordoned off in a low-level war and accused south-east governors of being obedient to the Federal government\u2019s brutal repression in Igboland.\n\nAccording to the group, \u201cAs a potentate, the police chief dictates Igbo security. It sounds like a prescription for Fulani hegemony for Igbos to rely on the South-East governors\u2019 security outfit, Ebubeagu.\n\nThe Igbo body submitted that if South-East governors are serious and sincere about Igbo security, they ought to counteract banditry in the region; object to military bombings and attacks on the land and build collaboration between Eastern Security Network (ESN) and Ebubeagu, since the ESN is supported by many Igbos.\n\nIn the meantime, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu has dragged Nigeria and Kenya before an international tribunal over his rearrest and rendition.\n\nKanu is demanding to be restored to his initial state before rearrest.\n\nThe IPOB leader, through his counsel, Aloy Ejimakor, petitioned the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights over his rearrest.\n\nKanu said he was a free man before his rearrest, hence the tribunal should restore that status.\n\nA statement by Ejimakor said the Nigerian and Kenyan governments must give an account of the extraordinary rendition of the IPOB leader.\n\nDAILY POST recall that Kanu had a few weeks ago rearrested and repatriated from an unspecified African country.\n\nThough the Nigerian government has been silent on the country, it is widely believed that Kanu was nabbed in Kenya.\n\nSince his return, the IPOB leader has been in custody of the Department of State Services, DSS, following an order by Justice Binta Nyako of an Abuja Federal High Court.\n\nOn Monday, DSS, however, failed to produce Kanu in court due to logistics reason.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Justice Nyako had adjourned the matter till October.\n\nNnamdi Kanu\u2019s trial: Storm court on Monday, don\u2019t be intimidated \u2013 Adeyanju tells IPOB supporters",

It appreciates the media as a strategic partner in our determination to foster the socio-economic and political development of our nation.\u201d\n\nRepresented by Kwara State Director of the National Orientation Agency (NOA), Segun Adeyemi, the minister explained that Federal Government\u2019s position on the regulation of the social media was for national interest and in line with global best practices.\n\nMohammed said the phenomenon of fake news and hate speeches, which has dominated the social media space, is detrimental to the nation\u2019s peace, security and national cohesion.\n\nThe minister said no responsible government would allow enemies of its country to use the media as a tool for destabilisation.\n\nHe urged the media to shun sensational reporting and avoid fake news.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to him, sensitive reportage will help to prevent or de-escalate conflicts, as the case may be.\n\nSpeaking on the theme: Culture, Media and National Cohesion, Mohammed said the neglect of culture and the breakdown of cherished cultural values have contributed largely to the myriad challenges currently bedeviling the nation.\n\nThe minister said urgent and concerted efforts were required for cultural reconstruction and reawakening to achieve the much-desired socio political and economic progress.\n\n\u201cThe other dimension of the theme of this conference is the role of the media in fostering national cohesion. The media is an indispensable institution in modern and democratic societies.\n\n\u201cAs the fourth estate of the realm and watchdog of society with constitutional backing, the media has a pivotal role to play in the progress and well-being of society,\u201d he said.\n\nNICO Executive Secretary/CEO Ado M.

          "text": "Agency Reporter\n\nThe Adamawa State government on Tuesday told a Federal High Court in Abuja that former Vice-President Atiku Abukakar is eligible to vie for the office of the president.\n\nThe state\u2019s Attorney-General, Afraimu Jingi, told Justice Inyang Ekwo while moving a motion on notice, seeking to be joined in the suit filed by a group against Atiku and three others.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the group, an Incorporated Trustees of Egalitarian Mission for Africa (EMA), had sued Atiku, his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) as first to fourth respondents.\n\nEMA is challenging Atiku\u2019s eligibility to contest for presidency on the grounds that he was not a Nigerian citizen by birth.\n\nThe group asked the court to hold, among others, that considering the provisions of sections 25(1) &(2) and 131(a) of the constitution and the circumstances surrounding the former vice president\u2019s birth, he cannot contest for the top office.\n\nBut Jingi, through his lawyer, Chief L. D. Nzadon, in the motion, dated April 26 and filed on June 24, sought an order of the court to be joined in the matter. Moving the motion, Nzadon based his argument on 21 grounds.\n\nThe lawyer described the matter as \u201ca public interest suit to ensure that the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) is complied with in the election of the President of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nHe said the Adamawa AG is a chief law officer of the state who must be brought in as a party.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney-General is traditionally the guardian of the public interest in any public interest litigation,\u201d Nzadon added.\n\nAccording to him, this matter cannot be effectively and conclusively determined unless the Attorney General of Adamawa State is joined as a party.\n\nNzadon said Atiku, against whom the suit was primarily directed, is a citizen of Nigeria from Adamawa State and that he had been elected governor of the state in 1999 and served as the Vice-President of the country between 1999 and 2007.\n\nThe lawyer said the suit threatens the right of not just the ex-vice president to contest the office of president \u201cbut that of the citizens of Nigeria of Adamawa State origin covering 12 out of the 21 Local Government Areas in the state\u201d.\n\nHe listed the local government areas to include Ganye, Jada, Toungo, part of Mayo-Belwa, part of Fufore, part of Song, part of Hong, Maiha, Mubi-North, Mubi-South, Michika and Madagali.\n\nNzadon said the total population of the citizens of Nigeria from Adamawa State who would be affected by the outcome of the suit was about 2 million, going by the 2006 National Population Census figures.\n\n\u201cEvery citizen of Nigeria, whatever his ethnic, religious or cultural background or persuasion, should have the same right to vie for any political position under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as any other citizen.\n\n\u201cTo disenfranchise the citizens of the 12 local government areas of Adamawa State in relation to the office of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is to discriminate against them, contrary to Section 42(1)(a), (2) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended),\u201d he told the court.\n\nAccording to him, Adamawa State has the highest number of Nigerian citizens from the former Trust Territories of Northern Cameroon of the three states that have such citizens, to wit: Adamawa, Taraba and Borno states.\n\nThe lawyer said it would be extremely difficult to get each one of these Nigerian citizens to defend this action in court.\n\n\u201cThis is a public interest Suit and can best be defended by the Adamawa State Government through its Chief Law Officer, the Attorney General of Adamawa State.\n\n\u201cThis cause will be defeated by the non-joinder of the citizens whose civil rights and obligations will be affected in violation of Section 36(1) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended),\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe citizens of Adamawa in the 12 local government areas ought to have been joined as necessary parties to this suit but were not.\n\n\u201cThe presence of the said citizens is necessary to enable the court to effectually and conclusively adjudicate upon and settle the questions involved in the action.\n\n\u201cThe government and people of Adamawa State have a greater interest in this suit than the 4th respondent (AGF).\n\n\u201cIt is the constitutional responsibility of the Adamawa Government to advance and protect the political, social and economic interests of the citizens of Nigeria from Adamawa State.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe applicant is a necessary party to this suit without whose joinder the citizenship issues affecting the indigenes of Adamawa State from the 12 of the 21 local government areas in the state cannot be determined with finality,\u201d the lawyer said.\n\nSince counsel to other parties in the suit did not oppose the motion, Justice Ekwo granted the prayer.\n\nThe judge, who gave the applicant seven days to file and serve all their processes, adjourned the matter until Sept. 27 for hearing of the substantive suit.\n\nNAN reports that both Atiku and the PDP had since asked the court to dismiss the suit which they said was grossly lacking in merit.\n\nIn a preliminary objection be jointly filed with the PDP, Atiku, maintained that he is \u201ca bona fide citizen of the Federal Republic of Nigeria\u201d.",

And, indeed, they have lived up to this terror tag. On a daily basis, Fulani herdsmen kill our people, they rape our women, sack our communities, destroy our farmlands and our crops. Our livelihoods are now sorely imperilled by the activities of the herdsmen. Yet, their leaders are in Abuja, fouling up the streets in long convoys and being protected by Nigerian security operatives. No single herdsman has ever been arrested, not to mention being punished for the atrocities against our poor rural dwellers. Those who have aided and abetted this very unjust, unfair and reprehensible system against Ndigbo are sponsoring Biafra.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, every Igboman sees himself as a Biafran to the extent that he feels oppressed, marginalised and unjustly treated by the Nigerian system. Which other zone in the country has five states? Only the South East! How many rail lines are currently being done in Igboland? We have a government that is instead constructing railways through the Sahara to other countries. Of what economic significant are they to the country! So, those who are perpetuating this unfair system against our people are the sponsors of Biafra.\u201d\n\nThe group said though the modus operandi of Nnamdi Kanu may not be acceptable to everyone, he is, however, not the cause of the problem. \u201cHe is not even the only propagator of Biafranism. Many others who share his objectives, but still disagree with his means are active and vocal, and are unflinching in their convictions.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a don, Jackson Omenazu, yesterday said no amount of intimidation can stop the agitation for a president of Igbo extraction in 2023.\n\nSpeaking yesterday in Enugu during the second Presidential Aspirants Handshake, organised by the South East For President 2023 (SEFORP 2023), Omenazu and other speakers on the occasion held that 2023 Presidency was the right of the South East zone.\n\nSEFORP 2023 had, at the function, inaugurated a seven-man Research, Strategy and Planning Committee to fish out genuine presidential aspirants from the South East to harness and present them to the people.\n\nOmenazu, who was the chairman on the occasion, identified inherent injustice in the country as the reason for the agitations in Nigeria, adding that a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction in 2023 would resolve the problem.\n\nHe said: \u201cOnce a citizen feels threatened about his citizenship, the next you can get is rebellion. There is no political gangsterism that can stop it; 10 million soldiers will not stop it, a trillion police will not stop it, what will stop the agitations all over the country is equity and justice for all. And I believe the Igbo presidency will drive in equity and justice for all.\n\n\u201cIgbo presidency in 2023 is an agitation laced with equity, justice and good conscience. We strongly believe the Nigeria project can never be complete without an Igbo man being the president of this country. It is a fact known by all in this country that the zones that make up Nigeria have all tested the presidency apart from the South East. Any Nigerian with sound conscience will believe that 2023 is a date with history. 2023 is a journey that will deliver Nigeria from backwardness. I am highly optimistic that the Igbo presidency will re-write the Nigerian history for good.\n\n\u201cIndustrialisation of this country will start from 2023 under Igbo presidency, we are going to exhibit God-0given talent from 2023 and the entire country will know that when God gives, nobody takes.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThere was heavy security presence around the Federal High Court complex Abuja, yesterday, where the absence of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, in court forced an adjournment of his trial to October 21.\n\nWhen the matter was called by 11.10am, the IPOB leader, who is in the custody of the Department of State Security Service (DSS), was absent in court.\n\nThe DSS blamed the absence of Kanu in court on logistics problems.\n\nBefore the court proceedings, journalists and lawyers were subjected to a hectic time with security operatives before gaining access into the courtroom.\n\nIn addition, some members of IPOB were arrested by security operatives outside the court premises.\n\nRegardless, the prosecution counsel, Mohammed Abubakar, informed the court that the case was slated for hearing although the defendant was yet to be produced by the DSS.\n\nThe prosecution counsel had, however, challenged the powers of the judge to continue with the trial without the fiat of the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Justice John Tsoho.\n\nAbubakar posited that since the court commenced its annual vacation on July 26, it followed that a vacation judge should step up to hear the trial.\n\n\u201cI want to draw the attention of the court that the annual vacation for judges has commenced.\n\n\u201cThis is no fiat from the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court for this court to continue with the trial of the defendant.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if this court can continue. I don\u2019t think in the absence of a fiat from the Chief Judge, that we can continue, Abubakar stated.\n\nReacting, Kanu\u2019s counsel, Mr Ifeanyi Ejiofor, informed the court of an application he filed, seeking the transfer of Kanu from DSS custody to correctional centre.\n\nResponding, the judge held that the trial could not proceed in Kanu\u2019s absence, having been arrested and brought into the country.\n\nJustice Binta Nyako had insisted that Kanu must physically be brought to court since he is now available to face his trial.

          "text": "By Chukwudi Nweje and Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nSCORES of supporters and journalists who laid siege to the Cour De\u2019appal De Cotonou, Benin Republic, yesterday, to witness the trial of\n\nSunday Adeyemo popularly known Sunday Igboho, were disappointed.\n\nHis supporters were in court as early as 7:30am anticipating the arrival of the Yoruba youth leader, who has been in detention since Thursday. Though the court session was scheduled for 10am, there was no sign of Igboho.\n\nHowever, the pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, has alleged that the ongoing trial is a proof that the Federal Government may be pursuing a Fulanisation agenda by going after freedom agitators while ignoring activities of herders who terrorise the country.\n\nIt applauded the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji, Ogungunniso 1, for sending a delegation to Cotonou and the Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Ogunwusi Ojaja II, for setting up the Ooni Caucus towards working on various issues pertaining to Yoruba interests, including the travail presently being faced by Igboho.\n\nOlubadan of Ibadan had through his spokesman, Mr Adeola Oloko announced that a delegation would be sent to Cotonou when he hosted the executive council members of Central Council of Ibadan Indigenes (CCII) led by its President, Prince Yemisi on Sunday.\n\nThe Ooni of Ife had also last week set up the Ooni Caucus meant to work on various issues pertaining to Yoruba interests including the travail presently being faced by Igboho.\n\nActing leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, in a statement issued on his behalf by the National Publicity Secretary of the organisation, Mr. Jare Ajayi in Ibadan, Oyo State, noted that Igboho is the arrowhead of activists, agitating for a Yoruba nation and putting an end to harm being inflicted on farmers and women in Yorubaland by Fulani herders.\n\nSome kings and Yoruba communities in Benin Republic that mobilised heavily in support of Igboho also got applause from Afenifere for ensuring that an Oduduwa son, Igboho, does not suffer unjustly.\n\n\u201cWhat is now regarded as Sunday Igboho travail ought not occur at all if there had been good governance in Nigeria and people are not harassed without any just cause. It is so sad that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration is concentrating on haunting and harassing those who are seeking relief from the oppressive situation in Nigeria while shying away from tackling the menaces of kidnapping, terrorism and antics bordering on ethnic cleansing.\u201d\n\nOn the propriety of Igboho trying to escape abroad, Afenifere maintained that there was nothing strange or wrong, adding that history is replete with conveyors of a new order having to seek refuge outside their immediate country, at least for a time.\n\n\u201cWe recall that Moses had to be taken away from the prying eyes of Pharaoh and his agents in Egypt. Prophet Muhammed (s.a.w) too had to leave his hometown, Mecca for Medina in order to escape persecution. Thus, there is nothing wrong in Igboho seeking a respite, first to preserve his life and perhaps to re-strategise.\u201d\n\nAfenifere, however, accused the Federal Government of going after freedom agitators, while neglecting those who are known to be behind terrorism in the country.\n\n\u201cBy its conduct, government is giving people reasons to believe the allegation that it is pursuing a Fulanisation agenda. Harassment of freedom agitators and innocent citizens must stop forthwith.\u201d\n\nAfenifere also enjoined other monarchs in Yorubaland and other prominent people to emulate the good examples of Olubadan and Ooni.\n\n\u2022Gani Adams rallies 10 Benin Republic monarchs Meanwhile, Gani Adams, Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, said he has rallied 10 Benin Republic monarchs to facilitate the release the agitator.\n\nIn a statement by Kehinde Aderemi, his personal assistant, Adams said the move was taken to ensure justice and fairness in Igboho\u2019s trial.\n\nHe said an emergency meeting of the 10 kings would be presided over by Oba Signon Adekilumo, the Alajowun of Ajowun land.\n\n\u201cI think we must stand by him because we are all in the struggle for the liberation of our race and whatever happens to Igboho happens to us. And the journey, though, didn\u2019t begin with him, it will definitely not end with him, because the agitation for self-determination is our legitimate rights for which we are ready to follow with all our strengths.\u201d\n\nHe said the 10 monarchs are in the best position to work with the authorities in the Benin Republic to ensure Igboho gets a fair trial.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

Buhari, presently in London with senior officials of his government to attend the Global Education Summit holding in the European country, will along with the other leaders seek to raise the fund from donors across the globe.\n\nThe UK and Kenya are to jointly host the meeting, tagged Global Partnership for Education (GPE). The summit will be urging world leaders to invest in education and improve access for girls.\n\nA statement by the British High Commission in Nigeria on Monday said, \u201cAt the summit, the Global Partnership for Education aims to raise at least $5 billion from donors to support education systems in up to 90 countries and territories, where 80 per cent of the world\u2019s out-of-school children live.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, the UK has been a donor to the GPE since 2005.\n\nThe statement also said UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson had already secured a landmark commitment from G7 partners to pledge at least $2.7 billion to the Global Partnership for Education ahead of the summit. This includes \u00a3430 million from the UK, its largest ever pledge to GPE.\n\nThe statement further explained that the Global Education Summit also provided an opportunity for Nigeria to commit to progressively increase domestic education spending towards the global benchmark of 20 per cent of total government expenditure.\n\nNigeria receives substantial funding from the GPE. In June, the GPE announced the approval of a new grant of $125 million for Nigeria to fund an education programme that will be implemented by the World Bank in Oyo, Katsina and Adamawa states, the statement disclosed.\n\nIt added, \u201cOver the past 10 years in Nigeria, bilateral UK support has improved education systems for 11 state governments, reaching over eight million children.\n\n\u201cThis support has helped to reach out-of-school children and ensure they can access school and receive quality learning, including basic literacy and numeracy.\n\n\u201cEducating girls is one of the best investments for reducing poverty and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and, therefore, is a priority for the UK, also in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSince 2012, the UK has supported over one million girls to access schooling in six states through the Girls Education Project Phase 3, in partnership with UNICEF.\n\n\u201cSince 2018, UK aid support through the Education in Emergencies programme, reached over 200,000 conflict affected children in the North-east of Nigeria with formal and informal education.\u201d\n\nThe statement further revealed, \u201cAs a part of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office\u2019s global campaign to promote the aims and objectives of the Global Education Summit, and in another demonstration of Nigeria\u2019s importance to the UK\u2019s Global Education ambitions, Nigerian students from a Government Secondary School, in Abuja, joined children from around the world to record messages about what education means to them.\u201d\n\nThe statement quoted the British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing, as saying, \u201cI encourage Nigerian leaders to commit to protecting and increasing funding for a future where every Nigerian 10-year-old can read, and where every child can access 12 years of education. I hope there will be ambitious pledges and donors can come together to support the GPE financing to give 175 million children the opportunity to learn.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Orders DSS to produce him on October 21\n\n\u2022Igboho tried behind closed-doors in Cotonou\n\n\u2022Afenifere lauds Ooni, Olubadan over Yoruba agitator, accuses FG of harassing freedom fighters\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja and Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan\n\nJustice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court, Abuja, yesterday, declined to proceed with the trial of self-acclaimed leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu until he was physically brought to court.\n\nThe judge, who ordered the Department of State Service (DSS) to produce him by October 21, declined to go ahead with the trial in absentia since Kanu has been re-arrested and in custody of the DSS.\n\nBut Sunday Adeyemi, otherwise called Sunday Igboho, who was being tried in Benin Republic, was yesterday tried behind closed doors as journalists and his supporters were shut out.\n\nSimilarly, Afenifere, a Pan Yoruba socio-political organisation, yesterday, lauded the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, Ojaja II and the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji, for sending a delegation to Benin Republic, where Chief Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho,was facing trial.\n\nKanu and three others were standing trial for alleged treasonable felony and five other charges.\n\nThey pleaded not guilty to the charges and the court in April 2017 granted bail to Kanu on health grounds.\n\nHowever, Kanu jumped bail in September 2017 after soldiers invaded his family house in Afaruku, Abia State. His failure to attend his trial forced the court to revoked his bail and issued a warrant for his arrest in 2019.\n\nThe federal government working in collaboration with security agencies re-arrested Kanu in Kenya and brought him back to Nigeria, to continue his trial.\n\nWhen he was brought to court on June 29, 2021, Justice Nyako ordered his remand in DSS custody pending the notification of his lawyer and fixed July 26 for continuation of trial.\n\nAt the resumed trial, however, counsel to the prosecution, Mr Mohammed Abubakar, informed the court that the case was for hearing and although defendant had not yet been produced by the DSS, due to logistic reasons, they were ready to proceed with the trial, adding that they had three witnesses in court.\n\nBut in a swift reaction, Kanu\u2019s lawyer, Mr Ifeanyi Ejiofor, informed the court that the DSS had denied him and relatives of Kanu the opportunity to see him.\n\n\u201cI was informed authoritatively, I am speaking from the bar, that Nnamdi Kanu has been taken out of jurisdiction of this court. We have been denied access to Kanu in the last 10 days. We are worried about his safety and don\u2019t know why the federal government refused to bring him in court\u201d, he said.\n\nEjiofor said he had consequently has filed an application, seeking the transfer of Kanu from the DSS custody to the Correctional center.\n\nInterjecting, Nyako said the court could not do anything without the presence of Kanu in court. She noted that Kanu was being tried in absentia, because he was not in the country but, now that he has been arrested and in custody, the prosecution must produce him in court during trial in line with the law.\n\nSimilarly, when Abubakar raised the issue of whether the court would need a fiat to proceed with the trial during vacation, Nyako, stated that it was the duty of the prosecution to apply for the fiat if they wanted the trial during vacation and not the duty of her court.\n\nWhile the annual vacation of the Federal High Court commenced Monday July 26, it was however noted that Nyako was not one of the vacation judges.\n\nIn a short ruling, Nyako, said the court observed that the defendant was not in court when the matter was called and accordingly ordered the prosecution to produce Kanu in court on the next adjourned date, October 21.\n\nWhile indicating that Kanu would remain in the custody of the DSS for now, she ordered the DSS to allow his lawyers have access to him in line with the law.\n\nNyako stated that if the prosecution was able to get a fiat from the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, the court could reschedule the date for next hearing.\n\nHowever, reacting, a former governor of Anambra State, Chukwuemeka Ezeife, who was in court on behalf of Ohaneze Ndigbo, told journalists shortly after the court\u2019s proceedings that,he was shocked that the federal government did not produce Kanu in court today (Monday) to face his trial.\n\nWhile he described Kanu as a son, the former governor stressed that no matter what people feel or think about Kanu, he belonged to a people and they will stand by him in times like these.\n\nEzeife, stated that it was pertinent for Kanu to be \u201cbrought to court. We want to see him; we want to know whether he is still alive. I hope the government will produce him on the next adjourned date\u201d.\n\nBefore the day\u2019s proceedings, security personnel comprising DSS and Police completely took over the premises of the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nAs early as 6.40am the security operatives had barricaded all roads to the court, ensuring only staff of the Court and accredited journalists had access into the premises.\n\nDue to the security hurdles, it was difficult for lawyers and journalists to access the courtroom.\n\nAt a point, tempers were flared up, when lawyers to the secessionist agitator in their numbers insisted that they must be part of the court proceedings.\n\nThe lawyers claimed that the court was an open place and should not be shut especially to lawyers.\n\nThey also opposed screening by security operatives claiming that lawyers could not present ID cards before they would be given access into the court.\n\nCourt staff insisted that only a very limited number of persons would be allowed into the court due to the sensitive nature of the case and compliance with the covid-19 guidelines.\n\nOn Sunday Igboho, his supporters, who had been in court as early as 7:30am yesterday anticipating his arrival were however disappointed as there was no sign of him. Many detainees were brought to court for hearing in minibuses, but none of those buses had Igboho in them.\n\nHis trial was scheduled for 10 am on Monday.\n\nBut a source within the courts, hinted that Igboho had been brought to court earlier than anyone thought to avoid the possibility of any drama or clash.\n\nThe source, a court staff, added that Igboho was now at the \u201cphase of law enforcement\u201d in the court, and was currently indoors with the prosecutor in charge.\n\nIdris Oladejo, Igboho\u2019s cleric, also confirmed that his friend, whom he \u201chad been fasting and praying for, is in court\u201d.\n\nA Beninese monarch, who came to court to support Igboho also sat outside the courtroom.\n\nPolice officers, Igboho\u2019s supporters, other detainees and journalists were equally outside anticipating information from the prosecutor\u2019s office.\n\nHowever, around 4:30 p.m., security officials at the Benin Republic High Court in Cotonou were seen asking supporters of Yoruba nation activist, Sunday Igboho, to leave the court premises.\n\nAccording to sources, the hearing was no longer expected to take place in the courtroom due to the large turnout of people, who had besieged the court on Monday to witness the hearing.\n\nAs of the time of filing in this report, the hearing was said to be taking place in one of the offices inside the High Court as the main courtroom that was scheduled to be used for the hearing was deserted.\n\nMeanwhile, Afenifere leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, in a release issued on Monday by Comrade Jare Ajayi, National Publicity Secretary of the organisation, called for the stoppage of harassment of those it described as freedom agitators and innocent citizens.\n\nThe Olubadan had announced the raising of a delegation to be at the court, where the Yoruba agitator was being tried in Cotonou.\n\nThe announcement was made public by Olubadan\u2019s spokesman, Mr. Adeola Oloko, while the monarch was hosting the executive council members of Central Council of Ibadan Indigenes (CCII) led by its President, Prince Oluyemisi Adeaga\n\nAfenifere, which also lauded the Ooni for setting up the Ooni Caucus meant to work on various issues pertaining to Yoruba interests including the travails of Igboho, the situation ought not to have occurred at all, if there had been good governance in Nigeria and people were not needlessly harassed.\n\n\u201cIt is so sad that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration is concentrating on hunting and harassing those, who are seeking relief from the oppressive situation in Nigeria while shying away from tackling the menaces of kidnapping, terrorism and antics bordering on ethnic cleansing,\u201d it said.\n\nOn the propriety of Sunday Igboho trying to escape abroad, Afenifere maintained that there was nothing strange or wrong with this, adding that history is replete with conveyors of a new order having to seek refuge outside their immediate environment at least for a time.\n\n\u201cWe recall that Moses had to be taken away from the prying eyes of Pharaoh and his agents in Egypt. Prophet Muhammed (s.a.w) too had to leave his hometown, Mecca for Medina in order to escape persecution. Thus, there is nothing wrong in Igboho seeking a respite first to preserve his life and perhaps to re-strategize.\u201d\n\nAfenifere, however, accused the federal government of going after freedom agitators while neglecting those who were known to be behind terrorism in the country.\n\n\u201cBy its conduct, government is giving people reasons to belief the allegation that it is pursuing a Fulanisation agenda. Harassment of freedom agitators and innocent citizens must stop forthwith\u201d the release added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "South African payments and software platform, Yoco, has secured $83 million in Series C funding, bringing the total funds raised to date by the startup to $107 million.\n\nThe company plans to deploy the funds to develop more tools that enable small micro and medium businesses (SMMEs) thrive in the digital economy. It also plans to expand beyond South Africa as the demand for digital payments among African small businesses grows.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, this investment will unlock capacity for us to accelerate product development for our merchants and continue on our growth trajectory in South Africa and beyond,\u201d CEO Katlego Maphai said.\n\nThe latest round is the largest single investment raised by a payments company in South Africa and the largest ever by a small business-focused payments platform in the Middle East and Africa (MENA).\n\nThe Yoco founding team (L-R): Katlego Maphai (Chief Executive Officer), Carl Wazen (Chief Business Officer), Bradley Wattrus (Chief Financial Officer) and Lungisa Matshoba (Chief Technology Officer). Image credit: Yoco\n\nThe Yoco journey\n\nLaunched in 2015, Yoco was known initially for its portable card machines. Today, the company offers a wide array of financial services including online and in-store payments, business software, and capital to small business merchants.\n\nYoco\u2019s service offerings were needed to empower South Africa\u2019s payments ecosystem as millions of businesses lacked access to electronic payments, despite more than three-quarters of adult consumers carrying a card.\n\n\u201cWhen we started to plunge deeper into the problem, we found that traditional banks made it challenging and a privilege for businesses to get a card machine. Traditional POS systems come with high monthly and transaction fees and appeal to mainly the established business operation,\u201d Maphai told TechCabal.\n\nYoco was launched to lower these barriers and enable small businesses to thrive. \u201cOur expertise and efforts centre around driving financial inclusion and lowering the barriers of entry for our customers (small businesses),\u201d Maphai said.\n\nIn less than six years, Yoco has become the payments partner for over 150,000 small businesses across South Africa, processing more than $1 billion in card payments per year.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth has been driven almost exclusively by small, independent businesses that were previously cash-only.\n\nOpportunity for further growth\n\nAccording to Carl Wazen, Yoco\u2019s chief business officer, the company is still at the beginning of its journey despite being the largest payments platform in South Africa. This, he explained, is because there are over 6 million small businesses in South Africa and well over 100 million across the MENA region that still transact only in cash.\n\n\u201cRecent consumer behaviour shows a shift away from cash and businesses must rapidly adapt to this change. This presents a huge opportunity and it is our mission to support that transition,\u201d Wazen said.\n\nTo seize the opportunity, Yoco plans to deepen its operations in South Africa in addition to a pan-African expansion goal. The company is currently piloting its technologies in Mauritius with plans to add another country in the MENA region by the beginning of 2022.\n\n\u201cAs a relatively young company, we\u2019re intently focused on our immediate goals and objectives and on getting the basics like customer value and consistent delivery exactly right,\u201d Maphai said. \u201cBut we still have our eyes firmly fixed on our ambitious longer-term goal: expansion of our operation into a respected, truly pan-African brand.\u201d\n\nThe goal, according to Wazen, is to reach at least a million merchants within the next four years. Yoco aims to increase its team by 200 people within the coming year to support the growth plans.\n\nAlready, the startup has attracted top veterans to its executive ranks from companies such as Monzo, iZettle/Paypal, and Uber. A new Chairman has also been brought on board: Juan Fuentes, former Managing Director of Pagseguro, a business that he grew into a $19 billion payments giant in Brazil.\n\nThe Series C round included new investors such as Dragoneer Investment Group, which is making its Africa investment debut, after having previously backed fintech giants like Chime, Nubank, Mercado Libre, Square, and Klarna.\n\nAlso joining the round were Breyer Capital, HOF Capital, The Raba Partnership, 4DX Ventures, TO Ventures, and several current and former executives from global tech leaders such as Coinbase, Revolut, Spotify, and Gojek.\n\nExisting Yoco investors including Partech, Velocity Capital Fintech Ventures, Orange Ventures, and Quona Capital also took part in the round.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMaphai is confident that this latest funding and Yoco\u2019s unique small business-focused approach, coupled with its depth of talent and now the backing of some of the world\u2019s leading investors, positions the digital payments platform on a springboard to significant and long term growth.\n\n\u201cWorking so closely with small businesses during a global pandemic, we have a first-hand account of how agile these businesses need to be in a rapidly changing world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRemoving barriers and levelling the playing field by creating access to financial tools is a big part of answering these challenges. This new capital injection translates into an acceleration of access for small businesses in our region and beyond, bringing our vision of open commerce forward.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "It was 2015 when Oluwasoga Oni made a decision. While studying for a master\u2019s degree in Systems Engineering and Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he took a class that challenged him \u2013 alongside his classmates \u2013 to develop a business that could impact a billion lives.\n\nComing from a medical background, he used the opportunity to create a solution for a problem he had firsthand experience with: Lack of access to quality medical equipment in Nigerian hospitals. MDaaS Global was born in January 2016, with the aim of solving the challenge for thousands of health establishments in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe business idea had been percolating for a while as I grew up around health care,\u201d Oluwasoga told TechCabal. \u201cMy father is a medical doctor who has run a hospital in a small town in Nigeria for over 35 years, and I witnessed the issues he faced accessing medical equipment. So the challenge of accessing quality medical equipment is close to home for me.\u201d\n\nThrough his personal experience and research across Nigeria, Oluwasoga saw a massive social and business opportunity to serve low- and middle-income patients better.\n\nHe started MDaaS with a multidisciplinary team of co-founders \u2013 Opeyemi Ologun, Joe McCord, and Genevieve Barnard Oni. He met McCord and Genevieve in that class at MIT.\n\nThe founding team\u2019s experiences helped prepare them to build their startup from scratch, according to Oluwasoga who started his career in Software Engineering before transitioning into Systems Engineering. \u201cOur diverse backgrounds, experiences, and strengths were extremely helpful in the early days when it was really just the four of us.\u201d\n\nOlogun is an engineer by training and has extensive operations and sales experience in Nigeria. In contrast, Joe has a Master\u2019s degree in Supply Chain Management and has managed supply chains in 11 African countries, including Nigeria.\n\nMDaaS founding team. (L-R): Joseph McCord, Opeyemi Ologun, Genevieve Barnard Oni, and Oluwasoga Oni.\n\nGenevieve has a Master\u2019s degree in Business and Public Administration, with a background in Public Health and International Development and prior experiences working in Uganda, Malawi, and Ghana.\n\nMost of her work was in rural public health facilities. But, like Oluwasoga, she also saw the challenges doctors faced operating with limited resources amid other inefficiencies in the medical equipment space.\n\n\u201cWhen I met Soga, we spent our first date talking about medical equipment in rural and peri-urban places,\u201d Genevieve recalled in a 2019 interview.\n\nAt the time, she was working in the Global Healthcare Entrepreneurship program at Babson College. The program exposed her to several social organisations that are transforming Africa\u2019s healthcare industry.\n\nFor their second date, Genevieve heard Oluwasoga pitch an early iteration of MDaaS Global. Eventually, she joined the team.\n\nRunning a multimillion-dollar startup as a couple\n\nOluwasoga and Genevieve Barnard Oni have been married for over three years now while co-running MDaaS Global. The idea would be intolerable to some couples who want a clear separation between work and home life while desirable to others who dream of working with their life partners.\n\nFor Oluwasoga and Genevieve, finding a balance between job and family time is crucial. \u201cAs all founders will know, it can be really difficult not to work on your business 24/7, and being married to your co-founder can make that even harder,\u201d he said.\n\nSo how do they create the balance? Oluwasoga explained that during the Covid-19 lockdowns last year, the couple started verbally letting each other know when the office was \u201cclosed for the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur closing times don\u2019t have to be the same, and some days the office never closes, but it helps us to create some boundaries between work and home,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Onis also started some new non-work hobbies together including brewing beer, running, and taking French classes.\n\n\u201cNot only are these new things really fun, but they also help us to be more intentional about spending quality time together outside of work.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe MDaaS evolution\n\nAfter founding the startup from his class at MIT, Oluwasoga secured some funding from an angel investor and returned to Nigeria to work on his healthcare idea full-time.\n\nThe name MDaaS is an abbreviation of \u201cMedical Devices as a Service,\u201d which harkens to the original iteration of the company.\n\nAt the early stage, the startup began with direct sales (and service support) of secondary medical equipment from U.S. markets to Nigerian hospitals. However, most of their clients struggled to purchase the tools. MDaaS switched to a leasing program but that also failed.\n\n\u201cWe initially provided refurbished medical equipment sales, leasing, and servicing to small and medium hospitals. But we saw that most of our target hospitals lacked the economies of scale needed to justify these capital outlays, even at our reduced prices,\u201d Oluwasoga said.\n\nMDaaS then decided to roll out its current asset-sharing model. So rather than equip individual health facilities, MDaas installs and operates modern, tech-enabled diagnostic centres that aggregate demand from small and medium healthcare facilities in underserved communities.\n\nMDaaS offers imaging, cardiac, and lab services to identify life-threatening diseases, especially non-communicable ones (NCDs), and earlier for treatment through its centres. Its services help address the lack of access to diagnostics and preventive care for Nigerians, one of the significant problems that have long plagued Nigeria\u2019s underfunded healthcare sector.\n\nMDaaS offers imaging, cardiac, and lab services to identify life-threatening diseases, especially non-communicable ones (NCDs), and earlier for treatment through its centres.\n\nAccording to Oluwasoga, operating the high volume and low-cost model allows MDaaS to provide excellent clinical quality at prices patients can afford. For instance, an obstetric ultrasound, one of the startup\u2019s most common procedures, can cost as little as \u20a61,200 (around $3) compared to \u20a65,000 \u2013 \u20a620,000 ($12 \u2013 $50) charged at typical clinics and hospitals.\n\nBut even as MDaaS services are priced low, some patients in low-income communities still cannot pay, Oluwasoga said.\n\nGrowth across board\n\nMDaaS launched its first diagnostic centre in Ibadan in 2017 and has added six more in other states and cities, including in Lagos and Ogun.\n\nIn June, MDaas secured a $2.3 million seed round extension to increase their physical locations in Lagos, Oyo, Kwara, Edo, Kogi, and Kaduna states. They plan to create more virtual and home-based care options to make its services more accessible.\n\nThe startup has experienced rapid growth across various indicators. For example, it has performed over 80,000 diagnostics tests, grown from a 4-person founding team to a team of over 70, partnered with over 500 health facilities and 10 HMO networks, and expanded its referral network to include over 750 clinicians.\n\nOluwasoga\u2019s dream is to build the largest network of physical and virtual diagnostic and primary care facilities in Africa. \u201cWe currently work to achieve this big goal through our chain of tech-enabled diagnostic centres, BeaconHealth Diagnostics, and our new virtual-first preventive care product, SentinelX.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, MDaaS secured a one-million-dollar seed round. Besides other funding raised over the last five years, they have now raised a total of $3.7 million.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

While there\u2019s more excitement about big investment firms like Sequoia and Tiger Global who are making bold statements about their interest in Africa with their investments, some newer players are looking to take part in the action.\n\nOne of such players is Expert DOJO, a US-based early-stage fund that has decided to commit up to $5m to invest in African startups this year. It\u2019ll be making 20 to 50 new investments.\n\nSince the firm\u2019s first fund launched in 2018, Expert DOJO has invested in over 100 companies at pre-seed and seed stages across 30 countries. Some of these companies include Shipsi, Squadra and Woodpecker.\n\nExpert DOJO decided to focus more on Africa when it noticed that some of the strongest performers in its portfolio were from across Africa.\n\nSetting itself apart from other global accelerators, Expert DOJO has assembled an entire Africa-dedicated team plus cross-functional experts and Entrepreneurs in Residence (EIRs).\n\nIn addition to its new fund, the firm will dedicate an Africa-only cohort this September 2021 (currently accepting applications) to startups targeting the African market. Similar to the international cohort program, for this cohort, Expert DOJO, is looking to provide $100,000 in funding and a three-month virtual accelerator program.\n\nWhich startups qualify for this? Tech-enabled startups with a proven and scalable product. These startups also must have their main operations based in Africa and generate at least $5,000 monthly recurring revenue.\n\nStarNews Mobile, a mobile video network for Africa, is one of the first African startups Expert DOJO invested in. It currently has over 10m mobile subscribers across Africa and has secured content partnerships with Universal and Sony Music distribution as well as marketing partnerships with Pan-African mobile operators MTN, Orange, and Moov.\n\nHow was Expert DOJO helpful to StarNews Mobile? \u201cThey helped with introducing us to service providers like Accountant, legal counsel and digital marketing. They also provided strategic advice,\u201d Guy Kamgaing, the company\u2019s CEO, said.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t necessarily looking for investment in 2019 when Expert DOJO invested. But the turning point for him was when he realized that apart from money, Expert DOJO had a support network and were focused on understanding Africa better.\n\n\u201cOver the years,\u201d Kamgaing said, \u201cExpert DOJO has been consistent in terms of their interest and commitment to African companies.\u201d\n\nBrian Mac Mahon (Expert DOJO) and Guy Kamgaing (StarNews)\n\nFor Brian Mac Machon, the founder of Expert DOJO, they were motivated by the success of startups like StarNews to invest further in Africa.\n\n\u201cOne commonality we\u2019ve seen throughout our Africa portfolio is these founders\u2019 focus on growth from day one, with extraordinary resilience, grit, and most importantly, results. We\u2019ve witnessed these startups take the tools and resources provided in the DOJO accelerator and scale at super speed, well beyond industry standards,\u201d Mac Machon said.\n\nWhat\u2019s different about Expert DOJO?\n\n65% of DOJO\u2019s portfolio companies are women or minority-led. \u201cWith a valuation of $32M and the third most active startup accelerator in the United States, Expert DOJO aims to close the global inequities in venture capital funding: \u201cWe\u2019re investing in founders who represent the diverse society we live in, and not just the privileged Silicon Valley elite,\u201d Mac Mahon said.\n\nAnother of Expert DOJO\u2019s notable investments is Klasha, a female-led Nigerian fintech startup.\n\nJess Anuna, CEO of Klasha shared her DOJO experience by saying that DOJO works relentlessly to secure funding for their startups and ensure they\u2019re being introduced to the right investors that will help their company scale, invest in future rounds, and strategically align with their company\u2019s needs.\u201d\n\nFor startups that go through Expert DOJO\u2019s acceleration program the support received goes beyond the three months. Victoria Mehran, an Investment associate at Expert Dojo explained this saying, \u201cWe\u2019re committed to supporting them for life. We are hopping on growth strategy calls with all our founders. Brian is on the phone with founders from 5 am to 11 pm and same thing with other members of the team.\u201d\n\nExpert Dojo\u2019s inaugural Africa cohort is only the beginning of its plans in Africa. The hope is that they will start an Africa-only fund in the near future.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "JULY 25, 2021\n\nThis newsletter is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that will serve as a post-pandemic guide. Subscribe here to get it directly in your inbox every Sunday at 3 pm WAT. Hello, A few days ago, I re-watched \u201cThe Founder\u201d \u2013 the movie about McDonald\u2019s origins. Or to be specific, about how Ray Kroc crookedly (sort of) usurped the original founders to build the world\u2019s most efficient fast food chain. The pivotal moment, when Kroc meets the finance guy, is worth savoring again:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to realize what business you\u2019re in. You\u2019re not in the burger business, you\u2019re in the real-estate business. You don\u2019t build an empire off a 1.4% cut of a 15-cent hamburger. You build it by owning the land upon which that burger is cooked.\u201d\n\nSix decades later, McDonald\u2019s is still primarily a multibillion dollar real-estate business. Tech companies today use McDonald\u2019s as a lesson in scaling. Stripe is not a payment processing company but one building \u201ceconomic infrastructure for the internet.\u201d Just as Google became the internet\u2019s knowledge infrastructure two decades ago. What does scale look like in Africa? Fintech is the continent\u2019s hot cake so let\u2019s start there. PARTNER MESSAGE\n\nHave you tried Flutterwave Mobile today? The Flutterwave Mobile app, the app that turns any smartphone into a mobile POS is now redefining commerce. The Flutterwave Mobile App makes it super convenient for anyone to take their business with them anywhere, anytime. Learn how you can take your business anywhere, anytime here. Now, today\u2019s story.\n\nThe top 4% No standard definitions exist for what scale is for fintech in Africa. But one effort by the Wheeler Institute at the London School of Business can be a guide. Here are five key numbers from the report: Out of 716 fintech companies pooled across Africa, only 37 have achieved scale. 20 out of those 37 companies are headquartered in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. On average, it takes 12 years for a African fintech company to scale; only 5 startups have managed to scale within 5 years of operations.\n\nOlanrewaju Odunowo/TC Insights Also, those 37 include \u2018fintech\u2019 units launched by Airtel and MTN. So we really only have 4% scale prevalence in African fintech.\n\nThese numbers are not pretty. Is Africa not a huge market populated by young people with internet-enabled smartphones? Why are the fintech companies serving them not scaling? The report gives two explanations: Fragmentation: Many tech companies have not overcome the complex aspects of implementing their ideas in practice. A major complexity is the existence of different (and sometimes harsh) regulations from one country to another. Low-income: How many people can pay for the services being offered? An \u201caddressable market\u201d is demand \u2013 the number of people \u201cwilling and able to pay\u201d \u2013 not population. Goodwill may attract but it is self-interest that converts. Putting it bluntly, the report states that \u201cscaling a business that serves lower income tiers is notoriously hard.\u201d It\u2019s a reality check for those who dream of capturing the next billion from Africans at the bottom of the pyramid. Beware of \u201cfinancial inclusion\u201d apps. However, it\u2019s not all bad news. One interesting takeaway is that \u201cinfrastructure\u201d fintech companies are likely to scale in Africa. Olanrewaju Odunowo/TC Insights Infrastructure fintechs, according to the report, are those providing payment gateways, building banking-as-a-service applications or aggregating services into APIs. Of the 96 fintech companies defined as being in the sub-sector, 10% have scaled. Interswitch, MFS Africa and Fawry probably typify the infrastructure fintechs but I am surprised that certain names are not listed among the scaled in this sub-sector. Is a multimillion-dollar acquisition not a signal of scale? How about a presence in 30 countries with over $50m in annual revenue? The researchers explain their methodology in the report. Whatever those answers, the important thing to note is that companies building the rails for other services (financial and non-financial) in Africa are likely to expand quickly. But scale is not just for B2B fintechs. Carbon and Branch, two digital lending companies, make the case that it is possible to scale by serving consumers efficiently. Both have recently evolved to digital banks. Carbon staking out a claim to lead Buy Now Pay Later in Africa \u2013 in other words, to become infrastructure for lending. Perhaps another report with a different yardstick will reveal other scaled fintechs in Africa. For now, we can look deeper into the top 4% to see how they arrived where they currently are. Like McDonald\u2019s, did they all scale by owning land instead of burgers and fries? FROM THE CABAL In case you missed these:\n\n\n\nSenegal will produce rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 from 2022, thanks to a tech transfer deal involving two major biotech companies. The technology and expertise for making the Covid tests will be passed from biotech companies to DiaTROPIX, a diagnostic test production unit in Dakar. The goal is to boost Covid detection in Africa. In Ethiopia, Dashen bank has partnered with Thunes , a Singapore-based global payments network, to facilitate fund transfers from around the world to the Horn of Africa nation. It\u2019s the latest in a series of recent events signalling Ethiopia\u2019s increasingly open financial industry.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoining the rank of one of the most valuable startups on the continent, South Africa-based fintech startup, Yoco, has announced an $83 million Series C today.\n\nThe round was led by Dragoneer Investments Group, a US-based investment company. Former investor, Partech, also returned to partake in this round. Other investors include Breyer Capital, 4DX Ventures, Orange Ventures, Velocity Capital Fintech Ventures, and Quona Capital.\n\nThis Series C is after a $3 million Series A in 2017 and a $16 million Series B raised in 2018, bringing the company\u2019s summate value to $102 million. Making it the largest funded South African startup, and one of the most valuable startups in Africa.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Bradley Wattrus, Carl Wazen, Katlego Maphai, and Lungisa Matshoba, Yoco initially kicked off operations as an offline payment service startup providing their portable card machines for SMEs in South Africa to process Point-of-Sale payments.\n\nAfter about seven years of providing offline payment offerings, the company rolled out an online payment platform in March of 2020, a few days into the COVID-19 lockdown order in South Africa. Following the lifting of the lockdown, both offline and online offerings went into full gear.\n\nWith this funding in place, the startup is looking to scale offline and online offerings for their payment services, expand to new markets, and hire more team members.\n\nYoco wants to strengthen its presence by hiring 200 members to the team to work remotely and in their physical offices currently available in South Africa and Amsterdam.\n\nPer TechCrunch, new hires in the company include Juan Fuentes, the former Managing Director of Brazil-based fintech unicorn, Pagseguro, who is currently the Manager; and Lindsey Jayne, a former VP of products management at England-based online bank, Monzo.\n\nSmall and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in South Africa contribute one-third of the GDP. Currently, the startup serves about 150,000 small businesses, claims to have a daily addition of over 500 merchants, and has carried out over $2 billion worth of transactions in card payments.\n\nPlans for the future include foraying into other parts of Africa and the Middle East, and reaching at least a million people in the course of the next four years with more digitised payment options.\n\nFintech startups in Africa are still leading the pack of startup fundings in Africa, with reports showing that in 2020, the continent raised at least $1.3 billion in fundings deployed to fintech. This is a no brainer given Africa\u2019s unbanked population, the speed and convenience of online and card-based payment transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

          "text": "After weeks of speculations and fears of Covid 19, the much talked about games, the rescheduled 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games officially kicked off last Friday, July 23 in Japan.\n\nStaging the Tokyo Olympics at these difficult times where the pandemic has crumbled activities with sports the biggest hit, has not been easy for Japan and the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which runs the Olympic Games.\n\nOver $15.4 billion has been spent by the Japanese government with $6.7billion coming from the taxpayers. But the fear is that organizers and the IOC could lose billions of dollars if the Olympics are canceled due to COVID-19 for a second time.\n\nRead Also: Virus surge threatens Tokyo Olympic Games\n\nCost of cancelling the Olympics\n\nOver 11,000 athletes from 200 countries are in Tokyo for the Tokyo Olympics amid coronavirus, but the stakes are higher for advertisers, Japan and IOC who are feeling anxious about the more than $1 billion they have spent to run ads.\n\nCalls to cancel the more than $15.4 billion showpiece have intensified as more athletes test positive for Covid-19.\n\nJapan medical adviser Dr. Shigeru Omi has said it is abnormal to hold the Olympics during a pandemic.\n\nCNN reports say that about 15.1 percent of Japan\u2019s population are fully vaccinated.\n\nRead Also: The pricey pain of hosting an Olympics by numbers\n\nQuestions have been raised about the health risks of participants and the World Health Organization and other health bodies have been blamed for not taking a clear stand on the 2020 Olympics in Japan.\n\nEven the local media are joining the calls for cancellation. For example, Asahi Shimbun, one of the biggest selling newspapers in Japan, has called for the Olympics to be canceled.\n\nCalling off the Tokyo Olympics comes with huge financial implications. Japan has officially spent $15.4 billion, but government audits suggest it\u2019s twice that much. Japanese advertising giant Dentsu Inc., has raised more than $3 billion from local sponsors.\n\nCancelling the 2020 Tokyo Olympics could cost the IOC $3 billion-$4 billion in lost broadcast rights income. Sponsors account for 91 percent of the IOC income, and American network NBCUniversal provides about 40 percent of the IOC\u2019s total income.\n\nRelief for organizers and advertisers\n\nDespite some fears, the Tokyo Olympic Games promises to be a revenue generator.\n\nThe Olympics is always a major draw for sponsorship dollars, and despite pandemic fears, the Tokyo Games have registered over 60 sponsors and brands at various levels of endorsement.\n\nCoca-Cola, Toyota, Visa, Airbnb, Samsung, and Procter & Gamble are some of the big brands in Tokyo.\n\nRead also: Tokyo\u2019s Olympics leaves Japan swamped in a pool of debt\n\nSeveral other popular brands like athletic wear brand Asics, camera maker Canon, and beer brewer Asahi.\n\nBrands hopeful on return on investment\n\nStakeholders and analysts are optimistic the Olympic Games can still be a revenue driver for companies and sponsors.\n\nBig brands have spent over $1 billion on ads on the Tokyo Olympics, which is ongoing in empty arenas as the pandemic lingers.\n\nNBC believes the Games is a revenue booster and paid $7.7 billion for broadcasting rights to show the Olympics through 2032, and it\u2019s already sold $1.25 billion in ads for the Tokyo games.\n\nThere are more than 140 sponsors for NBC\u2019s coverage on television, on its year-old streaming platform Peacock and online, an increase over the 100 that signed on for the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\u201cNot being there with an audience of this size and scale for some of our blue-chip advertisers is not an option,\u201d said Jeremy Carey, the managing director of the sports marketing agency, Optimum Sports.\n\nNBC also revealed it had exceeded the $1.2 billion in U.S. ad revenue for the 2016 Games in Rio and had sold all of its advertising slots for the opening ceremony, adding that the price for a 30-second commercial exceeds $1 million.\n\nStreaming audience to increase\n\nTelevision has attracted the bulk of the ad spending, but the amount brought in by digital and streaming ads is on the rise, according to Kantar. Several forecasts predict that TV ratings for the Olympics will lag the Games in Rio and London, while the streaming audience will grow sharply.\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) reports that the IOC stands to make $3 billion to $4 billion on television rights from the 2020 Olympics. One NBC executive said they believe this could be the most profitable Games ever.\n\nThe Olympics have long been an ideal platform for companies looking to promote their brands, with plenty of opportunities to nestle ads, and brands executives believe this could be the most profitable Games ever.",

          "text": "In an announcement after the July MPC meeting, Nigeria\u2019s central bank governor, Godwin Emefiele, announced that the CBN bank will no longer sell foreign exchange to bureau de change operators (BDCs).\n\nThe CBN will also no longer issue fresh licences to BDCs.\n\nThe governor said that that the central bank sells about $110 million to BDCs every week. Going forward, those funds will be made available to commercial banks to meet genuine demand for foreign exchange.\n\nGoing forward, banks will reorganise their operators to cater to customers who use to patronise BDCs.\n\nEmefiele said the banks must make every effort to meet genuine demand as soon as possible.\n\nWith this move, the CBN seeks to reign in speculative demand for foreign exchange and take on the challenge of meeting all genuine demand.\n\nReactions to this move have been mixed.\n\nSome traders say that the action is probably counterproductive. They say that the central bank may be underestimating the size of demand outside the official market and that the policy change will do little to address the sharp disparity in the official and parallel market exchange rates.\n\nRead also: CBN again holds benchmark interest rate at 11.5% amid declining inflation\n\nHowever, others say that the move is correcting a long-standing anomaly. BDCs are licensed to meet demand for personal and business travel and not for big-ticket items that should translate to demand of over $100 million a week. Governor Emefiele noted that the CBN is the only central bank in the world that sells foreign exchange to BDCs. Some market operators also note that \u201cthere is nothing that BDCs do that banks cannot do better\u201d and that over 6,000 BDCs add little or no value to the market today.\n\nThat said, financial markets will react to news and the announcement is expected to spark volatility in the parallel market for foreign exchange, more so because of the timing of the announcement. The move is coming in late July when demand for foreign exchange for personal travel and school fees is typically high.",

          "title": "Opinion: Zuma\u2019s Controversial Sentence \u2013 By SAM KARGBO \u2013 Daylight",
          "text": "The world is being hit by the breakdown of law and order in South Africa because of the sentencing of Jacob Zuma to 15 months\u2019 imprisonment for contempt of court. This piece attempts to analyze the situation, and point out what is wrong with the jailing of Zuma at the time he was jailed.\n\nThere are moments when human beings break out of control and act in accord with their true self. It is in those autonomous moments that you can know them for who they are. The authentic human being is an autonomous one and not the controlled and pressured one. Behaviour can be motivated by thoughts and feelings, which provide insight into the individual\u2019s psyche, revealing attitudes and values. To the psychologist, when we are not aware of needs, we act based on our feelings, thoughts, habits, or impulse. To me, the bottom line is that people do not behave in a vacuum. There is hardly any action that is not traceable to a feeling, a thought or habit that is traceable to a need.\n\nThe needs of the average poor, deprived, depraved and ignorant African are different from those of the African elites. The elites have conquered poverty. They can provide for themselves and their families the basics of life. They strive for an environment where the law behind the law operates to the fullest. Subordinating the state and every individual or institution to the law is a big deal to the African elite. Although these are not at the top of the wish list of the poor, the elites who interact with the state and assume the role of the peoples\u2019 spokespeople wrongly prioritize them.\n\nThe average African \u2013 the rustic folk, the man on the street and largely uneducated\u2013 is steeped in religion with high idolatry doses. Religion, relationships and inner peace are better definers of their well-being than the Rule of Law or economic prosperity. To them, prosperity, accomplishments and fortunes of every kind are favours from God.\n\nWhen assessed in terms of physical and infrastructural development, income, money and other economic elements and variables, South Africa may not rank behind any other country in Africa. But the saying \u201cMan shall not live by bread alone\u201d has a profound meaning in this discussion. Economic prosperity or economic freedom may not mean much if it ignores what matters most to the poorest of the poor. The happiness of that group (the majority) is indeed the happiness of every African country.\n\nIt is, therefore, necessary to factor in the dimensions that matter to the poor or what they value more in economic development and strategies.\n\nTo the elites, who know the consequences of white-collar pillaging of the state, corruption is the worst of all economic crimes. It is much more than a monkey on our back. It is at the base of all developmental problems and the greatest threat to social cohesion. It undermines democratic and representative governance. Nothing has undermined public institutions like corruption. Be that as it may, fighting corruption can hardly feature on the first page of the wish list of the poorest of the poor.\n\nThis backdrop should throw light on the relationship between the jailing of Jacob Zuma and the attendant riots.\n\nZuma, who was President of South Africa between 2009 and 2018, was sentenced to 15 months in prison for contempt because he defied a court order to testify before a Judicial Commission investigating his presidency for corruption. His corruption scandals predated his presidency and lasted up to this moment \u2013 the time of going to press. The testimonies before the judicial commission by former ministers and state-owned corporations have not flattered Zuma. They have been so revealing and telling that the Constitutional Court, which is the highest court of South Africa, was persuaded to issue an order directing him to testify before a Judicial Commission. Expectedly, Zuma appealed to the sentiments of his supporters and resorted to clever stonewalling tactics. It was for this reason that the court convicted him of contempt and sentenced him to prison.\n\nConvicting and sentencing Jacob Zuma is meant to sell the Rule of Law as a prized commodity in South Africa. Indeed, it will appeal to lawyers, jurists, philosophers, political scholars and students of Aristotle, Locke, Dicey, Hayek and Fuller and other brilliant thinkers who made the concept dominant in political theories. But as Thabo Mbeki \u2013 Jacob Zuma\u2019s predecessor \u2013 would ask, was there no alternative to the Rule of Law in the context and circumstances of the jailing of Jacob Zuma? Is the jailing of Jacob Zuma worth the lives of the number of South Africans who have died and the ruin or harm that has befallen the South African economy?\n\nIs the cautionary approach to the concept of the Rule of Law by thinkers like Plato and Carl Schmitt not vindicated? Was the importance of the Rule of Law not exaggerated in the context of the jailing of Zuma? This discussion is not meant to be a variant of the debate about the value of the Rule of Law. It is an exposition or, perhaps, an amateurish psychological survey of the state of minds of those who are prompted by, or more correctly, those who used the jailing of Zuma to wreak havoc on the economy of South Africa.\n\nThe Rule of Law is hallowed partly because of its pivotal role in liberal political morality. The prescriptions of the Rule of Law for democratic and representative governance or human and fundamental rights \u2013 including social and economic freedoms \u2013 have proven to be indispensable values. The sentencing and imprisonment of Zuma agree with the Rule of Law. Zuma has always been under the law. He was a public authority and a citizen who is subject to surveillance, scrutiny and the constraining framework of law and norms. There was never a time in his life when it was lawful and permissible for him to be ad hoc in his action or act arbitrarily and per his absolute discretion. The law behind the law does not permit that. Zuma was a president who presided over the resources and lives of South Africans. He might have enjoyed the shield of the unjustified principle of immunity from prosecution while in office. He is now a private citizen who ought to give an account of his stewardship to South Africans. It was an affront to the Rule of Law and indeed to well-established norms of public decency for him to question or try to circumvent an effort of the state to bring him to account. What is wrong in subjecting him to an accounting process sanctioned by the highest court of the land? His behaviour speaks volumes about the person that he is and the leader that he was. He is indecent and of no integrity. But the Rule of Law is not strong enough to single-handedly subdue and contain him within the confines of the law. Zuma and his ilk, who are gods to the ordinary people, require much more than the Rule of Law to domesticate them. The Government of South Africa missed this point. I will explain further.\n\nThe Rule of Law is not a silver bullet. It requires the assistance of the Will of the people and their unquestionable desire and absolute willingness to be regulated by equal standards and values. The majority of the people should understand and relate the concept of the Rule of Law to their daily lives and well-being. Coercing the ordinary people to comply with the laws and public norms is not enough. The folks should know and accept their necessity. Until the majority take it as given and essential for conflicts to be determined and resolved by the Courts of the land, the Rule of Law is by itself a veritable source of conflict. The legal or penal system cannot be automated or made to work seamless if the majority of the people have not internalized the concept of the Rule of the Law and have a sixth sense of the consequences of actions and criminal behaviour. The Courts and their procedural mechanism should not only be available to the people for the espousal of rights and settlement of their disputes. They must resonate with them as the main pillars for their peace and security. The Rule of Law can only be clear and determinate when it resides in the recesses of the hearts and souls of the people. In this regard, the independence of the Judiciary, with its avowal bond with the people, is essential. The people must have absolute confidence in the judicial system and its adjudicative process. The ordinary man must be the owner and protector of the Rule of Law and not the elites or philosophers. Making it the job of lawyers or jurists to drive the normative values of the Rule of Law takes it away from the common man or woman. It makes it elitist and removes it from the domain and sphere of the most active population. The consequences of the exclusion of the ordinary folks in efforts meant to deepen the Rule of Law will be dire. The Rule of Law has a strong relationship with the independence of the Judiciary and the attendant presumptions of fairness and justice.\n\nThe integrity of the Judiciary is the most effective tool in the fight against corruption. If the ordinary folks believe in the independence of the Judiciary, they will have a presumption in favour of liberty in the judicial process. Where that is absent, criminal trials with political flavour in a polarised society become a joke and source of resentment against the Government.\n\nThere is no time when the independence of the Judiciary and the integrity of the legal process, and in the particular penal system, is tested as when a criminal trial has a political undertone. Political motive and malice can be attributable to criminal prosecutions of political leaders by ordinary people who do not understand the relationship between law and the mechanisms of Government. Rustic and poor folks are sometimes preoccupied with the trauma of the inability of the Government in power to act by its electoral campaign promises. They are justifiably easily irritated or impatient with any attempt to throw in between their frustrations and expectations the prosecution of their hero. To the ordinary person, yesterday is the greener grass. Tampering with their nostalgic memories can be suicidal for any Government. This is more so where the people see the Judiciary as another branch of the Executive. Unfortunately, many African leaders do not see the political benefits of working side by side with an independent Judiciary, and as such, the Judiciary is usually the first casualty of a despotic and rogue Government. The language of the violent and anarchical reaction of the ordinary South Africans to the jailing of Zuma for contempt of court is simply that they understood it to be a persecution of their god by his enemies in Government. To them, it was not the Rule of Law in action but the rule of the bad guys, who are working for the enemies of their hero. In a word, the South African Constitutional Court put into use a constitutional symbolic sovereign power without the sanction of the owners of the ultimate sovereign power. It failed to read the political weather and mood of the people.\n\nPerhaps the South African Constitutional Court has a lot to learn from the restraint, patient and cautious Supreme Court of Nigeria. Besides being circumspect in dealing with the malaise of contempt of court, that court has, for good reasons, resisted the temptation to tinker with presidential election results. Some say the heavens will not fall if they do for good and justifiable reasons, but it has resisted the temptation to risk the consequences of such a venture. The wisdom is that the day the majority of the Nigerian electorate disapproves of presidential election results, the Courts would not be the ones to reverse that result. Some decisions are better left for the people to take. To be sure, it is my prayer that there will come a day when the over 200 million Nigerians will domesticate the 360 members of the House of Representatives, 109 Senators, 36 Governors and one President who are sitting on top of their resources and destinies.\n\nIt is in that spirit that I will end this discussion with the following quote from Etienne de La Boetie, a French magistrate, classicist, writer, poet, and political theorist who lived for a short but very productive time between 1 November 1530 and 18 August 1563:\n\nWhere has he acquired enough eyes to spy upon you, if you do not provide them yourselves? How can he have so many arms to beat you with, if he does not borrow them from you? The feet that trample down your cities, where does he get them if they are not your own? How does he have any power over you except through you? How would he dare assail you if he had not cooperation from you?\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

The law behind the law does not permit that. Zuma was a president who presided over the resources and lives of South Africans. He might have enjoyed the shield of the unjustified principle of immunity from prosecution while in office. He is now a private citizen who ought to give an account of his stewardship to South Africans. It was an affront to the Rule of Law and indeed to well-established norms of public decency for him to question or try to circumvent an effort of the state to bring him to account. What is wrong in subjecting him to an accounting process sanctioned by the highest court of the land? His behaviour speaks volumes about the person that he is and the leader that he was. He is indecent and of no integrity. But the Rule of Law is not strong enough to single-handedly subdue and contain him within the confines of the law. Zuma and his ilk, who are gods to the ordinary people, require much more than the Rule of Law to domesticate them. The Government of South Africa missed this point. I will explain further.\n\nThe Rule of Law is not a silver bullet. It requires the assistance of the Will of the people and their unquestionable desire and absolute willingness to be regulated by equal standards and values. The majority of the people should understand and relate the concept of the Rule of Law to their daily lives and well-being. Coercing the ordinary people to comply with the laws and public norms is not enough. The folks should know and accept their necessity. Until the majority take it as given and essential for conflicts to be determined and resolved by the Courts of the land, the Rule of Law is by itself a veritable source of conflict. The legal or penal system cannot be automated or made to work seamless if the majority of the people have not internalized the concept of the Rule of the Law and have a sixth sense of the consequences of actions and criminal behaviour. The Courts and their procedural mechanism should not only be available to the people for the espousal of rights and settlement of their disputes. They must resonate with them as the main pillars for their peace and security. The Rule of Law can only be clear and determinate when it resides in the recesses of the hearts and souls of the people. In this regard, the independence of the Judiciary, with its avowal bond with the people, is essential. The people must have absolute confidence in the judicial system and its adjudicative process. The ordinary man must be the owner and protector of the Rule of Law and not the elites or philosophers. Making it the job of lawyers or jurists to drive the normative values of the Rule of Law takes it away from the common man or woman. It makes it elitist and removes it from the domain and sphere of the most active population. The consequences of the exclusion of the ordinary folks in efforts meant to deepen the Rule of Law will be dire. The Rule of Law has a strong relationship with the independence of the Judiciary and the attendant presumptions of fairness and justice.\n\nThe integrity of the Judiciary is the most effective tool in the fight against corruption. If the ordinary folks believe in the independence of the Judiciary, they will have a presumption in favour of liberty in the judicial process. Where that is absent, criminal trials with political flavour in a polarised society become a joke and source of resentment against the Government.\n\nThere is no time when the independence of the Judiciary and the integrity of the legal process, and in the particular penal system, is tested as when a criminal trial has a political undertone. Political motive and malice can be attributable to criminal prosecutions of political leaders by ordinary people who do not understand the relationship between law and the mechanisms of Government. Rustic and poor folks are sometimes preoccupied with the trauma of the inability of the Government in power to act by its electoral campaign promises. They are justifiably easily irritated or impatient with any attempt to throw in between their frustrations and expectations the prosecution of their hero. To the ordinary person, yesterday is the greener grass. Tampering with their nostalgic memories can be suicidal for any Government. This is more so where the people see the Judiciary as another branch of the Executive. Unfortunately, many African leaders do not see the political benefits of working side by side with an independent Judiciary, and as such, the Judiciary is usually the first casualty of a despotic and rogue Government. The language of the violent and anarchical reaction of the ordinary South Africans to the jailing of Zuma for contempt of court is simply that they understood it to be a persecution of their god by his enemies in Government. To them, it was not the Rule of Law in action but the rule of the bad guys, who are working for the enemies of their hero. In a word, the South African Constitutional Court put into use a constitutional symbolic sovereign power without the sanction of the owners of the ultimate sovereign power. It failed to read the political weather and mood of the people.\n\nPerhaps the South African Constitutional Court has a lot to learn from the restraint, patient and cautious Supreme Court of Nigeria. Besides being circumspect in dealing with the malaise of contempt of court, that court has, for good reasons, resisted the temptation to tinker with presidential election results. Some say the heavens will not fall if they do for good and justifiable reasons, but it has resisted the temptation to risk the consequences of such a venture. The wisdom is that the day the majority of the Nigerian electorate disapproves of presidential election results, the Courts would not be the ones to reverse that result. Some decisions are better left for the people to take. To be sure, it is my prayer that there will come a day when the over 200 million Nigerians will domesticate the 360 members of the House of Representatives, 109 Senators, 36 Governors and one President who are sitting on top of their resources and destinies.\n\nIt is in that spirit that I will end this discussion with the following quote from Etienne de La Boetie, a French magistrate, classicist, writer, poet, and political theorist who lived for a short but very productive time between 1 November 1530 and 18 August 1563:\n\nWhere has he acquired enough eyes to spy upon you, if you do not provide them yourselves? How can he have so many arms to beat you with, if he does not borrow them from you? The feet that trample down your cities, where does he get them if they are not your own? How does he have any power over you except through you? How would he dare assail you if he had not cooperation from you?\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

He clarified that Nigeria has never charged him to court or jailed for any offence, he was never arrested for any offence or invited to Police Station.\n\n\u201cIgboho said he never had any criminal record in Nigeria.

However, the migration of Prophet Muhammad differed from other Prophets because it was the beginning of the establishment of full Islamic practice by the early Muslims. At Medina, Prophet Muhammad established the best nation ever raised and from there Islam was embraced by many nations and tribes. \u201d Alhaja Oloso recalled\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt reiterated its admonition to the Afenifere not to overglorify Sunday Igboho to the extent of conferring the status of the savior of the Yoruba people on him just as Allah appointed His Prophets to liberate their people from the shackles of one oppression or the other.\n\nWhile stressing that Islam promotes oneness of Allah as well as love amongst people of different creeds and tribes across the globe, Oyo FOMWAN Amirah appealed to Nigerians to avoid fanning the embers of ethnic, tribal and religious crises which could further aggravate the present delicate situation in Nigeria.\n\nThe Association in the statement called on the Federal Government to bring all ethnic , religious and tribal groups and agitators across the Country together for a national discourse where the nation\u2019s multifaceted crises and problems will be discussed, addressed and resolved.",

          "text": "The Director General of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Salihu Lukman, has called on the leadership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), to admit the numerous challenges confronting the party and it\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari led administration in fulfilling it\u2019s campaign promises to Nigerians.\n\nLukman, stated that the call has become very necessary in view of the numerous inherited challenges that is confronting the President Muhammadu Buhari administration.\n\nHe regretted that in Nigeria, citizens are more and more divided, amidst conflicts, violence and wars, which he noted is consuming human lives and properties in a scale that is very alarming.\n\nThe PGF DG, who stated in a statement he titled, \u201cNigeria\u2019s Challenges and Need for Reorientation\u201d argued that though there is no doubt that the ruling party inherited a battered system from the now opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2015, the party may not had fared well in confronting the challenges it met on ground.\n\nCiting the Rwandan experience, Lukman, who challenged Nigerians leaders to develop a problem solving mechanism rather than the continuous blame game, warned that the nation\u2019s challenges are more likely to get worse if nothing is done to arrest the situation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201dIt is hardly disputable that PDP mismanaged and squandered opportunities for sixteen years between 1999 and 2015.\n\nNo need to go into details as that is not the focus. What is more important at this point is the recognition that it was easy for Nigerians to register their support for APC, and on that account voted PDP out of power in 2015.\n\nHe asked \u201cThe question is, to what extent did the APC and its governments meet or are meeting the expectations of Nigerians? What are the challenges and how is the APC and its governments responding to these challenges? Compared to PDP, how different is the APC?\n\n\u201cThe fundamental issue is the question of the extent to which APC leaders and members are responding to challenges.\n\nAre we taking responsibility? The good thing is that, in APC, leaders are not in denial of the challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was not the case with PDP before 2015 and up till this moment.\n\nHowever, being members of the APC, we should be able to acknowledge too that although, the slogan of the APC is CHANGE, which underlines the commitment of the party and its leadership to bring about change in the country, the programmatic details as articulated in the party\u2019s manifesto require a mobilisation programme in order to win the support of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cOne of the big gaps confronting the APC, which unfortunately makes it easy for opposition politicians to dent the party and its governments\u2019 is the absence of mobilisation programme to engage Nigerians to take responsibility in their different fields of endeavour in responding to challenges facing the country.\n\nGetting Nigerians to take responsibility in their different fields of endevours in responding to challenges facing the country is a critical success factor in terms of producing the change envisioned by the APC and its leadership as articulated in the manifesto of the party.\u201d\n\nThe Progressive Governors DG argued further that despite the wide recognition and acknowledgement that the challenges facing Nigeria as a nation are deep rooted, it will require a robust programme of reorientation in the country to sustain the envisioned change APC and its leadership are working to achieve, adding that \u201conce the focus and scope of initiatives is limited to operations of government institutions, and non-governmental institutions continue with business-as-usual practices, most of the challenges facing the country will linger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201d For instance, take the case of insecurity, which is the most important threat to the survival of the country. As much as combative military operations against insurgency in all its manifestations \u2013 banditry, kidnappings, abductions, etc. \u2013 is fundamental to restoring order and protection of lives and property in the country, equally important is also how Nigerians across all strata of social life are being mobilised to take responsibility in restoring order and guaranteeing security of life and property in every part of the country.\n\nHow is government working to raise awareness of Nigerians in terms of what to look out for as danger signals in our different communities? What kind of conducts by citizens, including community leaders constitute risk factors and therefore indicative of security challenges? What should be done, where and who to report to? What other initiatives should citizens take?\n\n\u201cIt is painful that with all the initiatives of APC governments, especially Federal Government under President Buhari, the claim of any failure can be made.\n\nUnlike all past governments since 1999, APC Federal Government is successfully implementing more initiatives and projects.\n\nHow can the APC government be successful in implementing almost all the projects past governments have failed to execute be termed a failure?\u201d he queried",

Gabriel Aduda, who disclosed the government\u2019s plan while in New York on Monday.\n\nAduda said the plan to re-open the mission, which was shut down in 1989, is now at \u201can advanced stage\u201c.\n\nThe permanent secretary said: \u201cWe think rather than having Nigerians residing in California travelling to the East Coast or to the North Coast, they don\u2019t have to travel that far.\n\n\u201cThe mission (San Francisco) is very important and in the next few months, before the end of the year, the mission will be running.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the ministry and members of the National Assembly committees on Foreign Affairs had visited all the Nigerian missions in the US in June for on-the-spot assessment.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe visited the Embassy in Washington, DC, the New York Mission, the Atlanta Mission and we took a trip to San Francisco where we hope to re-open another mission that will service the West Coast.\u201d\n\nNigeria already has a five-room, 4,250-square foot property owned in San Francisco, California, which was serving as Consulate, this Aduda said needs to be maintained as well as other missions in United States.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is the need for upgrading, there is the need for routine maintenance and on the whole, service-wise, I think we were quite satisfied with what we saw at the missions.\n\n\u201cYou will see that there are changes in all the missions in the US, especially Atlanta and New York, when it comes to the services that are being rendered to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThis is because, during the visit, it gave us the opportunity to discuss with the staff of the missions the new direction that the Federal Government is aiming.\u201d\n\nHe however said most of the challenges presented by the staff were immigration-related and they were already being addressed.\n\nAduda said Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) was totally responsible for producing passports and that the shortage of passport booklets was due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 slowed down a lot of things and we got a lot of backlog, so the inability to meet up is what created the problem in offering passport service to Nigerians abroad.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe assured Nigerians living in the US of improved services on passport issuance, stressing that with the level of support the ministry was getting from NIS, the missions would not be talking about shortage of passport booklet by the end of the year.\n\nHe noted that the Nigeria High Commission in London which had a backlog of about 19,000 passports had it cleared in three months.\n\nHe said another batch of passport booklets had been received at the Consulate-General of Nigeria in Atlanta adding, a lot is being done and we are hoping that before the end of this year, everything will be working at optimal level.\n\nAduda commended the Consulate-General in New York for providing improved passport services to Nigerians within its jurisdiction and for organising a cultural show to promote Nigeria\u2019s rich heritage.\n\nThe permanent secretary said the consulate had adopted cultural diplomacy through the show to sell the good image of Nigeria to the world.\n\nThe consulate had on Saturday organised a cultural show, with the theme \u201cNigeria: Our Community, Cultures and Unity\u2019\u2019, to showcase Nigeria\u2019s festivals, dances, and fashions, among others.\n\nAduda, who was at the event, said the consulate had promoted Nigeria\u2019s culture in a way that people would be able be to buy-in.\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",
