          "text": "The Aareonakakanfo of Yorubaland, Gani Adams, says autonomy for federating units in Nigeria is the best political solution to resolve the various secessionist groups and arrowheads in the country.\n\nAdams stated this in a chat with The PUNCH in his reaction to a statement by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), saying that the Federal Government won\u2019t rule out political solution to resolve the crisis surrounding separatist agitations in Nigeria.\n\nGrowing dissatisfaction, disaffection, and perceived injustice have fueled secessionist agitations in Southern Nigeria of late. While detained Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho is an arrowhead of Yoruba Nation in the South-West, embattled Nnamdi Kanu leads the proscribed secessionist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra in the South-East.\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent, Adams said, \u201cThe Federal Government have no choice than to proffer political solution to the two cases \u2013 Igboho and Kanu \u2013 because whether the Federal Government believe in their cause or not, their followers believe in what they are doing.\n\n\u201cIn the South-East, the people already have the mindset that they are being shortchanged and marginalised in the political system. What they are agitating for is either to have their liberation or get a certain autonomy.\n\n\u201cAnd for Igboho, I haven\u2019t seen the offence Igboho committed than warranted criminal charges. He was pressing his demands peacefully and if the government wants to move this country forward, if the Federal Government does not want agitations to breed in other regions, it should resolve the two cases politically, it is the best option to douse tension.\u201d\n\nAdams also said though the government is against the secession of any part of the entity called Nigeria, it should not be against autonomy for the various regions.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe government should not only resolve the issue of Igboho and Kanu but to listen to the cries of the people. Even though the government does not allow secession, it should allow the federating units to develop at their pace so that more agitation won\u2019t rise because, without this, more agitations may arise in the country because people are hungry and angry.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Gwandu said the probe would disclose those after the AGF, those dragging his personality, his name and his exalted office in the dirty politics of disrepute.\n\n\u201cThis is an orchestrated attempt to stir unnecessary controversies and Public apprehension.

That does not in any way make him a staff and contributing Editor of THISDAY.\n\n\u201cSince his resignation, THISDAY had at no time contracted Mr. Nkwazema to investigate any story, and we know nothing of his alleged investigation of a story leading to the raid of the residence of Hon.

The North East was already aflame before the coming of Buhari, its peoples rendered as pawns in the power games of the northern elite, who allowed Boko Haram to fester, indeed, Buhari protested about the onslaught on Boko haram, and for those who might have paid attention, Gumi\u2019s interventions are merely aping what Buhari used to say before he gained office in 2015.

Train track bombers, who were clearly intent on the derailment of a passenger train, are labelled as vandals in a clear advertisement of the complicity of the Buhari regime in the terrorist, led insurgency, ravaging Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAfenifere said President Buhari has failed to act on security reports detailing sponsors of terrorism presented him.\n\n\u201cRetired Navy commodore Kunle Olawunmi is on record as saying the security services had submitted a report to Buhari since 2017 and that a list of the names of the major sponsors of terrorism in Nigeria is one of the several pieces of information in that file. Several of these positively identified terrorists and terrorist sponsors, are today in government at the highest level, and many more are serving senators and governors.\u201d\n\nThe group also said Nigeria negotiated and agreed to by the founding fathers had died. It said President Buhari\u2019s endless arrogance, the manifest incompetence has killed what is left of fractured Nigeria and that the ethnic nationalities must renegotiate the current structure before it implodes.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, the Nigerian state that was negotiated before independence in 1960, the one that was birthed and named on October 1, 1960, is long dead. It was mortally wounded in January 1966 and was then slaughtered in July of 1966. Its funereal obsequies were held between 1966 and 1970. The Frankenstein that was cobbled together in place of the dead nation that was agreed, has survived this long on the back of repression, lies, illusions, and outright delusions.\n\n\u201cBut Buhari has finally killed it by his endless arrogance, the manifest incompetence, and the vile ethno-religious agenda, with which he is dangerously strangling the insufferable Frankenstein.\u201d\n\nAdebanjo said there is an urgent need for an urgent need to convene a Sovereign National Conference of the ethnic nationalities to discuss the future of Nigeria.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

In addition, we are working with and have shared the details of escapees with INTERPOL, to check the risks of\n\ncross border movements.\u201d\n\nThe minister also explained that 465 inmates are running various degrees around the country, adding that 85 of this are running post-graduate programmes, including four who are doing Ph.D programmes.\n\nHe said 560 inmates have been enrolled for WAEC/NECO examinations while 2,300 are enrolled for Adult Literacy classes in several custodial centres.\n\nThe minister assured the problem associated with procuring international passports will soon be over as he announced that 2,742,207 passports have been issued by the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) in the last two years.\n\n\u201cIt is important to inform you we have witnessed growing demand for the Nigerian passport both locally and by Nigerians in diaspora. A total of 2,742,207 passports of different categories were issued between 2019 to date.\n\n\u201cThe year-on-year increasing growth rate is, however, putting a lot of pressure on the current processing structure and resources and further justifies the need for a reform in the passport application and processing system in line with the current reality,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister announced since the outbreak of COVID-19 in the country, not a single case has been recorded in the custodial centres.\n\nHe said his ministry is not unaware of the challenges Nigerians face trying to process passports, adding that efforts are bing made to deal with the problem.\n\n\u201cThe ministry is aware of the challenges faced by applicants for processing and reissue of passports. I want to use this unique opportunity to assure Nigerians that the current experience will soon be a thing of the past. New production and capture centres will be opened in the next few weeks to ease access by Nigerians all over the world.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to inform Nigerians that the ministry has taken substantial measures to address shortages of the e-passport booklets. This year alone, the ministry approved a special deployment of over 600,000 passport booklets, the largest of its kind ever done, to cushion the effects of shortages being experienced,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the effort to tackle corruption, the minister pointed out the recent sting operation carried out by NIS Acting Comptroller General, Isa Jere, at the Ikoyi passport office, saying reforms such as new appointment management system are being put in place to rout corruption.\n\nAregbesola also stated that 174,000 jobs have been created through the administration of expatriate quotas and business permits.\n\n\u201cBetween 2019 and October 2021, over 87,000 expatriate quotas were granted, 951 business permits were granted and 598 licenses were issued to public places of worship for the conduct of statutory marriages.\n\n\u201c172,000 understudy jobs have been created through the expatriate quota administration system. We recently inaugurated a ministerial task force on the monitoring of expatriate quota.\n\n\u201cThe primary objective is to audit, monitor and enforce the conditions for the approval of expatriate quota and foreign business permit. Nigerians may wish to note that one of the conditions for the approval of expatriate quota is that for every expatriate position, the company must employ two Nigerians to understudy the expatriate.\u201d\n\nOn the response to the recent collapsed multi-storey building in Ikoyi, Aregbesola said the Federal Fire Service (FFS) did not shirk its responsibility as they did their best in the salvage operation.\n\nHe said the FFS officials were the first responders at the site and did their their utmost in the circumstance.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "\u2022Says Attorney General misleading President\n\n\u2022Alleges consultants\u2019 demands dubious, fraudulent\n\nEmmanuel Addeh, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos\n\nThe Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) yesterday maintained that the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami has continued to mislead President Muhammadu Buhari in the case of the $418 million (N169 billion at official FX rate) Paris Fund deductions being claimed by some consultants.\n\nSpeaking on Arise News Channel, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, in response to comments made on the matter earlier by Malami, the NGF Chairman, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, wondered why the attorney general was taking sides with people he described as \u201cdubious\u201d, instead of defending the country against them.\n\nThe federal government had approved the payment of the controversial sum to six creditors, in defiance of the issues raised by the 36 state governors on the legitimacy of the demands by the claimants.\n\nThe claimants included a former member of the House of Representatives, politician and lawyer, Ned Nwoko, who is demanding $142,028,941; and Riok Nigeria Limited, Orji Nwafor-Orizu, and Olaitan Bello, who are laying claims to $142,028,941.95, $1,219,440.45 and $215,159.36 respectively.\n\nAlso, Ted Iseghoghi is claiming $159,000,000, while a firm, Panic Alert Security System Limited, owned by George Uboh, is claiming $47,831,920 in separate \u201cconsent judgments\u201d.\n\nThe Debt Management Office (DMO) was recently directed to commence issuance of promissory notes to the creditors, a development the governors have continued to resist.\n\nMalami had insisted that the consultants were deserving of the monies, from his own assessment of the situation, alleging that the governors had admitted to owing the debts and had actually been paying them off for some years.\n\nAccording to Malami, contrary to claims, the NGF had signed a contractual agreement authorising the deduction of fees from the federal allocation of the states as payments to consultants, who handled negotiations on behalf of the 36 States and FCT.\n\nHe had stated that having committed to the deduction of the fee from the federal allocation which the governors of the 36 states had signed to and which preceded the Buhari administration for which payments were made in the past, the federal government could not but follow through with the payment hence the recent approval to effect the payment to the consultants via promissory notes.\n\nBut speaking yesterday, Fayemi, who stated that he was ordinarily reluctant to discuss the matter since it was already in court, noted that the governors had held several consultations with Buhari, his chief of staff, the attorney general and the finance minister in the last eight months to sort out the contentious issues.\n\nHe upbraided the attorney general for publicly identifying himself as the attorney general of the federal government during his interview, noting that the office which Malami occupies exists to serve the federation and not the federal government.\n\nRather than defending the consultants, Fayemi insisted that Malami\u2019s job was to defend the federal, state and local governments which make up the federation.\n\nAccording to the Ekiti state governor, the consultants were taking advantage of Buhari\u2019s \u201cdecency and generosity of spirit\u201d to fleece the Nigerian people, having tried and failed during the administrations of Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo, Umar Yar\u2019adua and Goodluck Jonathan to rip off the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cIt is not $418, it is $419 million and that may ring some bell in many places,\u201d he stressed, apparently referring to the term 419, the popular Nigerian word for fraud or scam.\n\nHe argued that there was no order of mandamus against the governors anywhere as alluded to by the attorney general and challenged Malami to produce the document if he\u2019s in possession of one.\n\nThe NGF chairman further pushed back on a statement made by Malami during the interview, that there exists a consent judgment confirming that the monies were owed the consultants and there was an agreement to pay, saying that there was nowhere in the so-called document that any amount was mentioned.\n\nHe mentioned that whatever consent judgment the consultants claimed to have obtained was entered into by a faction of the governors\u2019 forum in the days when the then chair of the NGF, Rotimi Amaechi, was purportedly removed, maintaining that Amaechi\u2019s NGF which was the authentic body never sanctioned the deal.\n\nHe stated that not even the best lawyers in the United Kingdom would NOT charge those huge amounts for a \u201ctwo-page letter\u201d purportedly given to the faction of the governors\u2019 forum on review of the judgment, insisting that it doesn\u2019t appeal to common sense.\n\n\u201cThe attorney general of the federation is pushing so vehemently on the side of people whose primary intent is to fleece the Nigerian people. Even the EFCC that reviewed all of these matters, actually accused the federal ministry of justice of lack of diligent prosecution of this matter.\n\n\u201cThese matters were not appealed by the federal ministry of justice, admittedly not under Malami at the time. But what is happening now is just a continuation of the sleight of hand and that\u2019s what the governors are challenging.\n\n\u201cI wrote to the president on behalf of my colleagues, sat with Mr. President on this issue and clearly Mr. President was misled and there\u2019s no way governors are going to allow this.\n\n\u201cI will ordinarily not come out and do this, but my brother Abubakar Malami directed his media aides to accuse governors of being the ones behind this and he has repeated on your programme (on Arise Television) that we are forum-shopping,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that Malami\u2019s claims that part of the monies had been offset in the past and therefore was a basis for further deductions did not hold water, since it was possible to obtain money by fraudulent means, but that the governors are now insisting that the right thing should be done.\n\nFayemi pointed out that since the activities of public servants would be scrutinised by the public at some point after they exit their positions, it was imperative to display the highest form of transparency in all their dealings.\n\n\u201cI am afraid that we do not believe that the attorney general has demonstrated this (transparency) and that\u2019s what has brought this about,\u201d he declared.\n\nAsked to confirm if the EFCC verified the amount being claimed by the consultants, he stated that it wasn\u2019t possible, reason the governors had been calling for a forensic audit, since members of the anti-corruption agency are not forensic auditors.\n\nFor instance, he stated that the EFCC report revealed that one of the documents which was used to claim the huge amount by one of the consultants was forged, describing the whole matter as clouded with a lot of \u201cmalfeasance\u201d.\n\nHe questioned why the attorney general, who is a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) was in a hurry to execute the so-called judgment of the lower courts when the governors had appealed the matter in a higher court.\n\nHe explained that because governors wanted access to the Paris Club fund when Buhari agreed to disburse it in 2017, they had some agreements with certain parties who had gone to court to block the money from being released, but noted that whatever they got was the full and final payment.\n\nOn the accusation of forum-shopping, he described the allegation by Malami as \u201cingenuous\u201d, alleging that the directive by the attorney general for the release of the monies was basically to rip Nigerians off.\n\nFayemi stressed that it was an \u201cinsult\u201d for the attorney general to insinuate that the governors were forum-shopping, a practice where a party attempts to have his action tried in a particular court or jurisdiction where he feels he will receive the most favourable decision or verdict.\n\n\u201cWe have been very clear that these claims, to the best of our knowledge are fraudulent and should be subjected to a forensic audit.\n\n\u201cIf states are found to be liable on account of the purported consultancy allegedly delivered by these people, because I don\u2019t know how anybody can claim to have delivered on the refund that is already established, for anyone to suggest that they did that is a red herring.\n\n\u201cThe best way to describe this 419 million dollars is to say that this is a local equivalent of the P&ID case and it\u2019s an irony that the attorney general is the one prosecuting the P&ID all over the place and trying to rescue $10 billion for the Nigerian people and yet is so willing to release $419 million to people of dubious circumstances who are demanding for the money I don\u2019t believe they worked for.\u201d\n\nBut an analyst of the development who does not want his name mentioned. told THISDAY that it would be disingenuous for Malami to continue to push for the payment of such a huge amount of money at this point in time when the economy is still reeling from the effects of the COVID-19, the consequent slump in federal government\u2019s revenue and its inability to meet its OPEC daily crude export quota . \u201cAll these challenges have made the federal government to remain in the debt market, borrowing monies from every available avenue to meet its obligations.\n\nTherefore, under the situation that the country finds itself, managers of the nation such as Malami should be more concerned about efforts to reflate the economy and should not be seen as the one encouraging steps that would further make the economy bleed.\n\nAt a time like this, focus should be on how to spend our way out of the present economic situation and on job creation for our huge youth population so as to raise productivity. All Malami is interested is paying consultants dubious consent judgment;\n\nThe analyst argued further that whether the governors initially allowed deductions to take place in 2016, \u201cdoes not hold water because the variables available then are not the same as 2021 and there are now different players entirely who have looked at matter and realised something is not quite right in the all scheme. More so, when the deal was consummated in 2016, the dollar was around N150/$1 and now he is pushing for the consultants to be paid at around N450/$. We are talking about a colossal amount of money to be paid to a few people to the detriment of over 200 million people. This is just immoral however one looks at it, said the analyst.\n\n\u201cClearly, as the chief law officer of the country, Malami should know that all his actions on this matter are not morally right and purely against public interest and it would be immoral for the president to even endorse the payment.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u00b7 THISDAY disowns Stanley Nkwazema, says he left company over 15 years ago\n\n\u00b7 Malami denies group leader\n\nAlex Enumah and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Police yesterday paraded 14 suspects allegedly involved in the invasion of the Abuja residence of Supreme Court Justice, Mrs. Mary Odili.\n\nTHISDAY disowned one of the suspects, Mr. Stanley Nkwazema, who claimed to be a staff and contributing editor of the newspaper.\n\nSimilarly, Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, distanced himself from the leader of the group that conducted the raid, Lawrence Ajodo, who claimed to be a consultant to the AGF.\n\nA group that claimed to be personnel of some security agencies, including the police, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Department of State Services (DSS), among others, had invaded the home of the Odilis on October 29. The invasion drew wide condemnation from individuals and organisation, including the judiciary, Senate, the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Ohaneze Ndigbo, Afenifere, and other socio-cultural groups and civil society organisations.\n\nEFCC Chairman, Mr Abdulrasheed Bawa, had denied involvement of the agency in the raid, while the Inspector General of Police, Mr. Usman Baba, in ordering investigation into the incident also denied involvement of the police in the matter.\n\nBut parading the suspects at the Force CID in Abuja, Force Public Relations Officer, Mr. Frank Mba, a Commissioner of Police, said the investigation was predicated on a petition submitted by Malami directing the Inspector General of Police to conduct a robust investigation into the matter. Mba said 14 suspects were arrested while seven were at large, even as he said detectives were working round the clock to apprehend others still at large.\n\nHe said the leader of the syndicate, Ajodo, who claimed to be a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), was an impostor.\n\n\u201cHe is an impostor, not one of us or other law enforcement agencies in the country,\u201d he stated.\n\nMba said the syndicate obtained a search warrant based on false representation. He said the identity card found on him containing the signature of the AGF was forged.\n\nMba said the invasion was a well-conceived one with actors drawn from different professional backgrounds, notably, law, journalism, and rogue law enforcement. He said one of the suspects, Yusuf Adamu of the Bauchi State Liason Office, had claimed that there was a large deposit of hard currency in the home of the Odilis.\n\nMba said a prayer warrior, Aliyu Umar Ibrahim, who was contacted by an alleged Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) staff had gone to Odili\u2019s house to get soil sample of the place which confirmed the existence of the hard currency in the residence. He said the syndicate contacted a staff of EFCC, Austin, who was at large, and two lawyers, Barristers Igwe and Lawrence, and a journalist, Nkwazema.\n\nNkwazema claimed he was investigating an exclusive story. But Mba said the police doubted him because he did not report the story before it broke and long after it broke, until police invited him.\n\nMba said all the suspects attended all the meetings before the invasion and were all there on the night of the invasion. He said the security men at Odili\u2019s residence should be commended for observing that the search warrant contained No 7 instead of No 9.\n\nAccording to Mba, \u201cThis action saved the nation what would have been an embarrassment. The investigation has been swift, intelligence-led and comprehensive. Any of the suspects currently at large will be arrested.\n\n\u201cWe have contacted other security agencies, whose personnel are among those at large.\u201d\n\nThe police spokesman said no staff of the Ministry of Justice was involved in the operation.\n\nBut a man, who claimed to be the whistle-blower, an Islamic prayer warrior and swore to an affidavit that there was looted money in the house, said the information he was given was authentic. He alleged that he was called by the EFCC, after which they all assembled at the Ministry of Justice, where they demanded for the affidavit that he submitted, prompting surveillance on the home of Justice Odili.\n\n\u201cI showed him Justice Odili\u2019s house,\u201d Ibrahim said.\n\nMba declared, \u201cAt the end, all would be charged to court based on their level of involvement.\u201d\n\nHe said the charges might include conspiracy, impersonation, and forgery.\n\nHowever, Ajodo, insisted that he was one of the five consultants appointed by the office of the AGF and that he was mandated to recover stolen funds lodged in 18 accounts.\n\nResponding to questions during their parade, Ajodo said he was neither a personnel of the police nor worked for the AGF, but maintained his position that he was one of the consultants mandated to recover 18 accounts. He said the search was not executed on the night of the invasion because the house number on the warrant was No 7 and not No 9 Imo Crescent, the residence of the Justice, which prompted them to call off the search.\n\n\u201cI was given18 accounts to recover. I am a consultant, one of the five engaged in that office (AGF),\u201d Ajodo insisted.\n\nHowever, the web of denial of involvement by security agencies appears to be punctured by the accounts of the police and the suspects.\n\nFor instance, the police said two soldiers, a police ASP, an immigration officer, and an EFCC staff, who were allegedly involved in the raid, were at large. Those who raided Odili\u2019s residence were also said to be about 50.\n\nThese raise the question how, suddenly, the paraded suspects are only civilians \u2013 lawyer, journalist, native doctor \u2013 or fake policemen or suspects, who forged search warrants for the operation.\n\nTHISDAY Disowns Stanley Nkwazema\n\nMeanwhile, the management of THISDAY Newspapers, in a disclaimer notice signed by the Managing Editor, Mr. Bolaji Adebiyi, stated categorically that Nkwazema was neither a staff nor a Contributing Editor of the organisation.\n\nThe notice dated November 11, read, in part, \u201cThe attention of the management of THISDAY Newspapers has been drawn to the news making the rounds that Mr. Stanley Nkwazema, one of those suspected to have invaded the home of Justice Mary Odili, claimed to be a staff and Contributing Editor of THISDAY.\n\n\u201cContrary to his claim, Mr. Nkwazema is neither a staff of THISDAY nor a Contributing Editor. He was a Sports Correspondent and resigned more than 15 years ago.\u201d\n\nAdebiyi explained that occasionally, Nkwazema, like hundreds of other readers of the newspaper, sent for publication articles and analyses and were usually obliged. He added that it was a privilege THISDAY gave to some of its ex-staff.\n\nThe notice added, \u201cThat does not in any way make him a staff and contributing editor of THISDAY.\n\n\u201cSince his resignation, THISDAY had at no time contracted Mr. Nkwazema to investigate any story, and we know nothing of his alleged investigation of a story leading to the raid of the residence of Hon. Justice Odili.\n\n\u201cThe police authorities and the general public should, therefore, note that Mr. Nkwazema, whatever may be his involvement in this matter, was not on any reportorial assignment in any shape or form on behalf of THISDAY.\u201d\n\nMalami Denies Ajodo\n\nIn a related development, Malami denied knowing or engaging Ajodo at any time.\n\nMalami, in a statement, described the confession of Ajodo as that of a \u201cdrowning man scavenging for a dying partner\u201d.\n\nHe added that he could not have stooped so low to engage a quack or fake police officer as consultant.\n\nMalami\u2019s position was contained in a statement by his media aide, Dr. Umar Gwandu.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe attention of the Office of the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice has been drawn to a confession of a suspect during interrogation in the investigation of the recent invasion of the residence of the highly respected Justice of the Supreme Court; Justice Mary Peter Odili.\n\n\u201cWith all the competent, high level professionals and capable human resources available at the disposal of the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, it only takes the imagination of the evil minds to assume or think that the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice will descend so low to engaging a quack or fake police officer to serve as his consultant.\n\n\u201cThis is a case of a drowning man scavenging for a dying partner.\u201d\n\nThe AGF said he was happy that investigation had commenced to unravel the circumstances and personalities behind the invasion and sponsored campaign of calumny against his person.\n\nHe added that it was his desire and hope that the investigation would also disclose those after him, dragging his personality, his name and his exalted office in dirty politics.\n\nMalami, while describing the development as an orchestrated attempt to stir unnecessary controversy and public apprehension, challenged the suspect to present documents of engagements where he worked as a consultant to the AGF, whether in the past or present.\n\nThe statement added, \u201cConsultant for what? Which activity or assignment? When was he engaged? What were the terms of reference for the alleged consultancy service? When was he engaged? Where was he engaged? Which work has he executed for the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and the Minister of Justice? For what duration? And for how much?\n\n\u201cWe boldly and unequivocally challenge the fake consultant/police officer to come out with answers or responses to these questions to the general public.\n\n\u201cThe Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice superintends over and respects the rule of law, and will not do anything to undermine the sanctity of his office and that of the entire judiciary and Justice sector.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Flays uneven distribution of COVID-19 vaccines between developed and developing nations\n\nDeji Elumoye in Paris, France\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday said his administration had invested extensively in critical infrastructure and economic projects, stressing that the possibilities being created through the investments for Nigerians and foreigners are enormous. Buhari also declared that investment in gas was a top priority of his government, as it had huge benefits in terms of financial returns and generation of power.\n\nThe president spoke in Paris while playing host to Managing Director of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), Dr. Mohammed Al-Jasser, and Chief Executive Officer of Total Energies, Patrick Pouyanne, on the sidelines of the three-day Paris Peace Forum (PPF), which began in the French capital on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking at the meeting with the IDB boss, Buhari emphasised his administration\u2019s commitment to infrastructural renaissance for Nigeria, saying, \u201cWe are struggling very hard on infrastructure, because there can\u2019t be sustainable development without it.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen infrastructure is in place, our people can look after themselves.\u201d\n\nThe president emphasised that looking at the vastness of the country, \u201cWe need roads, rail, power, airports, housing, and that is what we have engaged ourselves with in the past six years.\n\n\u201cAnd our people are seeing the new developments. Relative to the resources available to us, we have not done badly.\u201d\n\nHe appreciated IDB for its support so far, saying; \u201cWhat we are so dependent on (crude oil) has lost a lot of energy. It is coming back gradually, and we are breathing a bit more with some confidence. But we expect greater cooperation from you.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Al-Jasser said he was glad to see the level of collaboration between Nigeria and IDB since he assumed office three months ago. He told Buhari that he was impressed by Nigeria\u2019s policies on infrastructure, saying it would give \u201copportunities to youths, and encourage the private sector.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cNigeria is a pivotal country to us, and it deserves all the help it can get.\u201d\n\nThe IDB boss said the main role of the bank was to promote development among its stakeholders, saying it would continue to lend a helping hand to Nigeria.\n\nBuhari stated when he received Pouyanne that Nigeria had made huge investments in gas, adding that the country would continue to create opportunities for expansion, while looking at creating alternatives with renewable energy. He said Nigeria was mindful of the target of zero emission by 2060, and had started putting in place structures to ensure balance and safety for citizens and the global community.\n\nIn his remarks, the CEO of Total said the French oil giant had been greatly encouraged by the support for investors in Nigeria. He said the company would continue to explore and pursue opportunities of mutual interest.\n\nPouyanne noted that the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), led by Mele Kyari, had provided a strong support base and partnership for growth, assuring that investments in the gas sector would be sustained with consideration for renewable energy.\n\nDuring the opening of the three-day forum yesterday, Buhari flayed the disparity in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines between developed and developing nations since the pandemic broke out last year. He canvassed an end to the hoarding of vaccines by lifting export restrictions imposed by some countries.\n\nDelivering a keynote address entitled, \u201cLessons Learned from the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Importance of Coordination Among All Actors for Vaccine Delivery,\u201d at the forum, which held at Grande Halle de la Villette in Paris, Buhari submitted that the coordination for distribution of the vaccines needed to be total while the objective had to be the same to deliver vaccines to the world.\n\nAccording to him, the state of vaccine delivery across the world leaves much to be desired.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe have a situation where some countries are giving booster third doses for their citizens when millions across the world, especially in the developing world, are yet to receive a single dose.\n\n\u201cLet us compare vaccination rates to give an idea of the dimension of the problem. According to recent data, as of 4th November 2021, 91.3 doses of vaccine had been given for every 100 persons across the world. On the same date, however, only 14.7 doses of vaccine per 100 persons had been administered in Africa \u2013 a clear case of lop-sidedness.\n\n\u201cAccording to Bloomberg, countries with the highest incomes are getting vaccinated ten times faster than those with the lowest income.\n\n\u201cAs of 5th November 2021, Africa had fully vaccinated 77 million persons, amounting to just six per cent of the continent\u2019s population. By comparison, 60 per cent of the European Union population had been fully vaccinated by September 2021. This massive gap between vaccine requirements in Africa and vaccine availability is undermining the fight against the coronavirus pandemic on the continent. Even if Africa were to receive the 600 million doses of vaccine expected to be delivered to the continent by the end of 2021 under the COVAX arrangement, there would still be a considerable shortfall when compared to the population of the continent which currently stands at 1.383 billion.\u201d\n\nQuoting the World Health Organisation (WHO), Buhari stressed that even the planned COVAX deliveries to Africa had been cut by 25 per cent due to supply shortages and export bans.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is a major setback for Africa, where it is estimated that COVID-19 vaccine deliveries have to increase from around 20 million doses a month to an average of 150 million doses a month if the target of fully vaccinating 70 per cent of its population by September 2022 is to be achieved.\n\n\u201cSo, what needs to be done to plug the gap? How can vaccine availability in Africa be boosted? Who needs to do what?\u201d\n\nThe president urged world leaders and global health institutions to follow a regime of enabling access to the COVID-19 vaccines, cautioning that sidelining countries in terms of reach will undermine the entire effort.\n\nHe emphasised that export restrictions that encourage needless hoarding of vaccines needed to be lifted, while welcoming pledges by industrialised countries to share vaccines.\n\nBuhari said pledges should be fulfilled in a timely manner, as he appreciated some countries, like France, that had donated vaccines to developing countries.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cResolving supply-chain constraints would require better coordination within the manufacturing process; and between manufacturers and end-users.\n\n\u201cThere is a clear need for the expansion of vaccine production capacity in Africa. In this regard, African countries already have a roadmap: the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plan for Africa (PMPA) developed in 2007 by the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD) on the basis of an African Union Summit decision taken in 2005.\n\n\u201cLicensing agreements should be reached with pharmaceutical companies for the transfer of intellectual property and technology to support the production of vaccines in Africa. If global vaccination is the only way to end the COVID-19 pandemic, then all stakeholders must act in a coordinated manner to plug the vaccine supply gap in Africa.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

You are now being tossed about by uncircumcised Fulani due to your idiocy and bribery. We the angry vipers are giving you 21 days to leave our land unless Maazi Nnamdi Kanu is released.\"\n\n\u201cFor Obi Cubana and Co, who are closely working with the killers of our youths, you and your crew made sure that Fulani Abba Kyari returned to Anambra State. You will hear from us.\n\n\u201cFrom now onwards, we\u2019ll put a stop to any form of tax and revenue in market and road transport such as bikes, vehicles and Sundry within the Biafran land. Henceforth, it shall be bloody. All hell shall be let loose,\u201d the group added.",

When everyone was to be ushered in for the main event, I was interviewing people who came in late. An armed officer and two others called for me,\u201d Denrele said.\n\n\u201cI was taken to an office and there was this influential personality sitting.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be amazing to catch an interview with them. He asked that I sit. I did. He asked for my name and very technical/intimate questions about the brand I worked for. I thought they were too overboard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe stood up and I thought we were going to do the interview outside. He said I should enter the car and I did. He asked if I was going to make him happy. I naively said yes, adding that I won\u2019t be asking my usual funny questions.\n\n\u201cWhat he meant had yet to click for me. I asked if I could now call my cameraman. He said no. This person unzipped his fly and said, \u2018make it go down\u2019. That was when I understood. I said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019.\u201d\n\nOn how he got over the experience, Denrele said he didn\u2019t cower when next he encountered the assaulter.\n\n\u201cI got the worst slap ever. It was like a flash and blur. I went dizzy. He screamed that I get out of his car. I got out of the car and sat on the floor, dazed. I had nobody to open up to. I couldn\u2019t have gone to the office,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI later ran into this person severally. He thought, if I saw him again, I would cower.

          "title": "Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha is a win for the creator economy",
          "text": "In 2015, software engineer Rufus Oyemade and web designer Evans Akanno started a creative agency called Cregital. Cregital, at that time, built websites for high-profile clients in Nigeria, some of them large corporations in banking and hospitality. The business was successful; yet, four years into its existence, Oyemade and Akanno embarked on a curious venture\u2014to build a product for clients who could not afford their services.\n\nDisha, the product they built, launched in 2019\u2014by which time Blessing Abeng had joined them as co-founder and growth and marketing lead for the product.\n\nDisha gave users the tools with which to build their own one-page websites from the comfort of their smartphones, without worrying about technicalities such as learning to code or sorting out a domain name.\n\nConsidering that it costs at least $150 to build a website and purchasing power in Africa is low, Disha should have, as a matter of course, scaled. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t, and by a little over a year after its launch\u2014at the peak of the pandemic\u2014the co-founders announced that they were shutting down the product.\n\n\u201cHow can we help?\u201d\n\nAs soon as the announcement of the shutdown went up, the Disha team were inundated with calls and messages from baffled well wishers, all of them concerned and wondering what they could do to keep the platform alive. These early conversations were tepid, nothing was concrete\u2014until Flutterwave came into the picture offering a total buyout. The move by the payments giant, which earlier this year became a unicorn, is surprising as both companies operate in different spaces\u2014Flutterwave in payments and Disha in the creator industry. One wonders, then, what the play is here.\n\nIn a call with Flutterwave\u2019s head of product marketing, Onyedikachim Nwankwo, explained that while both companies may run different businesses, their company goals are aligned. \u201cFlutterwave is about creating endless possibilities for everyone, and Disha\u2019s goal of enabling creators achieve success and get paid for their work ties into Flutterwave\u2019s larger mission of helping small businesses thrive.\u201d\n\nNew look for Disha?\n\nIn a statement announcing the acquisition, Flutterwave says that the buyout will grow Disha\u2019s base by providing users with the ability to make, receive and withdraw money from their Disha accounts in over 150 currencies and 34 countries across the world. Despite the acquisition, however, Disha will remain an independent company. According to Nwankwo, \u201cIts original vision will be maintained.\u201d\n\nOyemade\u2014who is now Software and Architectural Lead at Flutterwave\u2014states that Disha coming under the Flutterwave family means its vision will be explored farther than earlier imagined. \u201cBefore now, when users created a Disha page and linked to a Flutterwave payment link, they got taken off the Disha site. Now, with the acquisition, users can create and accept their payments, all in one place.\u201d\n\nFlutterwave has always played in the creator space, having supported arts events like ArtX Lagos. Now, as the digital world opens up to creators getting paid for their work through innovations such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the payments giant is well positioned to help creators on Disha access global markets and further grow the global creator economy, which is estimated to be worth $100 billion.\n\nFlutterwave became a unicorn in March after reaching a $1 billion valuation, and the company may be set to triple that value in the future to the tune of $3 billion by acquiring more funding.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Exclusive: Meta\u2019s VP MEA and Turkey on Facebook\u2019s transition into the metaverse",
          "text": "At the end of October, social media giant, Facebook, changed its company to Meta. The announcement was made in an hour-long video that explained the company\u2019s decision to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse.\n\nLeading that work in Africa is Derya Matras, Vice President (VP), Middle East, Africa (MEA) and Turkey, Meta.\n\nPrior to her appointment as VP in August, Matras was the Managing Director for the MEA and Turkey region. Before that, she was Country Director for Facebook in Turkey for four years. Derya holds a BSc in electronics engineering from Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey, and an MBA from Columbia Business School.\n\nOver email, Matras talked to TechCabal about Facebook\u2019s rebrand to Meta and how it plans to make money from the metaverse and deal with the challenges that come with building it.\n\nHow is the Metaverse better than Facebook in its current form?\n\nWhen Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world\u2014and we are not turning away from these existing products. Those experiences are going to form a crucial part of the future metaverse ecosystem. The Facebook app is still going to be called Facebook.\n\nThe name Meta is a clear link to our vision for the metaverse. However, the metaverse will exist, whether Meta is there or not. So, Meta means us moving beyond 2D screens towards immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality, to help build the next evolution in social technology. This is a natural evolution for our company as social media and technology evolves.\n\nWhat demographic is the metaverse targeting in Africa?\n\nGiven all that the metaverse has to offer, there\u2019s a lot at stake in making sure its possibilities are open to everyone and not just people from traditionally underrepresented groups. An inclusive metaverse benefits everyone.\n\nIs Facebook building the metaverse because it\u2019s best positioned to build something that\u2019s inevitable?\n\nIn recent decades, technology has given people the power to connect and express themselves more naturally. We started with websites, then we got phones with cameras, and then the internet became more visual and mobile. As connections got faster, video became a richer way to share experiences. If you look back over time, we\u2019ve gone from desktop to web to mobile; from text to photos to video. Now we are looking at what comes next. The metaverse will feel like a hybrid of today\u2019s online social experiences, sometimes expanded into three dimensions or projected into the physical world. It\u2019s the next evolution in a long line of social technologies, and it\u2019s ushering in a new chapter for our company.\n\nIn Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s letter, he mentioned that the \u201cmetaverse will not be created by one company\u201d. Does this mean there\u2019ll be other metaverses outside of Facebook\u2019s metaverse and that they can all exist side by side without Facebook trying to be the only metaverse out there?\n\nThe metaverse isn\u2019t a single product that one company can build. Its success depends on building robust interoperability across services, so different companies\u2019 experiences can work together. And it won\u2019t be built overnight. Many of these products will only be fully realised in the next 10-15 years. While that\u2019s frustrating for those of us eager to dive right in, it gives us time to ask difficult questions about how they should be built. We\u2019ll work with experts in government, industry and academia to think through issues and opportunities in the metaverse.\n\nWe also need to involve human and civil rights communities from the start to ensure these technologies are built in a way that\u2019s inclusive and empowering.\n\nAcross Africa, we\u2019re supporting Africa No Filter, Electric South and Imisi 3D to support creators who have been pushing the boundaries of digital storytelling using immersive technology to amplify African voices.\n\nIs there the potential for other applications and programmes to be built in the metaverse\u2014similar to the blockchain.\n\nWe are at the very start of this. A lot of the technology and infrastructure still needs to be built. It will take at least 5 to 10 years for this vision of the metaverse to come to life. This pace is going to be dictated less by business interests and more by technological realities. Infrastructure needs to be transformed with new technologies, hardware and cooling specifications to be able to support a robust service. And new hardware still needs to be built, including things like hologram displays, projectors, batteries, radios, custom silicon chips, cameras, speakers, and sensors to map the world around you and more.\n\nWhy should Facebook build this? Why not another company?\n\nThis was an important step for us to take on our journey, and as we evolve to Meta, we hope this will better reflect where we are going as a company. Like all businesses, we continue to innovate so that we can bring value to people\u2019s lives.\n\nWe are a social company with investments in technology, like VR; and the metaverse is the next frontier of virtual digital connection\u2014so it\u2019s a natural evolution for our business. But it\u2019s important to reiterate that Meta is neither going to build, own, or run the metaverse on its own. This isn\u2019t going to be a Meta product.\n\nBuilding this will be more like how the internet came about rather than how one app was launched. That\u2019s why we will be collaborating at every stage with other companies, developers, experts, and policymakers. Principles of privacy, safety, and security need to be built in from the start. If we have the principles right, then as a society, we will be better at tackling new challenges with these technologies as they arise.\n\nThe transition to communication via the metaverse will face some challenges considering that it\u2019s not just another app on the mobile phone. What challenges does Facebook expect to encounter in rolling out the metaverse in Africa?\n\nNew innovations bring new challenges, and there\u2019s lots we need to figure out. But that\u2019s why we\u2019re starting this conversation early. We have to be responsible in our approach, and we intend to do that in a number of ways:\n\nNo surprises: In the past, the speed with which new technologies have emerged has sometimes left policymakers and regulators playing catch-up. We don\u2019t want this to happen this time around. A core principle is going to be \u201cdon\u2019t surprise people\u201d. That\u2019s why we are having this conversation out in the open, way in advance of all these technologies being launched.\n\nCollaboration: Partnering with independent experts and organisations will be a crucial part of how we navigate future challenges. We have already launched a two-year $50 million investment in programmes and external research, collaborating with industry partners, civil rights groups, governments, non-profits, and academic institutions to get input as we build these technologies responsibly. This is alongside being a founding member of the XR Association (XRA), which is committed to helping build responsible XR, which includes virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and future immersive technology.\n\nBuilt-in: While we will need to continue to get better at anticipating risks, we won\u2019t be able to see around every corner. That\u2019s why the principles of privacy, safety, and security need to be built in from the start.\n\nFacebook plans to spend ~$10 billion this year on the metaverse project\u2014and even more in the coming years. How will the company make money from this?\n\nIt\u2019s very early, and our focus today is more around building the foundational pieces for the metaverse, like VR, and bringing more people into those experiences. We outlined a few areas during Connect where we think there is an opportunity around commerce. We want to help provide tools for creators and developers so they can build a meaningful business in the metaverse because we think digital commerce will become increasingly important.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that investing in the metaverse also means additional resources invested in issues like safety and security. For example, the $10 billion investment in Reality Labs that we have already announced will include spending on research to better understand how we can responsibly tackle safety and integrity challenges in the metaverse.\n\nAnd, just like the rest of the internet, we expect that free things in the metaverse would likely be powered by ads while there would also be paid experiences that are ad-free.\n\nThis is a very long-term vision. It\u2019s going to take investment over many years before the metaverse reaches scale.\n\nLately, fingers have been pointed at Facebook for inciting civil unrest in Africa and being ill-equipped to staff its Africa offices to properly regulate posts. How does Facebook plan to build the metaverse responsibly?\n\nEvery day, our teams have to balance protecting the ability of billions of people to express themselves openly with the need to keep our platform a safe and positive place. We continue to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content. To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.\n\nWe are on track to spend over $5 billion on safety and security in 2021 alone and have 40,000 people working on these issues, including 15,000 people who review content in more than 70 languages.\n\nHow we build is as important as what we build. And we will be collaborating at every stage\u2014with other companies, developers, experts and policymakers\u2014to make sure that what we build is good for the world.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Ayobami Olajide and Ayobamigbe Teriba. Ayobami and Ayobamigbe work with Ingressive Capital, a venture capital firm that writes up to $400K cheques to early-stage startups.\n\nYou\u2019re a startup founder. You have overcome every self-doubt standing in the way of you launching out; you have invested painstaking hours in defining your idea and building out your solution. You are convinced your solution is what the market needs.\n\nDefinitely, without your solution in the market, the total user experience will be a notch lower. Now there\u2019s only so much you can do with your resources; you need some capital injection to supercharge your operations and expand into new markets. You are thinking of raising capital, but you\u2019re unsure of which is easier: meeting and convincing investors or getting a donkey to pass through a needle\u2019s eye?\n\nThe truth is, there has been an influx of investors and investment activity on the continent. Disrupt Africa reported a 68.4% jump in the number of investors in 2020 (370 investors) from 2019\u2019s reported number of 261 investors. This figure still doesn\u2019t capture in totality the number of angels involved in these deals. Three hundred and ninety-seven companies secured $701.5 million in investment in 2020. By the first half of 2021, African startups had raised $1.19 billion based on an index from Maxime Bayen. Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa and Kenya trapped most of the capital flowing into the continent. Long story short, the uptrend continues, meaning there\u2019s capital for you.\n\nHow can you partake of this money rain?\n\nWhat are you building?\n\nCapital activities always follow momentum, simply put, FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). Sometimes it may be geographical (Egypt, Latin America, etc). Other times, it\u2019s sector-based: Fintech has been of serious obsession with venture capitals (VCs) and even institutions. Investors typically depend on signals like increased liquidity events in a particular geography or sector to plug into the next big thing.\n\nFor startups operating in the middle of the current market obsession, like BNPL and other startups in the fintech spectrum, it may be relatively easier to raise money than others. Well, there are thematic funds that cater to startups in specific sectors.\n\nWho should you be talking to?\n\nAt the initial stage of your company, you should connect more with other founders building infrastructure for what you are building. Also, you need to prioritise taking feedback from customers you are serving in a bid to achieve product-market fit (PMF). Once PMF is achieved, your startup should begin to see some traction.\n\nAccelerators\n\nYou can then consider applying to startup accelerators. Startup accelerators like Y Combinator and TechStars have become incredible partners to the growth of the African startup ecosystem. Y Combinator, for example, boasts of backing up to 15 African startups per batch. Edtech startups can consider applying to Injini; fintechs can apply to the African Fintech Foundry. Of general interest can be Google for Startups, Antler, xx.team, and the like.\n\nEven if you can\u2019t get into an accelerator, you can simulate an accelerator experience for yourself by talking to founders building global solutions in your space. We see this with Shola Akinlade of Paystack\u2019s engagement with Stripe leading to its eventual acquisition for $200 million. Engaging global founders is important in the sense that it would help you develop a local playbook based on global perspectives. Also, it puts you on their radar for investment opportunities from their corporate vehicle or angel checks from the founder.\n\nVenture Capital Firms\n\nWhile a lot of founders defer to this as a first option, it is important to note that VC engagement must be precluded by traction recorded in your startup, e.g., Trade Depot and its founders scaled the venture to a good traction point. VCs are unlikely to invest in idea-stage startups. For example, Ingressive Capital\u2019s investment criteria only caters for post-launch and post-revenue startups. The same goes for a number of VC firms in the ecosystem.\n\nAs a founder, it is important to familiarise yourself with the theses of venture capital firms you want to approach. Here are those of Future Africa and Ingressive Capital. You may get pointers for fit between the VC firm and your startup through a thesis alignment check or examine previous round announcements to see the kind of firms and the stage that VC firm typically invests in.\n\nYou can also evaluate your startup-VC fit based on the value-add they bring to your company beyond money. You must ask if they offer portfolio company support, follow-on investments or referrals, strategic market access, etc.\n\nYou can get the attention of VCs through their online events majorly co-hosted by the general partners of the fund\u2014Is My Idea Fundable? with FirstCheck Africa, Let\u2019s Talk with Microtraction), Invest in the Future with Future Africa), and How I Got Funded (Ingressive Capital).\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHow should you, and other founders, navigate the capital sourcing process?\n\nInteracting with investors need not inspire fear, provided that you are ready. First, it is necessary to engage and interact with investors to create a human connection. Investors invest in persons they are familiar with.\n\nIt is important to get your pitch ready. Vary your pitch to include a one-liner, an elevator pitch and an extensive one, with the aid of a deck. Your investment pitch deck should address the pivotal questions of the problem, why the problem matters, your solution, and the market opportunity (total addressable market).\n\nFurthermore, your pitch should emphasise how your solution measures against current market players. To achieve this, dedicate a section to competitive analysis in terms of product offerings and pricing.\n\nInvestors are often regarded as catalysts not creators. They use capital to supercharge your operations and help you achieve scale. It is important to show traction you have recorded in terms of user growth and financials tracked month-on-month (MoM) or quarterly growth for startups less than a year or year-on-year for older startups.\n\nHave a data room where investors can easily access your financial records, financial forecasts, incorporation documents, product demos, team bio and pitch deck. Fundraising is often a nerve-racking period in a founder\u2019s journey but it can prove to be very definitive. Founders must be willing to go all out and give it all it takes. As the legendary Yoda said, \u201cDo or do not. There is no try.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It\u2019s called Kifta Technologies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKifta Technologies creates cutting-edge defence technology used by private entities and countries globally.\n\nIt makes smart glasses that can identify who you\u2019re looking at and even tell you if they\u2019re a wanted criminal.\n\nInterestingly, the company is the brainchild of a Nigerian textile merchant, Monsuru Anifowoshe.\n\nAfter several cases of stolen, intercepted and even vanished textile containers travelling from Lagos to Kano, Anifowoshe decided to build drones that\u2019ll make sure his containers arrived at their destinations safely.\n\nHardware is hard. However, Anifowoshe is making it work somehow. Kifta\u2019s first Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) prototype cost $450,000 to build, easily a pre-seed raise for a software company in Nigeria.\n\nEmmanuel Paul visited Kifta Technologies HQ and dished all about the gadgets here: Nigeria\u2019s Kifta Technologies produces smart glasses, other cutting edge defence tech for companies and countries worldwide.\n\nOr you can jump straight to the video here.\n\nEquity-free financing by Lendable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to funding, there are two ways to do it.

The former \u2014 a popular option in the startup space \u2014 is equity financing, while the latter is debt financing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLendable, a UK-based debt financing company, typically gives startups between $5 million and $10 million in debt financing. However, it doesn\u2019t finance startups in the idea stage, only those with a proven product that needs to kick things up a notch.\n\nLendable shared how they invest, some of their biggest funding stories, and missed opportunities with Techpoint Africa\u2019s Chimgozirim Nwokoma.\n\nYou can read all about it here: How UK-based debt financing company, Lendable, is providing equity-free financing for African startups.\n\nRabbit\u2019s $11m pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRabbit team. Sourece: TechCrunch\n\nThe grocery delivery business in Egypt seems to be getting a lot of attention lately. Last week, Breadfast and Appetito bagged $26 million and $2 million, respectively.\n\nThis week, it\u2019s RabbitMart, aka Rabbit\u2019s turn. The startup raised a massive pre-seed round of $11 million.\n\nWho invested? Per TechCrunch, the record-breaking pre-seed saw investments from Global Founders Capital and Goodwater Capital, among others.\n\nInterestingly, Rabbit was founded in June 2021 but just came out of stealth in October.\n\nUnlike players like Breadfast and Appetito, Rabbit says it will set itself apart by letting the market call the shots. According to its CEO, Ahmad Yousry, Rabbit, \u201cwe\u2019re going to let the market dictate what we sell. We\u2019re not limiting ourselves as a grocery player.\u201d\n\nThe company employs an Amazonesque system to fulfil orders in 20 minutes. It has a large warehouse in addition to fulfilment centres to speed up delivery.\n\nThe startup plans to add more fulfilment centres in major cities across Egypt over the next year.\n\nFlutterwave acquires Disha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, November 10, 2021, African payments startup, Flutterwave, announced its acquisition of Disha, a platform for creators to curate their content and receive payment.\n\nDisha, which has about 20,000 users globally, was on the brink of shutting down in February 2021 but told users in a tweet that it was \u201cconsidering new options for our company and will share an update as soon as we have made a resolution.\u201d\n\nFounded by former Cregital CEO, Evans Akanno, Rufus Oyemade and Blessing Abeng in 2019, most of the platform\u2019s users were based in the UK, US and Europe. However, it only generated a little over $1000 monthly, according to TechCrunch.\n\nWhat does this acquisition mean for Disha? Flutterwave will provide the platform with a new payout and collection solution to help users receive payments from audiences globally.\n\nWhile Flutterwave makes it easier for creators to receive payments, the acquisition is also a way to invest in a global creator market estimated at $104.2 billion.\n\nMFS Africa raises $100m Series C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDare Okoudjou (Founder and CEO, MFS Africa).

          "title": "Ghana mobile money revenue offers clues to MTN Nigeria\u2019s PSB expectation",
          "text": "The share of the mobile money market and the value of transactions controlled by MTN Ghana may have helped unravel a picture of what to expect from the Nigerian business when MTN kicks off its payment service bank (PSB) in the next six months.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria recently granted approval in principle to MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa to operate payment service banks (PSBs), with final approval to follow in six months, subject to specific requirements.\n\nControlling about 85 percent of the mobile money market in Ghana, the MTN subsidiary in the West African country raked in revenues of GH\u00a2 1.26 billion (N84.97billion) in the nine months through September 2021, according to its financial statements.\n\nWhile the regulations governing the Nigerian mobile money industry and the level of development in the country\u2019s financial services industry differ from what is available in Ghana, the MTN MoMo business in Ghana is similar to what MTN Nigeria will be able to do in Africa\u2019s largest economy. Although the Nigerian PSB licence doesn\u2019t give room for the operators to do as much as their Ghana counterparts.\n\nUnlike in Ghana, Nigeria\u2019s PSB operators cannot provide lending and insurance products. Also, their interest-bearing assets are limited to government and central bank-issued instruments. Lending, according to market analysts, can be a profitable add-on for digital payments providers and the restrictions on offering insurance and investment products could limit PSBs\u2019 ability to generate expected revenue.\n\nTo extrapolate the revenue MTN Nigeria is likely to generate from its mobile money business in Africa\u2019s most populous nation, BusinessDay proceeded to analyze the data by Tellimer, a global technology, information, and data provider, that surveyed mobile money penetration (defined as mobile money users as a percentage of total subscriber base) across various African telcos and markets.\n\nAs expected, Safaricom had the highest penetration (71percent), given its dominance and the positive trend for mobile money in Kenya. Airtel Africa had the lowest in Tellimer\u2019s sample, at 20percent, while MTN Group had a penetration of 24 percent overall; however, the rate is much higher in Ghana, at 42 percent, due to MTN Ghana\u2019s first-mover advantage.\n\nRead also: MTN Nigeria, Airtel PSBs to create 1m direct jobs\n\nWith an assumption that MTN Nigeria will potentially have 30 percent mobile money customer base from its c68.5 million total customers and its network effect of the already existing group of c560,000 agents, analysis of Tellimer\u2019s data shows, the telco giant revenue of cNGN131bn and NGN53bn EBITDA at an assumed EBITDA margin of 40 percent per annum. This is lower than Safaricom M-Pesa\u2019s incremental EBITDA of 47 percent.\n\nA lower margin was projected for MTN Nigeria due to the tougher competition in the country\u2019s financial services industry as the largest economy in Africa is already home to several payments-focused unicorns: Interswitch, Flutterwave, Opay and, most recently, Chipper Cash.\n\nThe projection was done using Tellimer\u2019s average revenue per user (ARPU) which ranges between $2.2 and $1.3. The data provider said it assumed ARPU of $1.3 for MTN Nigeria, below the group\u2019s average for H1 21 due to the competition in the market.\n\nThere is a high level of competition in the Nigerian payments sector, with banks developing agency banking and an array of fintechs servicing a wide range of clients, Ayobami Omole, Telecoms analyst at Tellimer said.\n\n\u201cThis means that it will be very difficult for MTN Nigeria to replicate M-Pesa\u2019s success in Kenya or that of its fellow MTN Group subsidiary in Ghana,\u201d Omole said.\n\nIn trying to win over market share, the Lagos-based analyst said there will be tough price competition which will limit potential revenue. \u201cAlthough, I must say that it is too early to conclude with certainty that the telcos won\u2019t make as much money given the higher population we have in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWhen MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa get the PSB licence in the next six months, the number of financial services providers under the new permit would increase to five. The central bank had in 2019 granted approvals to Hope PSB, Money Master PSB and 9PSB.\n\nEven though the PSBs are expected by the CBN guidelines to operate mostly in the rural areas and unbanked locations, targeting financially excluded persons, with not less than 25 percent financial service touchpoints in such rural areas, the operators\u2019 participation in the industry is expected to bring huge competition to the existing traditional banks.\n\nHaving the largest share of the market, MTN Nigeria is expected to rake in the biggest share of the revenue, even though the projection is not expected to match its success in other existing markets.\n\n\u201cThe mobile money service will be value accretive for MTN Nigeria because it means beyond voice and data, they can leverage on it to generate more revenue,\u201d Yinka Ademuwagun, Yinka Ademuwagun, investment management analyst at ValuAlliance Asset Mgt said.",

          "text": "Foreign investors can\u2019t get enough of Nigerian banks\u2019 Eurobonds but won\u2019t touch their stocks with a ten-foot pole.\n\nFirst, it was Access Bank and now United Bank for Africa (UBA) that has issued Eurobonds that ended up oversubscribed by foreign investors, a sign of strong investor confidence in Nigeria\u2019s top banks. But their stocks don\u2019t reflect the same level of confidence.\n\nUBA on November 11 disclosed that its $300 million Eurobond was oversubscribed 1.7 times as investors staked $520 million for the five-year bond which was issued at a coupon of 6.75 percent.\n\nA coupon payment on a bond is the annual interest payment that the bondholder receives from the bond\u2019s issue date until it matures.\n\nFor the UBA Eurobond, investors will receive 6.75 percent every year for five years. That\u2019s one of the cheapest coupons in emerging and frontier markets, yet another sign of investor confidence in the bank\u2019s financial health.\n\nThe issue attracted interest from global investors across Europe, the U.S., the Middle East, Asia and Africa, with orders from \u201cquality real money accounts,\u201d the bank declared in a statement announcing the successful transaction.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just UBA that has investors falling over one another to get a piece of its Eurobond.\n\nThe strong investor appetite for the Eurobonds of Nigerian banks already came to the fore when the country\u2019s biggest bank, Access, issued two $500 million Eurobonds in the space of three weeks.\n\nRead also: Appetite for Access Bank Eurobond rises with second oversubcription in 2 weeks\n\nThe first issue was three times oversubscribed with an order book of $1.6 billion, the largest order book ever for a Nigerian bank Eurobond transaction.\n\nThe five-year Eurobond was sold with a coupon of 6.125 percent, just as cheap as UBA\u2019s.\n\nThe second $500 million Eurobond was two times oversubscribed with total bids of $1 billion, having attracted wide investor interest as well.\n\nThe successful outings of Access and UBA are expected to spur other banks to sell Eurobonds ahead of the implementation of fresh regulatory guidelines (Basel III) that would require them to bolster their liquid assets to manage risks better.\n\nBut while investors are lapping up the Eurobonds of the banks, they are not as attracted to their stocks even though it delivers an even higher return \u201con paper\u201d.\n\nThe NGX banking index, which tracks the performance of stocks of listed banks\u2019, is down 0.95 percent this year, according to data from the NGX.\n\nUBA\u2019s stock is down 5.78 percent since the start of the year.\n\nGuaranty Trust Bank, another one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks, has also seen its share price decline by 15.30 percent in the period under review while Zenith Bank is down 3.23 percent.\n\nAccess Bank\u2019s share price has however gained 10 percent this year but that\u2019s not due to foreign investor activity rather it is a rally fueled by local fund managers.\n\nFirst Bank of Nigeria Holdings which makes up the list of Nigeria\u2019s five largest banks is another exception, with its shares up 60 percent amid an ownership tussle that has led to an aggressive buying of the lender\u2019s shares.\n\nThe lack of interest in banking stocks, once favourites of foreign investors, is due to challenges with accessing foreign exchange which has made many wary of holding naira assets.\n\nAt the last check, foreign equity investors had some $2 billion trapped in Nigeria as the central bank rations sales of scarce dollars following a slump in inflows of the greenback.\n\nAlthough dollar liquidity has been improving in recent times and is expected to improve even further as banks tap the Eurobond market, foreign investors remain largely on the sidelines.",

          "title": "Lagos streets turn outlets for fast food",
          "text": "In a bid to reach more customers and boost sales, fast food restaurants have turned Lagos streets into retail channels to sell their products in cheaper and smaller packs.\n\nAccording to a BusinessDay survey, restaurants in Lagos, Nigeria commercial hubs, such as Mr. Biggs, Chicken Republic, and Sweet Sensation, pioneers of the Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs) industry, have been using the \u2018Sell-on-the-Go\u2019 marketing strategy, by setting up express kiosks since 2019.\n\nThese kiosks \u2013 small, stand-alone booth-like structures placed in areas with high foot traffic \u2013 are used by these QSRs to reach their customers in an informal way. It is a type of direct, low-cost marketing strategy, according to experts.\n\nUchenna Uzo, consumer expert and faculty director at Lagos Business School, says many Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCGs) companies are packaging their products into smaller bits to make it easier for hawking, and restaurants are late in the game.\n\n\u201cThe power of Selling-on-the-Go makes you more accessible to the end consumer, it helps you to break down what you are offering in smaller sizes that people can afford.\u201d\n\nThe QSRs give immediate market information on the products people buy more of, in what size, package, and quantity do they want you to sell to them, price testing like what proportion, menu, a right price point that people are willing to pay for, etc., and it also helps in brand visibility, Uzo states.\n\nSimilarly, Ayorinde Akinloye, a consumer analyst at United Capital plc, notes that the QSRs are going retail as much as possible to offer more products and services, saying, \u201cThere is also the need to go beyond the mega outlets because it is expensive and difficult to run. It is cheaper to run small kiosks.\u201d\n\nTwo recessions witnessed in Nigeria in the last five years have led to high inflationary pressures, low purchasing power, and falling consumer income. Apart from the QSRs going into smaller formats, FMCGs now package their products into smaller sachets to target the larger segment of the economy.\n\nSome of the advantages of using kiosks are that it improves customer buying experience, increases customer base, reduces the cost of the business, increases efficiency, etc.\n\n\u201cA lot of consumer food service operators are now trying to explore the format of miniaturization. It is a tread of trying to increase transaction numbers and reduce cost,\u201d Cheng Fuller, a retail expert says.\n\nRead Also: UAC Restaurants increases retail offering to consumers, opens bakery in Lagos\n\nFuller advises that if restaurants want to penetrate neighborhoods and reach more consumers for profitability\u2019s sake, they should try to increase their outlets but only in smaller formats because the larger ones are expensive.\n\nIn other countries like the US, UK, and France, kiosks are well established but they are the self-ordering ones they use. With the help of technology, this type of kiosk allows customers to select and pay for products and services without the need for human interaction.\n\nBut kiosks in Nigeria do not use technology. What consumers do is to walk into them, look at the menu/price list, and place orders.\n\n\u201cOne way to meet customers is to give them the \u2018go-to service\u2019 that meets their needs. So, the more you increase your point of sales, the more sales you make,\u201d Wale Abioye, a manager at Sweet Sensation, says.\n\nHe further notes, \u201cIf you look at the demography of those who are patronizing these small kiosks, they are within the age group of 16- 30 something years. So, all brands have to go that direction.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Association of Fast Food and Confectioners of Nigerian (AFFCON), the Nigerian food industry is estimated to be worth over N1 trillion and is also one of the best-performing industries in the country.\n\nA recent report by Euromonitor International, a London-based market research company, predicts that 2021 might likely see some street stalls/kiosks strive to improve their customer service by offering more attractive outlets in an effort to better compete with limited-service restaurants.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, some restaurant chains are launching their own street stalls/kiosks as they seek new sources of revenue. Mr. Bigg\u2019s is particularly notable in this regard, as its Mr. Bigg\u2019s Express kiosks use a similar bold red and yellow frontage as its limited-service restaurants,\u201d the report states.\n\nAlthough it is an interesting opportunity, Uzo advises that QSRs should not copy each other or else their business could shut down.\n\nFuller also says the restaurants should not copy each other blindly, \u201cThey should do it based on their own unique financial constraints and benefits that would accrue to them.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 Lift Above Poverty Organization (LAPO), has entered into a partnership with the development Research and Project Centre (dRPC), an intermediary non-profit organization to advocate for an increase in budgetary allocation for women empowerment in Edo State.\n\nThe project tagged \u2018Partnership for Advancing Women in Economic Development (PAWED)\u2019, aims to increase the salience of women\u2019s economic empowerment within national and state government Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs), increase the salience and knowledge of effective policies, programs, and strategies to advance women\u2019s economic empowerment within communities of donors and national and state government\u2019s MDAs, with a primary focus on women\u2019s empowerment collectives, as well as women\u2019s economic empowerment amongst civil society and influential leaders and their commitment to support change that might be in opposition to cultural and social norms.\n\nUnder the partnership, LAPO will conduct advocacy to relevant stakeholders and follow up on inclusion of women economic empowerment in budgetary allocation, create a consortium of about nine to ten Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and train them to do likewise.\n\nThis collaboration which is in line with LAPO\u2019s vision of poverty alleviation and promoting gender inclusion will enable the organisation to facilitate and accelerate the economic empowerment of target beneficiaries in the state. The project will also improve staff capacities especially in the area of public sector engagement and advocacy.\n\nProject PAWED kicked off with an advocacy visit to the Edo State Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. The team which consists of LAPO and DRPC representatives was led by the Executive Director, LAPO, Dr. Honestus Ayobami Obadiora.\n\nGiven the project, the Executive Director, LAPO, recognized that Agriculture has an important role to play in sustainable Economic Empowerment of women. He noted that women are still being marginalized due to cultural restrictions or gender-based deprivations at the grass-root level.\n\nHe, therefore, solicited for improved access of women to farm inputs and credits, deliberate efforts by the Government to involve more women in production and educate women farmers on effective methods of agricultural processing, preservation, and storage. He also solicited more government support in the area of budgetary provision for agricultural infrastructure, farm settlement schemes, and increased financing for women farmers to enhance agricultural productivity and women\u2019s economic empowerment.\n\nResponding, the Permanent Secretary, Peter Aikhuomobhogbe confirmed that the state government and ministry are currently implementing several women-friendly policies and programmes including a minimum of 40% women inclusion in government interventions and appointments. He however promised to include more gender-inclusive projects in the budget when and where necessary.\n\nIn addition, the Director of Agricultural Services, Erhunmwonsere Sunday noted that women are being used as tools for resistance even to gender-inclusive programmes and policy implementations and that there is a need to interface with the cultural interference to ensure maximum reception of gender-inclusive projects. He called on LAPO for intensive community level advocacy and sensitizations to reduce these hindrances.\n\n...",

          "text": "The Kano High Court in Kano has awarded N50 million damages to the family of a detainee who was tortured to death in the cell of the defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).\n\nMustapha Muhammad, then 28 years old, died in SARS custody in Kano on September 14, 2019, his brother, Abdulkarim Muhammad, said in the affidavit filed along with the suit.\n\nDelivering judgement on Tuesday, the judge, Y.M. Ubale, granted nine out of the 10 prayers sought by the deceased person\u2019s family.\n\nAlthough the family sought N100 million damages, the judge awarded N50million compensation in their favour.\n\nThe judge also ruled that the act of concealing Mustapha\u2019s death from his family amounted to a deprivation of the deceased\u2019s religious rights, which as a Muslim, required that he be quickly buried.\n\n\u2018How my brother died\u2019\n\nMr Muhammad, in whose name the family of the deceased instituted the rights enforcement suit, had in his affidavit evidence told the court that his brother was tortured to death by SARS operatives in Kano.\n\nHe, however, said the SARS officers, in a bid to conceal the circumstances of the death, said that Mustapha died of stomachache and went further to procure a fake medical certificate to cover their tracks.\n\nMr Muhammad added that they falsely claimed that his brother died on September 27, 2019, contrary to the entry in the mortuary\u2019s records showing that he died earlier on September 14, 2019.\n\nAccording to him, days after the deceased person died, the police refused to inform any member and continued to receive money and food for the days till when the family got to know Muhammad had passed on.\n\nSuit\n\nThe family\u2019s lawyer, Abba Hikima, in October 2019, sued the Kano Police Command demanding N100 million damages over the killing of Muhammad.\n\nMr Hikima noted that SARS tortured Mr Muhammad to death and refused to inform the family.\n\nThe lawyer sought a declaration that the torture and killing of Muhammad by the police without recourse to the law amount to unlawful, arbitrary and unconstitutional contravention of the fundamental rights of the deceased guaranteed under sections 33 and 34 of the Nigerian constitution.\n\nHe also sought an order of the court to award the sum of N100,000,000 as damages payable by the police to the deceased through his family.\n\nThe federal government and the 36 state governors had, through the platform of the National Executive Council (NEC) chaired by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, agreed to set up panels of enquiry in the various states in the wake of the nationwide #EndSARS protests against police brutality in October 2020.\n\nBut Kano is among the five states in the North-west region, that did not inaugurate the #EndSARS panel probing rights violations perpetrated by SARS and other police units.",

          "title": "Osun Infrastructural Development under Governor Gboyega Oyetola \u2013 By Yinka Kolawole",
          "text": "One of the reasons Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola will remain in the good books of Osun people is the massive infrastructural development that the state has witnessed since the governor assumed mantle of leadership on November 27th, 2018.\n\nShortly after taking over as governor, Oyetola commissioned four projects as part of the activities marking the event. The commissioned projects were: upgraded Technical College, Oba Sir Adesoji Aderemi East Bypass, Obafemi Awolowo Motorway and Fakunle/Unity High School, all in Osogbo. Prominent among the projects is the Awolowo Motorway which is the dualisation of 40km Osogbo\u2013Ikirun\u2013Ila odo, Kwara State Boundary.\n\nThe road construction projects created over 5,000 direct jobs in the state and 12,000 indirect jobs for welders, plumbers and bricklayers, as well as food vendors.\n\nThough quite a number of projects are being undertaken by Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State, clearly, the flagship project, among the massive investment in upgrading of infrastructural amenities in the state in recent months, especially in Osogbo, the state capital, is the dualisation of the 45 kilometer Osogbo-Ikirun-Kwara State Boundary road.\n\nIt would be recalled that Federal Executive Council (FEC) recently approved NNPC\u2019s request to fix 21 federal roads at N621bn.\n\nHowever, Southern Nigeria got a total of 228.22km while rehabilitation and expansion of Lagos-Badagry Expressway (Agbara Junction-Nigeria/Benin border) in Lagos State. 62km is involved. Also Dualization of Ibadan-Ilorin road (Route A2) Section II in Oyo State (Oyo-Ogbomosho). 52km\n\nConsequently the people of Osun state have been urging Governor Gboyega Oyetola to make moves so that Osun could also benefit from NNPC\u2019s road projects. The corporation can, for instance, assist in the completion of Osogbo (Old-garage) to Ikirun junction road (20.5 kilometers) and Ikirun-Ila Odo- Kwara State Boundary road (16.55 kilometers).\n\nSince the state government signed a N17.8 billion contract agreement with SAMMYA Construction Company Limited for the Dualisation of the 45kilometer road, the project segmented into three of Osogbo-Dagbolu (International market) to Alamisi Market in Ikirun (9.52 kilometers); Osogbo (Old-garage) to Ikirun junction road (20.5 kilometers) and Ikirun-Ila Odo- Kwara State Boundary road (16.55 kilometers), the state government has been receiving a lot of commendations from both the people living in the state and road users using the ever busy Osogbo-IIorin road.\n\nIn line with the assurance given by the past government, that the project would be completed within 24 months, with the explanation that the project was not the usual direct contract award, but a Contractor-Financing transaction which came out of the confidence of the contractor in the previous administration and that the money for the contract would be repaid across 36 months after the completion of the project.\n\nStakeholders Comments\n\n\u201cThe Contractor, SAMMYA Construction Company Limited has not only demonstrated its capabilities in executing the project technical wise, but it has also displayed solid financial war chest that only few construction companies can boast of, thereby clearing any doubt about the success of the project,\u201d this is the submission of one Kunle Folorunsho who resides in Ota-Efun, Osogbo the state capital.\n\nChairman of the rulling All Progressive Congress in the State Prince Gboyega Famodun, who commented on the dualization Old Garage to Kwara State boundry opined that the contractor handling the project is very much on site and he is doing well.\n\nFamodun stated that there is tremendous achievements and the work is getting to the outskirts of Ikirun town already.\n\nHe, however, submitted that funding was a problem, saying it was affected by fund, but notwithstanding the government still doing its best.\n\nThe APC Chairman stressed that it was a federal government road but the State government took over, saying that the government of Oyetola would not relent in the completion of the project.\n\nAlso an APC stalwart, Mrs Adeola Egbedokun contended that the contractor handling the project has remained Committed to its speedy completion.\n\nShe urged the state government to make available everything that is needed to complete the project in the very shortest period.\n\nEqually a civil servant who does not want his name mentioned said the contractor handling the project should be mobilised with funds for its full completion.\n\nHe remarked that the contractor is doing a good job on site, but the state government to, as a matter of urgency, make adequate funding a available.\n\nCommendations.\n\nAbout eight years down the road since work commenced on the multi-billion naira project, opinions of people of the state about the performance of the contractor on the job has been nearly the same, with people praising the technical knowhow that has never been seen in the state before now being employed by SAMMYA in executing the project.\n\nFor Adeyi Olakunle, a resident, \u201cWe are celebrating an enduring legacy; a legacy that has been through storms, insult and many other challenges.\n\n\u201cOyetola has done what Awolowo aimed to do. The dream of Awolowo was to ensure every Nigerian is literate. All what Oyetola have been doing in fulfilment of Awolowo\u2019s dream. Aregbesola\u2019s behavior is similar to that of Awolowo. He has transformed Osun in spite of the financial and political challenges. I thank God for Oyetola,s success.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Prince Aderonmu Kunle said Oyetola is a great man, adding that his projects are unforgettable because they are developmental, adding that, \u201cOyetola is the first Nigerian politician to bring back history and honour Nigerian past leaders like Oba Aderemi and Awolowo. Oyetola has laid wonderful foundation for the progress of the state.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the project vis-a-viz the quality of technology being employed by SAMMYA, a trader at Igbona Market in Osogbo, Madam Sinatu Layoonu, said the contractor SAMMYA has proven he is capable of handling the job with the deployment of brand new machineries for road construction, adding that the workers handling the project have also demonstrated sense of dedication to the admiration of people of the state.\n\n\u201cMany of these machines that SAMMYA workers are using for the construction are new to many of us in Osogbo. They are not only new, but are also very appropriate, at least to some of us, who have never seen such huge construction machines, for the quality of work people of the state are expecting them to deliver. We in deed very grateful to the governor for given such a project to a serious company like SAMMYA,\u201d she said.\n\nSimilarly, a shop owner at Ayeitoro area of the state capital, Chuks Ezemokuai, noted that despite the rain, the uncompromising spirit of SAMMYA has ensured work progress steadily on the project and urged Governor Gboyega Oyetola to fund the project.\n\nHe added, \u201cwhen the company initially commenced on the project and the contractor, SAMMYA Construction started work on the road, I, like many others doubted the capability of the construction firm because we were not familiar with that name, but it was not long before we were all proved wrong and SAMMYA won our hearts with the quality of machines and the expertise of its men constructing the road. Indeed, we are pleased with SAMMYA.\u201d\n\nEconomic Boost\n\nSpeaking on how activities of the contractor handling Osogbo-Ila Odo Kwara Boundary road, SAMMYA, has aided businesses of petty traders, especially those that have their shops close to the construction site, Mrs. Beatrice Olawoore opined that many of petty traders have immensely benefitted from the on going project because the construction workers have been patronising them.\n\nShe added: \u201cmany of us petty traders have benefitted from the presence of SAMMYA\u2019s men on this road because they buy a lot from us ranging from snacks to drinks and stuffs like that, they have aided our business very well. I believe this is part of the gains of this on going construction work, at least if the construction is not going on here, these men will not be around here and our sales would have remained what it was\u201d.\n\nSimilarly, answering questions on how the construction work has improved youth empowerment, one of the drivers recruited by SAMMYA from the state, Yunus Adegboyega from Oba Ile, a town in Olorunda local government area of Osun state, explained: \u201cI got a hint that SAMMYA was employing drivers and I approached its office. That was how I got the job.\n\n\u201cThe salary is very attractive and there was training for all the workers. Besides empowering us financially, SAMMYA is also exposing us to skills in our various areas that are very new to many of us. The number of youths from Osun state that have been employed into various departments and sections of the company since the work began on the road is well over 500\u201d.\n\nCorroborating views of Adegboyega on empowerment, but on a general note, a construction materials supplier based in Osogbo, Francis Fadoyin commended SAMMYA for sourcing construction materials from with in the state.\n\nFadoyin said business of many construction materials dealers have improved greatly since SAMMYA commenced work in the state capital.\n\n\u201cTrue to the promise of the chairman of the company, when the contract was awarded that, construction materials for the project would besourced locally; the workers are actually sourcing materials from people dealing in the materials in the state. We can only hope this will be sustained and other contractors working on projects within the state will emulate SAMMYA and buy materials from people dealing in them from the state\u201d.\n\nCounting the Gains\n\nWhile counting the gains of Osun massive investment in infrastructural development vis-a-viz the construction of Osogbo-Ila Odo-Kwara Boundary road, a labour leader in the state, Comrade Kazeem Oladepo challenged administrators in the country to borrow a leaf, not only from the model adopted to finance the project, but also the sheer dedication to duties which he said the contractor has shown in making sure that the work is done to specifications.\n\nSpeaking further, the employee of state Ministry of Health, added that the construction of the road has demonstrated the readiness of government to place the Osun in the league of developed states and the choice of SAMMYA, a pointer to the resolve of Oyetola,s administration to permanently etch his name in the minds of people in the state as a governor that lift the state to enviable heights in terms of infrastructural development.\n\nA Resident in Ikirun One Kolawole Ajani commended both state government and SAMMYA Construction Limited for making the project a good reference point for the development-driven administrators in the country.\n\nFor the monarch, the dream to transform the state\u2019s infrastructural amenities as conceived by the then governor was actually being given a life by the contractor handling the project, charging all those involved in the project to ensure that the same vigor with which they commenced the work with is retained throughout the duration of the project.\n\nIn his own reaction, the founder of Sword of Spirit Ministry, Eweta, Pastor Israel Wemimo said the major gain the state is recording through the ongoing Osogbo-Kwara Boundary project is in the area of empowerment.\n\nHe declared that those youths in Ikirun and adjoining communities, who could not be absorbed by the contracting firm handling the work at the moment, eagerly awaits when the contractor will shift full attention to the part of the project that traverses the community.\n\nSimilar to the view expressed by this clergy man is the one held by Chief Tadese Esuleke of Oloba Compound, Osogbo, who was of the opinion that, besides giving the state a facelift, employment opportunities created through the project and the perceived readiness of the contractor, who he said was not planning to use and dump those employed, but in addition, empower them by given them training in specific vocations, is simply the continuation of youth empowerment efforts of the previous government.\n\nHe said: \u201cMany youths in the state, who could not get opportunity in OYES are beginning to turn their attention to SAMMYA, the contractor working on Osogbo-Kwara Boundary road. Honestly, this work is assisting in mopping our streets of these hitherto idle young men. You can call it an indirect way by government and its partner the contractor to empower young ones.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on behalf of students\u2019 movement in the state, a former Osun State Chairman of the Joint Campus Committee (JCC) of National Association Nigerian Students (NANS), Comrade Bosede Safety said: \u201cPeople are saying youth empowerment is one of the gains recorded by the state through the project of Osogbo-Kwara Boundary road but beyond that fact, I think the preservation of lives and properties of the people that will use that road. The rate of accident on that road before this construction work is relatively high. Lives and properties have been lost and that will have to stop now with the expansion and reconstruction work going on.\u201d\n\nAlso Commenting on Osogbo \u2013 Ila Odo,the Commissioner for Works and Transport Remi Omowaye said the state government had provided resources that are needed to do the dual road to Ikirun from where the last administration stopped. So we are not abandoning any projects.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget we are three years in office. Some of these projects were awarded 2012/2013 so, the fact that they are yet to be completed are not our fault but we ensure some things are being done. If you go there now you will see that the contractors are there.\u201d",
          "summary": "One of the reasons Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola will remain in the good books of Osun people is the massive infrastructural development that the state has witnessed since the governor assumed mantle of leadership on November 27th, 2018.\nShortly after taking over as governor, Oyetola commissioned four projects as part of the activities marking the event.\nThe road construction projects created over 5,000 direct jobs in the state and 12,000 indirect jobs for welders, plumbers and bricklayers, as well as food vendors.\n52kmConsequently the people of Osun state have been urging Governor Gboyega Oyetola to make moves so that Osun could also benefit from NNPC\u2019s road projects.\nThe rate of accident on that road before this construction work is relatively high.",

I am focusing on problem solving, if it is all women that will get it done, that\u2019s fine,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor instance, when I was CBN Governor, a lot of assignments that required trust and integrity, i gave them to women and they never disappointed.\n\n\u201cIn Anambra, we don\u2019t discriminate.

          "text": "Zipline, the global leader in instant logistics, has successfully completed the first long-range drone delivery of both authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines requiring ultra-cold-chain in Ghana.\n\nThis achievement is attributed to the collaboration of Zipline, Pfizer and BioNTech, which paved the way for automated, on-demand delivery of first mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in Ghana.\n\nIn addition to financial support for the pilot program, Pfizer and BioNTech provided technical assistance and know-how specific to the management and storage of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine at -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C.\n\nIn a press statement, made available to LEADERSHIP, the co-founder and CEO of Zipline, Keller Rinaudo said, delivery to people in remote and hard-to-reach places is a primary challenge for global vaccination, adding that, \u201cIn partnership with Pfizer and BioNTech, we have created a solution to address this potential pain point head on. Together, we are working to help transform vaccine distribution into a more effective, equitable process.\u201d\n\nMaking COVID-19 vaccines accessible to an entire country\u2019s population presents logistical challenges for many governments and healthcare organizations, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, says Rinaudo, even as Zipline is helping to address these challenges by implementing an end-to-end distribution model that safely delivers any COVID-19 vaccine to all corners of a country through its autonomous aircraft.\n\nChief sustainability officer and senior vice president, Global Health and Social Impact, Pfizer Inc, Caroline Roan said Pfizer has a history of investing with partners to improve access to medicines and vaccines in the most remote areas of the world.\n\n\u201cWe are proud of this collaboration with Zipline to implement breakthrough solutions that help advance equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, particularly for hard to reach and underserved populations,\u201d Roan added.\n\nPfizer Cluster Lead, West Africa, Olayinka Subair said, the company\u2019s focus is always on the patients as It deploys resources to bring treatments that extend and significantly improve their lives.\n\n\u201cWe consistently seek to collaborate with stakeholders to support and expand access to reliable, affordable health care in communities all around. At this time of extraordinary focus on science and dedication to patients, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, like all COVID-19 vaccines on the market, requires storage and transportation in controlled temperature conditions. Distributing these types of products rapidly and at national scale has no precedent in modern public health. Pfizer-BioNTech and Zipline have successfully tested the end-to-end supply chain from Pfizer\u2019s Puurs facility in Belgium to a last-mile health post in rural Ghana.\n\n\u201cBy uniting transformational technology, cutting-edge science and indomitable human spirit, Pfizer is pioneering biopharmaceutical innovations to do more than just treat difficult diseases, we are opening new worlds of medical possibilities in support of our purpose: Breakthroughs that change patients\u2019 lives. And we\u2019re applying equal parts intelligence, passion and ingenuity to ensure these breakthroughs are accessible to all,\u201d Subair said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nZipline, Pfizer and BioNTech tested and validated the end-to-end model for delivery of mRNA vaccines with ultra-cold-chain requirements, and Zipline will now utilize it to distribute Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccines, as well as COVID-19 vaccines from all manufacturers, to regions across Ghana.\n\nThe companies share a goal to help ensure the safe and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Pfizer and BioNTech have committed two billion doses of their COVID-19 vaccine to low- and middle-income countries through 2022 and are actively working on collaborating with both public and private organizations to accelerate the vaccine rollout worldwide.\n\nTo date, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has reached 2 billion vaccines to 155 countries and territories in every region of the world, including through its agreement with COVAX.\n\nNearly 175,000 COVID-19 vaccines from multiple manufacturers have been distributed across Ghana to-date by Zipline, the first company to do so through an autonomous aircraft at national scale. Zipline plans to distribute millions more as supply becomes available. Through this partnership, Pfizer, BioNTech and Zipline have brought together their expertise and capabilities to help advance more equitable vaccine distribution.",

          "text": "Mr Tordue Salem, a missing Vanguard reporter, has been discovered dead in Abuja.\n\nEven when the police caught a man who pretended to be a kidnapper in order to extort money from the late journalist\u2019s family,\n\nAs of Thursday evening, no information on the recovery of his remains has been disclosed.\n\nThe late Benue-born journalist was last seen on Wednesday, October 13th, 2021, while covering the National Assembly\u2019s lower legislative chamber.\n\nHe was believed to have left work in a public cab with a female relative for B.J\u2019s garden, which is located near the Total filling station, opposite Force headquarters.\n\nHe allegedly signaled a cab for the lady who had left before him from the garden, informing her that he was going to Area 8, Garki. He was never seen again until his body was discovered on Thursday.\n\nAccording to Vanguard, the Police Intelligence Response Team, or IRT, went into action on October 16th after the matter of the late Tordue\u2019s inexplicable disappearance was reported to it.\n\nA suspect, identified as Prince Enyenihi, 25, was arrested in an effort to extort the family and others who were not named immediately, according to reports.\n\nOn October 26, 2021, the suspect, named as Prince Enyenihi, 25, contacted Mrs Salem through text message with a hidden number, asking N100 million in ransom for her husband\u2019s release. \u201cIf you don\u2019t pay, Tordue will be killed in seven days,\u201d the text message said. Call this number for further details.\u201d The text message also included an account number to which the funds should be deposited.\n\nThis was followed the next day by a call to Salem\u2019s wife from an unknown number. Mrs Salem wanted to talk with her husband first to make sure he was still alive before starting the negotiations. The caller, on the other hand, handed the phone to someone who tried to play along.\n\nWhen she realized the voice wasn\u2019t her husband\u2019s, she asked the stranger to say their daughter\u2019s name and birth date, a request that was received with total silence on the other end.\n\nMrs Salem received another call from an unknown number later that evening, asking if her husband had been released. The perplexed woman was alleged to have inquired as to why the caller\u2019s phone number was hidden.\n\nOn October 27, another SMS arrived on a bulk text messaging platform, demanding that the family pay the N100 million ransom by the next day, or Salem would be killed.\n\nThe police responded first, decrypting the phone number that had been phoned and tracing its owner to a woman in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\n\nDuring questioning, however, the owner of Joy Skin Care denied any wrongdoing, claiming instead that a certain number had been phoning her line since October 26, 2021.\n\nWhen security agents checked the number, they determined it was the same as the one used to contact Mrs Salem, and Prince Enyenihi was finally apprehended on November 5th, 2021.\n\nAccording to security operatives\u2019 first inquiry, Prince Enyenihi lived next door to the beautician.\n\nDuring questioning, he said that he learned of the Vanguard reporter\u2019s abduction via a leaflet that went viral on social media and included Mrs Salem\u2019s phone number as the person to call if discovered.\n\nThe suspect further alleged that he sent the text messages without his female neighbor\u2019s knowledge, and that he obtained her phone number and account information from her Facebook page.\n\nHe said, \u201cI knew the family wouldn\u2019t pay the money. I used the owner of Joy beauty skin care \u2018s account details in order to punish her for always talking to me anyhow.\u201d\n\nThe Police couldn\u2019t be reached immediately.",

          "title": "Nigeria Correctional Centres: 15 jailbreaks occur in 8 years, 3,646 inmates still on the run",
          "text": "Close to 4,000 inmates that escaped from Nigerian correctional centres between 2013 and this year are yet to be rearrested, our investigations have revealed.\n\nOf the 3,646 inmates yet to be recaptured in the last three years, about half of the fleeing criminals were illegally set free in three major jailbreaks this year(2021) alone.\n\nBlueprint further gathered that a total of 6,407 inmates in 15 correctional centres across the country regained unauthorised freedom following breach of security by unknown gunmen, including some suspected members of Boko Haram and armed robbers.\n\nHowever, the minister put the figure of those inmates still on the run at 3,412.\n\nMode of attacks\n\nThe miscreants usually attack the centres with sophisticated weapons, including machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and improvised explosive devices as evident in the Owerri and Benin City attacks where they assaulted poorly armed security personnel and freed large numbers of inmates serving various terms at the custodial centres.\n\nBlueprint also observed that hoodlums had taken advantage of the #ENDSARS protest to launch severe attacks on some dismally manned correctional centres such as the Benin City and Owerri facilities where sundry mass assault weapons were freely deployed to set free inmates and subsequently looted stores of provisions and few weapons available.\n\nThese breakages also culminated in the death of 30 persons including inmates and correctional officials while no fewer than 200 others were either severely injured or sustained minor injuries which nonetheless were serious enough to require weeks of medical attention.\n\nTimelines of jailbreaks\n\nAvailable records revealed the jailbreaks at different times across the country.\n\nFor instance, at the Shagamu minimum correctional centre, Ogun state, attacked January 4, 2013 by hoodlums, resulted in the escape of 20 inmates and left several officials and others injured.\n\nOnly about four escapees were said to have been rearrested by the armed squad of the Service.\n\nSecurity at the Olokuta Medium Security Centre in Akure, Ondo state was severely breached on the 30th of June 2013.\n\nNo fewer than 175 inmates escaped while two persons died and one warder was severely injured. A paltry 54 escapees were rearrested.\n\nIt was the turn of the Kirikiri Medium Prison Correctional Centre, Lagos state on 10th of October, 2014.\n\nThough it was largely unsuccessful, nonetheless, 20 inmates lost their lives while 80 others were injured and 12 escaped from the facility.\n\nSimilarly, on the 2nd of November, 2014, the Koto-Karfe Correctional Centre in Kogi state, came under assault allegedly by Boko Haram elements.\n\nConsequently, 144 inmates broke free while one inmate was killed. Only 45 of the fleeing inmates were rearrested.\n\nSecurity at the Ado Ekiti Correctional Centre, Ekiti state was breached on the 30th of November 2014, during which an official of the centre was killed, while 341 prisoners escaped from the facility. Officials said about 77 inmates were recaptured.\n\nThen came the Minna, Niger state incident in December 2014, when three unknown gunmen attacked and freed 270 inmates. A security officer was severely injured.\n\nTwice in 2016, the Kuje Medium Security Centre, FCT Abuja was assaulted. In fact, the first instance led to the Kuje centre chief being relieved of his duty by the Controller General of the Nigerian Correctional Centre Service (NCoS).\n\nThirteen inmates had on July 29, 2016 escaped during a jailbreak at the Koton-Karfe Correctional Centre in Kogi state. The centre seems to have a notoriety for jailbreaks as it has had three incidents, two of which were this year alone.\n\nThe Nsukka Correctional Centre in Enugu state took its turn on the 9th of August, 2016, when inmates organised themselves and broke out of their cells and 15 successfully disappeared into thin air.\n\nAgain, on June 3, 2018, the Medium Security Correctional Centre in the Tunga area of Minna, Niger state joined the train as more than 200 inmates gained illegal freedom and only 28 were rearrested.\n\nLike Lagos and Kuje centres, the Edo centre has experienced jailbreaks and repeated attempts to effect forced freedom for inmates.\n\nFirst, on the 19th of October, 2020, under the disguise of ENDSARs protesters, miscreants took advantage to launch a damaging attack on the Benin City and Oko centres illegally setting free 1,993 inmates, the highest of such numbers in history in Nigeria.\n\nSubsequently, two other attempts were made to secure unauthorised freedom for inmates, but they ended futile.\n\nOn 5 April 2021, Owerri centre, Imo state was forcefully thrown open allegedly by members of the Eastern Security Network (ESW) who succeeded in setting free 1,844 inmates, and burnt down other police facilities within the vicinity of the prison. Authorities said the attack experienced the most aggressive use of machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and improvised explosive devices, among others in the history jailbreak encounter.\n\nOn the 14th of September this year, the facility in Kabba, Kogi state, came under attack and many inmates got out, though 144 were recaptured.\n\nThis was climaxed on the 22nd of October when 1000 inmates at the Abolongo Correctional Centre in Ibadan broke loose and escaped from the facility.\n\nFG speaks\n\nSpeaking on the issue and related ones at a media parley in Abuja Thursday, Minister of Interior Rauf Aregbesola assured the escapees would be rearrested.\n\nHe said out of the 4,369 inmates that have escaped from correctional centres due to attacks on the facilities, only 984 were recaptured.\n\nSpeaking at a briefing organised by the Presidential Media Team at the Presidential Villa in Abuja, the minister said 3,906 inmates were still on the run.\n\nThe minister said it would be difficult for the inmates that escaped to run away from the long arm of the law, stressing that the biometrics of all inmates in the country had been captured.\n\n\u201cHow long can they continue to run from the state? The state is a patient bird. You can run but you can never hide. We have their biometrics. Whenever and wherever they appear to transact any business, their cover will be blown.\n\n\u201cI will like to inform Nigerians that we have captured the biometric information of all inmates in the facilities of NCoS working in partnership with the Nigerian Identity Management Commission (NIMC).\n\n\u201cTherefore, we have the capacity and are tracking all escapees from our facilities. In addition, we are working with and have shared the details of escapees with INTERPOL to check the risks of cross border movements,\u201d he said.\n\nOn reformation and rehabilitation of the inmates, the minister said there were 465 inmates running different degree programmes at the National Open University of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere are various ongoing reformation and education programmes for inmates in our custodial facilities. The Service, in partnership with the National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN), has increased the number of Study Centres to 10 across Correctional formations (Abeokuta, Anambra, Enugu, Kaduna, Keffi, Kuje, Lafia, Lagos, Port Harcourt, and Umuahia).\n\n\u201cThere are currently about 465 inmates running various Degree programmes, 85 of the inmates are running Post \u2013 Graduate Degree programs, while four are running PhD programmes within the custodial facilities.\n\n\u201cA total of 560 inmates have been enrolled for WAEC/NECO Examinations and 2,300 for Adult Literacy Classes in several Custodial Centers. Additional Borstal Training Institutions for young offenders, male and female, are to be established in each State of the Federation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister assured Nigerians that a ministerial task force would soon be inaugurated to enforce the re-arrest of all escapees and their collaborators.\n\nWhy jailbreaks?\n\nAccording to official data, Nigerian correctional centres across the country currently contain as many as 70,000 inmates, with only about 20,000 or 27% of them convicted.\n\nIn 2019, the interior minister said: \u201cClose to 90 per cent of the awaiting trial inmates are violators of state laws and so are essentially the responsibility of the various state governments.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to carry them along in devising strategies to decongest the facilities. In six months, this will be put behind us.\u201d\n\nIn other words, congestion of the facilities is largely caused by states who have failed to expedite action to pre-trial and other cases.\n\nHow it usually happens\n\nOn how the jailbreaks happen, NCoS spokesperson, Francis Enobore said: \u201cThe attacks usually occurred where we have a large number of awaiting trial persons. In the Owerri attack, where we have over 1,800 inmates, 1,693 inmates are awaiting trial.\n\n\u201cIn the Kabba incident, we have 294 persons in custody out of which 224 are awaiting trial. The push to get agitated and look for alternative means of leaving the facilities is higher where we have more awaiting trial inmates.\u201d\n\nParents, traditional rulers returning escaped inmates\n\nHowever, the NCoS said parents and some traditional rulers have voluntarily returned their wards who escaped following attacks on the facilities, to the various custodial centres.\n\nAlthough Mr Enobore was not forthcoming with the official figures of escaped inmates yet to be rearrested and returned to custody Thursday, he assured that the agency has a proper record of the escapees from the recent attacks.\n\n\u201cWe have all their records intact. We have been able to advance the course of modern record keeping of our inmates. We have their photographs and biometrics. That was the reason pictures of inmates that illegally broke free from the Abolongo centre were publicised to alert the public.\n\n\u201cAlso, we initiated a nationwide campaign urging the escapees to voluntarily return to their terms, and equally appealed to their close associates against compromise or colluding with the fleeing inmates by hiding them from the law.\n\n\u201cWe did mention that since we have their biometrics, we are going to hunt each and every one of them to the last man standing. And as a matter of fact, if you are found to have provided safe haven for any escapee, of course, you have contravened the law of the country and would accordingly be prosecuted.\n\n\u201cThe campaign has been successful. Parents have been returning their wards, traditional rulers, counsels; friends equally have been complying and assisting to return escapees.\u201d\n\n\u2018FG building more facilities\u2019\n\nOn ways out, the NCoS said six ultra-modern special custodial centres that would exclusively be used to house high-profile criminals were under construction across the six geo-political zones.\n\nThe special centres would include court premises, anti-aggression security posts with sophisticated security equipment and many more.\n\nThe agency spokesman said when completed and put to use, these facilities would prevent the incessant assault on the correctional centres experienced in recent times. \u201cThe ultra-modern capacity facilities of three thousand capacity in each of the six geo-political zones across the country is built to accommodate issues surrounding high profile criminals and how to keep them safe.\n\n\u201cHow do you protect the facilities from aggression? How do you take them to court for those awaiting trial? In fact, the question of taking them to court doesn\u2019t even arise because as it is structured, we are expected to have court premises within the complex to reduce the drudgery and the risk involved in some of these exercises for which you are aware. Sometimes, we suffer attacks on the way and our men are killed by some of these criminals who forcefully released their members,\u201d he further added.\n\nBesides, the agency said other custodial centres were being upgraded and equipped in terms of capacity and humane environment for the inmates.\n\nCases of invalid investigation\n\nCommenting on the development, a former Commissioner of Police and now special adviser to the Oyo state governor on security, Mr Fatai Owoseni, said: \u201cJailbreak is a well-coordinated and organised crime which does not happen randomly but requires a lot of efforts and combined forces and of course aided by insider information from the inmates and perhaps some criminal elements within as well.\n\n\u201cPrevious investigations into the causes of jailbreaks have yielded no results. Sadly, most of the time, officials tended to be on the defensive and would rather not come clear with reports that would implicate officials of correctional centres.\u201d\n\nCorroborating Owoseni\u2019s position, another security expert and former director, Department of State Services, Mr Mike Ejiofor, said: \u201cThe Service does not have the means to strengthen access control. And because these facilities are vulnerable, criminals explore their vulnerability. There must be a major upgrade of our correctional facilities. The facilities are overcrowded.\n\n\u201cThere is a need to review the judicial process by speeding up trials or releasing those who have no case to answer on bail. The Service does not even have enough manpower and the officials are not well armed to curtail the attacks.\u201d\n\nAlso, a guidance and counselling expert, Mrs Faith Okosun, advised the government to make \u201cweekly character reordering and purposeful skill acquisition mandatory to all inmates, stressing that it would give every inmate purpose and the drive to hope for meaningful life after serving their term.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nThe Nigeria Police Thursday paraded 14 suspects involved in the invasion of the Abuja residence of a Supreme Court Justice, Mary Odili.\n\nThe suspects include the whistle blower, prayer warrior and herbalist, Ali Umar Ibrahim; the mastermind-one CSP Lawrence Ajojo-a fake police officer; a contributing editor with THISDAY Newspaper, Stanley Nkwazema; lawyers and banker among others.\n\nBut the management of THISDAY has disowned Nkwazema, saying he resigned from his job as a sports correspondent some 15 years ago.\n\nParading the suspects at the Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID) Headquarters, Area 10, Abuja, Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO), CP Frank Mba, said seven of the suspects, including two soldiers, were still at large.\n\nHe said the suspects, who came from different professional backgrounds, were members of a criminal syndicate that specialises in operating as law enforcement officers.\n\nMba noted that the criminals were loose cannons and document forgers who were on their own and not hired by any personnel of the Ministry of Justice as they claimed.\n\nCP Mba further said the suspects conspired to raid the residence following information that the Supreme Court Justice was keeping a large sum of money in foreign currencies.\n\nHe commended the resistance by the security personnel deployed to the Odili residence for not allowing the suspects access to the premises, stating that it would have been a great embarrassment to the nation before the international community if the operation had succeeded.\n\nFielding questions from journalists, Ajodo, who was found to be with a police identity card with the rank of CPS in his name as well as an identity card of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) also in his name and signed by the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), confessed that he was not a policeman and does not work with the EFCC.\n\nHe also confessed to have forged the signature of the Attorney General, adding that he was not deployed on the mission to raid Odili\u2019s residence by Malami.\n\n\u201cI work for Malami as a consultant of recoveries, there are five of us. I was given 18 accounts to recover, though Malami did not send me to this mission. I am a banking expert with specialty in finance and forensic.\u201d\n\nAjodo also claimed that there was a mix-up during the raid, stating that the search warrant was supposed to be for No 9 but it read No 7.\n\nHe said they quickly revoked the warrant as soon as they noticed the mix-up.\n\nHowever, the whistleblower, Ibrahim, who claimed he was contacted by Odili\u2019s Godson, said he had some prayer sessions in the residence which revealed there was money in the JSC\u2019s house, and even swore to an affidavit to that effect at the EFCC office.\n\nHe claimed that Ajodo diverted his affidavit to the Ministry of Justice and he had led the team on a surveillance to Odili\u2019s residence before the raid.\n\n\u201cI am the whistle blower and I swore to an affidavit that there was millions of money stashed in that house. I was introduced as an Islamic prayer warrior to the Godson of Justice Odili and I did prayer there on October 13. I prayed to know if the story that there was money in the house was true.\n\n\u201cSo after the prayers, I decided to go through the EFCC as a formal channel and I was interviewed and interrogated. However, I ended up in the Ministry of Justice because Ajodo told me it was the same thing that EFCC is under Ministry of Justice.\n\n\u201cHe asked to go for surveillance before the raid. I took him to the address and directed them to Justice Odili\u2019s house,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, the journalist claimed he was following a lead on recovery of asset brought to him by one of the suspects, Barrister Alex Onyekwere.\n\nAccording to Nkwazema, who claimed he was a contributing editor with THISDAY Newspapers, he followed the lead for three days before the raid.\n\nHe admitted joining the team for the raid but claimed he did not enter the premises.\n\nAsked why he did not speak up or file a report based on his findings despite the outcry that followed the raid, especially after the security agencies denied involvement but waited five days before responding to invitation by the FCID, the journalist said he was at the FCID on his own volition.\n\nNkwazema not one of us \u2013 THISDAY\n\nMeanwhile, THISDAY Newspapers has disowned Nkwazema, saying he pulled out of the company some 15 years ago.\n\nThe position was contained in a disclaimer issued the company\u2019s Managing Editor (print and digital), Bolaji Adebiyi in Abuja Thursday.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe attention of the management of THISDAY NEWSPAPERS has been drawn to the news making the rounds that Mr. Stanley Nkwazema, one of those suspected to have invaded the home of Justice Mary Odili claimed to be a staff and Contributing Editor of THISDAY.\n\n\u201cContrary to his claim, Mr. Nkwazema is neither a Staff of THISDAY nor a Contributing Editor. He was a Sports Correspondent and resigned more than 15 years ago.\n\n\u201cHowever, occasionally, he, like hundreds of other readers of the newspaper, sends for publication articles and analyses and is usually obliged, a privilege THISDAY gives to some of its ex-staff. That does not in any way make him a staff and contributing Editor of THISDAY.\n\n\u201cSince his resignation, THISDAY had at no time contracted Mr. Nkwazema to investigate any story, and we know nothing of his alleged investigation of a story leading to the raid of the residence of Hon. Justice Odili.\n\n\u201cThe police authorities and the general public should, therefore, note that Mr. Nkwazema, whatever may be his involvement in this matter, was not acting on behalf of THISDAY in any shape or form.\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nFourteen persons have been arrested in connection with the siege on Justice Mary Odili\u2019s apartment in Abuja, the police said on Thursday.\n\nSome of the suspects include a fake Chief Superintendent of Police, Lawrence Ajodo; a contributing editor with one of the national dailies, Stanley Nkwazema, and an Islamic scholar.\n\nThe Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, paraded the suspects in Abuja and explained that their arrest followed a swift investigation by the police.\n\nAt least ten more persons linked with the incident including two military personnel are at large, the police spokesman added.\n\nREAD ALSO: Wike Gives FG 48-Hour Ultimatum To Probe Raid On Justice Odili\u2019s Residence\n\nThe arrest is the latest in a series of events since some armed men laid siege on Justice Odili\u2019s apartment in Maitama.\n\nThe incident drew criticisms from many quarters including the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, and human rights lawyer, Femi Falana, among others.\n\nWike had given the Federal Government a 48-hour ultimatum to get the perpetrators and claimed that the incident was an assassination attempt.\n\n\u201cWe think that there is an attempt to assassinate Justice Mary Odili, the husband and members of the family, there are no two ways about it. If they had succeeded, all the Federal Government would have told us (is that) we will get to the bottom of the matter because that has always been the normal language,\u201d Wike said during a press conference in Abuja on October 31.\n\n\u201cThe issue here has nothing to do with the Attorney General, we are happy he said he is not aware. We said, okay since you are not aware, we are giving you 48 hours to tell us who is responsible.\u201d\n\nThe NBA had also called on the Federal Government to set up a panel to probe the siege, describing it as an assault on the judiciary.\n\n\u201cThe grave implications of this possibility leave a lot to be desired,\u201d the president of the NBA, Olumide Akpata, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhen viewed in the context of a similar raid on the premises of Supreme Court Justices in 2016, the rationale of which was never fully explained or indeed justified, the NBA interprets last night\u2019s incident as a part of an orchestrated affront on the judiciary, designed to intimidate and ridicule the judiciary,\u201d the NBA boss added.\n\n\u2018An impostor\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali, has vowed to diligently prosecute the paraded suspects.\n\nIn a statement signed by spokesperson Mba, the police said it had recovered three vehicles and a laptop computer, printer and flash drive used for the production of fake identity cards from the suspects.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Police Force has arrested a total of fourteen (14) suspects including the principal suspect \u2013 a fake Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) \u2013 for complicity in the failed criminal trespass on the Abuja residence of Justice Mary Odili on Friday, 29th October, 2021,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThe suspects were arrested following investigations conducted by detectives from the Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB) which clearly revealed the criminal involvement and individual roles the suspects played in the invasion of the residence of the revered Supreme Court Judge. Recall that the Inspector General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, psc (+), NPM, fdc, on 1st November, 2021, affirmed that the Force did not authorize security operatives to carry out any assignment in or around the residence of Justice Mary Odili and directed the Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB) to carry out a discrete investigation with the aim of bringing the perpetrators to book.\n\n\u201cThe suspects; Ajodo Lawrence \u2018m\u2019 (principal suspect), Michael Diete-Spiff \u2018m\u2019, Bar. Alex Onyekuru \u2018m\u2019, Bayero Lawal \u2018m\u2019, Bar. Igwe Ernest \u2018m\u2019, Aliyu Umar Ibrahim \u2018m\u2019, Maimuna Maishanu \u2018f\u2019, Ayodele Akindipe \u2018m\u2019, Yusuf Adamu \u2018m\u2019, Bashir Musa \u2018m\u2019, ASP Mohammed Yahaya \u2018m\u2019, Stanley Nkwazema \u2018m\u2019, Shehu Jibo \u2018m\u2019 and Abdullahi Adamu \u2018m\u2019, L/CPL Mike (other name unknown) \u2018m\u2019, are members of a well-organized criminal gang with a web-like involvement of individuals drawing from their different competences, professional background and social contacts in perfecting the criminal plot. Membership of the syndicate include suspects with background in public service, business, law, journalism, banking, amongst others.\n\n\u201cThe facts of the case from Police Investigations have it that one Aliyu Umar Ibrahim, an acclaimed whistleblower, following a baseless and unverified information he got from one Yusuf Adamu \u2013 parading himself as the godson of Chief Peter Odili \u2013 that there is a huge sum of money in foreign currencies starched in the residence of Her Lordship, Justice Mary Odili located at No. 7, Imo River Street, Maitama, initiated processes aimed at illegally recovering the said money. Consequently, the syndicate contacted one Bashir Musa, a clerical staff of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), who in turn sought the assistance of two (2) others \u2013 Shehu Jibo and Abdullahi Adamu.\n\n\u201cThe whistleblower was later introduced to one Bayero Lawal who falsely presented himself as a Director in EFCC. He took the whistleblower to one Hajiya Maimuna Maishanu who in turn took them to her cousin, Michael Diete-Spiff, who claimed to be the Director of Foreign Currency Operation of Ghost\u2019s Account for Local Whistle Blowers & Assets Recovery Panel, purportedly operating under the Federal Ministry of Justice \u2013 an agency that in fact does not exist. Diete-Spiff later introduced the whistleblower to one Lawrence Ajodo with the aid of one Godwin (currently at large). From this moment, Lawrence Ajodo \u2013 who falsely claimed to be a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) and also the officer-in-charge of a non-existing Asset Recovery Panel at the Federal Ministry of Justice took over the planning and execution of the illicit operation. Through the assistance of one Ayodele Akindipe, an herbalist, the fake CSP procured the services of an Assistant Superintendent of Police and two (2) Soldiers for the failed operation. The fake CSP also elicited the services of a journalist, one Stanley Nkwazema and two (2) lawyers namely Bar. Alex Onyekuru and Bar. Igwe Ernest. While the journalist was expected to play the blackmail role, the lawyers were expected to help the syndicate in perfecting court documents and processes. The fake CSP later deposed to an affidavit and eventually obtained a search warrant meant for the execution of the raid.\n\n\u201cInvestigations so far conducted by the Police show that the suspects criminally trespassed on the residence of Her Lordship but were not allowed to execute the search warrant due to the lawful resistance from Police officers on guard duty at her residence. Police findings also revealed that the principal suspect \u2013 Lawrence Ajodo \u2013 is an impostor and not a police officer as he falsely claimed. Similarly, the Ghost\u2019s Account for Local Whistle Blowers & Assets Tax Recovery Panel purportedly operating under the Federal Ministry of Justice does not exist at the Federal Ministry of Justice neither is it registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission. Also, the signature of the Honourable Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN) on the ID card presented by the fake CSP during the raid was forged. The Search Warrant which the suspects procured from a Magistrate Court for purposes of searching the premises of Justice Odili, was also obtained under false representation. The entire criminal operation has no authorization of any known Security Agency or Federal Government Ministry/Department.\n\n\u201cThree (3) vehicles used by the suspects for the illegal invasion and a laptop computer, printer and flash drive used for the production of the fake ID cards were recovered from the suspects by the Police investigators.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, investigation is being intensified to arrest the other seven (7) suspects including two (2) persons believed to be personnel of the Nigeria Army who were physically present during the raid, and fully dressed in Army uniform.\n\n\u201cThe IGP, while assuring diligent prosecution of the suspects, reiterated the commitment of the Force to continue to advance the rule of law and combatting all forms of crimes and criminality in the country.\u201d",

          "text": "A court in military-ruled Myanmar on Friday jailed American journalist Danny Fenster for 11 years, his lawyer and his employer said, despite U.S. calls for his release from what it said was unjust detention.\n\nFenster, 37, the managing editor of online magazine Frontier Myanmar, was found guilty of incitement and violations of immigration and unlawful associations laws, his magazine said, describing the sentences as \u201cthe harshest possible under the law\u201d.\n\nHe is the first Western journalist sentenced to prison in recent years in Myanmar, where a Feb. 1 coup by the military against an elected government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi ended a decade of tentative steps towards democracy and triggered nationwide protests.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no basis to convict Danny of these charges,\u201d said Thomas Kean, editor-in-chief of Frontier Myanmar, one of the country\u2019s top independent news outlets.\n\n\u201cEveryone at Frontier is disappointed and frustrated at this decision. We just want to see Danny released as soon as possible so he can go home to his family.\u201d\n\nFenster was arrested while trying to leave the country in May and has since been held in Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison, where hundreds of opponents of the Tatmadaw, as the military is known, were jailed, many beaten and tortured, during decades of dictatorship.\n\nHe was charged with additional, and more serious, offences of sedition and violations of the terrorism act earlier this week, without an explanation by authorities. Those charges are punishable by a maximum 20 years in prison each.\n\nPhil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said Fenster\u2019s jailing was also intended as warnings to the United States and the media.\n\n\u201cThe junta\u2019s rationale for this outrageous, rights abusing sentence is first to shock and intimidate all remaining Burmese journalists inside Myanmar by punishing a foreign journalist this way,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe second message is more strategic, focused on sending a message to the U.S. that the Tatmadaw\u2019s generals don\u2019t appreciate being hit with economic sanctions and can bite back with hostage diplomacy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018PLAIN TO SEE\u2019\n\nFenster\u2019s family has repeatedly called for his release, saying they were heartbroken about his detention.\n\nHis trial had not been made public and a spokesman for the junta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe United States has been pushing for Fenster\u2019s release. The U.S. embassy in Myanmar did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday\u2019s verdict.\n\nThe State Department had earlier said his detention was \u201cprofoundly unjust\u201d and \u201cplain for the world to see\u201d, urging the junta to release him immediately.\n\nThe American is among dozens of journalists who were detained in Myanmar after protests and strikes erupted following the coup, hampering the military\u2019s efforts to consolidate power. Independent media has been accused by the junta of incitement.\n\nMore than 1,200 civilians have been killed in protests and thousands detained since the coup, according to activists cited by the United Nations.\n\nMyanmar authorities overlooked Fenster in a recent amnesty for hundreds of people detained over anti-junta protests, which included some journalists.\n\nDuring nearly half a century of harsh rule by the military, news reporting was tightly controlled by the state but Myanmar\u2019s media blossomed after the a quasi-civilian government introduced tentative reforms from 2011.\n\nSince the February coup, however, the military has rescinded media licenses, curbed the internet and satellite broadcasts and arrested dozens of journalists, in what human rights groups have called an assault on the truth.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists said in a report in July that Myanmar\u2019s rulers had effectively criminalised independent journalism.\n\nMing Yu Hah, Amnesty International\u2019s deputy regional director for campaigns, called the sentence a \u201creprehensible outcome\u201d in a deeply flawed case.\n\n\u201cDanny should have never been arrested in the first place and to sentence him to a combined 11 years shows how far Myanmar authorities are willing to go to signal that they do not respect independent media,\u201d she said.\n\nFrontier Myanmar\u2019s publisher, Sonny Swe, who spent eight years in prison during the previous era of military rule, announced Fenster\u2019s imprisonment on Twitter under the message: \u201cA lot of things are going so wrong in this country.\u201d",

          "text": "Japan\u2019s Toshiba Corp outlined plans on Friday to split into three independent companies, seeking to appease activist shareholders calling for a radical overhaul after years of scandal.\n\nThe move echoes a shift by fellow industrial conglomerate General Electric (GE.N) and will see Toshiba spin off core businesses \u2013 its energy and infrastructure divisions will be housed in one company while its device and storage businesses will form the backbone of another.\n\nThe third will manage Toshiba\u2019s stake in flash-memory chip company Kioxia Holdings and other assets.\n\nThe plan \u2013 borne of a five-month strategic review undertaken after a highly damaging corporate governance scandal \u2013 is partly aimed at encouraging activist shareholders to exit, sources with knowledge of the matter have said.\n\nThe overhaul was announced after markets closed in Japan. The company\u2019s Frankfurt-listed shares fell 4% at the open on Friday highlighting investor disappointment with the plan.\n\nA break-up would run counter to calls by some shareholders for Toshiba to be taken private. Its strategic review committee said, however, that option had raised concerns internally about its impact on business and the retention of staff.\n\nPrivate equity firms had also conveyed concerns about completing a deal due to possible conflict with Japan\u2019s national security law and potential opposition from anti-trust regulators, it added.\n\n\u201cAfter much discussion, we reached the conclusion that this strategic reorganisation was the best option,\u201d Chief Executive Satoshi Tsunakawa told a news conference.\n\nHe added that Toshiba, which hopes to complete the overhaul in two years, would have chosen the option to split regardless of the presence of activist shareholders and that Japan\u2019s powerful trade ministry had not voiced any objections to the plan.\n\nA portfolio manager at an activist fund with shares in Toshiba said the plan was disappointing and unlikely to be voted through at the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) the Japanese company plans to hold by next March.\n\n\u201cThe activists have two options now \u2013 you can sell and go away and come back in two years time or you can buy more shares and fight this thing at the EGM. I\u2019m going to go and think about what to do,\u201d said the portfolio manager who declined to be identified.\n\nRETURNS FOR SHAREHOLDERS\n\nAs part of the overhaul, Toshiba aims to return around 100 billion yen ($875 million) to shareholders over the next two financial years.\n\nIt also said it intended to \u201cmonetize\u201d its shares in Kioxia, returning the net proceeds in full to shareholders as soon as practicable. But it did not elaborate on whether that meant it was still keen on an IPO or would be considering other options.\n\nOther assets that will continue to be held by Toshiba include its stake in Toshiba Tec Corp (6588.T), a maker of printing and retail information systems.\n\nSome Toshiba investors are not convinced that a break-up would create value, shareholder sources said ahead of a formal announcement of the plan.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense to split if the valuation of a highly competitive business is hindered by other businesses,\u201d said Fumio Matsumoto, chief strategist at Okasan Securities.\n\n\u201cBut if there isn\u2019t such a business, the break-up just creates three lacklustre midsize companies.\u201d\n\nThe once-storied 146-year old conglomerate has lurched from crisis to crisis since an accounting scandal in 2015. Two years later, it secured a $5.4 billion cash injection from 30-plus overseas investors that helped avoid a delisting but brought in activist shareholders including Elliott Management, Third Point and Farallon.\n\nTension between Toshiba management and overseas shareholders has dominated headlines since then and in June, an explosive shareholder-commissioned investigation concluded that Toshiba colluded with Japan\u2019s trade ministry to block investors from gaining influence at last year\u2019s shareholders meeting.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Toshiba released a separately commissioned report that found executives including its former CEO had behaved unethically but not illegally.\n\nIt concluded that Toshiba was overly dependent on the trade ministry, adding that problems were also caused by its \u201cexcessive cautiousness towards foreign investment funds\u201d and \u201cits lack of willingness to develop a sound relationship with them.\u201d\n\nRecovering from a slump due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Toshiba reported second-quarter operating profit roughly doubled to 30.4 billion yen.",

          "title": "Nigeria Police Parade 14 Suspects over Invasion of Justice Odili\u2019s Residence",
          "text": "The Nigeria Police on Thursday paraded 14 suspects allegedly involved in the invasion of the Abuja residence of Supreme Court Justice, Mrs. Mary Odili.\n\nTHISDAY disowned one of the suspects, Mr. Stanley Nkwazema, who claimed to be a staff and contributing editor of the newspaper.\n\nSimilarly, Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, distanced himself from the leader of the group that conducted the raid, Lawrence Ajodo, who claimed to be a consultant to the AGF.\n\nA group that claimed to be personnel of some security agencies, including the police, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Department of State Services (DSS), among others, had invaded the home of the Odilis on October 29. The invasion drew wide condemnation from individuals and organisation, including the judiciary, Senate, the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Ohaneze Ndigbo, Afenifere, and other socio-cultural groups and civil society organisations.\n\nEFCC Chairman, Mr Abdulrasheed Bawa, had denied involvement of the agency in the raid, while the Inspector General of Police, Mr. Usman Baba, in ordering investigation into the incident also denied involvement of the police in the matter.\n\nBut parading the suspects at the Force CID in Abuja, Force Public Relations Officer, Mr. Frank Mba, a Commissioner of Police, said the investigation was predicated on a petition submitted by Malami directing the Inspector General of Police to conduct a robust investigation into the matter. Mba said 14 suspects were arrested while seven were at large, even as he said detectives were working round the clock to apprehend others still at large.\n\nHe said the leader of the syndicate, Ajodo, who claimed to be a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), was an impostor.\n\n\u201cHe is an impostor, not one of us or other law enforcement agencies in the country,\u201d he stated.\n\nMba said the syndicate obtained a search warrant based on false representation. He said the identity card found on him containing the signature of the AGF was forged.\n\nMba said the invasion was a well-conceived one with actors drawn from different professional backgrounds, notably, law, journalism, and rogue law enforcement. He said one of the suspects, Yusuf Adamu of the Bauchi State Liason Office, had claimed that there was a large deposit of hard currency in the home of the Odilis.\n\nMba said a prayer warrior, Aliyu Umar Ibrahim, who was contacted by an alleged Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) staff had gone to Odili\u2019s house to get soil sample of the place which confirmed the existence of the hard currency in the residence. He said the syndicate contacted a staff of EFCC, Austin, who was at large, and two lawyers, Barristers Igwe and Lawrence, and a journalist, Nkwazema.\n\nNkwazema claimed he was investigating an exclusive story. But Mba said the police doubted him because he did not report the story before it broke and long after it broke, until police invited him.\n\nMba said all the suspects attended all the meetings before the invasion and were all there on the night of the invasion. He said the security men at Odili\u2019s residence should be commended for observing that the search warrant contained No 7 instead of No 9.\n\nAccording to Mba, \u201cThis action saved the nation what would have been an embarrassment. The investigation has been swift, intelligence-led and comprehensive. Any of the suspects currently at large will be arrested.\n\n\u201cWe have contacted other security agencies, whose personnel are among those at large.\u201d\n\nThe police spokesman said no staff of the Ministry of Justice was involved in the operation.\n\nBut a man, who claimed to be the whistle-blower, an Islamic prayer warrior and swore to an affidavit that there was looted money in the house, said the information he was given was authentic. He alleged that he was called by the EFCC, after which they all assembled at the Ministry of Justice, where they demanded for the affidavit that he submitted, prompting surveillance on the home of Justice Odili.\n\n\u201cI showed him Justice Odili\u2019s house,\u201d Ibrahim said.\n\nMba declared, \u201cAt the end, all would be charged to court based on their level of involvement.\u201d\n\nHe said the charges might include conspiracy, impersonation, and forgery.\n\nHowever, Ajodo, insisted that he was one of the five consultants appointed by the office of the AGF and that he was mandated to recover stolen funds lodged in 18 accounts.\n\nResponding to questions during their parade, Ajodo said he was neither a personnel of the police nor worked for the AGF, but maintained his position that he was one of the consultants mandated to recover 18 accounts. He said the search was not executed on the night of the invasion because the house number on the warrant was No 7 and not No 9 Imo Crescent, the residence of the Justice, which prompted them to call off the search.\n\n\u201cI was given18 accounts to recover. I am a consultant, one of the five engaged in that office (AGF),\u201d Ajodo insisted.\n\nHowever, the web of denial of involvement by security agencies appears to be punctured by the accounts of the police and the suspects.\n\nFor instance, the police said two soldiers, a police ASP, an immigration officer, and an EFCC staff, who were allegedly involved in the raid, were at large. Those who raided Odili\u2019s residence were also said to be about 50.\n\nThese raise the question how, suddenly, the paraded suspects are only civilians \u2013 lawyer, journalist, native doctor \u2013 or fake policemen or suspects, who forged search warrants for the operation.\n\nTHISDAY Disowns Stanley Nkwazema\n\nMeanwhile, the management of THISDAY Newspapers, in a disclaimer notice signed by the Managing Editor, Mr. Bolaji Adebiyi, stated categorically that Nkwazema was neither a staff nor a Contributing Editor of the organisation.\n\nThe notice dated November 11, read, in part, \u201cThe attention of the management of THISDAY Newspapers has been drawn to the news making the rounds that Mr. Stanley Nkwazema, one of those suspected to have invaded the home of Justice Mary Odili, claimed to be a staff and Contributing Editor of THISDAY.\n\n\u201cContrary to his claim, Mr. Nkwazema is neither a staff of THISDAY nor a Contributing Editor. He was a Sports Correspondent and resigned more than 15 years ago.\u201d\n\nAdebiyi explained that occasionally, Nkwazema, like hundreds of other readers of the newspaper, sent for publication articles and analyses and were usually obliged. He added that it was a privilege THISDAY gave to some of its ex-staff.\n\nThe notice added, \u201cThat does not in any way make him a staff and contributing editor of THISDAY.\n\n\u201cSince his resignation, THISDAY had at no time contracted Mr. Nkwazema to investigate any story, and we know nothing of his alleged investigation of a story leading to the raid of the residence of Hon. Justice Odili.\n\n\u201cThe police authorities and the general public should, therefore, note that Mr. Nkwazema, whatever may be his involvement in this matter, was not on any reportorial assignment in any shape or form on behalf of THISDAY.\u201d\n\nMalami Denies Ajodo\n\nIn a related development, Malami denied knowing or engaging Ajodo at any time.\n\nMalami, in a statement, described the confession of Ajodo as that of a \u201cdrowning man scavenging for a dying partner\u201d.\n\nHe added that he could not have stooped so low to engage a quack or fake police officer as consultant.\n\nMalami\u2019s position was contained in a statement by his media aide, Dr. Umar Gwandu.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe attention of the Office of the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice has been drawn to a confession of a suspect during interrogation in the investigation of the recent invasion of the residence of the highly respected Justice of the Supreme Court; Justice Mary Peter Odili.\n\n\u201cWith all the competent, high level professionals and capable human resources available at the disposal of the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, it only takes the imagination of the evil minds to assume or think that the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice will descend so low to engaging a quack or fake police officer to serve as his consultant.\n\n\u201cThis is a case of a drowning man scavenging for a dying partner.\u201d\n\nThe AGF said he was happy that investigation had commenced to unravel the circumstances and personalities behind the invasion and sponsored campaign of calumny against his person.\n\nHe added that it was his desire and hope that the investigation would also disclose those after him, dragging his personality, his name and his exalted office in dirty politics.\n\nMalami, while describing the development as an orchestrated attempt to stir unnecessary controversy and public apprehension, challenged the suspect to present documents of engagements where he worked as a consultant to the AGF, whether in the past or present.\n\nThe statement added, \u201cConsultant for what? Which activity or assignment? When was he engaged? What were the terms of reference for the alleged consultancy service? When was he engaged? Where was he engaged? Which work has he executed for the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and the Minister of Justice? For what duration? And for how much?\n\n\u201cWe boldly and unequivocally challenge the fake consultant/police officer to come out with answers or responses to these questions to the general public.\n\n\u201cThe Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice superintends over and respects the rule of law, and will not do anything to undermine the sanctity of his office and that of the entire judiciary and Justice sector.\u201d\n\nAlex Enumah and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",

          "title": "$418m Consultants\u2019 Fee: AGF Malami Should Defend Nigeria, Not Claimants, Governors Chairman Fayemi Says",
          "text": "The Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) on Thursday maintained that the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami has continued to mislead President Muhammadu Buhari in the case of the $418 million (N169 billion at official FX rate) Paris Fund deductions being claimed by some consultants.\n\nSpeaking on ARISE News Channel in response to comments made on the matter earlier by Malami, the NGF Chairman, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, wondered why the attorney general was taking sides with people he described as \u201cdubious\u201d, instead of defending the country against them.\n\nThe federal government had approved the payment of the controversial sum to six creditors, in defiance of the issues raised by the 36 state governors on the legitimacy of the demands by the claimants.\n\nThe claimants included a former member of the House of Representatives, politician and lawyer, Ned Nwoko, who is demanding $142,028,941; and Riok Nigeria Limited, Orji Nwafor-Orizu, and Olaitan Bello, who are laying claims to $142,028,941.95, $1,219,440.45 and $215,159.36 respectively.\n\nAlso, Ted Iseghoghi is claiming $159,000,000, while a firm, Panic Alert Security System Limited, owned by George Uboh, is claiming $47,831,920 in separate \u201cconsent judgments\u201d.\n\nThe Debt Management Office (DMO) was recently directed to commence issuance of promissory notes to the creditors, a development the governors have continued to resist.\n\nMalami had insisted that the consultants were deserving of the monies, from his own assessment of the situation, alleging that the governors had admitted to owing the debts and had actually been paying them off for some years.\n\nAccording to Malami, contrary to claims, the NGF had signed a contractual agreement authorising the deduction of fees from the federal allocation of the states as payments to consultants, who handled negotiations on behalf of the 36 States and FCT.\n\nHe had stated that having committed to the deduction of the fee from the federal allocation which the governors of the 36 states had signed to and which preceded the Buhari administration for which payments were made in the past, the federal government could not but follow through with the payment hence the recent approval to effect the payment to the consultants via promissory notes.\n\nBut speaking Thursday, Fayemi, who stated that he was ordinarily reluctant to discuss the matter since it was already in court, noted that the governors had held several consultations with Buhari, his chief of staff, the attorney general and the finance minister in the last eight months to sort out the contentious issues.\n\nHe upbraided the attorney general for publicly identifying himself as the attorney general of the federal government during his interview, noting that the office which Malami occupies exists to serve the federation and not the federal government.\n\nRather than defending the consultants, Fayemi insisted that Malami\u2019s job was to defend the federal, state and local governments which make up the federation.\n\nAccording to the Ekiti state governor, the consultants were taking advantage of Buhari\u2019s \u201cdecency and generosity of spirit\u201d to fleece the Nigerian people, having tried and failed during the administrations of Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo, Umar Yar\u2019adua and Goodluck Jonathan to rip off the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cIt is not $418, it is $419 million and that may ring some bell in many places,\u201d he stressed, apparently referring to the term 419, the popular Nigerian word for fraud or scam.\n\nHe argued that there was no order of mandamus against the governors anywhere as alluded to by the attorney general and challenged Malami to produce the document if he\u2019s in possession of one.\n\nThe NGF chairman further pushed back on a statement made by Malami during the interview, that there exists a consent judgment confirming that the monies were owed the consultants and there was an agreement to pay, saying that there was nowhere in the so-called document that any amount was mentioned.\n\nHe mentioned that whatever consent judgment the consultants claimed to have obtained was entered into by a faction of the governors\u2019 forum in the days when the then chair of the NGF, Rotimi Amaechi, was purportedly removed, maintaining that Amaechi\u2019s NGF which was the authentic body never sanctioned the deal.\n\nHe stated that not even the best lawyers in the United Kingdom would NOT charge those huge amounts for a \u201ctwo-page letter\u201d purportedly given to the faction of the governors\u2019 forum on review of the judgment, insisting that it doesn\u2019t appeal to common sense.\n\n\u201cThe attorney general of the federation is pushing so vehemently on the side of people whose primary intent is to fleece the Nigerian people. Even the EFCC that reviewed all of these matters, actually accused the federal ministry of justice of lack of diligent prosecution of this matter.\n\n\u201cThese matters were not appealed by the federal ministry of justice, admittedly not under Malami at the time. But what is happening now is just a continuation of the sleight of hand and that\u2019s what the governors are challenging.\n\n\u201cI wrote to the president on behalf of my colleagues, sat with Mr. President on this issue and clearly Mr. President was misled and there\u2019s no way governors are going to allow this.\n\n\u201cI will ordinarily not come out and do this, but my brother Abubakar Malami directed his media aides to accuse governors of being the ones behind this and he has repeated on your programme (on Arise Television) that we are forum-shopping,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that Malami\u2019s claims that part of the monies had been offset in the past and therefore was a basis for further deductions did not hold water, since it was possible to obtain money by fraudulent means, but that the governors are now insisting that the right thing should be done.\n\nFayemi pointed out that since the activities of public servants would be scrutinised by the public at some point after they exit their positions, it was imperative to display the highest form of transparency in all their dealings.\n\n\u201cI am afraid that we do not believe that the attorney general has demonstrated this (transparency) and that\u2019s what has brought this about,\u201d he declared.\n\nAsked to confirm if the EFCC verified the amount being claimed by the consultants, he stated that it wasn\u2019t possible, reason the governors had been calling for a forensic audit, since members of the anti-corruption agency are not forensic auditors.\n\nFor instance, he stated that the EFCC report revealed that one of the documents which was used to claim the huge amount by one of the consultants was forged, describing the whole matter as clouded with a lot of \u201cmalfeasance\u201d.\n\nHe questioned why the attorney general, who is a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) was in a hurry to execute the so-called judgment of the lower courts when the governors had appealed the matter in a higher court.\n\nHe explained that because governors wanted access to the Paris Club fund when Buhari agreed to disburse it in 2017, they had some agreements with certain parties who had gone to court to block the money from being released, but noted that whatever they got was the full and final payment.\n\nOn the accusation of forum-shopping, he described the allegation by Malami as \u201cingenuous\u201d, alleging that the directive by the attorney general for the release of the monies was basically to rip Nigerians off.\n\nFayemi stressed that it was an \u201cinsult\u201d for the attorney general to insinuate that the governors were forum-shopping, a practice where a party attempts to have his action tried in a particular court or jurisdiction where he feels he will receive the most favourable decision or verdict.\n\n\u201cWe have been very clear that these claims, to the best of our knowledge are fraudulent and should be subjected to a forensic audit.\n\n\u201cIf states are found to be liable on account of the purported consultancy allegedly delivered by these people, because I don\u2019t know how anybody can claim to have delivered on the refund that is already established, for anyone to suggest that they did that is a red herring.\n\n\u201cThe best way to describe this 419 million dollars is to say that this is a local equivalent of the P&ID case and it\u2019s an irony that the attorney general is the one prosecuting the P&ID all over the place and trying to rescue $10 billion for the Nigerian people and yet is so willing to release $419 million to people of dubious circumstances who are demanding for the money I don\u2019t believe they worked for.\u201d\n\nBut an analyst of the development who does not want his name mentioned. told THISDAY that it would be disingenuous for Malami to continue to push for the payment of such a huge amount of money at this point in time when the economy is still reeling from the effects of the COVID-19, the consequent slump in federal government\u2019s revenue and its inability to meet its OPEC daily crude export quota . \u201cAll these challenges have made the federal government to remain in the debt market, borrowing monies from every available avenue to meet its obligations.\n\nTherefore, under the situation that the country finds itself, managers of the nation such as Malami should be more concerned about efforts to reflate the economy and should not be seen as the one encouraging steps that would further make the economy bleed.\n\nAt a time like this, focus should be on how to spend our way out of the present economic situation and on job creation for our huge youth population so as to raise productivity. All Malami is interested is paying consultants dubious consent judgment;\n\nThe analyst argued further that whether the governors initially allowed deductions to take place in 2016, \u201cdoes not hold water because the variables available then are not the same as 2021 and there are now different players entirely who have looked at matter and realised something is not quite right in the all scheme. More so, when the deal was consummated in 2016, the dollar was around N150/$1 and now he is pushing for the consultants to be paid at around N450/$. We are talking about a colossal amount of money to be paid to a few people to the detriment of over 200 million people. This is just immoral however one looks at it, said the analyst.\n\n\u201cClearly, as the chief law officer of the country, Malami should know that all his actions on this matter are not morally right and purely against public interest and it would be immoral for the president to even endorse the payment.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Addeh, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos",
