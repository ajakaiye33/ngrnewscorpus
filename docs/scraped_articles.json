          "text": "The Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, SAN, has accused the Nigerian Army of inducing steps towards jailbreaks in Ondo State.\n\nThis is as he condemned, in strong terms, the withdrawal of soldiers of the Nigerian Army from the correctional centres across the state.\n\nAkeredolu expressed displeasure at the move after he was briefed on the situation by the state Commissioner of Police, Oyediran Oyeyemi.\n\nIn a statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Richard Olatunde, Akeredolu wondered why soldiers will be withdrawn from correctional centres which belong to the Federal Government.\n\nThe statement was titled \u2018Withdrawal of Soldiers From Correctional Centers In Ondo: Action Is To Induce Jail Breaks, Akeredolu raises alarm.\u2019\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cLast night, Governor Akeredolu received reports from the Commissioner of Police in the state that soldiers attached to the correctional centres in the state have all been withdrawn.\n\n\u201cThis development came as a surprise, considering the fact that both the Nigerian Army and the Nigerian Correctional Centers belong to the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThe Governor was more bothered about the overflow effect of the soldiers withdrawal on the security situation in the state. More so that such action could easily encourage jailbreaks across the state.\n\n\u201cIt is, however, pertinent to alert members of the public and the Federal Government of this unwholesome situation. Findings into the remote cause of this action have only revealed that it was an order from above without corresponding details.\n\n\u201cProactive efforts have been made to secure these centres so as not to allow premeditated jailbreaks as whoever gave the order to withdraw those soldiers was in the process of encouraging such.\u201d\n\nThe statement said Akeredolu has met with other security heads in the state, particularly the Police, and charged them to take over their responsibility of internal security in the state.\n\n\u201cWhile we believe that the Federal Government has a duty to protect the prisons, we are more concerned about the security of our people across the state. A jailbreak will not only threaten the peaceful atmosphere we are enjoying in the state, it will pose serious danger to our people.\n\n\u201cGovernor Akeredolu has met with the security heads and the Police has since last night taken up their responsibility of internal security by deploying armed Police officers to these correctional centres.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, whose main assignment is to secure Federal Government facilities, has also deployed armed officers to the correctional facilities.\n\n\u201cGovernor Akeredolu has also directed the deployment of men of the State Security Network (Amotekun) to complement the Police and the NSCDC. This is to ensure that any premeditated action is tamed and resisted with commensurate force,\u201d the statement added.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The utter disrespect, which underlines the response of the officer to the Governor establishes, beyond doubt, the impracticability of the current system, dubiously christened \u201cFederalism\u201d.\n\n\u201cAn arrangement, which compels the Governor of a State to seek clarifications on security issues in his jurisdiction from totally extraneous bodies or persons, is a sure recipe for anarchy.\n\n\u201cWe condemn, very strongly, this brazen assault on decency. We call on the IG to explain the justification for this intrusion.\n\n\u201cThis is not acceptable. Any expectations of rapprochement between so-called federating units and federal security agencies are becoming forlorn, progressively, due to deliberate acts which mock our very avowal to ethics and professionalism.\n\n\u201cWe condemn, in very clear terms, the role of the Attorney General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami SAN in this act of gross moral turpitude.\n\n\u201cWe, on our part, will continue to interrogate the current system, which treats elected representatives of the people as mere prefects, while appointed office holders ride roughshod over them as Lords of the Manor.\n\n\u201cIf the purported Chief Security Officers of the States of the Federation require clearance from the office of the IG on matters within their areas of jurisdictions, only hypocrites will wonder why the current security crisis deepens and there appears to be no solution in the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cWe condemn very strongly, this brazen assault on decency. We call on the IG to explain the justification for this intrusion.\n\n\u201d This is not acceptable. Any expectations of rapprochement between so called federating units and federal security agencies are becoming forlorn, progressively, due to deliberate acts which mock our very avowal to ethics and professionalism.\n\n\u201cWe stand by our brother, the Governor of Lagos State. We advise him to deploy the Regional security outfit in the State to protect the lives and property of the people.\n\n\u201cWe call on the President and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces to rein in the excesses of certain elements bent on acting in a manner capable of eroding the bond of trust existing between the people and the Federal Government.\n\n\u201d It is preposterous for political appointees to seek to undermine the very structure of service upon which their appointments rest.\n\nRecall that on Tuesday, December 21, 2021, some persons described as miscreants, acting on the directive of judgment creditor, Adebayo Adeyiga, and court bailiffs, allegedly, invaded the estate, with the aim of taking over the land and property of residents, following purported court order ceding the land to Adeyiga.\n\nThe executives of the Magodo Residents Association, MRA, consequently ordered the two main gates leading into the estate shut in order to prevent any form of invasion.\n\nAfter few hours of disturbance, residents and other people were allowed to go out of the estate but were prevented from reentering the estate.\n\nProtesting residents displayed placards of various inscriptions to express their displeasure.\n\nThey queried the presence of the policemen who were said to have been in the estate since last month.\n\nSome of the inscriptions read: \u2018Lagos Attorney-General prosecute those involved in illegal invasion of Magodo Phase 2\u2019, \u2018 and Magodo Phase 2 has been under siege of the IGP\u2019s anti-riot police squad for three weeks.\n\nThe residents subsequently called on the governor to intervene and Sanwo-Olu promptly visited the scene and told the leader of the police delegation that the land matter is a case between private individuals and the state government.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq\n\nThe Media Office of Former Senate President, Dr Abubakar Bukola Saraki, has advised the Governor of Kwara State, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, to cure himself of the fixation with the name of a man who assumed the post he is presently occupying 18 years ago and rather focus on how to provide efficient governance to the people of Kwara State.\n\nIn a statement signed by Yusuph Olaniyonu, the Media Office noted that Governor Abdulrazaq has continued to display the attitude of a man suffering from inferiority complex and that is why he would always talk about Saraki who left the Office of Governor of Kwara State over a decade ago.\n\n\u201cThe Media Office of Abubakar Bukola Saraki noted the \u2018long essay\u2019 written by Rafiu Ajakaye, the Press Secretary to Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq which was drifting with the name of Saraki from the headline to the last sentence. Ordinarily, one would ignore the piece as another diversionary gimmick being employed by a Governor and a government now reputed for failure to deliver on the numerous promises made to the people during elections.\n\n\u201cHowever, we consider it important to let the governor and his spin doctors know that the people have seen through their deception and thus, they should now direct their efforts towards delivering good governance to the good people of Kwara State.\n\n\u201cIt is important for Abdulrazaq and his cohorts to be reminded that Saraki can never be governor again. He is not going to be on the ballot for the governorship in 2023. So, why do the governor and his government talk about Saraki every time? They should know that 2023 will be a verdict on whether he (the governor) had measured up to expectation as a competent and efficient administrator.\n\n\u201cThe Kwara State governor should also know that 2023 will be a referendum on whether the promises he made to the people have been fulfilled. The election will not be about how many times he abused Saraki and what he did to antagonise the Saraki family.\n\n\u201cWe also need to remind the Governor that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to which Saraki belong will field a competent, well educated, experienced, and acceptable gubernatorial candidate in the next general elections in Kwara State who will be ready to debate the performance of the current government in public fora and tell the people what policies, programmes, and projects they should expect from him.\n\n\u201cThe Governor and his aides will be suffering from the grandeur of delusion to think that the major issues in Kwara State come 2023 will be their repeated lies and propaganda or false claims. Also, the next elections will not be based on empty sentiments. It will be about serious issues, a clear referendum on the performance of the incumbent and how to make Kwara greater\u201d, the Media Office stated.\n\nIt chided Abdulrazaq and his aides for thinking the governor could get re-elected only by attacking Saraki and using his name to divert attention from the many inadequacies of the present administration.\n\nThe Abubakar Bukola Saraki Media Office further noted that while the government owes a responsibility to the people to periodically give them an account of its achievements, every government should know that the people are more discerning and they can sift the truth and separate it from empty claims or mere grandstanding.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The people of Nkerefi in Nkanu East local government area of Enugu state Wednesday extolled the leadership virtues of the state governor, Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, over his brilliant performance in the state in the past six and a half years. The exultation was made on new year day in Umuikka, Enuogu-Nkerefi autonomous community, the country home of the former Secretary to the State Government, Elder GOC Ajah, mni, when the latter played host to the teeming members of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), prominent sons and daughters of Nkerefi land and other stakeholders from the four autonomous communities.\n\nAddressing the mammoth crowds, Dr Ajah expressed his appreciation for the timely response from the them not minding that it was on a New Year day when everyone was celebrating with their loved ones. He stated that the response from the cheering crowds showed the level of love and honour the people of Nkerefi had for him, adding that he would never take their friendship and support for granted.\n\nDr Ajah who spoke in a viral video obtained by our correspondent also commended the spirit of brotherhood among the people of Nkerefi which stood out in the state. According to him, the new year gathering became essential in order to appreciate the PDP faithful, party loyalists, including women and youths, and Nkerefi stakeholders from different divides for the support, solidarity and love they have shown him over the years right from his days as permanent secretary to his appointment as the state\u2019s SSG and Enugu State Science, Technical and Vocational School Management Board\u2019s Executive Chairman.\n\nWhile recognising the presence of the dignitaries at the event, Ajah extolled the humane virtue of the state governor, Hon. Ugwuanyi for remembering Nkerefi at a time it was needed most, describing him (governor) as rescuer of Nkerefi people from political darkness. He pointed out to the many developments bought to Nkerefi by the administration of Ugwunyi to include the reconstruction of road, installation of basic amenities, reconstruction of schools in the town, including the technical college in the community, sinking of modern borehole at Eke Nkerefi, and the appointments of the sons and daughters of Nkerefi into key positions in the state.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the stakeholders at the gathering have taken their turns to express satisfaction at the way Ajah was able to mobilise the calibre of people in Nkerefi to attend the fun-filled meeting despite differences in political leaning.\n\nHon. S. I Mbah, a PDP chieftain and former Administrator, Nkanu South Development Centre, who was at meeting poured out his gratitude to the convener of the meeting, declaring that Dr. Ajah had done the impossible. The visibly elated former Administrator said that the Nkerefi of today was far better than the Nkerefi of the past, and appealed to the people not to relent in their search for more development.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate God for the gift of life, and for staying alive to witness today being the first day of the year 2022. I want to express how I feel about this gathering today, and this convergence is an opportunity for us as the people of Nkerefi to reinforce the kindred ties among us. We are a blessed people and we thank God for what he has done so far for us.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seizing this occasion to thank our brother, the former Secretary to Enugu State Government (SSG), Executive Chairman, Enugu State Science, Technical & Vocational School Management Board (STVSMB) and founder of Akaji-Ugo Support Group for Gburubguru, Elder (Dr) GOC Ajah, mni, for considering it befitting for us as brothers to come together and celebrate this new year.\n\n\u201cAs I keep saying to people; we are not at competition with anybody. We go at our own pace and wish others well in their journey. If we feel or see that others are not doing well, we try to extend a helping hand. That is what makes us kindred and the same big family members in Nkerefi. The most important thing is for us as a people to live in unison and speak with one voice, because by this way, we can always achieve whatever our pressing need is. So, this gathering is commendable and we thank the host and convener, Dr GOC Ajah for that.\n\n\u201cI want to appeal to the stakeholder here, because I know we are complete as representatives of Nkerefi people, to keep pushing for the ensuing peace and unity we have been enjoying in Nkerefi land. Let us discourage any form of bitter rivalry or ill competition among ourselves. God can raise anybody up to be king from anywhere whether we like it or not. The fundamental thing is to keep supporting ourselves in politics, business, religion, education and in other aspects we have the opportunity to do.\n\n\u201cIt is also a thing of joy that Nkerefi is rapidly progressing in development, education, growth, and infrastructure. Nkerefi of today is far better than Nkerefi of yesterday because God used some people to alter the historical narration of our people. God has immensely used the Governor of Enugu state, His Excellency, Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi to change our story in a positive way. This reminds me the experience some of us had in the year 2014 or thereabouts during a prayer organised by the whole communities that made up Nkerefi. On that historic day, in a hot sunny afternoon which happened to be a dry season, while the prayer was on-going, heaven opened and it started raining around the vicinity of the prayer. The video evidence is still here with us. I have never seen anything like that before in my life. Many people were present that day including Igwe Luke Ogbuta of Imeoha Nkerefi Autonomus Community; our Igwe here in Enuogu Nkerefi Autunomous Community was there; late Ogbuzuru was alive then, Igwe and my brother were also there, and other prominent Nkerefians attended the prayer. Our prayer point that day was simple; that God should break every socio-cultural, economic and political jinx against our land. God did it for us. He answered our prayer with shower of rain.\n\n\u201cThereafter, in less than six months, the Governor appointed our son, Dr Ajah as SSG for the state, he appointed Hon. Engr. Mike Ogbuekwe as Special Adviser on Agriculture, he appointed Justice Ajah as a High Court Judge from Nkerefi, he appointed a Special Assistant in the person of Hon. Monday Diamond Ani, he gave us a Deputy Local Government Chairman in the person of Barr. Ngozi Ogbonna, and other appointments. We continue to pray for more development because God has started it. We must understand our history in order to appreciate our journey so far and where we are presently. God has been faithful to the people of Nkerefi in Nkanu clan.\n\n\u201cIn 2015 when we held a reception for our son in Nkerefi, our performing governor, honoured the invitation, and was for the first time, in Nkerefi. He dinned and wined with us in his usual humble gesture. At the reception arena, the governor re-echoed his support for the people of Nkerefi. He promised to reconstruct our road, and he did. He encouraged us to keep praying and supporting Dr Ajah, and I\u2019m happy to inform you that we have always been supporting him, and we are ready to go any length with him. The governor\u2019s love and fulfilment of his promises to Ndi Nkerefi shows that he is spiritually connected to the good people of Nkerefi. May God bless him immensely for all his good works in the state,\u201d Mbah stated.\n\nSimilarly, the President General of Nkerefi Development Union (NDU), an umbrella body of all the autonomous communities in Nkerefi, Hon. Prince Dubem Nonso has hailed the uncommon effort of the convener of the meeting, stating that the meeting the painted the reflection of the love and unity among the people of Nkerefi both within Nkerefi and outside Nkerefi land. According to the PG, Ajah has displayed uncommon leadership dexterity in his search for a more dynamic, progressive and developed people.\n\nCalling on all hands to be on deck to move Nkerefi forward, Dubem charged the stakeholders to see themselves as brothers and sisters and cooperate to work towards a progressive Nkerefi where everyone would be proud and happy to identify with the community. He further added that the leadership of NDU under him had recorded tremendous breakthrough in development and in the empowerment of youths of the different communities. He also stated that Nkerefi was enjoying a cordial relationship with the government at the centre, state and local levels, promising that he would continue to work with the state for the peace, security and progress of the people.\n\nOn his part, the former President General of NDU and a successful business mogul, Chief Christian Ogbanna fondly called Christag, has tagged the gathering as the most decorated day of the year in the history of Nkerefi people as event was able to attract major stakeholders and dignitaries across board.\n\nChief Christag who flamboyantly showered encomiums on the Akaji-Ugo Support Group pioneer, declared that the gathering had further reinforced that the people of Nkerefi were at peace, and would continue to work and support one and another for the greater good of the people of Nkerefi.\n\nIn his words; \u201cToday is a beautiful day, and I\u2019m happy to see that majority of Nkerefi bigwigs and political stakeholders are here regardless of political affiliations. This shows that political differences cannot sunder or divide us. We are still all brothers and sisters. I want everyone to underscore the fact that coming together like this brings unity and development to our communities. We are all one. We should not make mountain out of a molehill or fight ourselves. Nobody should pitch tent with outsider against his kinsman here. We must work together to attain the common goal we have been craving for. The development of Nkerefi will benefit every family in the community.\n\n\u201cTo my brother, Dr GOC Ajah, on behalf of our people, I\u2019m passing a resounding note of commendation on you for this act of generosity. May God continue to bless you. Since you\u2019ve decided to be calling on us in every 1st of January, we\u2019ll adjust our schedules to heed to your call. May God replenish your pocket and enrich the source of your expenditure.\n\n\u201cLet me use this occasion to urge you to honour every invitation and respond to our call whenever we need you. It shall be well with the people of Nkerefi in Jesus name.\n\n\u201cNow that God has been benevolent to Nkerefi, it is my prayer that it will continue without ceasing. My God continue to raise people who have the interest of the land at heart, bless every family and provide our needs.\u201d\n\nOne of the traditional rulers who was at the gathering with his beautiful Queen, HRH Igwe Sunday Onyekwere expressed his delight over the new year celebration at Dr Ajah\u2019s residence, saying that the peaceful gathering of the people of Nkerefi who were dinning and winning in the same ditch and cup would go a long way in making his year. \u201cMy people, I\u2019m overjoyed today that every stakeholder from different walks of life is here today. This is the brotherhood we have been craving for, and I will appeal to us to continue in this way in the spirit of the love we are now sharing. There is nothing greater than coming together as brethren to fraternise, rub mind together, eat and drink from the same plate and cup and discuss the development of our people. This is a great thing and it\u2019s good for our kingdom that we are starting the year with love and celebration.\n\n\u201cDivided we fall and united we stand. We must remain united in one accord. Even in politics, I\u2019m appealing to us to support candidates of Nkerefi extraction with interest to represent us at any level of government. It shall be well with the sons and daughter of Nkerefi in their going and in their coming in Jesus name,\u201d the contented king added.\n\nIn the same vein, a former Administrator in Nkanu East, Hon. Bond added his voice to the call of the sustenance of the peace that has been forged by the people. This, he said, would help Nkerefi to have their own share of the political benefits accrued from both the federal, state and local governments. He lauded Ajah\u2019s ecumenical style of leadership which he likened to the ensuing peace mantra brought about by Governor Ugwuanti\u2019s spirit of humility and accommodation of disparate interests in the state.\n\nBond who further urged the people of Nkerefi to support their sons and daughters in government so that they could do more stated that Ajah has been leading by example of his good steadship. According to him; \u201cOne thing that happens today that greatly delighted my heart is the gathering of the people of Nkerefi in their great number to celebrate the new year as sons and daughters of Nkerefi who have the same bleed ties.\n\n\u201cI came out to speak for two reasons; one, since my political sojourn in our dear state, there is nobody that had ever called a gathering of this kind in Nkerefi and had the calibre of people like this honour it. Ajah has set the ball rolling and we have learnt something fundamentally genuine in his capacity to mobilise men and women with different political and economic orientations. Years back when we started politics in Nkerefi, it took us a lot of effort to convince our people to join politics as there are certain dividends that accompany political participation. The political participation, in all sincerity, was poor, and the apathy was widespread. However, today, I\u2019m happy there is now a political renaissance among our people. There\u2019s a radical political reawakening and the people are actively coming out to participate.\n\n\u201cSecond, some time ago, when the emerging political formation began to gain momentum, in the spirit of democracy, political participants started pitching tents in what they balkanised as \u2018line up A, B, C and so forth\u2019. These line ups have survived till today. However, what amazes me today is that Elder GOC Ajah was able to galvanise all these line ups and get them to our gathering today. This is beautiful. This gesture must continue, and we will keep supporting it.\n\n\u201cI want to emphatically say this; I have travelled far and wide outside Nkanuland and related with people from different backgrounds, and I observed that our people of Nkerefi should learn how to support themselves. It is time to start helping our people in areas of politics, trade, entrepreneurship, education, business, connection, jobs, etc. It is only by doing this that Nkerefi can be great, and more developments will be attracted. This gathering has offered us the opportunity for soul searching and to take stock of how far we have fared in helping those struggling in Nkerefi. Ajah should continue with this project of yearly gathering, please. Let me also appreciate those of us that have taken it as a responsibility to help the people of Nkerefi in getting employed, in business and even in securing visas outside the country.\n\n\u201cI will not end my speech without recognising the immense effort of our President General, Hon. Prince Jim Dubem Nonso. The General PG is a loveable figure with a loveable character. We all love him because he is doing amazingly well, and he represents the voice of the whole Nkerefi people.\n\n\u201cLet me urge our brothers who are well to do to toe this template by Dr Ajah by also mobilising stakeholders for the progress of our community. We are going to be rotating it amongst ourselves to concretise our relationship. Just like every stakeholder here, I\u2019m making arrangement to call you people when it is my turn. Once again, I want to reiterate my support for Elder Ajah in all his future endeavours. He has my unalloyed support.\u201d\n\nRecounting the roles played by the PDP and the administration of Governor Ugwuanyi, the President General of Ohuani-Amofu autonomous community in Nkerefi and an aide to the state governor, Hon. Felix Nweze declared that Nkerefi had benefitted immensely from the political benevolence of the state governor. According to him, everyone living or travelling inside and outside Nkerefi have been a beneficiary of the large heart of the governor. He pointed to the road constructed by the governor and the jobs offered by the former SSG to his people.\n\n\u201cElder GOC Ajah is my cousin at Ihukuru, and we have got relations from other parts of Nkerefi land. This shows that we are all inter-related and the relationship has become that of one big family. I can\u2019t express the way I feel in words for what our brother has done today. It\u2019s a marvellous act of goodwill that we are all together today. With this we have hope of a greater Nkerefi.\n\n\u201cGOC sir, we want you to know that we are supportive of whatever you are doing and that is why we are here. Please, the people of Nkerefi are saying that you should continue with your good works.\n\n\u201cI have this to tell my people; the only thing that will save us as a community is for all of us to keep supporting the only umbrella that has been speaking for us which is the Nkerefi Development Union (NDU). NDU has been representing us in a way that has been beneficial to the people. We are aware that there are four autonomous communities here; however, Nkerefi is still one and only the same. We are one people. One family. One kindred. We travel on the same roads; share farmlands, paths, and one cannot do without the other. We are all related in one way or the other.\n\n\u201cToday, the people of Nkerefi can now comfortably sit, dine and wine together without fear or suspicion. This shows the extent things have changed for better. This cannot happen in other places because there is no love lost amongst many towns, villages and communities. Here in Nkerefi, we are doing things in common; men and women, old and young. Once it\u2019s evening, try and go out. You will be surprised. You will see people with different cars converged and drinking from one bottle.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, I want to encourage my brothers and sisters here that we must remain focused and be supportive of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi administration because we have immensely benefited from his government. I also want to say that PDP as a political party is serving our purpose and we are happy of its membership. Let us be steadfast with the party, and support whatever its leadership says. We are all beneficiaries of PDP in one way or the other. The road we ply is tarred by the PDP government. The boreholes sank for us came from the PDP and many other projects. We will continue with PDP until we get everything that we want. God bless Nkerefi, God bless Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, God bless PDP,\u201d the Ohuani Amofu PG stated.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, wealthy business philanthropist, Chief Chijioke Odih, fondly refered as Chi-Motors Nigeria LTD, while underscoring the invaluable reverence they have for Dr Ajah, declared that it was only Dr Ajah who could muster such courage to call the calibre of men and women and had them honoured his call on a new year day. According to him, responding to his call at such a festive period sent a clear message that they had absolute confidence on the person of GOC Ajah. He further told the cheering crowds that they would always honour Dr Ajah whether he had made the call on a Christmas day, new year day or any other day because of his impacts on the development of the community. He, therefore, called on the people to remain unswerving in their support for the leader of the party and foremost son of the community.\n\nThe event came to its climax when Dr Ajah donated an undisclosed huge amounts of money to the party faithful as their Christmas and new year take home package, and urged the women to remain steadfast as more dividends of democracy would be made available in due course.\n\nSome of the dignitaries at the gathering include, Hon. C.O Edeh (Bond), HRH Igwe Sunday Onyekwere, Chief Chijioke Odih (Chi Motors), PG Enuogu Nkerefi Autonomous Community, Hon. Samson Egbo, PG Imeoha Nkerefi Autonomous Community, Hon.

          "text": "Exactly one year after a female secondary school student accused the former Ogun State Commissioner of Environment, Hon. Abiodun Abudu-Balogun, of sexual harassment, the police and the state government seem to have remained \u2018idle\u2019 over the case.\n\nDAILY POST reports that a 16-year-old girl, Barakat Melojuekun, had on January 2, 2021 accused Abudu-Balogun of sexual harassment.\n\nIn a viral video, the teenager said she was taken by an uncle to the former commissioner\u2019s house to work as a computer operator in Ita Otu, Ibiade area of Ogun Waterside Local Government.\n\nAccording to Barakat, she was locked up in a room with the then appointee of Governor Dapo Abiodun, who offered to help with money to start a business.\n\nShe alleged that, \u201cHon Abudu-Balogun now moved closer to me and pressed my breast. I moved away from him. He said won\u2019t I co-operate, and I replied by saying why will I co-operate. He now started pressing my breast, pressing my body and harassing me. Then, I was struggling to free myself from him to get freedom.\n\n\u201cHe started reciting some incantations and wanted to place his hand on my head, I now moved away his hand and said nobody touches my head. He wanted to force me into his room, but I struggled with him and started shouting.\u201d\n\nUpon the allegation and the angry reactions it generated, the Secretary to the Ogun State Government, Tokunbo Talabi, on January 3, 2021, announced the suspension of Abudu-Balogun, saying, \u201cthe suspension is a further demonstration of the commitment of Prince Dapo Abiodun Administration to fairness, equity, justice and the rule of law, no matter who is involved.\u201d\n\nThis was in spite of Abudu-Balogun\u2019s denial of the allegation, describing it as political blackmail.\n\nSince then, the state police command had carried on with its investigations, even as Barakat and her father, Adesola Melojuekun, announced that they wanted to withdraw the case from the police.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer in the State, Abimbola Oyeyemi, revealed on January 13 that the erstwhile government functionary was grilled by the then Ogun Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, himself.\n\nOyeyemi added that, \u201cWe (The police) have concluded our investigation and we have forwarded our report to the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) to know the next step.\n\n\u201cAccording to the nature of the case, we will conclude our investigation and forward the report to the DPP. It is the DPP that will now advise us on what the accused will be charged for. We are waiting for the advice from the DPP.\u201d\n\nThe command did not reveal the content of the report forwarded to the Department of Public Prosecutions.\n\nFew weeks after his suspension, our correspondent gathered that the politician was later asked to resign his appointment, which he reportedly did covertly, despite all entreaties to Gov Abiodun.\n\nOur correspondent observed that since January 2021, neither the police nor the Ogun State Government gave an update on the case.\n\nWhile the police did not state whether or not the DPP had replied its letter, the government did not speak on Abudu-Balogun\u2019s resignation as it also refused to appoint another commissioner for the Ministry of Environment.\n\nThe silence of the security agency and the government has been fuelling speculations that the case must have been swept under the carpet.\n\nThe Ogun State police spokesman, Oyeyemi did not answer several calls to his phone between Monday and Wednesday.\n\nAlso, a message sent to him on Tuesday by our correspondent was neither acknowledged nor replied.\n\nIn the same vein, the Ogun State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Waheed Odusile, neither picked calls to his phone nor did he respond to a message seeking information on why there has been no update on Abudu-Balogun\u2019s matter.\n\nMeanwhile, the new Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in the State, Oluwasina Ogungbade, has assured that the case has not been swept under the carpet.\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent on Wednesday, Ogungbade said that he was not in office when the incident happened, saying, however, that Ogun is a state with zero tolerance for any form of harassment or molestation.\n\nHe words: \u201cFirstly, we must realize that Ogun State is in the forefront in the fight against gender-based violence and exploitation of children. We have the Child Rights Act and we have the Gender-based Violence Law. This incident which you have referred to allegedly occurred in 2020 if I am correct. I do not dispute the fact that government is a continuum, but we must realise that I assumed office not too long ago and the year is just starting, this is the second working day in the year.\n\n\u201cI remember then that I also read about the incident, just like a member of the public. So, my knowledge, as we speak, of the matter, is limited to what I read then as a member of the public.\n\n\u201cBut I can assure you, at least with my knowledge of the law and how these things are done, that the matter must have received and is receiving attention.\n\n\u201cI know, for example, that after the police have conducted their investigation, they normally send the case file as you have said to the DPP for advice. I also know that at the level of the DPP, the process is in various stages. I know there are multiple officers who go through a file and pass it on to the DPP. It is not the DPP himself that takes up a file. There are some junior officers, about two or three, that will go through a file, make recommendations before it finally gets to the DPP and finally before it gets to the office of the Attorney-General.\n\n\u201cThis is done to ensure that errors are not made, that people who should be arraigned, prosecuted and possibly convicted are not left off the hook. It is also to ensure that people who should not be arraigned are not unnecessarily arraigned; where, for example, the evidence does not support it.\n\n\u201cThe point I\u2019m making is that this is a process that has been put in place to benefit everybody, the accused, the complainant and the society at large.\n\n\u201cI will just implore you to hold on a bit. I will get back about the situation of things as of today. You know I was not here physically when the incident happened, though the office was here. Just give me time to look at it personally, then we can talk further about it.\n\n\u201cBut, I can assure you, the matter has been swept under the carpet. It has not been swept under the rug. There has been no soft-landing of any sort. I can assure you that this is a government that is very much committed to wiping out gender-based violence, assault or abuse of minors.\u201d\n\nAsked to state the time it would require to get details of the case and the processes it has gone through, Ogungbade declined to give a timeline.\n\n\u201cI cannot give you a timeline. I know that you want a timeline, but I cannot give you one. This is because I would not want you to hold me to a timeline. We all know how this process works, if I give you a timeline and somehow for some reason, we are unable to meet that timeline, it may bring a bit of misunderstanding. I will just reiterate all I\u2019ve said that the matter has received and is receiving attention,\u201d Ogungbade said in a phone interview.",

You don\u2019t have any business being in my state right now and I want you to disengage right now.\u201d\n\nThe CSP replied, \u201cI am here on the instruction of the Inspector General of Police through the AGF.

Let\u2019s carpet-bomb the forests and bomb all of them,\u201d El-Rufai said in an interview with Arise TV.\n\n\u201cThere will be collateral damage, but it\u2019s better to wipe them (bandits) out and get people back to our communities so that agriculture and rural economics can pick up,\u201d he added\n\nThe Kaduna State governor said more investment in security personnel, technology and military equipment will wipe out bandits \u201conce and for all\u201d.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEl-Rufai attributed the prolonged inability of security operatives to curb banditry in the Northwest to a lack of encouraging factors.\n\nHe said the military and other security agencies \u201care doing their best, but they are overstretched\u201d and advised a more strategic approach to the fight against them.\n\n\u201cThese bandits operate in the periphery because their hiding place is in the forest. It\u2019s a major problem,\u201d El-Rufai said.\n\n\u201cThe reality is we don\u2019t have enough boots on the ground to address the myriad of security challenges that we face, and these security challenges are asymmetric, widespread, and there\u2019s no part of Nigeria that doesn\u2019t have one security problem or the other,\u201d he added.\n\nA notorious bandit leader, Bello Turji, yesterday freed over 50 kidnapped victims in his custody in Zamfara State, following military raids on neighbouring bandit camps in Zamfara and Sokoto forests.\n\nThe Co-Chairman of the State Committee on Finding Lasting Solutions to Banditry, Dr. Abdullahi Shinkafi, confirmed the development to Channels Television.\n\nShinkafi noted that the released victims were about 70, adding that the notorious bandit kingpin released them \u2018unconditionally\u2019.\n\nAccording to the police, arrangements are being made to evacuate all freed victims to the state capital, Gusau for profiling and medical treatment before they are released to their families.\n\nZamfara State Commissioner of Police Ayuba Elkanah, who briefed reporters yesterday at the Command Headquarters in Gusau, revealed that those freed included seven pregnant women, 19 babies, and 16 minors.\n\nGiving a breakdown of the number of the returnees, he explained that 68 people were released in Shinkafi while 29 others regained freedom in Tsafe.\n\nElkanah said: \u201cFollowing an extensive pressure mounted as a result of the ongoing military operation around the camp of a notorious bandits\u2019 kingpin known as Bello Turji that covers Shinkafi, Zurmi and Birnin Magaji Local Government areas, on 3rd January 2022, police tactical operatives deployed at Shinkafi axis received an intelligence report that some kidnapped victims were seen stranded in the bush.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe police operatives in collaboration with genuine repentant bandits and vigilante swung into action and rescued 68) victims from the forest.\n\n\u201cThe victims were in captivity for over three months and they include 33 male adults, seven male children, three female children, and 25 women including pregnant/nursing mothers respectively. The victims hailed from Magarya, Maradun, Gusau of Zamfara State and Sabon Birni LGA in Sokoto State.\u201d\n\nThe victims, according to him, were abducted for over 60 days from three villages namely Adarawa, Gana, and Bayawuri in Rijiya District of Gusau LGA.\n\nElkanah said all the rescued victims were treated by the joint medical teams of the state government and the police.\n\nHe stated that they would be debriefed and handed over to the state government before being reunited with their families.\n\nKaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan said bandits killed nine citizens, injured five and rustled hundreds of animals during three attacks across Igabi and Zaria local government areas.\n\nAruwan said the bandits attacked Kudu da Gari settlement in Sabon Birni, Igabi and killed seven residents.

A man, Auwal Koshe, was shot dead by the brigands, who then rustled about 250 goats and sheep from the settlement.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, bandits attacked another herders\u2019 settlement at Filin Idin Barebare, Zaria LGA, where they killed Abubakar Mohammad. Abubakar Aliyu sustained gunshot injuries to his ribs and is receiving medical attention.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nDespite calls from certain quarters in the country to decentralize policing, President Muhammadu Buhari has again rejected the call for state police as the solution to the nation\u2019s mounting security problems, expressing fears that it may be abused by state governors.\n\nHe made this position known when he spoke during an interview with Channels television on Tuesday night, referencing the relationship between states and local governments, which may not be at a good level.\n\nAlready the call has led to the setting up of regional security outfits by some state governments.\n\nAccording to President Buhari: \u201cState police is not an option. Find out the relationship between local government and the governors. Are the third tier of government getting what they are supposed to get constitutionally? Are they getting it? Let the people in local government tell you the truth, the fight between local governments and the Governors.\u201d\n\nHe suggested a bigger role for traditional rulers in bringing peace to communities stating that, the royal fathers know who is who in their localities.\n\nOn reports of farmers/herders clashes in the country where he wondered why people that used to coexist peacefully no longer do so, he explained: \u201cFor example, there were two Governors that came to see me about problems \u2013 Oyo state and one other state \u2013 because the herders were in their forests but the animals were going into the neighbouring farms, and eating the crops; I said, as far as I know, the farmers and herders have been co-existing in Nigeria for generations.\n\n\u201cLet them go and ask the local leadership what has gone wrong, why the break in communication between the local leadership and the herders.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nSpeaking on the traditional rulers, he added: \u201cThe role of traditional rulers must not be undermined, because in their areas they know who is who, even by families, not to even talk of individuals.\n\n\u201cSo, we have to revert to that system for us to have effective security in the localities.\u201d\n\nAsked about his view an interview in May 2018 about governors demand for state police, Buhari said: \u201cI want the Nigerian Constitution to be consulted first and see what it says. If it says they should be allowed, then they should be allowed but don\u2019t forget, how many times did we have to release money to states in the name of bailouts to enable them pay salaries?\n\n\u201cHow many states are able to pay their workers in time? And you add the police to them? People should look at this matter very well.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further on why he was not convinced about the idea of state police, he added: \u201cNo, I am not convinced. We should have solved the current insecurity in the North-east and South-south by now. Can the states be able to shoulder the burden of the polic?\n\n\u201cYou cannot just give someone guns and ammunition, train him and refuse to pay him, you know what will eventually happen.\u201d",

They have rescheduled the meeting this weekend and it comes up most likely on Sunday.\n\n\u201cAfter the meeting, they will come up with a proposed date and take it to President Buhari for ratification.

From all indications, the February convention will hold,\u201d the party chief said.\n\nOn the possibility of the convention holding in February when the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) had not set up zoning committee, the official said most of the party\u2019s leadership positions had been zoned already.\n\n\u201cThere is no need for setting up any zoning committee because we have concluded almost all the zonings and only waiting for the ratification from relevant authorities. I can also confirm to you, on good authority, that two key positions, the National Chairman and the National Secretary, have been zoned. While the chairmanship position has been zoned to the North Central, the National Secretary will go to the South East. In fact, the convention will more or less be based on consensus arrangement.

You\u2019re equally expected to operate within the confines of international best practices associated with engagement, and one of such best practices is that you can only use maximum force on groups, individuals that are declared terrorists and that is where the application of the Terrorism Act comes in place.\n\n\u201cWhatever military hardware you acquire, there are limits within the context of the international convention as to how it can be used, when it can be used, and against who it can be used. And that is how the idea of looking at the activities of the bandits, cattle rustlers, kidnappers come into being.\n\n\u201cOur assessment took into consideration that they are causing a major threat to the territorial peaceful co-existence and causing a major threat to lives with weapons. The idea then came about that indeed they (bandits) have satisfied the criteria of being declared terrorists within the context of the law so that whatever military hardware at the disposal of the Federal Government can best be used against them within the context of the international convention and within the context of the law.\n\nBut groups and individuals including Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Afenifere, Arewa Youth Consultaive Forum (AYCF), Senator Roland Owie and Livingstone Wechie told Daily Sun last night that the explanations were bizarre and untenable.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze, Alex Ogbonnia, said appropriate measures were needed to solve the problem of insecurity.\n\n\u201cFor example, if the bandits are declared as terrorists, it would require a higher nature of containment and it is the will power to apply this appropriate higher measure of containment that is lacking and that is why the government is still foot-dragging. The will power is not there because of the sentiments attached to it and so long as the government continues to live in denial, the problem will continue to replicate itself. So, it is advised that we call a spade a spade so that we will be able to map out the appropriate technology to contain the problem.\u201d\n\nNational President of MBF, Dr. Pogu Bitrus, also blamed government for lacking political will to do the needful.\n\n\u201cLet there be the political will to rout both the terrorists and bandits who are now classified as terrorists from existence. Let the Federal Government have the political will to do the needful and declare war on them and not just to send soldiers to protect communities.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, said Nigerians were not interested in gazettes or who the courts declared a terrorist and tasked the Federal Government to live up to its constitutional responsibility to ensure security and welfare of the citizens.\n\n\u201cGiving reasons why the judgment has not been gazetted is not what we are interested in. The Federal Government should ensure Nigerians are free to move from one point to another and their property secured. The primary essence of government is to ensure security and welfare of the citizens.\u201d\n\nReacting, leader of AYCF, Yerima Shettima, said the classification of bandits as terrorists was overdue and the excuses by Malami lacked traction.\n\n\u201cThe excuse that they want to follow international best practices is not acceptable. I don\u2019t know what the bandits are doing that is not an act of terrorism. The Federal Government must muster the political will to do the needful before we are all consumed. I am of the view that relying on international best practices is not in our best interest. I\u2019ve seen a situation where their interest may conflict with ours. We have our own peculiar case and we should deal with it our own way.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nOn its part, the Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) accused the Federal Government of double standards in handling Boko Haram and bandits in northern Nigeria.\n\nChairman, Media and Publicity Bureau of ADF, Abia Onyike claimed Federal Government was more aggressive towards IPOB than against the bandits or Boko Haram.\n\nAccording to him, that was why it purportedly went into alliance with the South East Governors and approached a court to declare IPOB as a terrorist organisation.\n\nHowever, Onyike said even the South East governors and the Ohanaeze leadership, under Chief Nnia Nwodo, which bought into the scheme of proscribing IPOB had already regretted their actions.\n\nContinuing, Onyike claimed Malami was not being consistent in the way he handles issues of civil or state security.\n\n\u201cWhy did he move quickly to declare IPOB a terrorist organisation in September, 2017 and why is he reluctant now to accept the declaration by another court of law which has designated the bandits in the North West as terrorist organisations?\u201d\n\nAnother group, Oke Ndigbo, also accused the Federal Government of being selective in its fight against insecurity and handling bandits and the Boko Haram with kid gloves.\n\nSpokesman of the group, Chika Nsofor blamed Malami for not advising President Buhari rightly on the issue.\n\n\u201cThey know what they are doing. They are selective and sectional in handling this issue. What did it take them to brand IPOB terrorist organisation but they have been deaf and dumb where it concerns blood sucking bandits and Boko Haram?\u201d\n\nFormer secretary general of Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Anthony Sani, however, excused the government.\n\n\u201cYou would recall it was the Federal Government that sought the court\u2019s declaration of bandits as terrorists in order to clear the legal path for the campaigns against the bandits.The court has declared the bandits as terrorists. So,I do not see any dire implication in the slow pace of the process of gazetting bandits as terrorists, especially when regard is paid to the fact that the delay has not stymied the campaigns against the bandits. More so that even without the court\u2019s declaration most Nigerians see any group that terrorizes and kill innocent people as terrorists per excellence. And so, any delay in gazetting is a matter of procedures and should not constitute any setback in the war against the bandits, which we have seen going on and forcing Zamfara bandits\u2019 kingpin,Turji, to release some 52 captives.\u201d\n\nHowever, former Senate chief whip, Roland Owie, cautioned Malami against misleading President Buhari.\n\n\u201cI am not a lawyer but as a lawmaker, the pronouncement of the court is as good as a gazzete, they have to obey. He should stop misleading the president,\u201d Owie said.\n\nMr. Livingstone Wechie, former spokesman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, public analyst and leader of The Integrity Friends for Truth and Peace Initiative (TIFTPI), argued that Federal Government\u2019s action has cast doubt of its sincerity in fighting insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason so justifiable that will approve of Malami\u2019s reluctance in ensuring that the needful is done to stamp out banditry in Nigeria. The loss suffered by Nigerians and Nigeria as perpetrated by banditry and their co-travelers in insecurity is incalculable.\n\n\u201cThe same speed with which Malami proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) with a Court order is the same that was expected of him on banditry or even more because banditry has incontrovertible evidence of grave terrorism than the former at the risk of comparison.\u201d",
          "summary": "On November 25, a Federal High Court in Abuja had declared the activities of all bandit groups in the country as acts of terrorism.\nBut he revealed that the process of gazetting the court order would be completed within a few days.\nAnd that is how the idea of looking at the activities of the bandits, cattle rustlers, kidnappers come into being.\n\u201cLet there be the political will to rout both the terrorists and bandits who are now classified as terrorists from existence.\n\u201cYou would recall it was the Federal Government that sought the court\u2019s declaration of bandits as terrorists in order to clear the legal path for the campaigns against the bandits.The court has declared the bandits as terrorists.",

          "text": "\u2022Claim they were acting on instructions from higher authorities\n\n\u2022Lagos governor stands his ground, prevails; invites parties to a meeting today\n\nChiemelie Ezeobi and\n\nSegun James in Lagos\n\nIn yet another cruel stab to the heart of Nigeria\u2019s federalism, the power and position of the Lagos State governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and by implication, all state governors in the country as chief security officers of their states, were challenged yesterday by some very junior police officers at the Magodo Phase II Estate in Lagos. The officers, led by one Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) Bimbola Oyewole, bluntly refused the governor\u2019s directive to vacate the estate, where they had purportedly gone to effect a court order.\n\nSanwo-Olu had requested the policemen to vacate the area in order to de-escalate a potentially volatile situation following a Supreme Court judgement on the ownership of some of the lands on which the estate was built. Many believed he was trying to avoid a breakdown of law and order as the parties awaited the resolution of the matter.\n\nIn a viral online video watched by THISDAY, the governor was seen at the estate trying to mediate in the faceoff between the estate residents and the policemen, said to have been deployed from Force Headquarters in Abuja. The policemen in company with suspected land grabbers and members of a family had besieged the estate for days in a bid to demolish some properties in execution of a Supreme Court judgement.\n\nAmid the ensuing hullabaloo and the rising tension occasioned by the action of the police, the residents had called on the governor to intervene, which he did by visiting the suburb to see things for himself. Having seen the tension firsthand, he directed the policemen to withdraw, given that it was a case between private individuals and the state government.\n\nBut according to Oyewole, the police team were allegedly sent at the behest of the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, and the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, and, thus, could only be asked to withdraw by them.\n\nIn the video, the governor was heard telling the officers at the estate, \u201cCan you call your superiors in Abuja and tell them that the governor is here and as the chief security officer, you don\u2019t have any business being in my state right now and that I want you to disengage right now?\u201d\n\nThe CSP was also heard replying, \u201cI am here on the instruction of the Inspector General of Police through the AGF. I am too small or too low to call them. Your Excellency, Sir, you can call them, Sir.\u201d\n\nThe governor further asked the number of policemen at the estate, but the CSP replied, \u201cMy men are here; they are all over the place, I cannot precisely tell you how many we are. For security purpose, I cannot tell you the number.\u201d\n\nFurther attempts by the governor to get Oyewole to disclose the number of the policemen proved abortive. At this time, the governor declared that the presence of the policemen was illegal, adding that he would make calls to the IG and the AGF to ensure the officers left the estate to allow for a peaceful resolution.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe policemen are not from the Lagos State Police Command. They said they are from Abuja. I don\u2019t know what other interest they have beyond keeping the peace of the country. This is not an expectation that I expect from them because they don\u2019t have any business here.\u201d\n\nOver 549 properties were marked with red, brown, and blue inks, with the inscription: \u201cID/795/88 Possession Taken Today 21/12/21 by Court Order.\u201d\n\nSince the planned demolition and siege on Magodo Phase II Estate, the police had been harassing the community with members of a family said to be executing the Supreme Court judgement on the ownership of the land on which the properties were built.\n\nBut when Sanwo-Olu and members of the state executive council, accompanied by the Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, visited the estate, the governor went to the police station within the estate, where he was addressed by Oyewole. The CSP told the governor that the police team had been sent from Abuja to execute the Supreme Court judgement on Magodo Phase II properties.\n\nBut the police team leader could not provide the copy of the said judgement, when demanded by the governor, prompting Sanwo-Olu to order the armed policemen to deactivate their operation and leave Lagos in the interest of peace. The officer declined, claiming to be acting on the orders of the AGF and IGP.\n\nAfter several phone calls to the authorities in Abuja, on whose command the heavily armed policemen were said to be acting, Sanwo-Olu briefed the residents and appealed to the concerned parties to stand down until the matter was resolved.\n\nHe, thereafter, invited all the stakeholders to a meeting in his office at 11am this morning, saying the issues called for proper deliberation in the interest of peace.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cI\u2019ve spoken extensively with the Inspector General of Police, the Hon. Attorney General, and we\u2019ve resolved all of the issues. So, what we would see is that there\u2019s going to be a total stand down. Tomorrow (today), we\u2019ll be inviting the representatives of the judgement creditors.\n\n\u201cWe have actually started a committee meeting, but I want to invite them again officially to my office tomorrow by 11am to come over with two, three of their representatives. The state government will be there, the residents\u2019 association will be there, and the police will also be there, so whatever it is that must have brought about all these troubles and heartaches will need to be brought there.\n\n\u201cWe will all go through every line of it and we\u2019ll come to an amicable resolution.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu pleaded with all concerned to help ensure peace in the estate, saying, \u201cI want all of our citizens to go about their lawful businesses knowing full well that nobody will be harassed, or any property trampled upon pending all of these conversations.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe will have an extended conversation tomorrow so that we can bring this to a final closure. So, I want to ask the residents, the executives, don\u2019t take the laws into your hands. Just go back home peacefully. The policemen have been recalled.\u201d\n\nResidents claimed that over 20 people were arrested in what they described as an unlawful invasion of their properties. They said most of the property owners were locked up in the name of Supreme Court verdict enforcement.\n\nA resident, Mrs Sabina Adeniyi, said, her son was arrested and locked up at the police station until the governor and the Lagos State Commissioner of Police came to their rescue.\n\nAnother resident, Mr Mojeed Jamiu, described the invasion by the police as illegal, and likened the potential outcome to the way the #EndSARS protests escalated. He wondered why the police would take laws into their hands through unlawful invasion of private residences.\n\nThe Residents\u2019 Association has, however, petitioned the Lagos State House of Assembly to investigate the invasion of the Magodo GRA Phase II by the police on the directive of the Inspector General of Police and the Attorney General of the Federation. The residents, in the petition by Ademorin Kuye and Rotimi Agunsoye, stated that the \u201cresidents of Magodo GRA Phase II, Shangisha, Lagos woke up on the morning of December 5, 2021, to the sight of hundreds of arm wedging thugs, stern-looking and fully armed policemen and members of the Shangisha Landlords Association purportedly to execute a judgement.\n\n\u201cAware also that the judgement that was supposedly being enforced was delivered in 2012 by the Supreme Court in Military Governors of Lagos State & Ors Vs Adebayo Adeyiga & Ors in Appeal No SC/112/2002, wherein the Apex Court Affirmed the judgement of the Court of Appeal and the High Court delivered on the 31st of December 1993 in suit No ID/795/88.\n\n\u201cFurther aware that the declaratory judgement of the Supreme Court only recognised the Judgement Creditors as being entitled to the allocation and reallocation of 549 plots of land in Shangisha Village, not possession of any land.\n\n\u201cCognizant that several attempts have been made by the Lagos State Government from 2012-2015, to settle the matter amicably making different engagements, with the Judgement Creditors presenting a proposal for reallocation in the Magodo Residential Scheme within the Badagry area of the state, which some of them accepted.\n\n\u201cInformed that the Lagos State Government again in 2016, initiated a settlement to reallocate Ibeju Lekki Coastal Scheme located in the Ibeju Lekki Area, but this was rejected by the lead plaintiff, Chief Adebayo Adeyiga, as government continues to dialogue with majority of the Judgement Creditors to reach a concession towards implementing the judgement\n\n\u201cWorried that despite the ongoing settlement efforts and the pendency of an interlocutory injunction dated December 1st, 2020, before the Court of Appeal, seeking an order restraining him and his agents, Chief Adeyiga purportedly encouraged by the Attorney General of the Federation and the Inspector General of Police, stormed the estate with unknown bailiffs and armed security operatives to execute a judgement that was purportedly delivered by Lagos High Court.\n\n\u201cWorried that the execution being presently executed through the office of the AGF with the connivance of the IGP is illegal as only the Lagos State Deputy Sheriff can execute same and not thugs aided by policemen.\n\n\u201cMore worried that the highhandedness and reckless show of force on the 5th of December 2021 and the 4th day of January 2022 in Magodo by Chief Adeyiga and his cohorts in blatant disregard to Order 8 Rule 17 of the Supreme Court Rules 2014 and Section 37 of the Enforcement of Judgement and Order Part III of the Sherriff and Civil Process Act, LFN 2004 can lead to loss of lives and properties and ultimately breakdown of law and order.\n\n\u201cMost Worried the Attorney General of the Federation is destabilising Lagos State by using his office to back this illegality as a meddlesome interloper and the instrumentality of state \u2013 the Nigerian Police Force and their illegal Court Bailiffs, to scuttle ongoing settlement between the Lagos State Government, Magodo GRA 2 Residents and the Judgement Creditors.\u201d\n\nThe people, therefore, urged the Lagos Assembly Committees on Justice, Public Petition and Police \u201cto investigate the involvement of the Attorney General of the Federation and the Inspector General of Police in the attempt to destabilise the peace of Lagos State, scuttle the ongoing settlement process and enforce an illegality.\u201d\n\nThey also urged the legislature to \u201crecommend appropriate sanction for any officer found culpable in the illegal enforcement and breakdown of law and order.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Producers\u2019 cartel agrees to pump 400,000 additional barrels in February\n\n\u2022Oil Prices Hit $80 per barrel\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nAt a conservative price of $70 per barrel, Nigeria might lose as much as $1.085 billion in February as a result of its likely inability to meet its production oil quota which was increased to 1.701 million barrels per day by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) yesterday.\n\nOn the average, Nigeria has managed to pump just over 1.2 million per day in the last few months, thereby losing the desperately needed foreign exchange (forex) by the country.\n\nWith the aforementioned production volume, the country was projected to lose about 500,000 barrels per day next month, which would amount to about 15.5 million barrels for the month.\n\nWhen multiplied with a pessimistic oil price of $70, it would give about $1.085 billion.\n\nLatest figures from the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (NURPC), for instance, indicated that the country was only able to pump 1.23 million barrels per day in August, 1.24 million barrels per day in September, 1.22 million barrels per day in October and 1.27 million barrels per day in November.\n\nBut with the increase of Nigeria\u2019s hitherto 1.683 million bpd in January 2022 to 1.701 million bpd by OPEC, meeting the target next month would be an uphill task, if not impossible.\n\nNigeria\u2019s three tiers of government that depend largely on oil revenues for survival are also forecast to continue to feel the impact of the severely hampered production.\n\nFor instance, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited was only able to remit N10.5 billion, which was 8.5 per cent of its projected N122.7 billion to the federation account last month.\n\nBut the national oil company had blamed the inability to restart oil wells shut down in 2020, when OPEC compelled member countries to cut production for the declining production.\n\nAdded to that, it had listed issues with host communities, vandalism, incessant force majeure on major assets as well as technical issues leading to shutdowns as some of the challenges bedevilling the industry.\n\nHowever, the major culprit remains Nigeria\u2019s ageing upstream infrastructure, following years of under-investment in expanding and modernising the assets.\n\nAlthough the Minister of State, Petroleum, Mr Timipre Sylva and the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, had set the end of 2021 to improve Nigeria\u2019s production and meet the quota and that has not materialised significantly.\n\nIn a statement after the 24th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting where the decision to allocate an additional 400,000 barrels per day to its members was arrived at on Monday, the producers\u2019 group stated that it was sticking to the gradual plan to unwind in view of the current oil market fundamentals and the consensus on its outlook.\n\n\u201c(We) reconfirm the production adjustment plan and the monthly production adjustment mechanism approved at the 19th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting and the decision to adjust upward the monthly overall production by 0.4 mb/d for the month of February 2022,\u201d it announced.\n\nFurthermore, OPEC asked its members such as Nigeria, to meet up their production quota and urged those who had exceeded their allocation to agree on a compensation plan by June this year.\n\n\u201cWe reiterate the critical importance of adhering to full conformity and to the compensation mechanism taking advantage of the extension of the compensation period until the end of June 2022.\n\n\u201cCompensation plans should be submitted in accordance with the statement of the 15th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting,\u201d it added.\n\nMeanwhile, in view of the development, oil prices rose about two per cent on yesterday, even as the cartel said there were indications that the Omicron coronavirus variant would have only a mild impact on demand.\n\nBrent crude, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark was up at $80.48 a barrel, highest since November, while the United States West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose by $1.48, or 2 per cent, to $77.56.\n\nAlso, global manufacturing activity remained strong in December, suggesting that Omicron\u2019s impact on output had been subdued.\n\nThe supply crunch caused by members\u2019 inability to meet production may even be worse as Libyan output is likely to be about 500-600,000 bpd lower in the coming weeks, more than offsetting the planned monthly increase in OPEC+ production.\n\nThe country\u2019s oil firm said on Saturday oil output would be reduced by 200,000 bpd for a week due to maintenance on a main pipeline, adding to disruptions two weeks ago after militia blocked operations at the Sharara and Wafa oilfields.\n\nSpeaking before the OPEC meeting, its Secretary General, Sanusi Barkindo, stated that in 2022, the outlook correlates with a generally positive trajectory with regard to market fundamentals.\n\nHe added that while there were some uncertainties, particularly related to mutations of the coronavirus, there are signs that the global economic recovery, supported by the contribution of the \u2018Declaration of Cooperation\u2019 participating countries to oil market stability, can continue in the year ahead.\n\nShare

Emefiele stated this in his personal comment at the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, a copy of which was posted yesterday on CBN\u2019s website.\n\nDriven by base-year effect, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) had revealed that Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 4.03 per cent in the third quarter (Q3) of 2021, compared with 5. 01 per cent recorded in the preceding quarter. And the federal government had listed the removal of fuel subsidy, which had been described as a major drag on the economy, as one of the reforms it expected to carry out this year.\n\nHowever, in the MPC communiqu\u00e9, Emefiele stressed, \u201cExtensive structural reforms are also needed to ensure that long-run paths of growth surpass potential.\u201d\n\nThe CBN governor noted that as business sentiments brightened, following the various supply-side supports by the apex bank and orderly implementation of macroeconomic policies, he expected domestic fragility to diminish with benign knock-on effects on welfare and livelihood.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur medium-term goal is to fast-track growth above historic average. Economic activities may reach pre-pandemic levels if the resilience of non-oil activities (especially agriculture and manufacturing sectors) are given continued impetus.\u201d\n\nNigeria recorded eight consecutive months of deceleration in headline inflation rate to 15.4 per cent in November 2021.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, this reflected the disinflation in both the food and core components.\n\nHe stated, \u201cRegardless, inflation remained at unacceptable levels, propped by structural inadequacies. Short-term projections indicate further moderations in expected inflation, especially as development financing continue to resolve supply rigidities.\n\n\u201cAnalysis of monetary condition indicated a tepid outcome during the review period with mixed interest rate developments. While weighted average inter-bank call rate fell 3.21 percentage points to 10.00 per cent in October 2021, open-buy-back rate gained 1.07 percentage points to 12.18 per cent.\n\n\u201cMonetary aggregates expanded in October, although, below provisional targets. Broad money growth at 7.10 per cent, was 2.54 per cent points below benchmark.\n\n\u201cThe observed growth was, however, attributable to the 9.12 per cent expansion of net domestic assets underpinned by credits to the private sector.\u201d\n\nEmefiele pointed out that the banking system remained stable and resilient with capital adequacy ratio (CAR) at 15.2 per cent; liquidity ratio, 41.2 per cent; and non-performing loans\u2019 (NPLs) ratio at 5.3 per cent.\n\nHe, however, acknowledged that in the forex market, the exchange rate pressure had persisted, despite external reserves accretion, while capital market metrics recorded positive performances.\n\nDeputy Governor, Economic Policy Directorate, CBN, Dr. Kingsley Obiora, called for the deployment of more growth-induced policies in order to stimulate economic activities. He said this was why he supported the current \u201c100 for 100\u201d policy on Production and Productivity (PPP) introduced by the CBN.\n\nObiora said, \u201cThe policy will boost production in the manufacturing sector; reduce imports and expand the non-oil exports; improve accretion to external reserves; and ensure exchange rate stability.\n\n\u201cAlso, the launching of the Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme (TIES) in November 2021 would enhance entrepreneurship and promote economic growth in strategic sectors of the economy as well as address the challenges of youth unemployment in the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, given Nigeria\u2019s huge investment needs and limited fiscal space, we must continue to attract the private sector to the critical sectors of the economy through Public-Private Partnership (PPP). This arrangement will enhance efficient development and productivity of infrastructure, human capital and other critical sectors of the economy on a sustainable basis.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, CBN Deputy Governor, Corporate Services Directorate, Mr. Edward Adamu, noted that notwithstanding the positive outcomes so far on inflation and growth, the economy was yet to attain the pre-pandemic levels on several fronts.\n\nEmployment, for instance, continued to be a major policy concern, he said, adding, \u201cThe surest bet to alleviating poverty is growth in employment, which is tied to economic (output) expansion.\n\n\u201cIn effect, the economy needs to expand at a faster rate than has happened up to third quarter 2021, to generate more jobs. Even at the 4.03 per cent overall real growth rate in Q3, some sectors (activities) were still struggling.\n\n\u201cAmong those, oil and gas, fishing, and oil refining stood out. These activities and some others that barely crossed the line would continue to require policy support in the short- to medium-term.\n\n\u201cThe need to sustain liquidity support to key economic activities is buttressed by the vulnerabilities in the horizon, including new variants of the coronavirus driving infection resurgence.\n\n\u201cThe moderation in inflation is occurring at a fast pace, attributable mainly to the consistent effort towards boosting supply, rather than a decline in demand.\n\n\u201cBarring any major shock, the current trajectory is expected to be sustained through the first quarter of 2022. Contrary to what is happening in most other climes, the recovery in domestic demand has not translated to new price shocks.\n\n\u201cNot only has output rapidly increased, the liquidity management strategy has kept banking system liquidity close to its optimal level.\u201d\n\nOn his part, an MPC member, Professor Adeola Adenikinju, expressed concern about \u201cthe uncertainty around 2022, being a pre-election year,\u201d noting, \u201cusually, foreign investors are less likely to commit to new investment in the country, affecting foreign exchange reserves.\u201d\n\nAdenikinju, however, advised, \u201cGoing forward, there is a need to harmonise monetary policy with the monetary and development targets in the newly approved Medium-Term National Development Plan.\n\n\u201cThere is also a need to decompose the intervention fund to those that went to boost aggregate demand and those that went into expanding the supply base of the economy. Careful examination of the contributions of these interventions should guide the decision on the pace of winding down the interventions in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe CBN must continue to explore ways of further de-risking the critical sectors of the economy to enable the deposit money banks to lend to them.\n\n\u201cAs CBN interventions cannot continue in the long term, domestic banks must take on the responsibility of supporting households\u2019 credit and the MSMEs. The unsustainability of petrol subsidy is an issue that the government should address urgently.\u201d\n\nAnother MPC member, Professor Mike Obadan, said with rising debt service-to-revenue ratio, currently put at over 90 per cent, heavy debt servicing was taking a toll on lean fiscal resources and could hinder availability of funds to finance critical government programmes and projects.\n\nObadan stated, \u201cAgainst the backdrop of limited domestic revenue mobilisation and little or no foreign exchange inflow from oil and gas exports, the government\u2019s fiscal capacity remains weak.\n\n\u201cIt requires continued monetary support to drive economic activities towards the desired sustainable growth trajectory.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has appointed Dr. Doyin Salami as his Chief Economic Adviser exactly 80 months after he was first elected in May 2015.\n\nThe appointment comes less than 16 months to the end of the president\u2019s second term and also marks the first time a Chief Economic Adviser would be appointed since Buhari assumed office in 2015. The president had for long resisted calls to appoint a Chief Economic Adviser who would be charged with formulating, coordinating and monitoring the implementing of his economic policies.\n\nAccording to a statement yesterday by the Media Adviser to the President, Mr. Femi Adesina, Salami was until his latest appointment the Chairman of the Presidential Economic Advisory Council (PEAC).\n\nA 1989 doctorate degree graduate in Economics of Queen Mary College, University of London, Salami, 59, is Managing Director and Head Markets Practice at KAINOS Edge Consulting Limited, and member of the Adjunct Faculty at the Lagos Business School (LBS), Pan-Atlantic University, where he recently attained the rank of Senior Fellow/Associate Professor.\n\nThe Chief Economic Adviser to the President is expected to address all issues on the domestic economy and present views on them to the president; closely monitor national and international developments, trends and develop appropriate policy responses.\n\nHe is also to develop and recommend to the president, national economic policies to foster macro-economic stability, promote growth, create jobs, and eradicate poverty, among others.\n\nSalami had few months ago warned that Nigeria\u2019s current public debt stock was unsustainable and had also lamented that with debt service-to-revenue ratio at 97.7 per cent (January to May 2021), the country\u2019s public debt profile was unmaintainable. He had also estimated that the country\u2019s debt stock was to hit about N54 trillion when Ways and Means as well as the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) liabilities and projected fiscal deficit for 2021 were considered.\n\nTo improve revenue, therefore, the economist had said the government must block leakages, unlock opportunities at state level, improve tax efficiency and coverage, and sell-off dead assets, which are estimated at $900 billion.\n\nSalami had stated, \u201cWhile overall expenditure has grown by 102 per cent, from N5 trillion to N10.1 trillion between 2015 and 2020, revenue increased by just 15 per cent.\n\n\u201cThis subdued government revenue is as a result of constraints around domestic production/investment; low tax base, as tax revenue to GDP still revolves around seven per cent; limited effort to explore and unlock opportunities for revenue generation at state level; over-centralisation and issues relating to efficiency in revenue collection.\u201d\n\nSalami had also said FDI inflow into Nigeria had revolved around $1 billion in the last five years, adding that FDI inflow in the second quarter of 2021 was $78 million, even lower than Q2 2020.\n\nHe had said the country\u2019s investment climate was being constrained by macroeconomic instability, policy inconsistency, inadequate infrastructure, insecurity, as well as tough business climate.\n\nWith about 12 months to the next general elections and 2022 being an electioneering year, some analysts have argued that the new Chief Economic Adviser might not have the opportunity to make the desired impact.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The utter disrespect, which underlines the response of the officer to the Governor establishes, beyond doubt, the impracticability of the current system, dubiously christened \u201cFederalism\u201d. An arrangement, which compels the Governor of a State to seek clarifications on security issues in his jurisdiction from totally extraneous bodies or persons, is a sure recipe for anarchy.\n\nWe condemn, very strongly, this brazen assault on decency. We call on the IG to explain the justification for this intrusion. This is not acceptable. Any expectations of rapprochement between so called federating units and federal security agencies are becoming forlorn, progressively, due to deliberate acts which mock our very avowal to ethics and professionalism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe condemn, in very clear terms, the role of the Attorney General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami SAN in this act of gross moral turpitude.\n\nWe, on our part, will continue to interrogate the current system, which treats elected representatives of the people as mere prefects, while appointed office holders ride rough shod over them as Lords of the Manor. If the purported Chief Security Officers of the States of the Federation require clearance from the office of the IG on matters within their areas of jurisdictions, only hypocrites will wonder why the current security crisis deepens and there appears to be no solution in the foreseeable future.\n\nWe condemn very strongly, this brazen assault on decency. We call on the IG to explain the justification for this intrusion. This is not acceptable. Any expectations of rapprochement between so called federating units and federal security agencies are becoming forlorn, progressively, due to deliberate acts which mock our very avowal to ethics and professionalism.\n\nWe stand by our brother, the Governor of Lagos State. We advise him to deploy the Regional security outfit in the State to protect the lives and property of the people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe call on the President and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces to rein in the excesses of certain elements bent on acting in a manner capable of eroding the bond of trust existing between the people and the Federal Government. It is preposterous for political appointees to seek to undermine the very structure of service upon which their appointments rest.",

          "title": "Here\u2019s why startup funding in the Maghreb ecosystem is low",
          "text": "Five North African countries\u2014Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya\u2014make up the Maghreb region, a historic island between seas of water and sand at the far end of the Arab world.\n\nLeaving out Libya, which continues to battle with consistent civil unrest and hasn\u2019t really broken ground in the startup world, and Mauritania, which is relatively small and mostly underdeveloped, startups across the other three nations raised an estimated $72 million in 2021. Algerian startups raised $30 million; Morocco recorded an all-time high of $29 million; and Tunisia closed north of $23 million.\n\nThis is a landmark growth from the $20.1 million raised across 19 deals in 2020. But when you break these numbers down into deals and compare them to Egypt\u2019s over $600 million funding in 2021, the conversation on how disturbingly small the funding is comes up. When it comes to venture funding, Egypt has always been North Africa\u2019s leader, capturing up to 80% of investment flows into the region from 2015 to 2021, per Baobab.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, this is not a question of why Egypt dominates with such a huge margin but why the combined startup funding secured by five nations couldn\u2019t match up with at least a quarter of what their neighbour did. What\u2019s the problem of the Maghreb region, and how can the ecosystem rise to its full potential?\n\nTo set the context, the region has several problems that, if not resolved soon, may not only continue to shrink the potential of its burgeoning startup sector but could bury it completely. But here are five reasons funding is low in this region.\n\nIntra-regional conflict\n\nThe Maghreb countries don\u2019t see eye-to-eye; they are archenemies or, as they are popularly called, \u201cenemy brothers\u201d. It\u2019s gradually becoming clearer that these nations are incapable of cooperatively forgoing their cat-and-rat history and assembling their social and cultural similarities to achieve greater economic progress.\n\nThis enmity continues to subdue the economic potential of the region because each of the countries practices a closed-border policy, which hinders seamless intra-regional trade, especially between Morocco and Algeria. These two nations arguably hold the key to the region\u2019s prosperity but have instead contributed the most to its misfortune.\n\nDue to the hostile intra-regional trade culture, it\u2019s difficult for startups to project growth in terms of expansion across the Maghreb. That means it\u2019ll be difficult for a Moroccan company to expand into the Algerian market.\n\nA 100-kilometer fence along the Morocco-Algeria border built by the Moroccan government\n\nFor example, when Chari, a Moroccan startup that helps retailers access consumer products faster and cheaper, wanted to expand into Tunisia, it had to set up an entirely new company that has no ties with the mother company apart from the name and business model.\n\n\u201cWe had to start another company in Tunisia, with all the paperwork. We had to also hire a new general manager and local team, and basically duplicate the company in Tunisia,\u201d said Ismael Belkhayat, co-founder and CEO at Chari. \u201cSo we don\u2019t handle Tunisia from Morocco; our Tunisia operation is independent.\u201d\n\nThis shows that there is no business exchange between the countries; there is no unified environment, which means there are no real regional markets. How do you then pitch an investor to back a venture that operates in a broken market like the Maghreb?\n\nHostile bureaucracy\n\nSurprisingly, countries in the Maghreb region aren\u2019t completely in disagreement with one other. They all have something in common: a heavy and killer administrative process. Across the region, there\u2019s an administrative office called Office des Changes, a bureau that regulates all monetary transactions. The body monitors money that comes in and goes out of each country.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: as a startup, you can\u2019t do as little as spend on Google or Facebook Ads without consulting the bureau. If you want to advertise on Google or Facebook, you either need to pay a local tax or get special authorisation to spend money outside Morocco or Algeria or Tunisia. This isn\u2019t only applicable outside of the Maghreb but also within it.\n\nHence, local companies mostly consume local services and not foreign. Therefore, it is more difficult to leverage sophisticated tools to drive growth or even maintain operations across the board\u2014the bureau has made sure of that. Imagine not being able to use Trello or Slack because your country won\u2019t allow you to subscribe to them without charging your purse dry.\n\nThis same principle is applicable to investors. It\u2019s a tad difficult and expensive to pull out your funds after investing in the Maghreb region; you must pay a great chunk of tax to the bureau. All of this rigid bureaucracy makes it difficult for startups in the region to pull foreign investment.\n\nThe big don\u2019t trust the small\n\nThe Maghreb tech ecosystem is an unusual one, and startups are literally on their own. In Nigeria, for instance, big conventional banks back fintech startups, and FMCGs invest in e-commerce and logistic upstarts.\n\nIt\u2019s not like that in the North African region.\n\nBig local companies mistrust startups, mostly because of how easy it is for startups to shut down in the region. For them to trust, back and also, maybe, provide seed \u201cmarket\u201d (goods supplies), you must have at least a two-years track record.\n\nThe irony is, if nobody is ready to back a green early-stage company, how will it survive and be around for the two-year mark? It\u2019s a vicious cycle that puts startups in a very tight corner because it seems everything is designed to kill them. How can foreign investors trust a brand or product that potential local investors won\u2019t back?\n\nLack of fintech innovation\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been a reason if Africa had not experienced the power of fintech. Startups that play in this space attract big-cheque investors. Across the four biggest African tech hubs\u2014Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt\u2014fintech attracts the biggest funding. Even in Egypt, where logistics and e-commerce attracted more funding, the $120 million investment secured by MNT-Halan, a fintech company, remains its biggest single deal till today.\n\nWhen you move up west, the absence of fintech starts to show. Noureddine Tayebi, founder and CEO of Yassir, an Algeria-originated Maghreb-focused logistic company that raised all the $30 million for Algeria, confirmed to TechCabal over a call that \u2014 even though his company is active towards building a fintech product that will support their business\u2014 there are currently no fintech solutions in Algeria. Belkhayat also said the same about Morocco, though he mentioned that Tunisia has a few like Paymee, which he was sure will likely survive because of the supportive startup act the country enacted in 2018.\n\nBoth local and foreign investors are bullish on fintech startups, especially in Africa, and going by trends from the last five years, it\u2019s expected that entrepreneurs in the Maghreb countries will double down on fintech and court investors for more investments.\n\nHowever, Belkhayat thinks for a fintech to actually scale, it needs enough capital that is mostly not available to their startups at the early stage. This may be another reason why these countries will be stuck with cash going forward.\n\nLanguage barrier\n\nThe Maghreb region speaks French and that makes it a francophone region. According to Belkhayat, most of the available foreign investors communicate in English, so a founder who can\u2019t speak English talking to an investor who doesn\u2019t understand nor speaks French is already disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cMost VC funds are based in countries where people speak English, compared to French-speaking countries. Therefore, it\u2019s more complicated for us to raise money than the anglophones,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nBefore 2021, venture funding in francophone African countries was extremely low, with Morocco and Tunisia being the leaders per investment. But this year, Senegal took the lead after fintech startup Wave raised a record $200 million Series A. Apart from this deal, VC funding activity remained pretty much subdued in the region last year.\n\nAlso, both Belkhayat, his co-founder Sophia Alj and Tayebi are American-trained businessmen who have worked with top American organisations and understand the languages of the investors. Niama El Bassunie\u2014the founder/CEO at Waystocap, another Morrocan e-commerce business that was acquired by Egypt-based Fawry\u2014is also a UK-trained and based expert. So when you zoom in, it becomes clearer why their companies were able to raise enough capital, unlike others.\n\nThese are the struggles every Maghrebian startup faces while trying to raise foreign investment. Most importantly, the intra-region conflict that has led to lack of business exchange has to be fixed. Once that\u2019s solved, just like a domino effect, every other thing should gradually fall in place.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "EDITORS\u2019 NOTES\n\nOur dear readers, I want to say a big thank you for loving the brand, engaging with the publication, sharing our articles and reports, attending our events, and doing business with us. It\u2019s been an incredible year for us in which we launched TechCabal 3.0 to build a truly pan-African technology publication. We established a physical presence in Kenya and hired Nairobi-based African American technology journalist, Alexandria Williams. Our newsroom grew in order to expand our coverage beyond startup reporting to include consumer tech and Big Tech, which covers the telecoms and banking payment sectors. We broke the earth-shattering news of the dissolution of First Bank\u2019s board by the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele, and the unsuspected high churn of tech talent within Nigeria\u2019s fifth-largest lender Guaranty Trust Bank, which was responsible for its poor mobile services. We have held hands with high-profile leaders in technology and governance to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill to straighten things up as the country\u2019s startup ecosystem witnessed shocking regulatory interruptions this year. Thankfully, the bill has been approved by the executive and is now headed to parliament, hopefully for passing into law soon. 2022 will see us expand into more countries and hire writers on ground across the continent to bring you unrivalled reports on the impact of technology in Africa. Thank you once again and remember to share our articles with your network, because everyone is invited! Happy new year! Adegoke Oyeniyi, Editor-in-Chief Hey everyone, So, how about 2021, am I right? What a whirlwind of a year for Africa\u2019s technology and business ecosystem. We raised money, backed new founders, launched new venture funds, acquired smaller companies, and expanded into new markets. I joined TechCabal in January of this year to help drive TechCabal\u2019s transition from a Nigerian tech publication to a pan-African tech and media publication. This transition had already begun before I said \u201cyes\u201d to the job, but TechCabal 3.0 really grew legs and picked up speed in 2021. And what a hectic year it was for the newsroom. Two brilliant TechCabal reporters moved to other companies (Alexander Onukwue is now at Quartz, and Muyiwa Olowogboyega is doing great work with Lemonade Finance). We brought in new reporters, contributors, and editors onboard (Michael Ajifowoke, Damilare Dosunmu, Timi Odueso, Alexandria Williams, Sultan Quadri and Kelechi Njoku). And as always, we wrote about the impact of technology in Africa. TechCabal Wrapped is our way of walking you through our most-loved and most-read articles in 2021. I encourage you to (re)read, share, and discuss your favourite pieces with your friends and peers. Thanks for sticking with us this year. I can\u2019t wait to connect with you in the new year. Happy holidays. \ud83e\udd42 Koromone Koroye, Managing Editor\n\nHere\u2019s what you enjoyed reading from TechCabal in 2021\n\nIn 2021, TechCabal published 683 articles, 265 editions of TC Daily\u2014including this one\u2014and 50 editions of Next Wave. the Next Wave. Of all these articles, here are the top ten you enjoyed reading the most:\n\n1. iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple released the iPhone 13 series with newer features like larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 terabyte storage), new A15 Bionic processors, smaller notches, and new camera features. In this article, we reached out to trusted Apple retailers across the country and explored the prices of the new iPhones in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. 2. The Next Wave: When tweeting becomes a crime The Next Wave is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that serves as a post-pandemic guide. In this edition, Alexander Onwukwue examined digital regression and social media activism in the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing Twitter ban. 3. Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nIn October, the High Court of Kenya finally issued its ruling on the issue, highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry. 4. Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures\n\nThe Great Resignation hit one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks and, like in other countries, was brought on by rampant stress and the shift to remote work.\n\nIn this article, Daniel Adeyemi and Goke Oyeniyi took us behind the scenes of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures, a phenomenon that plagued many of the bank\u2019s customers in the first half of 2021.\n\n5. Five top instant loan apps in Nigeria\n\nThis year, loan apps on the continent have garnered a reputation for their uncouth recovery methods. Loans, however, still remain the go-to outlet for developing businesses or personal finances.\n\nAs countries continue to clamp down on the unethical practices of some of these apps, TechCabal made a list of some of the best instant loan apps democratising access to credit and bridging financial inclusion with healthy practices.\n\n6. Meet Abeg, Big Brother Naija sponsor and app of the hour\n\nWith an audience of 309 million and billions of impressions across social media, Big Brother Nigeria is one of West Africa\u2019s most-watched television programmes.\n\nLast year, tech companies like Kudabank, Patricia, and even Flutterwave threw their weight behind the show with sponsorship. This year, one of the biggest sponsors of BBN, however, was a newcomer platform called Abeg, who reportedly sponsored the show with $2 million.\n\n7. Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank freezes bank accounts of fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka\n\nAs this year marks several wins for the Nigerian startup scene at large, it\u2019s also the year the Nigerian government came down hard on the ecosystem. From crippling bans to questionable policies, Nigeria went after creators and founders in the economy.\n\nIn August, this manifested with the Central Bank of Nigeria freezing the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka.\n\n8. From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate\n\nOne of the trending questions of the ecosystem in 2021 was: How can more people get into tech?\n\nTo this end, TechCabal wrote quite a number of articles and flagships to help people navigate the wonderful world of tech. This article, however, takes a different approach with a narrative voice that follows the story of Kemi, who went from hawking dry fish to working as a software engineer at Bloomberg.\n\n9. How Herconomy raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours\n\nIn 2021, Nigerian startups raised about $1.4 billion. TechCabal has done a number of stories on some of these raises, most of which are led by venture capitals or private equity firms.\n\nVery few have angel investors leading the raises and even fewer have product users participating in those ventures. In this article, we explored how one startup, Herconomy, raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours, with members of its community as angel investors.\n\n10. Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem pays tribute to Nnena Nkongho\n\nNnena Nkongho.\n\nThe African tech ecosystem mourns the passing of Nnena Nkongho, an African investor who championed diversity and excellence.\n\nAs a way of remembering Nkongho\u2019s greatness and contribution to technology communities at home and abroad, TechCabal published tributes sent to us by people who knew and worked with Nkongho during her lifetime.\n\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed any of our articles, please forward and share them with your networks on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "21 things that happened for the first time in 2021 in the African tech scene",
          "text": "2021 has been a noteworthy year that has seen the African tech sector bounce back from the difficulties it faced in 2020. Here\u2019s a list of 21 things that happened for the first time in the African tech scene this year.\n\nAfrican artists raked in thousands of dollars from selling NFTs (digital art)\n\nThe growing popularity of NFTs has puzzled many, yet it has opened the door for artists and creators from Africa to sell their content to a global audience. With global sales of NFTs topping $2.5 billion in the first half of 2021, we saw African artists like Niyi Okeowo and Nyahan Tachie-Menson sell thousands of dollars worth of NFT; Osinachi sell $75,000 worth of crypto art in 10 days; and Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s work got featured on the New York Times Square billboard.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened in Malawi.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened its doors in July, in Malawi. The school was built by 14Trees, a joint venture between a British development firm and a Swiss company that specialises in building materials. The school\u2019s walls were printed in just 18 hours, compared to the several days it takes to build with conventional building materials. The process in general significantly minimises the time, cost, and materials used for building houses and schools. Hopefully, this technology can help address the severe shortage of schools in the country.\n\nThe African startup ecosystem raised a record $4 billion+ in venture capital funding\n\n2021 year was a landmark year for the African tech ecosystem, raising over $4 billion via 754 deals in venture capital funding. The Big Four\u2014Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt\u2014accounted for 80% of the total amount raised and 76% of the deals.\n\nAn autonomous drone was deployed to attack humans in Libya, the UN says\n\nA report published in March 2021 by the United Nations (UN) Panel of Experts on Libya stated that a drone had been used to \u201chunt down and remotely engage\u201d soldiers who are believed to have been loyal to Libya\u2019s General Khalifa Haftar. This case revisits the conversation on the ethics of using drones in military attacks. How reliable is the technology behind drones, and what could be the implication of a malfunction or error?\n\nApple appointed its first-ever country leader for Nigeria\n\nApple has sold over a billion smartphones (iPhones), yet they account for less than 10% of the smartphone market in Nigeria. In March, the announcement of the appointment of Teju Ajani as Apple\u2019s first-ever managing director for Nigeria is an indication of the tech giant\u2019s interest in Nigeria.\n\nAfrican regulators began responding to the unethical practices of digital lenders\n\nAfter many years of complaints about the predatory tactics of digital lenders, regulators in Nigeria and Kenya began taking steps to curtail it. A Nigerian regulator imposed a \u20a610 million naira ($18,000) fine on Soko Lending company and the Kenyan government recently put a law in place to curtail the excesses of digital lenders.\n\nApple Pay launched in Africa\n\nEight years after Apple launched Apple Pay, its payment and digital wallet system, the tech giant finally brought it to Africa, with its launch in South Africa this year. This launch came three years after Samsung launched its Samsung Pay in South Africa. This move speaks of Apple\u2019s intention to increase its penetration in sub-Saharan Africa where the adoption of digital payments has increased since the start of the pandemic.\n\nGhana kicked off its first fully digital census in West Africa\n\nIn June, Ghana started its first fully digital national census\u2014the first ever in West Africa. The country\u2019s last census was in 2010, and it put the population at 24.6 million. The country has, every 10 years since 1981, conducted the Population and Housing Census (PHC) but was forced to postpone the 2020 census due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nNigeria became the first African country to roll out a digital currency\n\nOn October 25, Nigeria became the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world, to introduce a digital currency. Developed by Barbados-based fintech company Bitt Inc., the eNaira is a legal tender just like the naira. According to the country\u2019s central bank, it must be accepted by all merchants and business outlets as a form of payment in Nigeria. The digital currency is expected to boost cross-border trade and financial inclusion, make transactions more efficient as well as improve monetary policy.\n\nSenegalese TikTok megastar Khaby Lame hit a 100 million followers milestone without saying a word\n\nIn August, Senegalese-born Khaby Lame became the second person ever to hit and cross the 100-million-followers mark on TikTok. Lame, a 21-year-old former factory worker living in Italy on a Senegalese passport, has crafted a comedic brand that has resonated around the world by putting so-called life hacks or complicated manoeuvres through the lens of intuitive everyday options.\n\nGoogle announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa\n\nAt the first virtual Google for Africa event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company\u2019s plan to invest $1billion over five years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\neCommerce giant Amazon stepped up its presence in Africa\n\nFor a long while, there have been questions about when Amazon will kick off operations in Africa. Well, Amazon answered that question this year. First, it affirmed its commitment to Egypt by replacing Souq.com as Amazon\u2019s selling platform in the country with Amazon.eg. This announcement also came with the inauguration of an Amazon fulfilment centre in Egypt. There was also the announcement of Amazon\u2019s controversial African headquarters in South Africa.\n\nThere was an acquisitions spree across Africa\n\nThis year saw a number of companies being acquired, most of them for undisclosed amounts. MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider, was acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nMFS Africa acquired Baxi. MaxAB, an Egyptian B2B marketplace, acquired WaystoCap. Ghanaian fintech startup, Zeepay, acquired 51% of Zambian counterpart Mangwee. Plentywaka acquired Stabus Ghana after $1.2m seed funding. Other notable acquisitions include JIji acquiring Cars45, and Ourpass acquiring Storemia.\n\nThe Ethiopian government launched its own mobile money service\n\nIn May 2021, Ethio telecom launched its own mobile money service, TeleBirr, to cater for the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. Two months after its launch, TeleBirr reported that it has gained six million users. The new service is expected to make a difference in Ethiopia where the banking system is seen as inefficient, with only 19 commercial banks serving the entire population.\n\nFrancophone Africa got its first unicorn in Wave\n\nWave, a spinoff from Asia- and Africa-focused remittance company Sendwave, raised $200 million in a Series A round to become the first unicorn from the French-speaking region of Africa. Why Wave? The startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nSix months and counting: Nigerian Twitter ban\n\nThe Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in June, following the social media platform\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by Buhari, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter has since then triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nSudanese tech got its first foreign funding in 30 years\n\nalsoug, the largest digital marketplace in Sudan, raised a $5 million investment round co-led by Egyptian fintech unicorn, Fawry, and a \u201cwider consortium of Western venture capital firms\u201d. This investment marked the first foreign venture capital investment into the Sudanese tech ecosystem since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period.\n\nSomalia got its first Visa card payment service\n\nVisa partnered with the International Bank of Somalia (IBS Bank) to launch Somalia\u2019s first Visa card payment service. This came six years after Mastercard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market. This partnership is an important indicator that Somalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headway towards reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nEthiopia awarded its first telecom license\n\nIn May, Ethiopia awarded its first telecom licence to a consortium made up of Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc, and Sumitomo Corp. The next month, Ethiopia launched a tendering process for the proposed sell-off of a 40% stake in the state-owned Ethio Telecom to private investors. These actions are all parts of the government\u2019s broader plan to open up the economy.\n\nTwitter opened its first Africa office in Ghana\n\nIn April 2021 social media giant Twitter announced Ghana as its choice for an African headquarters. The move came as a surprise to some who expected it to be Nigeria, a country with more Twitter users and a larger population overall.

          "title": "Ask an Investor: Twelve insights from Africa\u2019s top investors",
          "text": "At one point or the other, every startup founder or CEO was a newbie in navigating the murky waters of institutional investment. They maybe even got burnt because they didn\u2019t know the right questions to ask, or what to look out for.\n\nSo, we started the Ask an Investor series to help explain why and how investments in companies happen in Africa from the people who make them happen.\n\nIn the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed over 20 investors who\u2019ve shared their thoughts on what investors look out for in founders and startups before investing, the lessons learnt and mistakes made, key trends, and other relevant nuggets.\n\nI\u2019ll be highlighting a few insights from the published interviews here and think you should read the full version of the interviews.\n\nFounders Factory: A hands-on approach\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that I learnt early on from my conversations with different investors, it\u2019s that all investors are not the same. Their approach to investing is often influenced by their background and experiences. While most people easily associate investors with just money, Founders Factory Africa (FFA) would rather have you think of more.\n\nIn a conversation with Sam Sturm, one of the founding partners of FFA, he explains why:\n\n\u201cWe believe that capital isn\u2019t the only way to support a business. You need it so that you can execute but at the end of the day, capital isn\u2019t what solves problems. We believe that the challenges of product-market fit, customer acquisition, or retention are not the kind of challenges that capital alone can solve. Those are the challenges that you\u2019re looking to entrepreneurs to solve, that you\u2019re looking to the team to solve. If you can supplement them with experienced and talented people, you\u2019d be successful.\u201d\n\nAlongside providing capital, FFA is a venture building studio, this means that a portfolio startup can expect to get support from private coaches, product managers, product designers, etc.\n\nMicrotraction: A novel approach\n\nFive years ago, Yele Bademosi saw that it was difficult for people to raise funds if they didn\u2019t have a wealthy relative or network, so he set out to make it easier for founders to raise money.\n\nBut first, the Microtraction team had to do away with the status quo. This meant no batches, no programmes, and no demo days. Microtraction invested on the go.\n\nAnother different thing about Microtraction\u2019s approach is its bias for investing in startups with technical founders/co-founders. Why?\n\n\u201cIf we give you money, and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders.\u201d Bademosi explained. \u201cWe\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\u201d\n\nAcumen: Patient capital\n\nThe original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. So Acumen goes a step further beyond providing donations and grants to startups. It\u2019s a non-profit that uses donations received to invest in startups working on socially relevant issues.\n\nMeghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen, explained this: \u201cIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen, and we redeploy and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\u201d\n\nAcumen is able to invest at an early stage and wait a little longer than other traditional venture capital firms because they don\u2019t have to return the money back to donors.\n\nSawari Ventures: North Africa\u2019s leading VC firm\n\n2021 was an exciting year for North Africa as it garnered a lot of attention and funding. Before the boom, Sawari Ventures, which was founded over a decade ago, has been backing North African startups. The founders of Sawari Ventures also founded Flat6Labs\u2014the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator.\n\nIn our conversation, Tamer Azer explained the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup.\n\n\u201cVC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime. They have a 10-year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing, and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\n\u201cJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing cheques, we have to get the money to be able to write these cheques first. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these cheques. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\u201d\n\nUnconventional Capital: Removing gut feelings and bias in startup investment\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of my conversation with Franziska Reh, CEO of Unconventional Capital, I understood why the word \u201cunconventional\u201d was befitting.\n\nHere\u2019s how early-stage investment mostly happens: An investor and an ambitious entrepreneur get talking. After a few background checks and business plan conversations, the investor decides whether to invest. But not before checking their gut feeling. Along the way the investor is constantly asking, \u201cDoes this feel right?\u201d\n\nAt Uncap, the team decided to flip this approach upside down by relying on algorithms to make these decisions.\n\nReh explained, \u201cAt Uncap, in our investment process, no one in our team makes investment decisions. The selection process is based on an algorithm that focuses very much on the potential of the entrepreneur. It\u2019s a model that measures entrepreneurial potential as a predictor of future success. Afterwards, we invest through a standardised model.\u201d\n\nThis model allows Uncap to invest in thousands of entrepreneurs. Interestingly, Uncap exits the portfolio companies gradually over a period of time\u2014an unconventional exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThese companies we invest in buy back their equity through 5% of their quarterly revenues. They transfer 5% of their quarterly revenues to us. By this act, over time, they buy back the whole investment, plus the price that we\u2019ve paid before. It\u2019s a fixed multiple on the investment, it\u2019s basically the same for everyone.\u201d\n\nTomi Davies: Tales of an African angel Investor\n\nThe conversation with Tomi Davies, or TD as he\u2019s fondly called, started off with him explaining how he was able to partner with some of the brightest minds on the continent to build the angel investment space in Africa. He was part of the team that started the Lagos Angel Network and the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nWhile many know TD for his role in the African Angel community, but he\u2019s more than that.\n\n\u201cI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, and sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum,\u201c Davies said.\n\nHe also shared his proprietary framework for investing in startups.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\n\u201cFinally, you ask: is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also, is the business model sustainable? Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\u201d\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: Angel investor and startup advisor\n\nWhen I visited Ghana in July, Ato Bentsi-Enchill was one of the people I met. One thing that stood out to me was that he moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did he learn all these?\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network.\u201d Bentsi-Enchill explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\u201d\n\nAs a startup advisor, he helps African startups raise capital and protects them from difficult investors. In our conversation, he cites some instances where he\u2019s helped.\n\n\u201cFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts\u2014a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\u201d\n\nAdam Molai: African industrialist\n\nZimbabwe is known more for the Victoria Falls (the largest waterfall in the world) than its tech ecosystem, but still, Adam Molai is one of the few investors looking to change that.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice, and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and, through the Jua Fund, has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove, and many others.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye, he shared one of the best practices startups should adopt in getting funded.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund, this is what I must put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\u201d\n\nSunu Capital: A pan-African fund with a solo general partner\n\nSince Benjamin Schmerler left the United States at the age of 18, he\u2019s lived and worked in nearly every corner of the globe. Interestingly, he stumbled on the name for his firm\u2014SUNU Capital\u2014 while in Senegal.\n\nHe heard the word sunu in a song, and when he found out that it meant \u201cour\u201d, it resonated with him. \u201cI used it as the name of my firm because it\u2019s a simple word and, more importantly, because I believe in collective effort; working together to build more wealth for everyone and leave this planet a better place for our children,\u201d Schmerler said.\n\nOne thing he\u2019s been thinking about recently is how to aggregate African markets.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is how to break the borders between countries so we can get a larger aggregated market that can be efficiently served. I believe if we can do this, we would see exits on a scale beyond anything we have seen to date.\n\n\u201cI talk to entrepreneurs all the time and they show me the total addressable market (TAM) of Africa, a map of 54 countries. They hint at the possibility of expansion, and I\u2019m thinking, how do we unlock Gabon? What does it take to be a part of Cameroon as well? There is so much untapped potential all over the continent that I am absolutely excited by infrastructure that turns the 4 or 5 markets where all the activity is happening into 10, 20, 30 countries over the next handful of years.\u201d\n\nKepple Africa: Creating new industries\n\nA few minutes into our conversation, Satoshi Shinada reminded me that I need to visit more African countries. At the age of 18, he left Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years.\n\nFor Kepple Africa Ventures, the big vision is to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nIn our conversation, Shinada shared some mistakes he\u2019s made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything, and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\n\u201cAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\u201d\n\nLoftyInc: Not playing by the rules of VC investing\n\nIn 2012, Idris Bello and his partners, then in their early 30s, left their lucrative jobs and raided their savings to create the LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund. Over the years, through trials and errors, they\u2019ve seen some level of success. Today, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella.\n\nBello, who believes in sharing a full picture of his investor journey, shared some notable deals missed or mistakes made along the way.\n\n\u201cThose are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process there. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\n\u201cMost of the mistakes we made were as a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 cheque. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\u201d\n\nCapria ventures: Backing local funds and startups\n\nFive years ago, Jack Knellinger, Dave Richards and Will Poole formed Capria ventures, an investment firm that started out investing in local funds (VC firms) across the global south\u2014Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Recently, Capria Ventures has begun investing directly in startups, providing the much needed growth stage capital for them.\n\nToday, Capria Ventures has investment activity in about 50 countries with $650 million worth of current assets under management.\n\nIn my conversation with Jack Knellinger, he enlightened me on how they support VC firms\u2014a subject rarely spoken about.\n\n\u201cObviously, the main thing top of mind is fundraising\u2014helping them close their fundraising. Here, it involves everything from introductions to reviewing pitch materials. We look at how the funds are being positioned as well as the terms and negotiations with limited partners to ensure there\u2019s alignment between the fund managers, general partners, and limited partners.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the fundraising is done, we move to portfolio management. How are they putting in place the right systems and processes to grow, scale, and institutionalise the firm? Here, there\u2019s a wide range of things to be done in that regard, from team development to appropriately conducting due diligence before investing. When the fund managers have built up their portfolio of companies, we move to how they think about exits. What\u2019s the right time to exit? Do they want to look at partial exits?\n\nWhen a firm has mastered these aspects and gone on to raise multiple funds. We look at how they\u2019re telling the story of the firm and the funds you\u2019ve managed.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all for this year! Thank you to all the investors who took their time to talk to me and help others learn more about investing in startups.\n\nWhich investors/firms will you like me to talk to in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

The Nation reports that the company has met the six conditions imposed by the Nigerian government.\n\nTo refresh your memory, here are the conditions that the Federal government insisted on: an office in Nigeria, a country representative, payment of fair taxes, register with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC)/get a license from the National Broadcasting Commission, sensitivity to national security and cohesion, and train Nigerian IT personnel and strategic intelligence officers on how to report Twitter abuse/infractions noticed by the government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a source quoted by The Nation, Twitter\u2019s hesitance to open an office in Nigeria last year stemmed from it not being part of its 2021 budget. The source also expressed optimism that as the new year rolls out, the company will open an office.\n\nWhile it sounds like good news, this raises a few concerns. The first is that going by the report, Twitter is being coerced into opening an office in Nigeria. Ideally, this should create jobs and government revenue but could ensure government control over the microblogging site.\n\nAppointing a country representative also enables the government to hold someone accountable whenever they believe that Twitter has infringed on some of its laws.\n\nThis is the second time that reports have suggested that the ban could be lifted, and Nigerians would hope that things play out differently this time. However, owing to Twitter\u2019s silence on negotiations, it could be that it takes some time before the ban is lifted.\n\nGahez raises $2 million in pre-seed funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEgyptian eCommerce startup, Gahez, has raised $2 million in pre-seed funding. Disruptech Ventures led the round with Egypt Ventures, Tanmeyah, Afropreneur fund, and other angel investors participating.\n\nLaunched last year, the startup joins a slew of B2B eCommerce startups trying to digitise operations for Africa\u2019s merchants and manufacturers. Having worked with over 15,000 merchants and 142 manufacturers since its launch, the startup plans to use this fresh injection of capital to build its technology and recruit more staff.\n\nCo-founder and CEO, Wael Olama, in a statement, said, \u201cWe are on a mission to revolutionise the way retailers shop for their stores by relieving the stress of managing and sourcing. We believe that the Egyptian/African apparel market is untapped and widely fragmented, which provides Gahez with the perfect opportunity (relying on technology) to scale and position itself within the sphere.\u201d\n\nFedaPay secures funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeninese startup, FedaPay, has announced a first round of investment from the Benin Business Angel Network (BBAN).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaunched in 2018, FedaPay provides merchants with an efficient and secure payment system, enabling them to receive payments using cards and mobile money. Although the startup was founded in Benin, it has recently launched its services in neighbouring Niger.\n\nIn a statement, FedaPay\u2019s technical team lead and co-founder, Boris Koumondji, said, \u201cFedaPay is better than its Beninese competitors because it distinguishes itself by offering customised and flexible pricing that corresponds with its merchants\u2019 business models.\n\n\u201cFedaPay\u2019s payment method coverage allows them to take payments from customers via mobile money and bank cards in a single integration. All transactions that flow through the platform also adhere to the PCI DSS security criteria.\u201d\n\nCatch up on some of our best stories from 2021\n\n6 Nigerian agencies unite to fight data privacy abuse by money lending fintechs\n\nHow agritech startups are helping to check food inflation in Nigeria\n\nNigerian eCommerce platform, MallforAfrica, has shut down operations, possible rebranding could be imminent\n\nOpportunities\n\nAre you a 2021 Batch C Corps member with your PPA in a rural or semi-urban community in any of the 36 states of the country or Abuja?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nOluwanifemi, here.\n\nIt seems 2020, the year of the coronavirus, is looking to become a trilogy. For the third year running, people are living through different levels of lockdowns and increasing cases of COVID-19 and its variants. On the last day of 2021, Israel reportedly recorded a double infection of influenza and coronavirus \u2014 Florona \u2014 in a pregnant patient.\n\nAlthough this is not a variant of the virus like Delta and Omicron, experts can\u2019t say how severe a combination of this kind could be. Some countries are still reconsidering lifting lockdowns, while others have experienced more than three waves of the pandemic already. I\u2019m tempted to ask, \u201cwhen does all this end?\u201d So, this is another reminder for you to stay safe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, a lot happened in the last year; apart from Crypto Explorer \u2014 Emmanuel mentioned this yesterday \u2014 there are some interesting topical discourses/series we introduced/re-introduced in 2021 that I want to remind you of (I promise, this has nothing to do with COVID-19). But, before that, let\u2019s do a quick one on what happened to a once-upon-a-time sweetheart of the smartphone industry.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing\n\nBlackberry\u2019s demise\n\nThe Expert series\n\nLiving with learning disabilities\n\nRIP Blackberry devices, for reals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom January 4, 2022, devices using the Blackberry OS will be unable to make or receive calls (including emergency numbers like 911), send or receive texts, use mobile data or Wi-Fi. However, this does not affect Blackberry devices running on Android OS.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time coming. A steady decline in market acceptance has been noticed since 2013. The company stopped manufacturing its own phones in 2016 and began outsourcing to other hardware partner companies. In 2021, it gave prior notice about this discontinuation.\n\nNot exactly a complete death: Blackberry continues to run as a cybersecurity company. It pivoted to this enterprise in 2016. So, we could call this the end of an era.\n\nLooks familiar? Blackberry abandoning its mobile phone OS venture reminds me of the abrupt death of Windows phones in 2016 after running for six years. Half the time, experts predicted that it was bound to fail.\n\nSome quarters blamed the demise on the fact that Microsoft couldn\u2019t stand the market dominance of Google\u2019s Android OS and Apple\u2019s iOS. Others faulted its rigidity in adapting third-party apps, among other deficiencies.\n\nAlso, recall that Nokia and Motorola shared a similar fate, although the former was more shocking. Do you have a history with Blackberry? Please tell me about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2022 gets even better\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, we re-introduced The Experts series to our readers. It features the lives and exploits of African tech specialists across the world. So far, I\u2019ve picked the brains of the genius personality who, along with his team, built Interswitch\u2019s Quickteller, Wale Abba; talked to Rachael Akalia, one human that embodies the brand called Patricia Technologies, a Nigerian-founded Estonia-based alternative currencies startup.\n\nSubsequently, during a virtual chat, I got Mopewa Ogundipe to talk about her profession and journey to becoming the software engineer behind Clubhouse\u2019s long-awaited Android app; Nigerian-American, Abake Adenle also opened up about moving from a successful career in the UK\u2019s investment banking space to becoming an entrepreneur running a startup building a voice recognition and speech synthesis software for five African languages.\n\nThe last editions for 2021 featured famous music artist and tech investor, Mr Eazi, and the leader of open banking in Nigeria, Adedeji Olowe, who demystified the concept of open banking while talking about his life.\n\nAlong the line, Kudi\u2019s Product Manager, Nifemi Akinwamide, opened our eyes to what it looks like to navigate a learning disability to become successful.\n\nThis year, look out for new editions that promise to be even more exciting and instructive. Subscribe to get notified.\n\nHow much do you know about learning deficiencies?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms like dyslexia, dysgraphia, ADHD, and dyscalculia are rarely discussed within the Africa context, even for people living with the conditions. In 2020, our reporter, Victoria Fakiya, did in-depth reflections on these disabilities and discussed assistive technologies that can make life easier for people living with them. Click on the hyperlinks to catch up.\n\nMeanwhile, Precious Mogoli and Ogheneruemu Oneyibo also had interesting takes. Check them out here: Technology is awesome, but it\u2019s yet to conquer stuttering\n\nAnd here: What does communication in a techy world mean for Nigeria\u2019s deaf people?\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nTesla stock jumps after reporting record vehicle deliveries for 2021.

Yes, we\u2019re grateful for the respite of the public holiday, but you\u2019re probably working yourself into that mental space to resume work for the year.\n\nSince 2015, every New Year has seen Techpoint celebrate its birthday. On January 1, 2022, Techpoint turned 7, and we\u2019re entering the next frontier. Check out what that means in our Chief Servant, Muyiwa Matuluko\u2019s new year address.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechpoint Africa is 7! The next frontier\n\nWhat I\u2019m discussing\n\nA momentous 2021\n\nSignificant regulatory moves to watch closely\n\nIndustry trends for 2022\n\nA momentous 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was an incredible year for Africa\u2019s tech space in 2021, which saw five startups publicly disclose their valuations as unicorns. Led by Flutterwave in March 2021, OPay, Wave, Andela, and Chipper Cash joined the enviable ranks of companies worth over a billion dollars.\n\nThe acquisition of Funke-Opeke led MainOne by Equinix for $320 million remains one of the standout moments. Don\u2019t forget Nigeria\u2019s shocking 2021.\n\nWe did a roundup of the memorable moments of 2021. Check it out here.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the industry that stood out heads, shoulders, and knees above the pack was the fintech space. Nigerian fintechs, for example, raised almost $800 million in 2021, gulped up 76% of funding for the year.\n\nBut the real impact of fintech is not in the funding numbers, and in the last year, we saw some intriguing moves in agency banking, telco led mobile money, and e-transactions.\n\nGuided by the expert opinion of Adedeji Olowe, Trustee at Open Banking Nigeria, we reviewed Nigerian fintech in the year 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReviewing Nigerian fintech in 2021: Local investors are stepping up\n\nAre you interested in projections for the new year? Kindly keep reading.\n\nPolicies I\u2019m watching out for\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhana debating e-payment levies\n\nOn December 21, 2021, Ghana\u2019s parliament turned into a legitimate battleground as lawmakers debated a proposal to introduce a 1.75% levy on all e-payment transactions. This would include mobile money transactions.\n\nThose in support are eyeing dividends of up to $1.15 billion that the country would gain in 2022 if its tax net widens to include e-payments.\n\nThose against the bill insist that it wouldn\u2019t be fair on low-income earners and people outside the formal banking sector, who heavily rely on mobile money.\n\nContext: In recent years, mobile money adoption in Ghana has been growing in leaps and bounds to rival Kenya\u2019s success story. A levy on mobile money transactions would improve taxation revenues, but there\u2019s no telling how it would impact the average mobile money user.\n\nThe parliament will meet on January 18, 2022, to cast the final votes, so that\u2019s a space worth watching.\n\nKenya signs law on digital lending\n\nWith banks reluctant to give loans, Africa has seen the rise of several digital lenders who have filled this gap. However, there\u2019s been a few controversies regarding unethical and predatory lending practices.\n\nSince the onset of the pandemic in 2020, the Kenyan government has been implementing policies to stem these predatory practices. On December 7, 2021, the Kenyan parliament amended the Central Bank Act, 2021, giving the Central Bank of Kenya the authority to regulate digital credit lenders and limit unfair and discriminatory lending practices.\n\nGiven how vital lending is (more on that in a bit), I think this is a policy worth watching, and we can track important metrics like micro-lending activities. Read more.\n\nFunding Nigerian digital and creative companies\n\nThe African Development Bank (AfDB) has approved a $170 million loan to fund the Nigerian Federal Government\u2019s i-DICE (investment in Digital and Creative Enterprises) program.\n\nThe government plans to use this initiative to fund 226 technology and creative startups and provide non-financial services to 451 digital technology and small and medium enterprises.\n\nNigeria\u2019s policy space has been fraught with lots of bad news, but I thought I should bring up what seems like good news.\n\nThe problem is, we\u2019ve seen several initiatives like this, and I\u2019ve been dismissive of them, but I think I should pay closer attention to announcements like these.\n\nYes, we\u2019ll look at past promises of such nature too, and if time permits, we can also include the one about lifting Nigeria\u2019s Twitter ban \u201csoon\u201d.\n\nThe CBN\n\nI\u2019m not saying the Central Bank of Nigeria is a policy to watch out for; I\u2019m simply saying we should pay them close attention. Whatever the apex bank decides tomorrow could heavily affect Nigeria\u2019s fintech space.\n\nThe Nigerian Startup Bill\n\nThankfully, the Nigerian Federal Executive Council has okayed the startup bill, and it has been sent to the National Assembly. If passed, this bill is touted as one of the most important legislation for Nigeria\u2019s tech space.\n\nHowever, Nigeria has a stellar history of passing great business laws, but implementing them has been another issue. Can we see a change in 2022? Does Nigeria need a startup act? Where are the clouds and silver linings?\n\nHere\u2019s my analysis on this subject. Startup Acts: Can the decade\u2019s sexiest law save Nigeria\u2019s thriving but uncertain startup ecosystem?\n\nSome projections for 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Internet is the lifeblood of the world\u2019s biggest companies today, so imagine my surprise in 2021 when I discovered the term Web3.\n\nThe Internet has evolved from different stages, with the original invention being called web 1, our current era is web2, and the future evolution will be Blockchain-powered Web3.\n\nHonestly, there\u2019s no industry trend without the Internet, so what happens to all the companies we know and appreciate if the Internet is changing? What does this evolution mean, and how does it affect me? We had some answers in the last crypto explorer of 2021.\n\nWeb3: The Internet evolution to come in 2022 and beyond\n\nSurprise: Cloudfare says TIKTOK is now the most visited site in the world. Really? Not Google?\n\nWell, now is probably a good time to secure your child\u2019s online activities.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening in Web2? In 2021, several startups raised money to digitise Africa\u2019s informal sector, undoubtedly the largest employer of labour on the continent and its most significant economic contributor.\n\nAs a result, these startups could experience closer scrutiny in 2022, with great expectations on their shoulders; it promises to be an exciting ride.\n\nAnother company that will be sure to make the headlines is Jumia. Long before the new wave of startups, Jumia dealt with African SMEs, and its struggles are well documented. Could we see a change in 2022?\n\nFintech ride: In 2021, Nigeria processed 3 billion electronic transactions valued at $588 billion. Source: I nor fit lie f\u2026 sorry.. NIBSS.\n\nI\u2019m making it one of my projects in 2022 to find out what all those transactions are. My best guess is cash, but is that the whole story?\n\nAlso, in 2021, Nigerian fintech, Piggyvest, said it disbursed $587.5 million to 3.5 million customers.\n\nMeanwhile, Olowe has again made some exciting predictions for Nigeria\u2019s fintech space in 2022.\n\nSeveral predictions from last year, like WhatsApp\u2019s payment play and Visa and MasterCard\u2019s acquisition of Interswitch and eTranzact, respectively, have also featured in 2022.\n\nHighlights\n\nP2P FX to power investment apps\n\nNIN dethrones BVN\n\nTransfers become free.\n\nWe\u2019ll do a review this week, but you can check out his predictions here in the meantime\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nWhat we are reading\n\nWishing you a Happy New Year!\n\nEmmanuel Paul for Techpoint Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

          "title": "EU proposes gas as \u2018green energy\u2019 in boost to Nigeria\u2019s reserves",
          "text": "The European Union has proposed labelling natural gas as a \u2018green energy\u2019 source, a development that could translate into huge economic value for Nigeria that has over 206 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of proven gas reserves valued at over $803.4 trillion.\n\nNigeria along with other gas producers have been campaigning for the inclusion of gas as a clean energy source following the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, where countries expressed a desire to end funding for fossil fuel projects.\n\nNatural gas, while a fossil fuel, generally considered a dirty energy resource, is one of the cleaner fuels and exists in abundance in Nigeria and on the African continent. Proven gas reserves on the continent, according to figures from global data firm Statista, is about 624tcf.\n\nThis proposal will pave the way for new European investments in natural gas in Africa, and will therefore allow Europe to unlock billions of euros in finance and sustainable energy funds to support gas as a transitional energy source, said the African Energy Chamber (AEC), an African energy policy think tank based in South Africa.\n\nThe AEC hails the EU\u2019s proposal as a watershed moment that justifies a positive outlook for an inclusive energy transition for Africa because the idea that natural gas can be used as a transitional energy source has long been promoted by African nations.\n\nAccording to the chamber, the current Western pressure to adapt to cleaner energy systems has been exclusive in its recognition that the transformation may range in shape and timing from one region to the next.\n\nNJ Ayuk, executive chairman, African Energy Chamber, said: \u201cThe demonization of Africa\u2019s gas industry needs to stop, and investments need to come into the sector.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue this engagement, it is important that the oil and gas industry focuses its investment on further reducing carbon emissions within the gas value chain.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ayuk, sustainable development and making energy poverty history will require Africa to increase gas within its energy mix, which will give us a fighting chance to reduce the continent\u2019s carbon footprint, even when we are still fewer than 4 percent of global emissions.\n\nRead also: Germany shuts three nuclear plants as focus shifts to renewable energy\n\nAfrica risks being left behind throughout the energy revolution by prohibiting investment in energy sources like gas, which is counterproductive and regressive, African oil producers have argued.\n\n\u201cThey listened, worked, and allowed us to make the case for Africa\u2019s low-carbon Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), and while these discussions were crucial in bringing us closer together on gas, there is still a lot of work to be done to make this a reality,\u201d Ayuk said.\n\nFurthermore, the AEC gives insights into the investment opportunities that would spring in the aftermath of this new proposal.\n\nThe EU proposal will improve import of natural gas from Africa and ramp project funding on the continent as well as energy security for Africa.\n\nAfrican countries like Nigeria, Algeria, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Senegal, Angola, Ghana, Mauritania, Libya, Cameroon, and Equatorial Guinea have taken steps to monetise their natural resources in order to develop and industrialise independently.\n\nNigeria LNG recently signed a contract to develop the LNG Train 7 while Mozambique in 2019 signed a $20 billion deal with TotalEnergies for new LNG projects.\n\nBy using natural gas as a feedstock to create other value-added products like petrochemicals, from fertilizers to ammonia, revenue can be used to build infrastructure, from pipelines to ports and roadways, and we can therefore open the doors to economic diversification for other African countries as well.\n\nNigeria declared a decade of gas from 2021 in a policy framework that seeks to harness gas as an enabler for economic development.\n\n\u201cNatural gas is seen as the oxygen and lifeblood of Nigeria\u2019s socio-economic resurgence,\u201d said Timipre Sylva, during the Nigerian Gas Association\u2019s business meeting in December.\n\nThe government also passed the Petroleum Industry Act, which for the first time prescribed a separate fiscal framework for gas and provided generous incentives for investors. These moves would have been frustrated by campaigns to abolish funding for new gas projects.\n\nUnderscoring this fact, the AEC said despite predictions that demand for African LNG was expected to grow for the foreseeable future, investments in gas exploration had been hit hard by a short-sighted bias against our low-carbon natural gas resources.\n\nThis has led to reluctance towards investing in supply projects because of the fractured global outlook towards natural gas. The success of the proposal could change this.",

          "text": "In a last-gasp attempt to rescue an economy that has contracted twice in five years, President Muhammadu Buhari has tapped Doyin Salami to become his chief economic adviser much to the muted excitement of the business community due to the lateness of the appointment.\n\nBuhari\u2019s appointment of a chief economic adviser has been seven years in the waiting, with the position last held by Nwanze Okidegbe, who served under former President Goodluck Jonathan from 2011 to 2015.\n\nSome business leaders say the appointment is long overdue and questions why it took so long to appoint a chief economic adviser, especially when the economy\u2019s dwindling performance has yearned for one since Buhari first rode into power in 2015.\n\nThe business leaders are also sceptical of the impact Salami as chief economic adviser will have on the economy when his recommendations as chairman of the Presidential Economic Advisory Committee, a marked departure from the President\u2019s actions, have so far fallen on deaf ears.\n\n\u201cThe appointment is certainly a belated one as it comes seven years into his tenure and when little can be done,\u201d Muda Yusuf, former director-general, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), says.\n\n\u201cHowever, if the President takes Salami\u2019s advice, then we can at least arrest the economic rot. But expectations must be tempered as we are now just a year away from the next presidential elections,\u201d Yusuf notes.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economic travails have warranted an economic adviser since Buhari first came into power in 2015, with the metrics showing Nigeria was headed for an economic downturn on the back of lower oil prices.\n\nRead also: NIGERIA IN 2022: What to expect from economy\n\nThe crash in oil prices, which began mid-2014, did not however have to lead to a recession in 2016, according to several economists, but the lack of a sound economic management strategy, which a chief economic adviser would have spearheaded, cost the economy.\n\n\u201cIf the President cared enough about the economy, an economic adviser should have been appointed long ago. So, why has it taken so long?\u201d a business leader who does not want to be named, asks.\n\n\u201cBut for this President, appointing a chief economic adviser at this time may not mean much given that the same person is the chairman of his (Buhari) economic advisory committee, and his views are not popular with this administration,\u201d the business leader says.\n\nThe economy contracted by 1.62 percent in 2016 before expanding by 0.8 percent the following year, but never really recovered as growth has been below the population growth rate of 2.6 percent. This means that Nigerians have grown poorer every year since 2016, as the economy fails to keep up with the rate at which the population is expanding.\n\nIn 2018, the economy grew 1.92 percent and 2.21 percent in 2019 before contracting again in 2020 by 1.79 percent amid the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 full-year growth rate is yet to be published but is currently running at an average of 3 percent using data from the first three quarters.\n\nBut even that growth rate is nothing to cheer as it has solely reflected the low-base effect from the past year when there was a lockdown and businesses were shut. The World Bank estimates that Nigeria will end up with a GDP that was the same size as in 2010 by the end of 2021, an indictment on the economic management of Buhari.\n\nThe unemployment rate is also at the highest since the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) started collating data, rising five-fold in the last 10 years from 6.4 percent in 2010 to 33.3 percent at the end of 2020. That is the second-highest globally behind Namibia.\n\nInflation has also been above the CBN\u2019s target of between 6 and 9 percent since 2016.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari has signalled an interest in forging a legacy before his time is up, but his legacy projects should have started when he won the second election which makes me wonder if it is too late now,\u201d another business leader states.\n\n\u201cIt may just be for the optics,\u201d the person says.\n\nSalami\u2019s views on the economy are well publicised and they are a departure from the way the government has run the economy since 2015.\n\nSalami is an advocate for a greater role in the economy for the private sector rather than the government trying to do everything. He has also openly criticised the central bank\u2019s funding of the Federal Government and has called repeatedly for the elimination of the costly petrol subsidy regime.\n\nSome business leaders say the appointment of Salami, whose views are widely welcomed in the business community, is symbolic and are hoping he finally gets the President\u2019s ears.\n\n\u201cSalami\u2019s appointment is one that would have been better cheered in the investor community if it happened six years ago, but maybe something can still be done to salvage the situation Nigeria finds itself in if the President listens to him,\u201d an investor who does not want to be named, says.\n\n\u201cIf he does get the President\u2019s ears then it will be a significant departure from the way the economy is currently being run and that would be of much help to the economy,\u201d the investor states.",

          "title": "December rally eludes manufacturers as PMI drops first time in 7yrs",
          "text": "Manufacturers in Nigeria missed out on the seasonal boost the yuletide normally brings, as the Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI), a gauge for manufacturing sentiments, declined from November to December for the first time in seven years, according to data by FBN Quest and NOI.\n\nThough above the 50-point benchmark, the PMI moved from 57.4 points in November to 55.9 points in December, which was unexpected, seeing that the yuletide season often presents a periodic boost.\n\n\u201cThe trend is usually a further increase in headline rate for December due to a seasonal boost in demand resulting from year-end festivities,\u201d analysts at FBN Quest state in a monthly report.\n\nAnalysts say the causal effect of this performance was the outbreak of Omicron. \u201cWe attribute last month\u2019s decline to increased uncertainty among manufacturers on the back of the fast-spreading Omicron variant of COVID-19, which was first reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) in late November,\u201d the report states.\n\nSome manufacturers who spoke with BusinessDay say the variant classified as a SARS-CoV-2 \u201cvariant of concern,\u201d by the WHO may not be easily controlled, especially as information about its transmissibility, severity, and ability to evade vaccines is unascertained.\n\nFrank Onyebu, chairman, MAN Apapa branch, says little information being provided regarding Omicron planted seeds of doubts and uncertainty among manufacturers, with hinting possibilities of another lockdown, restricted movement, reduced production, reduced product demand as consumer\u2019s preference adjusts, among other things.\n\n\u201cI understand it has a higher infectious rate but we are hopeful that it will be curtailed faster. However, the possible threat of the Omicron variant is the restriction of entry or shutdown of other countries as they try to control the spread,\u201d Onyebu states.\n\nDamilare Asimiyu, senior analyst at Afrinvest West Africa, tells BusinessDay that usually, manufacturers ramp up production in December to serve increased demand and also store up for January, however, the outbreak of the Omicron variant caused manufacturers to worry and also fear for the future.\n\n\u201cOther than Omicron, FX challenges also posed a challenge for them, especially in sourcing raw materials hence inventory was down,\u201d he notes.\n\nThe report also reveals that supply constraints also contributed to the PMI decline in December, as manufacturers struggled to mend the cut created by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBusinessDay gathers that manufacturers in Nigeria are still struggling with the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, part of which is the cut in supply of raw materials, low demand of products, particularly those categorised as being non-essential, hike in production cost, etc.\n\nRead also: December rally eludes manufacturers\n\nAmong the five sub-indices analysed, the report notes that the most common answer in the surveys was no change, which accounted for more than 50 percent of the responses.\n\n\u201cThe reading for new orders, the most forward-looking of the five sub-indices, declined from 62.0 to 60.5 last month, supported mainly by medium-sized firms,\u201d it states.\n\nThe decline in demand was a blow for manufacturers who took strategic positions to effectively utilise the festive season as a quick relief for slow business activities in the course of the year.\n\nIn addition, an index that used to perform well during the review period to decline shows that the consumers\u2019 purchasing power weakness is more intense than before.\n\n\u201cIncomes did not grow, inflation was high and as such what consumers could afford last year or two years ago, they are not able to afford again,\u201d Ayodele Akinwunmi, senior relationship manager, corporate banking group, FSDH Merchant Bank, says.\n\nThe economic downturn during the pandemic led to rising unemployment, high prices, and decreasing disposable incomes among many Nigerian households last year and these negative impacts continued in 2021.\n\nAccording to a report by the Presidential Economic Advisory Council (PEAC), Nigeria\u2019s unemployment rate of 33.3 percent is projected to increase further by 7 percentage points to 40 percent by the end of 2021, which it says will largely be driven by the low capacity of the manufacturing sector.\n\nExperts say the PMI is a forward-looking indicator of economic activities; hence they project that the GDP for the fourth quarter of 2021 may perform sub-optimally.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at the possibility of achieving 1.0 percent to 1.5 percent because the activities of the season will not reflect on the numbers,\u201d Babajide Babatope, an economic expert tells BusinessDay\n\nHe says precedence has shown strong growth in the fourth quarter of the year, however, for 2021, the data provided may not match the reality.\n\nHe further relates this to inflation figures which had continuously decelerated since April 2021, yet the prices of items have risen incessantly by more than 50 percent.\n\nSimilarly, Asimiyu notes that due to the events that shaped 2020, the Q4 figures will be impacted by the low-base effect of the previous year, hence projections will fall between 2.3 percent and 2.7 percent.\n\n\u201cAnything above the projected figure can happen by magic, however, sectors like services and trade will however serve as major GDP boosters,\u201d he says.",

We will also expand to the hinterland within the Benin metropolis such as Ugbor zone, which comprises first and second Ugbor.\u201d\n\nNoting that EDSTMA was receiving more tow trucks to boost efficiency and professionalism, Oloriegbe added, \u201cWe are commencing the installation of bus stops having identified such.

Some even add a maternity side by side with the orphanage homes where they deliver people of babies and turn the place into a baby factory; they bring underage children to such homes to make babies and sell same, or traffic these children, as far as outside Nigeria, despite the restriction on international adoption.\u201d\n\nEdeko continued: \u201cOrphans are vulnerable persons; they are subject to all forms of exploitation; they are vulnerable to being trafficked, abused and sold. You will understand that the issue of human trafficking has been a very strong challenge globally and at the state level, Governor Godwin Obaseki has made serious efforts to stamp out human trafficking in Edo State.\n\n\u201cAs the ministry with the responsibility to investigate any adoption process, in line with the Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) Agenda, we are committed to sanitizing the system and will be setting up a committee to audit orphanage homes in Edo State and come up with holistic policies on adoption and management of orphanage homes, in line with the child rights law. This is topmost on our agenda for the new year.\u201d\n\nShe further stated: \u201cThe government of Governor Obaseki is talking about institutional reforms and sectoral reforms. It then means we must reform every department that is within the purview of this ministry. So, we have continued to train and retrain the proprietors and proprietresses of these orphanage homes, and looking at these children today, I can see they are very beautiful; they are doing things that normal children will do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to do an audit and remove all those that came into this as a business. It is a charity and if you do not have the heart to do charity, you cannot be in the issue of managing orphanage homes. If you are here for the wrong reason, better take your leave. It is not going to work and we will put many of them behind bars and we will close the orphanages that are for business.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly those that are for true charity will be allowed to function, as there are standards for running orphanage homes in Edo State,\u201d the commissioner noted.\n\n...",

The utter disrespect, which underlines the response of the officer to the Governor establishes, beyond doubt, the impracticability of the current system, dubiously christened \u201cFederalism\u201d. An arrangement, which compels the Governor of a State to seek clarifications on security issues in his jurisdiction from totally extraneous bodies or persons, is a sure recipe for anarchy.\n\n\u201cWe condemn, very strongly, this brazen assault on decency. We call on the IG to explain the justification for this intrusion. This is not acceptable. Any expectations of rapprochement between so called federating units and federal security agencies are becoming forlorn, progressively, due to deliberate acts which mock our very avowal to ethics and professionalism.\n\n\u201cWe condemn, in very clear terms, the role of the Attorney General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami SAN in this act of gross moral turpitude.\n\n\u201cWe, on our part, will continue to interrogate the current system, which treats elected representatives of the people as mere prefects, while appointed office holders ride rough shod over them as Lords of the Manor. If the purported Chief Security Officers of the States of the Federation require clearance from the office of the IG on matters within their areas of jurisdictions, only hypocrites will wonder why the current security crisis deepens and there appears to be no solution in the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cWe condemn very strongly, this brazen assault on decency. We call on the IG to explain the justification for this intrusion. This is not acceptable. Any expectations of rapprochement between so called federating units and federal security agencies are becoming forlorn, progressively, due to deliberate acts which mock our very avowal to ethics and professionalism.\n\n\u201cWe stand by our brother, the Governor of Lagos State.

Mbadiwe University for Imo people\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAs you may well know, the university was built and furnished with tax payers money of not lessan N40bn. Yet, an individual, abusing his office as governor brazenly wanted to appropriate it to himself as a privately owned establishment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI am glad to report to you that by the second week of December this year, I received a Certificate of Ownership for the University on behalf of the Government and people of Imo State. Today, as we speak, that Universiy is now the rightful property of Imo State.\u201d\n\nOn security, Uzodinma said: \u201cYou will recall that as a government, we have repeatedly maintained that some of the security breaches were\n\npolitically contrived.\n\n\u201cThis was based on intelligence information at our disposal. As the lgbo saying goes, when a child is crying and pointing at a particular direction, it is because either his mother or father is there. Now, you will recall that a few weeks ago I assured you that my administration will name those behind insecurity in the state during this stakeholders meeting but for security reasons we will hold on.\n\n\u201cWith the cooperation of the security agencies and the support and assistance of the Federal Government, we have been able to overwhelm the bandits and criminality.\u201d",

          "text": "The Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma has declared that his government has succeeded in restoring democracy in the State. The Governor made the declaration during the State\u2019s 6th stakeholders meeting involving leaders drawn from across the State.\n\nAccording to the Governor, his government was founded on the democratic principles of open, transparent, accountable, and inclusive governance.\n\n\u201cI am sure that many of us will readily recall that there was once upon a time, when the governance process of Imo State was shrouded in secrecy. Not only did Imo people not know how their State was governed, there was in fact a big wedge between the people and the government. So wide was the wedge that those who attempted to cross it to know what was happening in government got marooned in it. I challenge anyone to produce one single document of the previous administration where it showcased its report card to the people of the State.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was this regrettable state of affairs that informed my resolve to run an open, transparent, accountable and inclusive government. As you very well know, on each of the six occasions we have met, I have documented an address detailing an account of my stewardship. This is accountability in action.\n\nSo, I can proudly declare at this point that with your support we have restored democracy to Imo State, because we have restored the process of open, accountable and inclusive governance. Yes, we have banished the dark ages of government by necromancy and replaced it with the government of the people, for the people and by the people. Congratulations to all of us,\u201d the Governor declared.\n\nThe stakeholders meeting, which was chaired by Mr. Leo Stan Eke, Chairman Zenox Group and drew massive attendance from across the State, saw the Governor give an account of his stewardship as his administration nears its second anniversary.\n\nGovernor Hope Uzodimma, while delivering his account of stewardship, informed the people of the State of the accomplishment of his government in 16 broad sectors of governance within two years of his administration. The sectors included Road Infrastructure, Security, Local Government Administration, Revenue generation, Agriculture, Tourism Health, Land Administration, Commerce and Industry and Education, among others.\n\n\u201cFor us one of our greatest achievements in the education sector is the recovery of the K. O. Mbadiwe University for Imo people. As you may well know, the University was built and furnished with tax-payers money of not less than 40 billion naira. Yet, an individual abusing his office as Governor, brazenly wanted to appropriate it to himself as a privately owned establishment. I am glad to report to you that at the second week of December, I received a certificate of ownership for the university on behalf of the Government and the people of Imo State. Today, as we speak, that university is now the rightful property of Imo State,\u201d he disclosed.\n\nOn Commerce and Industry, the Governor said his administration had commenced moves to revamp all moribund industries in the State.\n\n\u201cThis administration has paid off debts owed to Assets Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON) by successive administration in the State in respect of the Imo Standard Shoe Industry. The sum of 1.3 billion naira was negotiated down and full and final payment made. I am hopeful that operations will commence in the industry in the next few months.\n\nOn infrastructural development, the Governor disclosed that no fewer than 90 roads have either been completed or about to be completed across the State. According to Governor Uzodimma, the infrastructural projects cut across urban and rural areas within the three senatorial zones of the state with an urban renewal program that has given Owerri the State capital a facelift.\n\nOn health, the Governor informed the people of the State of giant strides made through the provision of basic medical services in Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Health sectors. He emphasized the efforts made to contain the Covid-19 pandemic in the State including the rehabilitation of 305 health centres across the State to enable Imo people live healthier lives even as he appealed to the people of the State to get vaccinated due to the dangers of the Delta and Omicron variants of the virus.\n\nThe high point of the event was the vote of confidence passed on the Governor by the stakeholders of Imo State. The motion for a vote of confidence was moved by Chief Dan Nwanyanwu, the National Chairman of Zenith Labour Party.\n\nChief Nwanyanwu before moving the motion for the vote of confidence said \u201cI was unable to attend the last 4 meetings. I want to say that our state has been good since the governor came on board. The chairman said he is not a politician; I am not an APC member. I am not a PDP person. I have been in opposition since 1999 and I have never shifted, but when you see something that is good, you need not to pretend as if it\u2019s not good.\n\n\u201cI am known in the country because I speak the truth and I\u2019m never afraid to say so. I want to say that just as you came in you saw Owerri, I went to Orlu and I can see that the state is working. All we have to do is to pray for those who have eyes and have refused to see.\n\n\u201cI have not come to Imo State for the past 5 years, but I am happy with what I am seeing. We should call our people to come home. I want to thank you for the recoveries you have made. That is the things that has attracted me the most. I have spoken about it publicly and if that is the only thing you do for Imo people, Imo people will be grateful to you because it has never been done before.\n\n\u201cYou have rolled out the constructions that are completed and those that are ongoing. We are all from those areas. They are not voodoo projects. They exist. Those of us in opposition we see it and we should not be afraid to speak the truth.\n\n\u201cWe as a people need to stop what we are doing; painting a bad image of our state. Why are we not speaking out? Why are we keeping quiet? I will not run away. We should not. We did so for eight years that is why things went wrong; because we kept quiet and we did nothing. We did not interrogate the man at the helm of affairs.\n\n\u201cBut we have a governor now who is calling us from time to time to listen to him, that is what we call transparency, leadership and engagement. So as we leave here today, it behooves on us to talk about the things our governor is doing because we believe that our state should grow. On our own we must play our own part. Everything should not be left to the government.\n\nFor me, this is the midterm results of this government, even though it\u2019s not up to two years. Because you must remove nine months of COVID-19, so this government has worked for 1 year and 3 months. I think I\u2019m satisfied and I hereby move that this house pass a vote of confidence on the Government. Following his motion, Dr. Mrs. Dorathy Nnaji, the Chairman of Imo State Chapter of National Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ) rose in secondment with the overwhelming support of all Stakeholders.\n\nAmong those who graced the event were Chief Eng. Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, former Governor Ikedi Ohakim, former Inspector General of Police, Mike Okiro, President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof. George Obiozor, retired banker and member of the Imo Economic Summit Group, Dr. CNC Nwachukwu, Chief Greg Mbadiwe, Onyeka Onwenu and a host of others, all of whom commended Governor Uzodimma for an outstanding performance within a short period in office and collectively sued for peace for the government to do more.",
          "summary": "The Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma has declared that his government has succeeded in restoring democracy in the State.\nSo, I can proudly declare at this point that with your support we have restored democracy to Imo State, because we have restored the process of open, accountable and inclusive governance.\nThe high point of the event was the vote of confidence passed on the Governor by the stakeholders of Imo State.\n\u201cI have not come to Imo State for the past 5 years, but I am happy with what I am seeing.\nFollowing his motion, Dr. Mrs. Dorathy Nnaji, the Chairman of Imo State Chapter of National Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ) rose in secondment with the overwhelming support of all Stakeholders.",

          "title": "Why FG is yet to gazette bandits, kidnappers as terrorists \u2013Malami",
          "text": "The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami (SAN) has said the delay in officially gazetting bandits as terrorists was to ensure things were done in line with international best practices.\n\nMalami made the clarification Tuesday while featuring on NTA Good Morning Nigeria, monitored by Blueprint in Abuja.\n\nHe, however, said the court declaration was enough to give the bandits a terrorist tag and be treated accordingly.\n\nFollowing an ex parte application by the federal government, Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court Abuja, on November 26, 2021, ruled that Yan Bindiga (Hausa word for gunmen) and Yan Ta\u2019adda (Hausa word for terrorists) be declared as terrorists.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe gazetting of a court order or judgement is a process but what matters fundamentally within the context of international convention is the judicial declaration and that has been obtained; the court has declared bandits, kidnappers, cattle rustlers as terrorists.\n\n\u201cSo, with or without the gazette, what gives effect to such declaration is a judicial pronouncement but the gazette is a mere formality and it has been on and I believe within a matter of days, it will be concluded.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Malami explained that the situation regarding IPOB was due to the \u201cthreats to lives and properties they have caused in the nation.\n\n\u201cGovernment has a responsibility to act but within the context of acting, you are equally expected to operate within the confines of international best practices associated with engagement and one of such best practices is that you can only use maximum force on groups, individuals that are declared terrorists and that is where the application of the Terrorism Act comes in place.\n\n\u201cWith that in mind, Nigeria acted, first by proscribing IPOB, taking into consideration the threats to lives and properties they have caused in the nation. Boko Haram was proscribed.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, we are confronted with another threat in the North-West associated with banditry, kidnapping, cattle rustling, and in all these, these people are using weapons to attack Nigerians, kidnap them, and created a situation of serious security challenge and fear in the system.\n\n\u201cWhatever military hardware you acquire there are limits within the context of the international convention as to how it can be used when it can be used, and against who it can be used. And that is how the idea of looking at the activities of the bandits, cattle rustlers, kidnappers comes into being.\n\n\u201cOur assessment taking into consideration that they are causing a major threat to the territorial peaceful co-existence and causing a major threat to lives with weapons, the idea then came about that indeed they (bandits) have satisfied the criteria of being declared terrorists within the context of the law so that whatever military hardware at the disposal of the Federal Government can best be used against them within the context of the international convention and within the context of the law,\u201d Malami further said.\n\nMBF tackles Malami\n\nBut the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) has said Malami\u2019s actions and utterances were clear indications that there is no political will to end terrorism in Nigeria.\n\nNational President MBF Dr Bitrus Pogu stated this Tuesday in an interview with journalists in Abuja.\n\nPogu said: \u201cI can never buy that line of thought. It means they have seen that their people who are doing mischief will be protected better if they are left as bandits.\n\n\u201cAnd as far as I am concerned, court orders are court orders and Malami has to obey it. If the court has made its declaration based on the practice of the people and their actions, they have been terrorizing people, they even shot down an aircraft, they have gone beyond the level of bandits and the court has declared them as terrorists and so it should be obeyed.\n\n\u201cTherefore the treatment the federal government should give to terrorists should be given to them. They are not a special breed. Recall that the Boko Haram was started by mainly Kanuris and later minorities and other groups joined. Today Boko Haram is predominantly Fulani.\n\n\u201cWhat makes them different from the people operating in the North West? They are one and the same. More importantly the court has declared them as terrorists, so that should be what they should be called; and that should be how they should be treated to enable us to have a solution to the problem we are having.\n\n\u201cMany of us have said that the truth about the matter is that this thing is lingering because there is no political will. And the action of Malami is an indication that there is no political will to end terrorism in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd trying to give these criminals a safe haven does not solve any problem. They should be treated as terrorists and the declaration of the court should determine the name and their classification at the international level so that we can jointly rout this thing out of Nigeria and have peace.\n\n\u201cBy so doing, all they are doing by exporting terrorism to other parts of the country will stop.\u201d\n\nArrest financiers \u2013Ndume\n\nIn a related development, Chairman Senate Committee on Army Ali Ndume has asked the federal government to name, arrest and prosecute suspected sponsors and financiers of terrorism in Nigeria.\n\nNdume spoke Monday on a Channels Television program, Political Paradigm.\n\nThe lawmaker said he was still embarrassed with past attempts to nail him as sponsor of the Boko Haram.\n\nThe lawmaker who recalled his travail while being tried as sponsor of Boko Haram sect, said his only offence was that the Department of State Services (DSS) tracked his phone and uncovered a call made by a spokesman of the insurgents and attempted using that to label him as a financier of the group.\n\nNdume said: \u201cIf there is evidence that somebody is funding Boko Haram and there is clear evidence after doing your investigation, why don\u2019t you tell Nigerians? Why don\u2019t you prosecute them?\n\n\u201cJust because they were tracking my phone and they said a spokesman of Boko Haram called me, they arrested me.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t even ask me and they didn\u2019t do any intelligence work. The then Senate President (David Mark) called me and said the DSS wants you to report that they have some questions.\u201d\n\nOn getting to the DSS office, the lawmaker further recalled, rather than allowing him avail the Service of useful information that would assist its operation, he was interrogated and consequently, \u201cthe DSS, through the then spokesperson, Marilyn Ogar, briefed journalists\u201d and accused him of sponsoring terrorism.\n\nBandits kill 9, troops kill 2\n\nMeanwhile, bandits have killed nine people and injured five others during the attacks on Kudu da Gari near Sabon Birni, Rugarr Goshe near Rigachikun both in Igabi local government area and Filin Idin Barebare in Zaria local government area of Kaduna state.\n\nThis is just as troops also killed two bandits on the outskirts of Tumbau village, Kerawa in Igabi local government area following an interception, as the bandits were retreating to Malul Forest.\n\nKaduna state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan disclosed this in a statement Tuesday.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe security forces have reported to the Kaduna state government that nine citizens have been killed, with five injured and hundreds of animals rustled by bandits during three attacks across Igabi and Zaria local government areas.\n\n\u201cAccording to the first report, bandits attacked Kudu da Gari settlement in Sabon Birni, Igabi LGA and killed seven residents, listed as: Dahiru Bilya, Jibrin Bilya, Dayyabu Adamu, Bashir Habibu, Jabir Shuaibu, Buhari Habibu and Abubakar Habibu.\n\n\u201cFour others were left critically injured, and were rushed to a medical facility for treatment. They are identified as: Audi Mohammad, Mubarak Ilya, Balarabe Junaidu and Umar Bilya.\n\n\u201cIn another incident, bandits invaded a herders\u2019 settlement called Ruggar Goshe, on the outskirts of Kangimin Sarki village, Rigachikun, Igabi LGA. One Auwal Koshe was shot dead by the brigands, who then rustled about 250 goats and sheep from the settlement.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, bandits attacked another herders\u2019 settlement at Filin Idin Barebare, Zaria LGA, where they killed one Abubakar Mohammad. One Abubakar Aliyu sustained gunshot injuries to his ribs, and is receiving medical attention. The bandits then rustled an unspecified number of cattle from the settlement.\n\n\u201cOn another note, troops have reported that two bandits were neutralized around the outskirts of Tumbau village, Kerawa, Igabi LGA. The bandits were retreating to the Malul forest when they were intercepted by the troops, and two of them were neutralized in the ensuing fire fight, with an AK-47 rifle recovered.\n\n\u201cExpressing his grief at the reports of the attacks, Governor Nasir el-Rufai prayed for the repose of the souls of the citizens who lost their lives, and sent his deepest condolences to their families. The governor wished the injured a speedy recovery.\n\n\u201cGovernor el-Rufai commended the troops for their alertness and swift response during the engagement which saw two bandits neutralized. Patrols and monitoring have been sustained by security agency in the general areas,\u201d Aruwan said.",

          "title": "IMF to Nigeria, others: Handle debt rescheduling with care",
          "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned emerging and developing economies on the need to be careful in the way they go about rescheduling domestic debt.\n\nIn a newspaper on its blog titled Sovereign Domestic Debt Restructuring: Handle with Care, the international lender said countries needed to be careful on how they go about restructuring the rising debt vulnerabilities and growing stocks of sovereign domestic debt.\n\nThe document further said questions of when and how to restructure such debts were now more acute than ever.\n\nOver the past two decades, emerging market developing economies have seen their share of domestic debt increased from 31 to 46 percent of their total sovereign debt.\n\n\u201cThus, restructuring of domestic debt is likely to play a role in the resolution of future debt crises,\u201d the paper said.\n\nWhile noting that domestic debt is easier to restructure, the Bretton Wood Institute said \u201cauthorities can simply elect to alter the terms of debt contracts through changing domestic law, which in the medium to long term may avoid some costly consequences associated with external debt restructurings, such as the loss of access to external debt markets.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, domestic debt is often held predominantly by domestic creditors who will suffer losses. Through this channel, sovereign debt distress can easily spread to domestic banks, pension funds, households and other parts of the domestic economy. This can add to the economic malaise that made the debt restructuring necessary in the first place,\u201d the IMF said.\n\nIn restructuring, the international lender explained that the net benefit of a domestic debt restructuring is considered.\n\nThe paper also queried: \u201cDo the benefits of a lower debt burden outweigh the fiscal and broader economic costs of achieving that debt relief?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision to restructure domestic debt or not is always the sovereign\u2019s prerogative and entails the responsibility to limit the damage and help mitigate the effects of a restructuring on the domestic economy. For example, to avoid compromising the viability of the domestic financial system, the government may be required to recapitalize some banks or replenish pension savings. Similarly, ensuring the continued effective functioning of the central bank may require fiscal support.\n\n\u201cThe net benefit calculation will determine whether or not the domestic debt should be part of a restructuring, together with external debt, or on a standalone basis,\u201d the paper said.\n\nWorld Bank warns\n\nIn a related development, the journey ahead for fiscal and monetary authorities appears challenging with the World Bank warning that the country runs the risk of rising cost of funds which are susceptible to throwing the macro-economy and fiscal arrangements into shock.\n\n\u201cWhile currently the debt stock of 27 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is considered sustainable, any macro-fiscal shock can push debt to unsustainable levels.\n\n\u201cHowever, the debt to the GDP in Nigeria is rising quickly, and the total stock of debt in absolute value has almost doubled between 2016 and 2020, and without a policy change is expected to reach 40 per cent of the GDP by 2025,\u201d World Bank said.\n\nThe global apex ban also expressed concerns over Nigeria\u2019s rising cost of debt servicing, which according to the institution, has disrupted public investments in key sectors.\n\n\u201cThe cost of debt servicing is also a concern as it is potentially crowding out public investment and critical service delivery spending. Interest costs have been above two percent of the GDP since 2018, reaching 2.4 percent of the GDP in 2019 and then falling to 2.2 percent of the GDP in 2020.\n\n\u201cCost of debt is high as Federal Government also resorts to overdraft (Ways and Means financing) from the CBN to meet in-year cash shortfalls. At end of 2020, the stock of the CBN Ways and Means financing was estimated at N13.1tn or 8.5 percent of the GDP,\u201d it stated.\n\nFG on rising debt\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has estimated that Nigeria\u2019s total public debt would rise from the present N38 trillion to N50.22 trillion by the end of 2023, with domestic debt projected at N28.75 trillion and foreign debt at N21.47 trillion.\n\nThere are suggestions that President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration is planning to borrow an estimated N12 trillion in two years.\n\nEconomists have condemned President Buhari\u2019s incessant borrowing habit and warned that it could hurt the country\u2019s development and productivity down the line.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, the administration spent N445 billion on debt servicing, according to Debt Management Office.\n\nThat is the amount that could have been used to improve factors of production and grow the economy.\n\nThe Washington-based global financial institution disclosed this in its November edition of Nigeria Development Update.\n\nAccording to World Bank, the country\u2019s debt is at risk of becoming unsustainable in the event of macro-fiscal shocks.\n\nIt said: \u201cNigeria\u2019s debt remains sustainable, albeit vulnerable and costly, especially due to large and growing financing from the Central Bank of Nigeria.",

Your Excellency sir, I\u2019m not here on my own order.\n\n\u201cI am here on the instruction of the Inspector General of Police through the AGF. I am too small or too low to call them. Your Excellency sir, with due respect sir, you can call them directly sir so that they can tell us to come.\u201d\n\nBefore the arrival of the governor, residents of the estate had staged a protest to condemn the planned takeover of their properties.\n\nThey decried the invasion of the estate by a team of policemen alleged to be providing security for court bailiffs said to have sealed some properties in the enforcement of a Supreme Court judgement.\n\nCarrying placards with various inscriptions to vent their concerns, the residents also faulted the continued presence of the police team despite an earlier intervention by the governor.\n\nDespite being informed by Governor Sanwo-Olu who hinted that he had contacted the AGF and that the latter said he had no knowledge that the police team was still at the estate, the CSP insisted, \u201cIt is not my duty to call because I am too low to do that sir.\u201d\n\nIllegal Operation\n\nThereafter, the governor asked the leader of the police team to give an account of the number of policemen at the estate.\n\n\u201cI have several of them, sir. I cannot precisely tell you how many we are,\u201d the CSP replied the governor. \u201cI know the number of my men here sir, we sought for some other people to join us. But for security purpose, I cannot say this is the figure, sir.\u201d\n\nObviously dissatisfied with the response and action of the defiant police officer, Governor Sanwo-Olu declared the presence of the security team at the estate as illegal.\n\nHe also questioned the motive behind the operation, stressing that the issue only involved the state government and had nothing to do with the residents in the first place.\n\n\u201cIt is a very illegal operation,\u201d said a visibly angry governor. \u201cThey (policemen) are not from the Lagos State Police Command. They said they are from Abuja, and I don\u2019t know what other interests they have beyond keeping the peace of the country.\n\n\u201cThis is not an expectation that I would expect for them because they don\u2019t have any business here at all.

          "title": "UK Travel Firms Call for Removal of Covid Testing Rules",
          "text": "Travel industry groups have called for all remaining Covid restrictions on travellers to be removed in the latest government review.\n\nWith data last week suggesting one in 25 people in the UK currently had the virus, airlines say passenger testing is having no real impact.\n\nThe government said it continued to \u201ckeep all measures under review\u201d.\n\nThe travel industry said compulsory testing for UK arrivals and departures had held back the sector\u2019s recovery.\n\nThe prime minister will meet his cabinet later and urge them to back his decision not to impose any further Covid restrictions in England.\n\nOn Tuesday, Boris Johnson said he hoped the country could \u201cride out\u201d the current wave, although he acknowledged parts of the NHS would feel temporarily overwhelmed.\n\nCurrently, all travellers to the UK aged 12 and over have to show proof of a negative test, which can be a PCR or a lateral flow test, and must be taken up to two days before departure for the UK.\n\nThey then have to take another test \u2013 which this time must be a PCR test \u2013 within the first two days after their arrival in the UK.\n\nBut at the time that rule was brought in a month ago, the number of new cases reported in the UK each day was running between 40,000 and 50,000 \u2013 and was only rising relatively slowly because it was almost entirely made up of the Delta variant of Covid.\n\nBut now, the UK has announced more than 200,000 new cases in a day for the first time in the entire pandemic and Omicron is the dominant variant \u2013 so airlines can argue that there is no longer any hope of relying on testing to \u201ckeep out Omicron\u201d.\n\nThe only other countries in the world that have topped 200,000 positive tests in a single day this week have been the US and France.\n\nThe trade body Airlines UK argued that continuing the current measures would be financially disastrous for the industry. It added that the current limits have depressed demand and dented consumer confidence.\n\nManchester Airports Group (MAG) has sent the government research it commissioned, which it claims shows that pre-departure testing has had little or no impact on the spread of Omicron.\n\nIt said that passenger numbers at MAG\u2019s airports fell by more than 30% after Omicron measures were introduced.\n\nTim Hawkins, chief of staff at MAG, told the BBC\u2019s Today programme the research showed there was a \u201cbasis for taking out all tests\u201d related to international travel, due to the high number of Covid cases in the UK.\n\n\u201cWe are beyond the point where international travel restrictions can play a role in managing that peak and if there is no benefit to it then we shouldn\u2019t be doing it and we should take those measures out,\u201d he added.\n\nLast month, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said that \u201cvery soon\u201d, if Omicron became the dominant variant, there would be \u201cless need to have any kind of travel restrictions at all\u201d.\n\nAs well as travel restrictions, ministers must also consider future plans for domestic testing.\n\nThe system has come under pressure in recent weeks as cases have surged, with appointment slots and home test kits periodically being temporarily unavailable.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Mr Johnson announced plans for 100,000 critical workers to take daily tests.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph has reported that the government is planning to change testing rules so that people who test positive on lateral flow devices do not need to take a confirmatory PCR test.\n\nThe government did not comment but pointed to the guidance from the UK Health Security Agency which maintains that people should take a follow-up PCR test if they receive a positive lateral flow result.\n\n\u201cWe continue to review PCR availability and continue to make more PCR booking slots available every day,\u201d the agency said.\n\nTravellers must pay for private tests rather than using free NHS tests.\n\nMAG chief executive Charlie Cornish and Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade said the government should press ahead with the \u201cimmediate removal\u201d of travel testing requirements which come at \u201chuge cost\u201d to the industry.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore vital they do not remain in place a day longer than is necessary,\u201d they wrote in a statement.\n\nA government spokesperson said that they keep all measures \u201cunder review\u201d and added that the temporary testing requirements were introduced to \u201cprevent additional Omicron cases from entering the UK, stopping people from passing it on to others if they are infected\u201d.\n\nThe Times has reported that the requirement for people to take a pre-departure test before they arrive in England is likely to be dropped by the government in the update later. But it said the requirement that people take a PCR test within two days of arriving in England is set to remain.\n\nSeparately, European airline and tour operator stocks rose on Tuesday amid a rise in investor confidence in the sector.\n\nHargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter told Reuters: \u201cWith so many people in the short-term being forced to isolate at home, it\u2019s likely many people will be spending the next few weeks browsing travel blogs for inspiration, given there is so much desperation for a holiday.\u201d\n\nA recent report by aviation analytics firm Cirium found that the Covid pandemic triggered a 71% drop in international flights in and out of the UK in 2021.",

I am ready to live and breathe tennis in the next few weeks of competition.\u201d\n\nHe has not spoken about his vaccination status, but said publicly last April: \u201cPersonally I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn\u2019t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel.\u201d\n\nThe decision is highly controversial in a country that is seeing tens of thousands of Covid cases for the first time after enduring some of the world\u2019s strictest restrictions.\n\nMany have previously accused the government of allowing the rich and famous to do as they please while ordinary people remain separated from sick and dying loved ones.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how good a tennis player he is. If he\u2019s refusing to get vaccinated, he shouldn\u2019t be allowed in,\u201d A&E doctor Stephen Parnis tweeted on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIf this exemption is true, it sends an appalling message to millions seeking to reduce #COVID19Aus risk to themselves & others. #Vaccination shows respect, Novak.\u201d\n\nAustralian player Alex de Minaur told a press conference: \u201cI just think it\u2019s very interesting. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s Jamie Murray added: \u201cI think if it was me that wasn\u2019t vaccinated I wouldn\u2019t be getting an exemption. You know, but well done to him for getting clear to come to Australia and compete.\u201d\n\nApplications for medical exemptions are being assessed anonymously by two separate panels, with inflammatory cardiac illness or another acute condition listed as valid reasons.\n\nBut it is also possible Djokovic has recently tested positive for the virus, which would allow him to defer taking the vaccine.\n\nVictoria state government minister Jaala Pulford acknowledged the decision was \u201cfrustrating and upsetting\u201d, but also denied that Djokovic had received special treatment.\n\nBoth she and Mr Tiley urged Djokovic to give more information to the public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll certainly be helpful if Novak was to explain the conditions in which he\u2019s sought an exemption and granted an exemption but ultimately it\u2019s up to him,\u201d Mr Tiley said.",

          "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron has warned he intends to make life difficult for people in France who have not been vaccinated against Covid-19.\n\n\u201cI really want to hassle them, and we will continue to do this \u2013 to the end,\u201d he told France\u2019s Le Parisien newspaper.\n\nBut political opponents said the strong language he used in the interview was not worthy of a president.\n\nHis comments came as a bill on Covid passes was delayed by opposition MPs uniting against the government.\n\nA debate in parliament on the bill, which would bar the unvaccinated from much of public life, was prevented from continuing after midnight.\n\nThe legislation was expected to be approved in a vote this week, but it has angered vaccine opponents and several French MPs have said they have received death threats over the issue.\n\nIn his interview with Le Parisien on Tuesday, Mr Macron said that while he would not \u201cvaccinate by force\u201d, he hoped to encourage people to get jabbed by \u201climiting as much as possible their access to activities in social life\u201d.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t send [unvaccinated people] to prison,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we need to tell them, from 15 January, you will no longer be able to go to the restaurant. You will no longer be able to go for a coffee, you will no longer be able to go to the theatre. You will no longer be able to go to the cinema.\u201d\n\nThe language Mr Macron used about hassling or annoying the unvaccinated is considered to be slang and prompted a strong reaction from opposition politicians.\n\n\u201cNo health emergency justifies such words,\u201d said Bruno Retailleau, Senate leader of the right-wing Republicans, quoted by AFP.\n\n\u201cEmmanuel Macron says he has learned to love the French, but it seems he especially likes to despise them.\u201d\n\nFar-right leader Marine le Pen tweeted: \u201cA president shouldn\u2019t say that\u2026 Emmanuel Macron is unworthy of his office.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile leftist politician Jean-Luc Melenchon described the remarks as an \u201castonishing confession\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is clear, the vaccination pass is a collective punishment against individual freedom,\u201d he added.\n\nFrance has one of the highest Covid vaccination rates in the EU, with more than 90% of the adult population double-jabbed.\n\nFor months France has asked people to show either proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test to access many public venues.\n\nBut the French government wants to remove the option to show a negative test in response to record increases in infections, driven by the highly contagious Omicron and Delta variants of Covid.\n\nOn Tuesday, the country reported 271,686 new daily Covid cases \u2013 the highest number of daily infections recorded in France since the start of the pandemic.\n\nMr Macron is still yet to formally declare he will run for a second term in April\u2019s presidential elections, but told Le Parisien in Tuesday\u2019s interview that he wanted to and will clarify his decision \u201conce the health situation allows it\u201d.",

          "title": "Extensive Structural Reform Needed to Accelerate Nigeria\u2019s Economic Growth, CBN Governor Emefiele Says",
          "text": "Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has reiterated the need for extensive structural reform this year to fast-track the country\u2019s economic growth. Emefiele stated this in his personal comment at the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, a copy of which was posted on Monday on CBN\u2019s website.\n\nDriven by base-year effect, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) had revealed that Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 4.03 per cent in the third quarter (Q3) of 2021, compared with 5. 01 per cent recorded in the preceding quarter. And the federal government had listed the removal of fuel subsidy, which had been described as a major drag on the economy, as one of the reforms it expected to carry out this year.\n\nHowever, in the MPC communiqu\u00e9, Emefiele stressed, \u201cExtensive structural reforms are also needed to ensure that long-run paths of growth surpass potential.\u201d\n\nThe CBN governor noted that as business sentiments brightened, following the various supply-side supports by the apex bank and orderly implementation of macroeconomic policies, he expected domestic fragility to diminish with benign knock-on effects on welfare and livelihood.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur medium-term goal is to fast-track growth above historic average. Economic activities may reach pre-pandemic levels if the resilience of non-oil activities (especially agriculture and manufacturing sectors) are given continued impetus.\u201d\n\nNigeria recorded eight consecutive months of deceleration in headline inflation rate to 15.4 per cent in November 2021.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, this reflected the disinflation in both the food and core components.\n\nHe stated, \u201cRegardless, inflation remained at unacceptable levels, propped by structural inadequacies. Short-term projections indicate further moderations in expected inflation, especially as development financing continue to resolve supply rigidities.\n\n\u201cAnalysis of monetary condition indicated a tepid outcome during the review period with mixed interest rate developments. While weighted average inter-bank call rate fell 3.21 percentage points to 10.00 per cent in October 2021, open-buy-back rate gained 1.07 percentage points to 12.18 per cent.\n\n\u201cMonetary aggregates expanded in October, although, below provisional targets. Broad money growth at 7.10 per cent, was 2.54 per cent points below benchmark.\n\n\u201cThe observed growth was, however, attributable to the 9.12 per cent expansion of net domestic assets underpinned by credits to the private sector.\u201d\n\nEmefiele pointed out that the banking system remained stable and resilient with capital adequacy ratio (CAR) at 15.2 per cent; liquidity ratio, 41.2 per cent; and non-performing loans\u2019 (NPLs) ratio at 5.3 per cent.\n\nHe, however, acknowledged that in the forex market, the exchange rate pressure had persisted, despite external reserves accretion, while capital market metrics recorded positive performances.\n\nDeputy Governor, Economic Policy Directorate, CBN, Dr. Kingsley Obiora, called for the deployment of more growth-induced policies in order to stimulate economic activities. He said this was why he supported the current \u201c100 for 100\u201d policy on Production and Productivity (PPP) introduced by the CBN.\n\nObiora said, \u201cThe policy will boost production in the manufacturing sector; reduce imports and expand the non-oil exports; improve accretion to external reserves; and ensure exchange rate stability.\n\n\u201cAlso, the launching of the Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme (TIES) in November 2021 would enhance entrepreneurship and promote economic growth in strategic sectors of the economy as well as address the challenges of youth unemployment in the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, given Nigeria\u2019s huge investment needs and limited fiscal space, we must continue to attract the private sector to the critical sectors of the economy through Public-Private Partnership (PPP). This arrangement will enhance efficient development and productivity of infrastructure, human capital and other critical sectors of the economy on a sustainable basis.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, CBN Deputy Governor, Corporate Services Directorate, Mr. Edward Adamu, noted that notwithstanding the positive outcomes so far on inflation and growth, the economy was yet to attain the pre-pandemic levels on several fronts.\n\nEmployment, for instance, continued to be a major policy concern, he said, adding, \u201cThe surest bet to alleviating poverty is growth in employment, which is tied to economic (output) expansion.\n\n\u201cIn effect, the economy needs to expand at a faster rate than has happened up to third quarter 2021, to generate more jobs. Even at the 4.03 per cent overall real growth rate in Q3, some sectors (activities) were still struggling.\n\n\u201cAmong those, oil and gas, fishing, and oil refining stood out. These activities and some others that barely crossed the line would continue to require policy support in the short- to medium-term.\n\n\u201cThe need to sustain liquidity support to key economic activities is buttressed by the vulnerabilities in the horizon, including new variants of the coronavirus driving infection resurgence.\n\n\u201cThe moderation in inflation is occurring at a fast pace, attributable mainly to the consistent effort towards boosting supply, rather than a decline in demand.\n\n\u201cBarring any major shock, the current trajectory is expected to be sustained through the first quarter of 2022. Contrary to what is happening in most other climes, the recovery in domestic demand has not translated to new price shocks.\n\n\u201cNot only has output rapidly increased, the liquidity management strategy has kept banking system liquidity close to its optimal level.\u201d\n\nOn his part, an MPC member, Professor Adeola Adenikinju, expressed concern about \u201cthe uncertainty around 2022, being a pre-election year,\u201d noting, \u201cusually, foreign investors are less likely to commit to new investment in the country, affecting foreign exchange reserves.\u201d\n\nAdenikinju, however, advised, \u201cGoing forward, there is a need to harmonise monetary policy with the monetary and development targets in the newly approved Medium-Term National Development Plan.\n\n\u201cThere is also a need to decompose the intervention fund to those that went to boost aggregate demand and those that went into expanding the supply base of the economy. Careful examination of the contributions of these interventions should guide the decision on the pace of winding down the interventions in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe CBN must continue to explore ways of further de-risking the critical sectors of the economy to enable the deposit money banks to lend to them.\n\n\u201cAs CBN interventions cannot continue in the long term, domestic banks must take on the responsibility of supporting households\u2019 credit and the MSMEs. The unsustainability of petrol subsidy is an issue that the government should address urgently.\u201d\n\nAnother MPC member, Professor Mike Obadan, said with rising debt service-to-revenue ratio, currently put at over 90 per cent, heavy debt servicing was taking a toll on lean fiscal resources and could hinder availability of funds to finance critical government programmes and projects.\n\nObadan stated, \u201cAgainst the backdrop of limited domestic revenue mobilisation and little or no foreign exchange inflow from oil and gas exports, the government\u2019s fiscal capacity remains weak.\n\n\u201cIt requires continued monetary support to drive economic activities towards the desired sustainable growth trajectory.\u201d\n\nObinna Chima",
