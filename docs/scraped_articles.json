          "text": "A security guard at the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Kaduna State, Abubakar Aliyu, has been arrested with two others, Abubakar Yakubu aka Dogo and Isaa Kabiru aka Wicked, for the alleged kidnapping of two lecturers in the institution.\n\nThe lecturers were identified as one Prof Ibrahim Bako and Dr Abdulmumuni Ibrahim, said to be lecturers at the Faculty of Medicine.\n\nThe gang also reportedly kidnapped Ibrahim\u2019s two children as well as one Ajiyah Ramatu and her son, Rabiu. It was learnt that Ramatu and Rabiu were abducted at the sick bay unit of the university.\n\nCity Round gathered that suspects were apprehended recently by detectives attached to the Inspector-General of Police Intelligence Response Team.\n\nPolice said the gang carried out six kidnappings in the university and confessed to have been engaged by a former chief security officer of the institution who is still at large.\n\nA police source told our correspondent, \u201cAfter a series of complaints, the university management requested the intervention of the IRT. During our investigations, we arrested Abubakar Yakubu aka Dogo, an okada rider. He said a former chief security officer of the university and one Bello, were the ones who invited him and his gang to terrorise the university because the present VC removed him (the CSO) from his position.\u201d\n\nYakubu, who hails from Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna State, said that he was introduced to kidnapping by one Sanusi (also at large), adding that he got between N16,000 and N30,000 share each time a ransom was paid.\n\nThe 24-year-old father of three added that Sanusi lured him into kidnapping on the promise that he would make a lot of money.\n\nHe said, \u201cI dropped out from primary school and went into cattle rearing. I bought a motorcycle and started operating around Samaru town in ABU and ABU Teaching Hospital. I used to make close to N3,000 daily. I went into kidnapping because of greed through Sanusi.\n\n\u201cHe told me that the okada business I was doing would not get me enough money. I joined the gang and we kidnapped one pastor at Sabua Local Government Area. We also kidnapped one Alhaji Mutair. We followed him to his house and kept him at Kidandan Forest for four days.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much was paid as ransom. I wasn\u2019t there when the ransom was negotiated but I got N30,000 as my own share. I bought food and clothes with the money. We also went for another kidnapping in Kundu village in Giwa LGA and we kidnapped a man whose name I don\u2019t know. We followed the man to his house and it was one Ballo Ahudu, our informant, who brought the job. We kidnapped the man and took him to our camp where he spent 11 days with us. I got N16,000 as my share of the ransom.\u201d\n\nYakubu, who said their next operation was at ABU, stated that they were contracted by a former CSO of the university. He claimed that the ex-CSO contacted him through one Arbo Bello.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe had a meeting and the former CSO and Bello told us that they wanted us to cause insecurity in the university because the vice chancellor wasn\u2019t ready to work with them and that there were also lecturers and professors who were not happy with the new VC. They wanted insecurity in the school so that the new VC would not succeed.\n\n\u201cThey told us nothing would happen if we carried out kidnapping in the school. Six of us struck at the school in September 2020 and we kidnapped two children of Dr. Abdulmumuni and took them to our camp. They spent 13 days with us.\n\n\u201cOur gang leader, Alhaji Layi, was the person who negotiated the ransom. I don\u2019t know the amount that was paid but I got N30,000 as my share. We then went to kidnap Ajiya Ramatu and her son and took them to our camp where they were kept for 13 days. After the ransom was paid, I was given N30,000.\u201d\n\nYakubu said he was arrested at Biye village while another victim they kidnapped was in their camp, adding that he led the police to apprehend two other members of the gang.\n\nThe guard, 27-year-old Aliu, said he agreed to join the gang because he was not happy about the former CSO\u2019s sacking.\n\nThe father of four admitted to have participated in three of the kidnappings and got a share of N550,000.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am a security guard at ABU. I was employed in 2015 through the former CSO. I was not happy that the VC sacked him and I decided to join him to destabilise the university. I was the person that monitored the movement of all the kidnappers in the university. I monitored three kidnappings. I got N550,000 for participating in the kidnappings.\u201d\n\nKabiru, 35, said he was a businessman and was not involved in the kidnappings. He, however, said he used to buy stolen cows from the gang.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Actress, Oloruntimilehin Bukola, popularly known as Kiitan Bukola, has revealed that her rape ordeal at the age of 10 had a long-term effect on her sexual life.\n\nIn an interview with Saturday Beats, she said, \u201cI cannot remember what age I started taking alcohol but I started drinking beer in secondary school. My mom did not know about this habit and my father did not live with us. Drinking is an addiction for me. I find it difficult to make love without getting high, because of my rape ordeal. That way, I can do whatever I want. Also, I have to really share a close bond with my partner before I can get intimate. Sometimes, I feel irritated, angry and paranoid for no reason. I still get flashes from the incident. I can picture his face clearly. However, I am really trying my best to stop my drinking habit. People close to me know that I always have (alcoholic) drinks around me.\n\n\u201cI did not want to tell anyone my story at that time because of the fear of being stigmatised or ridiculed. That was what prompted me to make a movie about my experience 23 years later. I want victims to have the courage to speak out. The incident happened at Oke Bola in Ado Ekiti.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, I had another bad experience with a guy some years back. We were in a long-distance relationship but he came to Nigeria after a while. I had gone to see my mum in Ondo State and he was in Akure (the state capital) at the time. We spent some time together and when it was getting late, I asked him to drop me at the park. However, he cajoled me and we stayed back in his house. He tried to have sex with me and when I refused, he slapped me very hard. I told him it was the time of my menstrual cycle. But, he insisted that he wanted to confirm. He later confirmed and apologised. I did not sleep till 5am when I left his house the next day. This happened in 2006 or 2008. I have been more careful since then.\u201d\n\nThe actress who urged victims to speak out regardless of when the incident happened also said she wished she met her rapist before he died. She added, \u201cWhen I told my rape story on social media, I found out that the guy had died. I was told he was killed during a robbery. I was hoping to meet him and I would have paid him back for what he did to me.\n\n\u201cI knew the identity of my rapist, so I told my family friend about it, who then informed me that he (rapist) had died. Another person also confirmed the story to me after I spoke out about the incident. I think my career also helped me to speak out because I could make a film out of it.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026asks Ohanaeze, Afenefere, Arewa, PANDEF, Other groups to give total support\n\n\u2026calls on NASS to give legal backing to Southern Govs\u2019 resolutions\n\nBy Levinus Nwabughiogu-Abuja\n\nBillionaire Lawyer and former member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ned Nwoko has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to grant full autonomy to the local government councils to facilitate their revenue allocation directly from the federation accounts.\n\nHe also asked that the same treatment be given to state houses of assembly and the judiciary just as he called on the national assembly to enact laws to legal backing to the recent resolutions of the southern governors.\n\nNwoko in an open letter to Buhari, a copy of which he made available to Vanguard in Abuja on Thursday said giving heed to the issue was the only to bring peace, unity, progress, security and sustainable development to the country.\n\nHe also called on the socio-political regional bodies such as Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Afenefere, Arewa, PANDEF to give their total support to the call.\n\nAccording to him, the autonomy would signal the commencement of the restructuring Nigerians were hearing for.\n\nNwoko lauded Buhari for his many populist and people-oriented programmes and policies, declaring support for the President.\n\nHe said that a situation where state Governors muzzle the local government and the Houses of the assembly was highly defective to the ideals of democracy.\n\nThe letter read in parts: \u201cToday, Nigeria as a developing nation is faced with a myriad of social, economic and political challenges which have been endemic and long drawn transcending successive governments. But even with the hydra-headed constraints, you have continued to stand firm in your faith and hope in the survival and growth of the nation, especially with your anti-graft crusade and selfless leadership style.\n\n\u201cI share your good vision that Nigeria must overcome her problems, rise above her inhibitions and move forward for the well being of her over 200 million people.\n\n\u201cIn recent times there have been growing interest and anxiety in the affairs of Nigeria against the backdrop of corruption, socio-economic difficulties and insecurity by bandits across the country.\n\n\u201cI particularly share your concerns for the necessity of one Nigeria, that would guarantee peaceful coexistence, equity and social justice among the diverse inhabitants.\n\n\u201cMr President, I am elated that you have championed this move with your policy thrust of granting autonomy to local governments as well as ensuring the independence of State Assemblies and the judiciary. Your quest remains a bold patriotic template that would strengthen the separation of powers among the executive, judiciary and legislature, for the benefit of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, I join you and other well-meaning Nigerians, as an impassioned citizen and concerned stakeholder in the Nigerian project to make a clarion call for the sustenance of these institutions. I specifically call for full autonomy for the local government administration in Nigeria as the bedrock of restructuring, true federalism and genuine democracy.\n\n\u201cI make bold to assert that lack of independence in local government leadership has over the years produced a weak structure that could not safeguard lives and inspires good governance at the grassroots.\n\n\u201cMy firm belief is that local government autonomy and direct funding from the Federation allocation account would embolden elected chairmen and councillors to work effectively with divisional police officers and traditional rulers to manage security as every crime is local.\n\n\u201cThe prevailing situation where most state governors control local government funds through the federation allocation account, leaving the councils as appendages of the states, is grossly defective. Local governments deserve the independence to attract experienced technocrats and successful businessmen who have the latitude and wealth of experience to perform as chairmen.\n\n\u201cI am convinced such arrangement would herald real democracy as elections would be fought locally and popular candidates would emerge regardless of political parties and godfather phenomenon.\u201d\n\nAlso read:\n\nGo beyond rhetorics on restructuring call by Southern Govs\n\n\u201cThe recent resolution by Southern governors for restructuring should go beyond rhetorics and be matched with action. What is required urgently is for the National Assembly to ensure implementation of administrative and financial autonomy in favour of democratic institutions in Nigeria especially the local governments.\n\n\u201cElections will be free and fair if local governments are independent. This will usher in the much-needed election of credible aspirants. Council chairmen will be effective while Councilors will take charge of their wards. Also, the kings will be held responsible for their towns and villages.\n\n\u201cIt has been generally observed that most Governors don\u2019t know what goes on in local governments areas. They rely on advisers who are most times not resident in the LGAs. Majority of the Governors control elections because they control local government executives. Free these executives and empower them through direct allocations and see what will happen with elections and security.\n\n\u201cMr President, the restructuring we need should start from the grassroots because it is the foundation of democracy. Happily, you have been in the vanguard of this campaign and I wholeheartedly support your efforts so far.\n\n\u201cI also call on Ohaneze, Afenefere, Arewa, PANDEF and other groups to give total support. I believe that if this is achieved before the next general elections in 2023, everything will change for good, to the delight of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe need strong democratic institutions at the various levels in Nigeria for the good of all. We need rule of law and social justice much more than ever before. The strike by judicial workers under JUSUN demands this reasonably. Judges deserve financial and administrative autonomy to function freely. State legislators should not be subservient to state Chief executives. Local governments must stand alone to drive effective governance at the grassroots.\n\n\u201cIt is a welcome development that public hearing on the review of the 1999 Constitution is holding simultaneously across the six geo-political zones from May 26 to 27, 2021. Local government officials in collaboration with traditional rulers must mobilize their people to participate massively. Political parties, civil society organizations, human rights groups, youths and women bodies and indeed all Nigerians irrespective of tribe, religion and social status must ensure full participation in the constitutional review process.\n\n\u201cThe needed and achievable restructuring is the autonomy of local governments and independence of state Assemblies and the judiciary.\n\n\u201cMy inner conviction is that such proper framework of institutional reforms will lead to the birth of a new Nigeria rooted in a glorious culture of self belonging, justice and fairness, peace and unity, political stability, economic prosperity and general fulfilment. A new Nigeria where democracy would live up to its true meaning as the government of the people, by the people and for the people, propounded by the 16th President of the United States of America, Abraham Lincoln. True democratic independence at the local governments, state assemblies and the judiciary represent the trajectory of our search for a better Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMr President, I resolutely trust and have the confidence that you will do your utmost best as a consummate patriot and exemplary leader to bequeath a legacy of viable democracy to the present and future generations of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, may God continue to guide you in good health and wisdom to lead Nigeria towards the attainment of the positive goals and dreams of the founding fathers.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Femi Fani-Kayode\n\nSomebody asked me, what I felt about what\u2019s going on in this country and how things will unfold. And whether I\u2019m worried or not. The answer to the question is yes, I\u2019m worried. And let me tell you what I believe is happening.\n\nThere are 4 major forces in this country today, I\u2019ll call them 4 holes, 2 are in the S/West, one is in the East and the 4th is Buhari and he represents the North.\n\nAnd the S/West, we have two holes, very powerful, aggressive, focused and very very committed holes. In the person of Gani Adams, who\u2019s the Aare Ona Kakanfo and the other is Sunday Igboho, who by any standard is the hero of millions.\n\nExceptionally tough young man. Now these two forces, represent the heart, soul, mind and spirit of the Yoruba people. They cannot be stopped, they\u2019re not politicians, they cannot be intimidated, they cannot be threatened, they\u2019re extremely focused and both of them, if sufficiently provoked, the kind of mass following they have, their readiness to die for their cause, they\u2019re extremely dangerous.\n\nThankfully, they\u2019re good men and men that simply want a fair deal in a wider Nigeria, for our people. Also, men that are committed to the cause of Oduduwa Republic, once it is clear that there can be no fair deal in a wider Nigeria. They\u2019re totally committed to that. In fact, they\u2019re simply waiting for the integrationist to offer a better deal. Outside of that, they\u2019re leaving and they decide to go. It will take a war to stop them, and they have the hearts of the people.\n\nIn the east, you have Nnamdi Kanu, I know him, exceptionally tough, very courageous and he has a massive following, absolutely massive. I call him the third one and personally call him the tiger of the east, an exceptionally tough young man and inspirational. And if there is to be an election in the east or Biafra tomorrow, he will win hands down.\n\nHe has the hearts, minds, and the soul of his people and he\u2019s fighting for his people. Then you go up north. And before I go up to President Buhari, we go middle belt, the man who\u2019s a good friend of mine, he was at Oxford, brilliant man Obadiah Melafia. Obediah is not a freedom fighter or such, he\u2019s not a man that is committed to any form of violence but he\u2019s a man of ideas and his ideas are explosive, extremely inspirational. He\u2019s very focused, he\u2019s a brilliant intellectual and his ideas and intellectual contributions are more powerful than bombs. Because he has ignited a sense of awareness in the people of the middle belt- the northern minorities, particularly the Christians. And he\u2019s voicing their opinions and fighting in their corner more than anybody else in the history of the middle belt.\n\nAlso read:\n\nHe\u2019s extremely focused and he represents in my view the 4th hope. And it\u2019s a very positive one, very strong, he represents hope for the people of the middle belt. Then, of course, you have President Buhari himself, who I believe is the 5th hope, so rather than 4, we have 5 holes. President Buhari and those that are with him, supporting him, are also very focused on doing what they\u2019re doing. And some of them understand the situation and are ready to adapt, others are not. And that group collectively represents a very powerful force that cannot be underestimated. Within that camp, there are various groups I won\u2019t go into that now, some are more liberal and moderate than others. But by and large, there are President Buhari\u2019s loyalists. Now these 4, 5 holes, are the ones that hold the destiny of our country.\n\nIf they conflict and if they can be no compromise between them at any point in time, and if we do not agree on a formula, to avoid war in this country. If we cannot somehow assuage the feelings and persuade the Igbohos, Adamses and those behind them, to try to be a little bit more understanding about whats going on, try to reach out to them in peace and in love, try to build that bridge, it would be a very dangerous situation we are against, the same with Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nAnd the same with the people that Obediah Melafia represents in the middle belt. And that\u2019s all left to the forces that left the state. Buhari\u2019s gotten, people.\n\nNow what I\u2019ve said so far may have lost most people because it\u2019s really not for the less discerning and people that cannot think deeply. It\u2019s very profound what I\u2019ve said but they say a word is enough for the wise. The dumb may not understand it, simply because they\u2019re not wise but the wise will understand what I\u2019m saying and in a nutshell, what I\u2019m saying is this, politicians may act and behave as if really nothing is happening and that things are in order and moving towards 2023. And they\u2019re totally besotted and obsessed with who\u2019ll become President tomorrow.\n\nAt least in a couple of years, but what they fail to appreciate is that in 2 years time, there may not be a Nigeria left. If things go on as they\u2019re going now and I kid you not, I\u2019m very close to many politicians in this country, I\u2019ve been involved for many years and I have never seen this level of ethnic nationalism being expressed and exhibited among the Yoruba people and among the Ibo, and among the people of the middle belt as I have today.\n\nAlso read:\n\nIn fact, it is so extreme that I\u2019m sure it\u2019s far more so than even just the civil war. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with. And people like Igboho, particularly and Adams and Nnamdi Kanu and Obediah Melafia and even Buhari himself have tapped into the power and the attraction of that ethnic nationalism, rightly so in my view.\n\nIt can be used in a positive way if it\u2019s used properly if tapped into, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but where these ethnic nationalities are on a collision course, particularly when it the Fulanis against the rest or when the rest are saying enough is enough or when the rest are saying that they\u2019re tired and they\u2019re fed up and when the rest are saying that they will not be intimidated or threatened by anybody even those that organize coercive arms of government and control the state. And when the rest are saying listen, if you consider us to be slaves, we\u2019ll show you that we\u2019re not slaves and you have people rising up in those areas, like the names I\u2019ve mentioned, like the holes I\u2019ve mentioned to say we will defend the honour and the future of our people.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll preserve the lives and honour of our people no matter what, this goes beyond politics. This is about national survival, it\u2019s about the survival of our ethnic nationality and it\u2019s about the unity of our country. So I would urge politicians and those who cannot think deeply to begin to think about what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re sitting on a keg of gunpowder and we\u2019re acting as if nothings happening, we put our heads in the sand like an ostrich and we\u2019re pretending that nothing has gone wrong. In the east today, people are being killed every day, being butchered by our security forces and of course unknown gunmen as they call them are also attacking not just civilians but members of our armed forces, members of our police and so on and so forth, which of course I do not support.\n\nI think it is wrong, violence both ways is wrong and two wrongs do not make a right. So what\u2019s going on it is unbelievable. In some cases, in some parts, policemen cannot even wear their uniforms now because they\u2019re scared of being attacked and this is very sad, same in the south-south. In the southwest, you have massive militias being built up around two charismatic leaders who are prepared to go all the way if sufficiently provoked and if the state cannot guarantee the lives and properties of the Yoruba people.\n\nAnd let me tell you, it is only because the elders of the southwest have been holding them back and chanting restructuring as a way out, that is why the west has been a little bit restrained, this will not last for much longer. The people there are fired and they want their own country and you can\u2019t wish it to win. The middle belters have been completely suppressed, subjugated, oppressed, cheated and belittled for so many years now. Far more than any other groups in this country, they are also seeking emancipation, they also want a way out and that is ably reflected on the activities and words of a man like Obediah Melafia like I said earlier.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO HERE:\n\nAnd then, of course, you have the core north itself, represented by President Buhari and those that think like him. Not all are extreme, some are, some aren\u2019t and thank those who are not so extreme are the ones we can reach out to and talk to but those that have no place in Nigeria anymore as far as I\u2019m concerned and really ought to consider going back to Chad, Niger Republic, wherever they come from and resettle there. But as far as this country is concerned, whether you listen to me or not, you believe me or not and we\u2019ll have this conversation again in about 3 years time and I\u2019m sure you people will say yet again, FFK was right. But for now, the important thing is to recognize the challenges we\u2019re facing, cause these ones to come together and negotiate, and discuss the way forward, because if we don\u2019t do that, I assure you, there\u2019ll be a conflict somewhere down the line. The state cannot suppress the will of the people of the S/west through arms, or do the same to people of the S/East.\n\nThey cannot kill everybody in the South-south, they cannot kill everybody in the middle belt and they cannot kill everybody among those in the core north who also want a change. What they can do is to establish the fact that it is important for us to sit down and talk as nationalists and see if there\u2019s a way out of this and negotiate this thing to a point where everybody is comfortable whether through restructuring or whatever it is.\n\nWhat we mustn\u2019t do is continue to act as if we don\u2019t need to talk to each other and act as if nothing will change, nothing will happen. Doesn\u2019t matter how many people are killed, that the state can hold the line. The state cannot hold the line, in a conflict like this, it\u2019s just a matter of time and the most important thing to recognize mostly is this, there are men of goodwill on all sides. We may disagree on Oduduwa, Biafra, Nigeria or even an amalgamation of the 4 zones.\n\nThe middle belt, South/south, S/East and S/west coming together under one country and the core north going a separate way or we have 5 or 6 different countries at the end of it all, or we even are an integrated Nigeria, which is restructuring and we continue as one. It doesn\u2019t matter what you think, what you feel, where you stand on the way forward. What matters is that we must have peace, must have dialogue, must have understanding and we must stop this idea that you can kill all those that are opposed to you and that you can wipe them off the face of the earth and crush the opposition, crush those that do not agree with you, this cannot work, we must talk, we must dialogue, that\u2019s the way forward, the only way forward and that\u2019s my preferred option for the future of this country.\n\nWe continue to trust God that we won\u2019t have a war, we won\u2019t have a breakup. I assure you as sure I am that night follows day and day follows night, if something isn\u2019t done and we don\u2019t retrace our steps and we stop demonizing and killing each other, the killings of Ibos don\u2019t stop in the S/east, killings of Yorubas don\u2019t stop in the S/west, the killing of middle belters doesn\u2019t stop, being killed by different people, whether Boko Haram, Fulani herdsmen, elements within the security forces or whatever it is. Whoever is responsible at the end of it all, everybody will say no offence to Israel, you can kill us but we also have a right to defend ourselves and we will fight back and defend our people and nobody can take that right away from anybody.\n\nSo let\u2019s have this concession again in about 3 years, we\u2019ll see who\u2019s right or wrong, but I urge you all just to think and understand the complexity of the situation and the gravity of this terrible mire that we\u2019ve found ourselves in. I pray for those that make these decisions, I pray for those that are in a position to help us achieve peace and I call for dialogue and understanding on all sides but with justice, there must be justice. Without justice, there can be no peace, justice for the people of the S/west, for the people of the S/east, people of the S/south, people of the middle belt and justice for the people of the core north.\n\nBut I\u2019ve also been deprived by elements within the state and deny their rights and there must be security. That is the way forward.\n\nTalk to Adams, talk to Igboho, talk to Nnamdi Kanu, talk to Obediah Melafia, talk to everybody and those on the other side also should be able to talk to elements within the Buhari government, for us to now agree that we go our separate ways peacefully or we stay together in a restructured Nigeria. I end with this.\n\nWhat we must not do is continue as if we don\u2019t have a problem because if we continue that way, believe me, 2023 will be an illusion and even if we get there as one country, I really would pity whoever it is that would take over from President Buhari.\n\nWe have some good candidates, those that know me to know who I believe is the right person. I\u2019ve identified who I think worth to be President of this country, but the question for me today is that, will there be a Nigeria in 2023. I pray so, I hope so but at the same time, I will never deny the right of my people in the S/west for self-determination, if that is what they want to do and I would not expect anybody to deny others the right to have the same principle of self-determination exercised in their zones. That is the way of life, that is what you call freedom and liberty and that is what we demand. May God bless you all and thanks for listening to me.

          "title": "Miyetti Allah leader to Fulani herders: Don\u2019t obey open grazing ban",
          "text": "National President of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Abdullahi Bello Bodejo has dismissed the ban on open grazing declared recently by the Southern Governors Forum. He has also instructed Fulani herdsmen not to obey the directive but to keep grazing their cattle wherever they find themselves in all the states of the country.\n\nIn an interview with VINCENT KALU, the leader of the Fulani socio-cultural organisation stressed that the governors were jokers, accusing them of plotting to take over the cattle business in Nigeria.\n\nHow will Fulani herdsmen cope with the ban on open grazing declared by the Southern governors?\n\nWe are going to follow the law and see how to approach some good leaders in the South-East, South-West and the South-South. We will also approach the Inspector General of Police and other security agencies to protect our people.\n\nIt is not about grazing; it is a plan against Fulani people. Some people want to hijack the cattle business from us. Anywhere you go now, you see Fulani grazing cows and you will think they belong to them. No! The cows belong some people in that area or community. If you go to Benue, the state that first promulgated the anti open grazing law, you can see cows grazing; their owners are Tiv people. Even the governor, Samuel Ortom, has so many cows. They want to chase us away and continue with our business.\n\nWhat these Southern governors are trying to do, some other African countries tried it, but it didn\u2019t work. So, this one will not be an exception. You can\u2019t just wake up without plan B, and say you have banned open grazing. This business has history; we didn\u2019t just wake up and start cow rearing. It is a blessing from God; it is God that blesses us with this business, it is not like farming or palm wine tapping business. This is from the beginning; the only thing is how to transform the business. These governors are confused; they are trying to deny Fulani their rights and means of livelihood. Nigeria has only one constitution, which the governors are breaching. We may approach the court to stop them from carrying out their plans. The process by which they arrived at their decision was wrong. They were supposed to have invited us because we are part of their various states. If you are a governor, you are a governor for everybody living in that state. Since we live in all the states doing our business, it behooved them to have invited us to the meeting. I don\u2019t know who is giving them this evil idea. No state can progress without Fulani being in that state; any state without Fulani is backward and poor. Fulani attract blessing. They don\u2019t have problem, but unfortunately, people attribute kidnapping, robbery and banditry to them. It is not fair. They have not seen their people killing police and other security personnel. How many police stations have Fulani burnt? How many policemen have Fulani killed? But they want to tamper with the business God has blessed us with. The governors are very wrong.\n\nYou said other African countries tried to ban open grazing and it didn\u2019t work, but these governors seem determined to execute it.\n\nI say it categorically that this ban on open grazing by the Southern governors will never work. The only thing that can stop us from grazing in any area is if there are no grasses and water in such place. Fulani don\u2019t have borders or boundaries; they don\u2019t need permission to graze their cows from one area to another area.\n\nThere is no law, no constitution prohibiting them from doing so. Fulani are educated and they believe in leadership. They follow the constitution, which permits them internationally to graze anywhere. ECOWAS permits us to graze anywhere, but any person that commits a crime, let the law of the land be visited upon such a person.\n\nDo these governors want to tell me that in their states, only Fulani herdsmen are their problems? Let them know that what they are doing is against the law. They are confused and they don\u2019t know what they are doing in their respective states. They are confused and also jokers. That law cannot be obeyed. You can\u2019t wake up and ban somebody from doing his legitimate business without providing a Plan B for him. Are they not in Nigeria? If they have a hidden agenda, they should make it open for everybody to see. They don\u2019t have a reason for what they want to do. Governors have powers and if they wake up and decide to do whatever they like with the Fulani, then we shall see. They should remember that before them were some leaders in this country and if all these leaders, Zik, Awo, Ahmadu Bello, etc had toed their line; this country would not have been here for them to be governors. God has blessed some parts of this country with oil, some parts with agriculture and others with cattle rearing. However, we don\u2019t want anybody to tamper with what God has blessed us with.\n\nYou said you are going to petition the IGP. Why?\n\nWe are going to write to the Inspector General of Police to provide enough security to our people wherever they may be in the South because they are under threat. This morning I have received 46 calls from our people there who want to leave, but they are scared of what may happen to them on the way. Since the governors are the chief security officers of their states, they should provide security for them to leave their states. Grazing or no grazing, the Fulani will survive. A Fulani man can trek from Abuja to Cameroun, from Abuja to Somali, Abuja to Central Africa. It is only Fulani that can do that. You can\u2019t dictate to them how to run their business or their lives. You didn\u2019t provide electricity, water, school, hospital to them. Now, people are taking vaccine for COVID-19, you don\u2019t remember them. They are doing their businesses inside the bush and you still want to stop them, and yet they are feeding you with the meat! If we order our people to leave the South, may be the governors will be eating dog meat. I don\u2019t know what they will be eating if we stop our people from going there.\n\nIf you were a farmer, you took a bank facility to plant maize, millet, cassava, and then cows descend on the farm and eat up the crops, what would you do?\n\nIs there any nearby police station in that area? Is there any court in that area? Such a wicked person is supposed to be arrested, prosecuted and jailed. Such person is not a good rearer. In Nasarawa, Plateau states, for example, we have a vigilante that joined hands with the communities. We will send our vigilante to arrest any person who commits this kind of atrocity. If he is a small boy, they will arrest his father and everybody in the house and take them to the police station and force them to pay for the damage done to the farmer. We are good leaders, we can\u2019t support anybody who will go and destroy somebody\u2019s farm. That is what the governors should do. They are supposed to join hand with the good Fulani to deal with those who are spoiling our names, which is better than waking up to ask our people to leave their area.\n\nWill you invite Buhari to mediate over this matter?\n\nWe will like the Federal Government to intervene between Fulani and these governors who don\u2019t like them. They should be made to know that this country is one and forget about those their boys \u2013 IPOB and Oduduwa boys. These boys are joking and we are not part of their joke. We don\u2019t have time for that. They killed Fulani fathers and children. I urge the security agencies to go after these killers.\n\nTalking about killings, last month, some people alleged to be herdsmen killed about 25 people in Ebonyi State. What do you say to that?\n\nIf other people kill some people, they pin it to herdsmen. How many herdsmen have the police in that area arrested? How many herdsmen are in police custody? Herdsmen were not responsible for the killings. They can say Fulani were the ones involved, but how many of them were arrested? I can only believe it if the Commissioner of Police says that they arrested a Fulani or some of them who did the killing. The propaganda is too much. Like a big lie that Ortom told. He said Fulani attacked him and he ran away. How did he recognise a person who wanted to kill him while he was running? Did he have any video to prove they were Fulani? Some people are now learning Fulani language. Like in a video, one boy alleged to be a Biafra person was speaking pure Fulani language and people will take him for a Fulani. If such a person goes to kill, and he speaks Fulani, people will say the killer was a Fulani man. Let the police do their investigation, and thereafter people can draw conclusions. Many people are trying to cause trouble because Buhari is a Fulani man. Everybody is angry with the Fulani.\n\nHow do you mean? The late President Yar\u2019Adua was also Fulani, and there were no such issues\u2026\n\nYes, Yar\u2019Adua was Fulani. He tried to unite the country. He gave the Niger Delta militants amnesty. Buhari is also in the process of uniting the country. Till now, the Federal Government has not looked into our problem. I get very much annoyed and curse such people who say Buhari is backing the Fulani. He has not done anything for us. We are the first people he is supposed to do something for, but he hasn\u2019t done anything for us. See how they are funding rice farmers. See what work he is doing in the South. We are calling on him to wake up and give us our grazing areas. We may consider paying a courtesy visit to Southern governors on this issue and make them see reason to reverse their position. If they can\u2019t invite the Fulani associations, they are supposed to invite the Sultan of Sokoto and other emirs, who are also Fulani for that policy. Some people were educated and went to school through the Fulani, so they are not supposed to treat us in this way. Thank God that the Nigeria\u2019s constitution gives the governors only four years and the highest is eight years. These governors who came up with this evil law, some of them in the next two years will become former governors. We also believe that those who will replace them will change the narrative. We believe in one Nigeria and we want everyone to be one. I\u2019m about going to marry an Igbo girl from Enugu. Then these people shouting Biafra will see that the leader of Miyetti Allah has become their in-law. A Rivers State man is married to my aunt and they have ten children \u2013 some of their names are Kate, Ndidi, Kingsley, etc. If I go to Rivers State, nobody can chase me out because I have cousins there. But it should be pointed out that Igbo and Yoruba cannot stop Fulani from grazing their cattle in their areas.\n\nWe have separatist agitators who want to leave Nigeria. What is your view?\n\nIf the country breaks up, we don\u2019t have any problem. Even if they break it into 32 parts, it is not a problem to us. But let them not forget that the Fulani are cooking their food under the trees in the bush. If you are looking for Fulani trouble, be ready to leave the city and join him to cook your food under the tree. Or else, allow him to be. Don\u2019t touch them. If you chase the Fulani away, you kill their mother, father, and others, do you think you will sleep with both eyes closed? They don\u2019t look for trouble, but don\u2019t look for their trouble.\n\nYou said if Nigeria splits, it doesn\u2019t concern the Fulani. How do you mean?\n\nThe Fulani don\u2019t have borders. If I want to migrate to Ghana now, nobody can stop me. If a Fulani man wants to relocate to Sudan, can you stop him? So, we don\u2019t have a problem if they tear Nigeria apart. But the only thing is that our forefathers suffered to build Nigeria and they treated everybody, Igbo, Yoruba and others equally, and that is why we are saying let Nigeria be one united country. But we are not scared of anything. For Yoruba, if you leave Ogun and Lagos, you cannot see any other Yoruba country again. It is the same thing with the Igbo. Go anywhere, you can see Fulani, even in the 36 states. The only thing is that you can\u2019t appreciate their population because they are inside the bush and don\u2019t care what is going on in the city. How then do you want to chase them out? I\u2019m directing all the herdsmen in the South not to leave or go anywhere and they should continue to graze their cattle in that region because it is Nigeria. They should not mind the governors who have violated the constitution that guarantees everybody freedom to live and do legitimate business in any part of the country. They can\u2019t expect the Fulani to respect their law, which is inferior to Nigeria\u2019s constitution. Let them think on how to provide basic amenities to their people instead of fighting the herdsmen. Fulani are not problem in this country, but some desperate politicians are trying to give them a bad name. Some of these Southern governors have seen that their tenure is ending in two years time and they are not popular among their people to the extent that any candidate they sponsor for election, even for councillorship in 2023 will fail and that may be the reason for the meeting, to cause confusion in the country.\n\nI want to tell these governors, even in their dreams, none of them will be president or vice president in this country. If they have a hidden agenda, let them make it open so that Nigerians will advise them. I don\u2019t know what they are looking for.",
          "summary": "How will Fulani herdsmen cope with the ban on open grazing declared by the Southern governors?\nAnywhere you go now, you see Fulani grazing cows and you will think they belong to them.\nNo state can progress without Fulani being in that state; any state without Fulani is backward and poor.\nFulani don\u2019t have borders or boundaries; they don\u2019t need permission to graze their cows from one area to another area.\nThe Fulani don\u2019t have borders.",

          "text": "Oil mogul and former presidential candidate in 2019, Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim has dismissed those agitating for secession in the country. In an interview with ADETUTU FOLASADE-KOYI, he also speaks on how to resolve the country\u2019s political imbalance and why a referendum, ahead of the 2023 general election is unnecessary.\n\nThere are calls for secession in two regions of the country now. Is that not worrisome?\n\nThis is just nonsense, to be honest with you. It is pure nonsense. Nigeria, in the Independence Constitution that we had, there were democratically-elected leaders. They were not handpicked and they went to the Lancaster conference in 1957 and 1958.\n\nThe Eastern delegates were led by Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the Western delegates were led by Chief Obafemi Awolowo and the northern delegates were led by Sir Ahmadu Bello. And an Independence Constitution was negotiated. One of the critical elements of the Independence Constitution, which remains with all the constitutions that we have had, whether midwifed by the military or whatever, is the principle of indivisibility and indissolubility of the Federal Republic of Nigeria; this was agreed by all the regions.\n\nSo, this theory by some illiterates \u2013 and some of them may be professors \u2013 and they go about talking nonsense as if that is the truth. This theory that Nigeria was put together forcefully by the British is false because the people of Nigeria did negotiate the constitution, led by democratically elected leaders. And, the principle of indissolubility and indivisibility of the Federal Republic of Nigeria was agreed. In fact, it was thoroughly debated at the Lancaster Conference in London, where component regions should have the right to secede or not.\n\nThe South West wanted it, the Northern Region also did not mind it. In fact, the most compelling argument for national unity came from Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe who said that we should have a model constitution like the constitution of the United States of America where secession is an act of treason and that Nigeria should exist in unity in perpetuity!\n\nBut with the present realities, are you telling me Nigerians cannot renegotiate our unity?\n\nI am not convinced that the unity of Nigeria is the problem. What I think is the problem is the mismanagement of our diversity. That is the issue.\n\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\nWell, in the sense that we have not allowed the elements that can guarantee efficient management of state power to operate. We had a coup in 1966 that took powers from the sub-national authorities that would have efficiently managed the situation like security you are talking about. If anything happens in a local government, the people who live in that community will know who the criminals are.\n\nIt is easier when security is managed at that level than when it is managed from the central government. There is always a problem with even trust. People will not volunteer information easily. So, some of the security problems we are having is traceable to the fact that powers that were residing at the local level have been taken away and dumped at the federal level. And, you know, interestingly, a lot of people like to blame the Fulani but, the people who carried out the 1966 coup were not Fulani.\n\nSo it is not about Hausa or Igbo or Yoruba, it is about the fact that we have distorted the most essential element of managing diversity; which is to have a level of control mobilisation and development and two key elements, security and the economy are the most important elements of activities in a society.\n\nAnd when you have taken those powers and dumped them at the centre, then you snuff out creativity and efficiency and the state can no longer function at its optimum. When we decentralise, we will regain our balance and I do not think that the issue is our unity. The issue is that we distorted the essential principles of managing that diversity and now we must restore it. That is the solution, not secession and I have not seen an African country that achieved secession that has been better off. Eritrea is not better off than they were. They fought for almost 30 years to leave Ethiopia; what have they achieved after they left? Look at South Sudan; they are now even fighting and all that.\n\nAnd, let me tell you, Nigeria is more of a blessing than a curse. When people are talking: \u2018let us secede.\u2019 Secede to where?\n\nBefore Nigeria was amalgamated, there was nothing called a Yoruba nation. What you had was Oyo Empire and the various sub-nationalities in the present South West were in 200 years war against Oyo, the Ekiti and all that. They were all fighting Oyo; to be independent of Oyo. There was so much insecurity. This was a war that was fought) for 200 years. So what do they mean by a Yoruba nation? There was no Yoruba nation before the British amalgamated Nigeria. There was Oyo Empire under Alafin and the Egbas had their own flag and they had their own generals fighting Oyo, fighting Ibadan. Ibadan was the city state that was aligned to Oyo. Even the lower flank to the North, Ilorin, that one had broken up from Oyo. It wanted its own independence. Everybody wanted independence from Oyo Empire. So what is the Yoruba nation that they are talking about?\n\nAnd the ones in the East that are talking about Biafra, they didn\u2019t even have a kingdom. They didn\u2019t have any empire. What do you mean by Biafra? Everybody was at the clan level when the British came to that place. The only thing in the South-East and South-South that was a big kingdom was Benin and everybody was either a vassal to Benin directly or indirectly in those areas. Secession is pure nonsense. Secession to where?\n\nSome agitators point at the current imbalance, saying one tribe was favoured over others in appointments. Yet you say our Constitution maintains our indivisibility and indissolubility?\n\nWell, that is the problem with the character of a government; it is not a problem with the character of the country. Yar\u2019Adua was president of Nigeria; were all his appointments from Katsina? So, must you break Nigeria because now you are having issues with appointments? If you are having issues with appointments, there are constitutional remedies to correct that. We have the Federal Character Commission; there is no state in this country that is not represented in the Federal Character Commission. Where is their report? Where are the voices of their state representatives? They all keep quiet; they don\u2019t say anything! Then, apart from the institution such as the Federal Character Commission, where is the party? We have governed this country before, in 1999, and 60 per cent of all federal boards were appointed by the committee set up by the National Regulatory Committee. We zoned every big board appointment!\n\nIn our time, if the chairman of the Nigeria Ports Authority is zoned to the South-South, that of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation cannot be retained in the South-South; it goes to another region. That was how we did it and, at the end of the day, even if (former) President (Olusegun) Obasanjo wanted to do otherwise, it was impossible for him to do. So, one of the problems that you have is not just with the government, virtually all the institutions have collapsed and they have to do with the character of the occupants of those institutions not because those institutions cannot work. Even if you go your way, it is not the guarantee that there will be development in those places. Some people will still be oppressive if you don\u2019t have good leaders. If you don\u2019t have people who are ready to speak up and take up responsibilities that they have signed for, those countries, if they become independent, will not do well.\n\nIn the Second Republic, whenever the party spoke, the state actors toe that line. After 2003, progressively, it is a different ball game for our political parties. Can we go back to that era?\n\nYes we must. Even in countries of Africa that were one party states, the party was strong. All the noise against (late President Robert) Mugagbe, he did not leave until the ZANU PF took a decision and said \u2018okay!\u2019 Mugabe knew it was all over at that point, even as the country was a one-party state. The ANC (in South Africa), when they turned against (former President) Jacob Zuma, that was the end of him. So, you need a strong party.\n\nBut political parties are not as independent as before. How do we go back to that era because moneybags, governors and political state actors have hijacked the parties?\n\nSome of the people who are shouting today, they were the ones who killed the political parties. I was expelled from the PDP in 2000 because we were insisting on the doctrine of party supremacy. Some people in government humiliated those of us who formed the PDP because they wanted unlimited control over government. Myself, (late) Harry Marshal, some of the founding fathers of PDP then, we were all expelled in one day, in a well programmed attack against the national executive committee of the party, by some people who were shouting that they want to be president today, by some people who are crying that democracy is suffering, they were the ones who killed democracy!\n\nThey did not want the party founders; who are great men. I was one of the youngest of the Group of 34 that started PDP and these were great men, those were people who had been in government and they have never stolen money. (Late) Chief Solomon Lar never had a piece of land in Abuja here. (Late) Alhaji Adamu Ciroma never had a house in Abuja here yet, he had been governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria. He had been Minister of Finance. He had seen money more than anybody else had seen. We were inspired by leaders who wanted the best for this country and we respected them, not because they were moneybags. We followed them. We spent our money behind them because we believed in them.\n\nThen, some miscreants came into government and they didn\u2019t want this structure that brought them into government to have any influence on their policies and we were always fighting, it was war from 1999 between the party and some people. Do you know how many times the PDP secretariat was surrounded by armoured tanks? The party itself! They brought armoured tanks to the party secretariat because they wanted to get some people out of the party forcefully. The fight that happened in PDP, between 1999 and 2001 has not happened since then and this was why we lost it. Now, regrettably, the same people who caused the problem are busy jumping about pontificating! One of the problems of Nigeria is that most Nigerians don\u2019t have a sense of history. There is a sense of collective amnesia in this country and people pretend not to even remember things that happened six months ago. So there is no way you can make progress as a country if you don\u2019t have a sense of history.\n\nSo, back to the issue, it is not just about (President Muhammadu) Buhari. It is not about secession, it is not about any Fulani, you need strong institutions to have a functioning democracy. Some of the people that are saying they want to secede, how are their governors managing their states? Some of them don\u2019t have five kilometres of functional local roads. Even with the money that is available right now. Is it Buhari that is doing that one?\n\nSo, we have a lot of issues but where we are is very simple. Let\u2019s first of all deal with issues that we can agree on and then move forward gradually from there and the rest questions will be resolved politically, democratically on the field of the election if we allow programmes to govern our choices.\n\nOnce it is election time now, nobody is focused on the candidates, where is he coming from, who is he, what is his pedigree? You, the media, also have to help to moderate the debate about choices and what issues should govern the political contest. So, we all have our various roles to play in this issue.\n\nIs a referendum necessary now before we go into 2023 elections?\n\nThat will be a distraction. Referendum for what?\n\nWell, referendum to address how to move Nigeria forward\n\nDo we need to complicate issues? Look, Boko Haram and the bandits are in Shiroro (Niger State) and few kilometres from Abuja. There are some bandits in the forest of Kaduna. Is it a referendum that you need now or you need to get those guys out of that place and move them back as much as possible? What we need now is to secure, at least, let us secure the North Central states that are around Abuja and that is what my six-point agenda is all about. We need to immediately guaranty security in the various states and local governments.\n\nAnd we can write our lawmakers now, to amend the sub-sections of the constitution and get concurrence from the states. We can actually do this within the next 60 days. In fact, we can get this done, if there is the will, within the next 30 days. We can actually do it so that the states and the local governments can legitimately raise their local police instead of this vigilante stuff. We need proper police not vigilantes. The vigilantes themselves will become terrors. There must be standard operating procedure that is modern, that even civilised people who want to provide assistance can relate to. A modern structure. I mean, what assistant and support can you get when their insignia is like 15th Century village hunters?",

          "text": "Two weeks after the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) said it had issued 54 million people their national identity numbers, it is in the process of deploying a Device Management System (DMS).\n\nThe NCC said in a statement, \u201cTo curtail the counterfeit mobile phone market, discourage mobile phone theft, enhance national security, protect consumer interest, increase revenue generation for the government, reduce the rate of kidnapping, mitigate the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitate blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices, one of the means to achieve this is through the deployment of Device Management System.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implementation of a Centralised Equipment Identity Register otherwise known as Device Management System will serve as a repository for keeping records of all registered mobile phones\u2019 International Mobile Equipment Identity and owners of such devices.\u201d\n\nDespite the government hinging the policy on fighting insecurity, there are privacy concerns that the government can easily abuse access to such data.\n\nDoes this new requirement infringe on privacy?\n\nAs of March 2020, Nigeria was one of eleven countries with mandatory biometric SIM registration laws. One of the arguments against compulsory registration is that it allows the government to track SIM card owners and makes it easier to track calls and messages.\n\nA Device Management System will take this step even further, allowing the government even more access to what should be private information. While the argument from the government is that it improves security, there\u2019s the risk that the government can spy on its citizens.\n\nGeneralized surveillance in countries like Nigeria with weak security agencies controlled by the executive can become police states where opposition leaders can be tracked and arrested. But with the rise in crime in Nigeria in the past year, it is easy to understand the government\u2019s argument.\n\nDoes the government\u2019s argument make sense?\n\nIn a 2016 paper, \u201ccomplete mobile phone registration has many generalised benefits to the society especially in combating crime.\u201d\n\nWith increasing reports of kidnappings taking place around the country, a centralised registry may help to find bad actors even quicker, and it could help combat the sale of stolen phones. When there\u2019s a central registry for IMEI, the police could identify the owners of lost and stolen phones thousands of times daily.\n\nA critical part of this paper argues for a central database of mobile phones that law enforcement agencies presumably can access. Yet, it is this central assumption that still provides a problem.\n\nWhether Nigerians trust that the government will not abuse access to such critical information remains to be seen.\n\n*An earlier version of this report stated that the NCC asked telcos to register the IMEI numbers of their subscribers; the NCC has now clarified its position",

          "text": "Exceptional results require a high-performance team but how do you build one?\n\nIn what can be termed a mini-MBA session, Seni Sulyman and Chichi Offodile in an edition of TechCabal Live shared expert advice on how to build high-performance teams.\n\nSeni Sulyman is the founder and community manager of Black Ops, a network of top African operators building great companies and cultures across the world. Before starting Black Ops, Seni helped scale Andela\u2019s operations from series B to series D with over 1,000 team members across US and Africa offices.\n\nChichi Offodile is the COO of Helium Health. She has over 15 years of experience working at EMC/Dell and Deloitte.\n\nTheir Journey at Helium Health and Andela\n\nThe conversation begins with Chichi and Seni talking about their journeys at Helium Health and Andela respectively. They both stepped in when each company had a viable product/service, some traction, and funding.\n\nFor Chichi, she was brought in when Helium Health had figured out what it was doing but was uncertain about how to move forward. Her strength lies in figuring out how to build a sustainable company and that\u2019s what she set out to do via a transformation plan.\n\nSeni joined Andela in 2016 when the company was in only two markets \u2013 Nigeria and Kenya. At that time there had been a few leadership exits and the general employee morale was low. His mandate was to stabilize the ship. Which he did before focusing on operational expansion.\n\nHow do you begin the transformation process?\n\nFor Seni, he believes the transformation process should start with the why\u2014 otherwise known as communicating a vision that galvanises everything. At Andela, he had to create a modified version of the vision that was more compelling to the team.\n\nAfter clearly articulating the vision, decide on the steps to take to achieve the vision. This involves setting performance indicators and reviews, so it\u2019s clear what the goals are and whether people are hitting them.\n\nHow does a high achiever culture permeate a company?\n\nBoth Seni and Chichi believe that it starts with hiring people with the potential to be high achievers and then setting a good example as a leader.\n\nGiving people room to execute the tasks they\u2019ve set out to do is also an important factor.\n\n\u201cI make sure that leadership allows people to be creative. Allow people to execute. If you don\u2019t give people the opportunity to succeed, you\u2019ll be stifling them. I motivate people by allowing them to set their goals and fix a timeline to achieve it,\u201d Chichi said.\n\nBuilding cohesiveness within the team\n\nGreat things are rarely ever done by one person. How do we ensure that the team sticks together?\n\nSeni believes the people have to align on the why. This alignment has to start from the top, there has to be a unified strategy at the top level.\n\n\u201cStrategy is a lot more of what you\u2019re saying No to than what you\u2019re saying Yes to,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting an example of when he had to build cohesiveness within a team, he said that during his time at Bristow he noticed that two senior executives weren\u2019t aligned on the company\u2019s direction. One person wanted a high-end airline, while the other person wanted a low-cost airline.\n\nTo resolve this issue, he had to call both of them together to iron out their differences before the company could move forward.\n\nHow do you get teams to keep going without burning out\n\nA common challenge high-performance teams face is that they experience burnout due to the intense and fast-paced nature of work.\n\nSeni responded to this question by stating that he thinks that the issue with the pandemic and people experiencing burnout is that a lot of people were thrown into remote work without warning.\n\nThe solution to this is to encourage people to take time off work since the line between work and rest can be blurry. As a leader, you have to practice what you preach.\n\nIn order to encourage people to take some time off work, he often schedules his emails sent in the middle of the night to go out by the next morning to avoid creating unnecessary work or a sense of urgency.\n\nAnother activity that helps is social gatherings, it\u2019s important for companies to have occasional fun hours. One-on-one sessions are also helpful. These are open-ended meetings with employees, where the manager finds out how they\u2019re doing as human beings and what\u2019s going on in their lives.\n\nHe ends with a caveat \u2013 it\u2019s a little difficult to build a high-performing team without working really hard.\n\n\u201cYou cannot work 80 hours a week every week, you\u2019ll burn. You also can\u2019t work 40 hours every week and materially change the world.\u201d\n\nYou have to be thoughtful and deliberate in getting work done.\n\nChichi adds that she believes companies also need to do two things.\n\nThey have to be deliberate with capacity planning. If you\u2019re growing as a company, you can\u2019t expect to have the same set of people working at the same level while the company is expanding. You need to hire more people or adjust people\u2019s roles.\n\nBe open about flex working. The output is the most important thing, let people work in ways that work for them.\n\nAt what point should a company hire an operations lead?\n\nChichi\u2019s response to this question is that the first thing to do is to have a thought process to manage operations but as soon as you have funds for it, please hire.\n\nWatch the full conversation here",

          "title": "Stax wants you to enjoy USSD with better design, without ever dialling codes again",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nMost people who started using mobile phones in the 2000s became familiar with USSD through loading and checking airtime balance. With time, mobile banking became a major use case; again for airtime transactions, but also for buying internet data, sending money and paying bills.\n\nUnlike mobile apps that need to be downloaded and installed, USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, if you insist) is lightweight and straightforward to use.\n\nDial the code for the desired service, follow the instructions e.g. \u201cpress 1 to Check Balance\u201d on each page and, provided there isn\u2019t some \u201cconnection failure\u201d or \u201centry error\u201d, your wishes will come true.\n\nA misconception is that USSD is for people who use basic phones but the feature has become mainstream even among smartphone users in Africa. A study of smartphone users in Bangladesh, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa showed that 87% of all financial-related transactions were conducted via USSD, with only 13% via mobile app.\n\nSo, USSD works well. But it still has its fair share of frustrating glitches that you normally wouldn\u2019t encounter on an app. For one, you need to memorise the code for each service you want to access. You could minimise an app to get information from, say, your notes app. But you mostly can\u2019t minimise a USSD session once it\u2019s started.\n\nUSSD\u2019s original design did not foresee \u201chow the introduction of smartphones would bridge the worlds of computing and telecommunications to form an entirely new industry,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi explains.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say we should throw it away. On the contrary, some companies recognise that USSD is here to stay in Africa. As such, they are merging the best of both worlds: stacking the visual appeal and interactivity of smartphones on top of USSD\u2019s simple and efficient backend.\n\nOne such company is Hover, a US-based company, and their solution is called Stax.\n\nMaking USSD smart\n\nStax is a mobile app currently available only to Android users in 10 countries, including Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. It has three use cases: buy airtime, send money, and request money. All without ever dialling any USSD code.\n\nStax\u2019s main promise is that users never have to dial a code again\u2026 while enjoying USSD.\n\nIt\u2019s not a digital wallet or account, so it doesn\u2019t ask for an email address or phone number. But \u2013 and this is an important but \u2013 Stax needs certain phone permissions.\n\nWhat permissions? Three precisely: to make and manage phone calls; send and view messages; and access your contacts.\n\nWith those enabled, you can input how much airtime you want to buy, choose the bank or fintech-powered account you want to debit and input the phone number to credit or select from your phonebook.\n\nIt would be great if this is where it ends but \u2013 somewhat unfortunately \u2013 Stax asks for two other permissions to complete this task of buying airtime. Permission to display on top of other apps on your phone and another to connect with mobile money and telecom services on your behalf.\n\nThis gave me pause and maybe it is because of the copy: \u201cAllow Stax to have full control of your device?\u201d\n\nThree paragraphs beneath that question describe why the permission is needed. But all the bad news I have absorbed about privacy risks over the past four years flashed before my eyes, discouraging me from clicking \u201cAllow.\u201d\n\nJess Shorland, co-founder of Hover, agrees that some work needs to be done to make users more comfortable with the permissions. But she has an explanation for why they are necessary:\n\n\u201cIt allows us to automate the USSD session on behalf of the user. We\u2019ve basically built a different interface for USSD. The user interacts with that interface in a way that is a lot more screen-reader friendly.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one big permission request\n\nIn other words, the accessibility permission is what enables Stax to do these things on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\nWhen a user gives Stax access, the app activates a screen reading functionality and acts as a web browser. USSD is still happening in the background but instead of presenting those USSD screens, Stax\u2019s SDK reads the USSD dialog, runs the functions and shows the user a familiar app interface.\n\nBut what are the risks? Because there is no way to convince a user that giving up control doesn\u2019t somehow make them a little vulnerable. Shorland says Stax only takes the information needed to enable the user complete their transaction.\n\n\u201cEverything happens client side, not on our servers. It\u2019s also what enables us to be offline,\u201d she says, emphasizing that the app is open-source as a sign of transparency.\n\nWho in Africa needs Stax?\n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of cool that Stax, a fintech app, works offline like regular USSD. But with the internet being more central to the digital and financial services space today, why should we cheer for Stax?\n\nHover CEO and co-founder Ben Lyon says they are \u201cbuilding for the world as it is today so that we can bridge it to where it ought to go.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, there were 159 million monthly active mobile money accounts in Africa, according to the GSM Association. Africa represents more than half of the global mobile money usage.\n\nLyon thinks such numbers and smartphone usage \u2013 expected to double to 678 million by the end of 2025 \u2013 will make USSD even more mainstream. \u201cIt is a standard view of the tech industry that USSD is a bygone thing. It is actually just categorically wrong.\u201d\n\nIf that view is wrong as he insists and if USSD\u2019s user experience needs to be modernised for the smartphone age, then solutions like Stax would seem right on time.\n\nStax wants the app to be under 10MB so that it will work easily on every (Android) phone. Average transaction time is supposed to be 12 seconds.\n\nMy airtime purchase this morning took a bit longer. It showed a transaction failure message at the end and my bank debited me two seconds later. But I got the airtime.\n\nStax is\u2026 a work in progress\n\nAs of today, Stax currently supports transactions for eight banks (Access, First, Guaranty, Keystone, Sterling, UBA, Wema, Zenith), OPay and Paga.\n\nBeing in the USSD business in Nigeria means getting into the CBN (banks) vs NCC (telcos) scuffle around who pays for USSD services. What does Hover think about this debate?\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that USSD is about accessibility and inclusion, I believe strongly that consumers should not pay to access the channel,\u201d Lyon says.\n\n\u201cI hope NCC and other players come around to this view that consumers should not pay.\u201d\n\nOutside of that and other potential headaches, Stax\u2019s focus will be on convincing individuals and businesses that the app is reliable for all seasons and geographies, regardless of internet connection, says Peace Itimi, who leads growth for the product.\n\n\u201cWe are not monetizing Stax yet and it\u2019s not on the near term roadmap to monetize it,\u201d Lyon says. \u201cThere is a WhatsApp sized opportunity here and our first priority is to make sure we can seize the opportunity at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBen also name-drops WeChat as a possible inspiration for monetization. With a large user base, Stax could begin enabling discovery and access to third party services, in what could make Stax a super app of sorts.\n\n\u201cWhen people understand what the product can do, they will fall in love with it,\u201d Itimi says.\n\nThat depends: on how they fix those curious accessibility permissions, and if people really feel the need to switch from basic USSD \u2013 which works okay \u2013 to a shinier, app-enabled life.",

          "text": "This might be it!\n\nFinally, a financial app that considers the lifestyle of regular people, the harsh economic situation in the country, and everyday financial challenges that influence how people borrow, save or invest.\n\nCan we pique your interest?\n\nLet\u2019s start with savings. Some of us have been saving from when we were kids and it was cool to have a piggybank. Beyond piggybanks and other traditional ways of saving like Esusu, it has become common to save with banks and almost everyone has a savings account. Some even have up to three. But what value do you get from those savings accounts or the Esusu contribution? How much interest do you earn from them in a month?. Probably nothing. In most cases, you even pay more on annoying charges. The good news is that savings has evolved. It\u2019s no longer enough to just keep money anywhere and call it savings. Financial apps like Branch, PiggyVest and Kuda have shown that your savings can be an investment which allows you to earn actual interest, no matter how small. People hardly have enough to money to meet their financial needs and this clearly influences the service features on majority of these financial apps.\n\nHowever, they all differ in the interest they offer on their platforms. If you\u2019re familiar with all the top ones, a quick research will show you that while several savings and investment apps offer sumptuous interest rates with up to 15% per annum being the highest, Branch sets the pace with 20% interest rate per annum. Branch is also the only financial app so far that offers flexible withdrawals, which means your money doesn\u2019t have to be locked for any minimum duration. Afterall, we save for rainy days, don\u2019t we? So if the rainy day comes you should have access to your money.\n\nAll the things your bank won\u2019t do.\n\nHere are a few more things that sets Branch apart from both your regular banking and other financial apps.\n\nAt your beck and call, for a cost: Trust your bank to be on top of their game when they send you notifications but obviously at a cost. Branch has no such thing as SMS alert fees.\n\nPay, to pay bills: Every month, you pay all sorts of bills like DSTV and PHCN on your regular financial apps and banking apps. But of course, it always comes at a cost \u2013 N100 here, N50 there. Some banks even say this cost is negligible, but everyone knows if you stack up enough N100 notes, you\u2019ll eventually have enough to do something that is not negligible. Again, with Branch, this service is free!\n\nTransfer fees: How many transfers have you made in the last month alone? How many did you make last year? If you add up all the charges you pay for making transfers in a month, you can at least buy airtime or data with it. If you add up all the cost for a year, who knows what you can buy with it. The point is, in the end, all these costs and charges add up to something. So if you can make unlimited transfers for free, why would you rather pay for it? Branch doesn\u2019t think you should pay for it though.\n\nAnybody home? \u2013 Customer service with most banks would leave a sour taste in your mouth. They will put you hold. They will tell you the problem can\u2019t be solved remotely and you should go to a branch near you. When you get to the bank branch, you\u2019ll be in a queue, then you\u2019ll fill forms. Finally, they\u2019ll tell you to go wait at home that it will be done in a few days. That doesn\u2019t happen with Branch. Branch customer service team is available 24/7 and all problems are resolved in-app.\n\nBonus programs: Most financial apps have some form of bonus program but none of them is like Branch. Branch has a second-generation referral system that makes referrals a win-win for all parties. Whereas other financial apps pay one-time bonuses for referrals, Branch pays you N500 when friends you refer pay up their first loan. The friends you invited also earn N500. In addition, you earn N50 for every deposit of N300 and above. How cool is that?\n\nThe money part: Branch gives you up to N500,000 in loans within seconds of applying on the app. No collateral or paperwork required. Start with small loan amounts and get higher amounts the more you repay.\n\nClearly, Branch offers you more flexibility and a lot more profit than other financial apps. So if you\u2019ve been suffering from poor financial services, it\u2019s time to make a switch. Branch can be downloaded on the Google Play Store",

Onyekachi Izukanne, Michael Ukpong, and Ruke Awaritefe, the co-founders of TradeDepot, were selected as Endeavor Entrepreneurs on May 18, 2021, at the 15th Virtual International Selection Panel (v-ISP #15). TradeDepot is a B2B eCommerce platform that allows retailers to order inventory through multiple channels (Mobile, USSD, and WhatsApp) and have it delivered the next day.\n\nWith a mission to build strong entrepreneurship ecosystems in high-growth markets including Africa, Latin America, Asia, Europe & North America, Endeavor selects, mentors and accelerates the best high-impact entrepreneurs behind some of the world\u2019s most exciting scale-up companies, supporting them to scale their companies as well as drive economic growth and job creation.

The Endeavor network includes some of the world\u2019s most exciting scale-up entrepreneurs and most experienced mentors and investors. TradeDepot, a Factory-to-Retail distribution platform for Consumer Goods companies, is solving an important problem by organizing and digitizing an industry that affects the lives of millions of Nigerians. We\u2019re excited to support Onyekachi, Michael and Ruke with their mission of connecting retailers to manufacturers with mentorship and guidance as they continue to grow as leaders and scale TradeDepot.\u201d, said Tosin Faniro-Dada, the Managing Director & CEO of Endeavor in Nigeria.\n\nEndeavor Entrepreneur candidates go through a rigorous selection process which culminates in an International Selection Panel (ISP) where candidates are vetted by trusted mentors, drawn from Endeavor\u2019s extensive network of over 4,000 mentors across the world. As part of the process, TradeDepot was presented at the 15th v-ISP and was successfully selected in a unanimous decision by the panelists as part of a cohort of 13 entrepreneurs from 9 markets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to welcome Kachi, Michael, and Ruke to the Endeavor Entrepreneur network!

TradeDepot\u2019s mission is to consolidate this fragmented informal\n\nretail supply chain, connect the world\u2019s top consumer goods manufacturers to micro retailers on the streets of Africa\u2019s cities and support the informal retail sector with inventory financing to scale and grow.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nBitnob is a Nigerian startup that lets users buy, save and invest in bitcoin. Users can access these features and much more through the mobile app that\u2019s available for Android iOS.\n\nBitnob offers a ton of other options, like loans, Dollar-Cost-Averaging plans, and many much more. At first glance, the Bitnob app feels fantastic, with a simple UI and easy-to-find functions. But how does it handle the functions that truly matter, like buying BTC and saving?\n\nWe\u2019re about to find out.\n\nGetting started with Bitnob\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the onboarding process\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a new account on Bitnob\n\nSetting up your Bitnob app begins with installing it from your app store. When you open it for the first time, you\u2019ll need to create an account. Unlike many other apps, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you just sign up with an email and get on with it.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll need to supply your first name and last name. Your first name will be used to create a username that\u2019s unique to you (more on the username later.)\n\nYou\u2019ll also provide your phone number and receive an OTP for verification. Once that\u2019s clear, you can create a secure password and five-number transaction pin.\n\nI love this part because the app makes you choose something secure and up to 8 characters. Once you have all this dialed-in, you can get to the fun part.\n\nDepositing money on Bitnob\n\nAs an app for savings and investment, I expected Bitnob\u2019s deposit system to be as simple as inputting debit card information. Unfortunately, I was wrong.\n\nIf you remember, the topic has been complicated in Nigeria since the CBN has ordered banks to close accounts of crypto traders back in February. To protect its users, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you buy BTC straight from your bank account.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll first buy a recharge voucher from Ovarr. One thing I love is that the cards are sold in bundles ranging from $10 to $500. This way, users can buy within their financial limits.\n\nTo buy the voucher, you have to fill in your user information and then pay using a debit card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter buying the voucher, you\u2019ll get a pin that you can paste into Bitnob to activate your purchase.\n\nSo while the process is slightly longer than I expected, it works all the same.\n\nWithdrawals on Bitnob\n\nWithdrawals aren\u2019t quite as tedious, and you can complete them in a few short steps.\n\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need to select \u2018withdraw\u2019 in the plan of your choice. You can withdraw to a BTC wallet or a USD wallet. To get cash in my local bank account, I had to first select a USD wallet and then send the cash to my local account.\n\nYou can send BTC to your blockchain wallet by selecting \u2018send\u2019 and pasting the BTC address in the provided field. You can also use the QR code scanner instead of pasting the BTC address.\n\nSending BTC to another user follows this same procedure. You simply paste their address or scan their Bitnob BTC wallet address.\n\nCustomization options\n\nYou can make changes to your Bitnob account through the \u2018account\u2019 icon. From here, you can change your name and user name, and fill in next of kin details,\n\nYou can also add your bank accounts and mobile money accounts here. I love that you get to choose between the two options.\n\nBitnob Features\n\nNow we get into the staple features of Bitnob\n\nAccessing loans\n\nBitnob offers Nobcredit, which is an awesome way for users to get quick cash while still HODLing their BTC. You can access Nobcredit from the app\u2019s home page, and the process is quite quick.\n\nThe loan amount you get depends on how much BTC you have as collateral. You can then pay back before the tenure expires to reclaim your BTC.\n\nYour interest rate is calculated based on your loan-to-value ratio, or the amount of collateral you have. Average rates are between 16 and 17.2%, and loan tenures range between 3 and 12 months.\n\nI love that you can check your interest rate and collateral volume using the in-app loan calculator. This makes sure that you have all the information you need before moving forward.\n\nPlans\n\nOne of Bitnob\u2019s main features is that you can create a savings plan for your BTC. You can name the plan, choose the amount you want to save in USD, and pick the frequency of savings. The available options are daily, weekly, and monthly.\n\nYou can also select a maximum duration for the lock. WIthdrawing before the maturity date will earn you a 3% penalty. The penalty is one more reason to keep saving.\n\nThe plans work based on the concept of Dollar-Cost-Averaging, which simply allows you to invest large sums over a period. The longer your investment tenure and the more often you make deposits, the bigger your overall portfolio.\n\nUnfortunately, you can only fund your plan with money from your USD wallet, which means you\u2019ll have to buy vouchers that cover your savings amount.\n\nUsers can create as many plans as they need, and adjust the deposit amount, frequency, and maturity date for a bigger payout.\n\nReferrals\n\nBitnob allows you to earn up to $1,000 via referrals alone. And it\u2019s quite easy to get started because you get a referral code immediately when you sign up. You can copy the code right from the home screen.\n\nWhen a new user signs up with your referral code, you get a small USD reward based on how much your referral deposits. I love the referral system because it\u2019s as easy as sending your code to whoever you invite.\n\nSecurity and Support\n\nHow does Bitnob handle security and customer care?\n\nReaching customer care\n\nHave you ever tried to reach customer care only to be kept on hold for an unreasonable amount of time? I loved that Bitnob went a different route by allowing you to live chat with customer care right in the app.\n\nI got a response within 2 minutes (I actually checked) of sending the message which was quite impressive. You can also access the FAQs section from within the app.\n\nSecurity features\n\nIf you have trouble remembering your passwords don\u2019t worry. Bitnob automatically activates fingerprint login for every user with a biometric-enabled device. If you\u2019d rather log in old school, you can turn this feature off in the accounts tab.\n\nOne cool but annoying security feature is that the app logs you out every time your screen goes to sleep. I found this quite irritating because I use the app a lot and I have to log in every few seconds.\n\nBut I also can\u2019t stay mad because it protects my BTC even more. Once my screen turns off, no one can access or even see my funds, which makes me feel good.\n\nOther standard security features also apply. For example, you can\u2019t change passwords unless you provide the old password.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nOverall, the Bitnob app delivers an impressive performance. My only reservation is the convoluted process associated with depositing. However, it\u2019s completely understandable given the current financial laws.\n\nBefore you go, I wanted to tell you one quirky thing I found about the app. It displays these short but interesting messages on the login page and your dashboard, and they really add character to the app. Two of my favourite are \u2018we care about you,\u2019 and \u2018my favorite human, cheer up.\u2019 Be sure to look out for these when you download the app.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nBitnob is a Nigerian startup that lets users buy, save and invest in bitcoin. Users can access these features and much more through the mobile app that\u2019s available for Android iOS.\n\nBitnob offers a ton of other options, like loans, Dollar-Cost-Averaging plans, and many much more. At first glance, the Bitnob app feels fantastic, with a simple UI and easy-to-find functions. But how does it handle the functions that truly matter, like buying BTC and saving?\n\nWe\u2019re about to find out.\n\nGetting started with Bitnob\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the onboarding process\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a new account on Bitnob\n\nSetting up your Bitnob app begins with installing it from your app store. When you open it for the first time, you\u2019ll need to create an account. Unlike many other apps, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you just sign up with an email and get on with it.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll need to supply your first name and last name. Your first name will be used to create a username that\u2019s unique to you (more on the username later.)\n\nYou\u2019ll also provide your phone number and receive an OTP for verification. Once that\u2019s clear, you can create a secure password and five-number transaction pin.\n\nI love this part because the app makes you choose something secure and up to 8 characters. Once you have all this dialed-in, you can get to the fun part.\n\nDepositing money on Bitnob\n\nAs an app for savings and investment, I expected Bitnob\u2019s deposit system to be as simple as inputting debit card information. Unfortunately, I was wrong.\n\nIf you remember, the topic has been complicated in Nigeria since the CBN has ordered banks to close accounts of crypto traders back in February. To protect its users, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you buy BTC straight from your bank account.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll first buy a recharge voucher from Ovarr. One thing I love is that the cards are sold in bundles ranging from $10 to $500. This way, users can buy within their financial limits.\n\nTo buy the voucher, you have to fill in your user information and then pay using a debit card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter buying the voucher, you\u2019ll get a pin that you can paste into Bitnob to activate your purchase.\n\nSo while the process is slightly longer than I expected, it works all the same.\n\nWithdrawals on Bitnob\n\nWithdrawals aren\u2019t quite as tedious, and you can complete them in a few short steps.\n\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need to select \u2018withdraw\u2019 in the plan of your choice. You can withdraw to a BTC wallet or a USD wallet. To get cash in my local bank account, I had to first select a USD wallet and then send the cash to my local account.\n\nYou can send BTC to your blockchain wallet by selecting \u2018send\u2019 and pasting the BTC address in the provided field. You can also use the QR code scanner instead of pasting the BTC address.\n\nSending BTC to another user follows this same procedure. You simply paste their address or scan their Bitnob BTC wallet address.\n\nCustomization options\n\nYou can make changes to your Bitnob account through the \u2018account\u2019 icon.

          "title": "Does the Nigerian government want safety or surveillance with its new IMEI policy?",
          "text": "From July 2021, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) will require Nigerians to submit their IMEI numbers to a Centralised Equipment Identity Register.\n\nIn May 2021, the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy released a Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Registration (PDF) that requires Nigerians to submit their IMEI numbers to a Centralized Equipment Identity Register (CEIR), otherwise known as Device Management System (DMS), which the NCC would manage.\n\nSome of the reasons given for the Ministry\u2019s action include curtailing the counterfeit mobile phone market, discouraging mobile phone theft, enhancing national security, protecting consumer interest, increasing revenue generation for the government, reducing the rate of kidnapping, mitigating the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitating the blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices.\n\nThis move follows the Nigerian government\u2019s previous initiatives for digital identities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecall that in December 2020, the Nigerian government released a statement mandating all Nigerians to obtain their National Identification Number (NIN). Predictably, there was a rush as Nigerians all over the country attempted to get their NIN before the deadline at the end of 2020.\n\nThe directive caused a massive uproar among Nigerians because it was given in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic. Perhaps as a result of that, the deadline was moved to February 2021. Since then, it has been moved thrice, with the new deadline now June 30, 2021.\n\nThe NCC\u2019s IMEI policy will definitely have major implications for the entire nation if implemented.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nThe International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique number used to identify a mobile phone. It is usually found inside the battery compartment of most phones but can also be gotten by dialling *#06#. With an IMEI number, a phone can be tracked, but more than that, it can also be used for identity theft and even cloning a phone.\n\nEver since the news broke, there has been an understandable outcry, with IMEI and Isa Pantami trending on Twitter.\n\nHowever, while the government requires Nigerians to share this data, they do not have to, as your IMEI is part of the data transmitted to your network operator as soon as you make a call, use data, or send a text.\n\nThis information is rarely ever used beyond providing the details that your phone needs to work. However, security operatives can use it in the case of theft or while tracking terrorist activity.\n\nA few countries, including Azerbaijan, India, Cambodia, Chile, Columbia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Thailand, Turkey, and Lebanon, already have some form of this database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf a phone owner possesses their IMEI number, they could provide law enforcement agencies with this information to track these phones if they are stolen.\n\nWhile the reasons given by the government for this new policy appear genuine at first glance, Nigerians are bothered about the possible ways the government can exploit this data.\n\nAn article on The Insider details how the Saudi government uses IMEI numbers to track the location of women who have run away from abusive partners. Most of the doubts expressed regarding the use of this information for surveillance.\n\nIt has not always been used negatively. The ITU reports that implementing this in Great Britain and Turkey resulted in a reduction in mobile phone theft while it increased the number of legally imported mobile devices in Ukraine by 95%, as well as increasing revenues from the import of mobile devices\n\nAccording to a data privacy expert, some of the questions that should be asked include whether there are sufficient safeguards in the absence of a comprehensive data protection law. Also, is the government going to be transparent about its use of this data and what happens in the case of a violation?\n\nOne must remember that with the government mandating Nigerians to link their SIM cards to the NIN, the government already has rich insights into the activities of its citizens. Adding IMEI data to this would mean that they can also get real-time location data on anyone.\n\nWith Nigeria\u2019s poor human rights history, Nigerians may be right to be suspicious about the motives behind this policy.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "Economy still awaits FG\u2019s 300,000-unit housing intervention 12months after",
          "text": "The Nigerian economy, which is in dire straits at the moment, is still waiting for the federal government with its intervention in the housing sector as provided for in the economic sustainability plan (ESP) more than 12 months after that plan was inaugurated.\n\nESP is part of the government\u2019s responses to the COVID-19 pandemic aimed to provide stimulus package to businesses and critical sectors. Housing was listed among growth sectors and the strategy was to provide 300,000 housing units yearly.\n\nThe expectation was that the construction of these houses would generate activities in the economy. The strategy envisaged the creation of 1.8 million jobs, starting in 12 months and subsequently creating 1.5 million homes for families across the country.\n\n12 months after, it remains to be seen or heard where these houses, which target low-income earners, are being built. As a result, jobs are not being created, leading to more Nigerians falling into poverty.\n\nAbout 82.9 million Nigerians were in poverty before COVID-19, according to the World Bank. On October 7, 2020, the Bank said that Nigeria, with a poverty rate of 39.1 percent, has the largest poor population (79 million extreme poor) in Sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for 20 percent of the total poor in the region.\n\nRead Also: How Sanwo-Olu is bridging housing deficit in Lagos\n\nThe bank says 10 million Nigerians were forced into poverty as a result of COVID-19, adding that the country\u2019s poor population is set to rise from 82.9 million in 2019 to 90.0 million in 2022 due to natural population growth.\n\nBut with the economic effects of the COVID-19 crisis, the national poverty rate is instead forecast to jump from 40.1 percent in 2019 to 45.2 percent in 2022, implying that 100.9 million Nigerians will be living in poverty by 2022.\n\nThis is an unfortunate and worrisome situation which, in part, would have been solved by the ESP strategy on housing and other growth sectors if it had been followed through as planned.\n\nThe strategy which got a N200 billion lifeline from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is an ambitious one which was why it was hailed by housing sector stakeholders even though the 300,000 housing units, according to them, was like a drop of water in an ocean given a 20-million housing deficit.\n\n\u201cFederal government\u2019s decision to build 300,000 houses across the country and also to spend N2 trillion on rural roads construction is a welcome development that will positively impact the economy in various ways,\u201d Femi Akintunde, GMD, Alpha Mead Group, noted.\n\n\u201cFirst, it is a form of reflationary measure that will stimulate economic output through increased spending in housing and infrastructure development. Such investment will create large-scale employment, increase the stock of housing and the provision of additional road infrastructure will help to improve connectivity and ease our logistics challenges,\u201d he added.\n\nAmong other things, the ESP strategy aims at easing bottlenecks in the delivery of social housing and delivering affordable homes through direct government interventions in housing construction.\n\nIt involves working with state governments to identify land for housing construction in all Local Government Areas and targets 100 percent local input for the construction of 400 homes in each Local Government Area.\n\nThe project elements include standardising the design of homes for cost management and industrialisation of the construction process, identifying and selecting delivery partners formed by groups of professionals and artisanal builders as primary delivery channels as well as creating a \u2018homes warehouse\u2019 to buy completed homes from delivery partners, in the absence of ready off-takers.\n\nSimilarly, there were also plans for encouraging private sector involvement and facilitating maturity of the mortgage market that will cater to the needs of middle-class Nigerians while government addresses the needs of low-income earners and the poor.\n\nAll these underpin the concerns raised so far by housing industry stakeholders on the government\u2019s delay and/or slow take-off of the intervention scheme.\n\nAnalyst\u2019s views on possible causes of this delay are varied. While an economist who did not want to be named explained to BusinessDay that government did not have the needed money to build the projected houses, Akintunde blames structural dislocations in the housing sector financing structure.\n\nVictor Onukwugha, President, Association of Housing Corporations of Nigeria (AHCN), was quoted recently as commending the inclusion of the housing sector in the ESP but faulted the actual execution strategies of the project elements which, he noted, were vague without a clear cut plan and roles for executions.\n\n\u201cIt is a year now that the plan was rolled out and from what we can all see, not much has been achieved in easing bottlenecks in the delivery of social housing aside from the purported release of N200 billion by Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for the project. The second track, which proposes to deliver affordable homes through direct government intervention is still hanging,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "There was a clear consensus at the World Health Organisation (WHO) Africa regional conference with the World Economic Forum last week that building vaccine manufacturing capacity will not be instrumental to the current fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa, given that the time and resources required cannot be urgently activated.\n\nIt might take a minimum of three or more years to establish production structures, such as obtaining agreements on intellectual property, technology transfer, training and building infrastructure, Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director, Africa, said.\n\nDespite seeing increased interest in production from high-income countries, African political leaders and even pharmaceutical companies with existing bases in Africa, Moeti said much of it would not resolve the current challenges of accessing vaccines for most of the continent.\n\n\u201cThere is a great interest in some of the high-income countries to start something with some African countries to produce vaccines, but these are medium to long-term plans. To produce vaccines in this emergency mode, the infrastructure to do that will not only need an injection of capital. We will need to find investors in the process and it needs to be looked at going forward,\u201d according to Moeti.\n\nSimilarly, Razia Khan, Standard Chartered Bank head of research and chief economist Africa and Middle East, said efforts to build manufacturing capacity would apply more to preparedness for future pandemic.\n\nIt will play a crucial role in terms of what needs to be done to boost the provision of healthcare services generally and encourage manufacturing in a greater number of localities.\n\n\u201cThese are all important issues that do need policy solutions to be formulated now,\u201d she said.\n\nExcluding Nigeria, countries including Senegal, South Africa and Rwanda are already seeing green light for manufacturing partnerships with the European Union listing them as centres for future manufacturing.\n\nBut in entirety, the capacity for vaccine manufacturing resides in five countries: Egypt, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia. The production here, however, is largely focused on last mile processes of packaging and labelling, playing down on the significant part of vaccine preparation.\n\nAlso, current vaccine capacities at less than 100 million doses are unable to address the scale of production needed to vaccinate the continent, according to WHO.\n\nNigeria, Africa\u2019s most populated country with the eight-largest COVID-19 cases on the continent, requires roughly 300 million doses of vaccines to develop herd immunity, for instance.\n\nSo far, it has only had access to about 4 million doses of Astrazeneca vaccines, sufficient for less than 1 percent of its populations.\n\nDuring the pre-pandemic period, sourcing vaccines in Nigeria and most African countries often came from donations from UNICEF supported by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, with fewer than 10 countries being self-sufficient in terms of vaccine procurement.\n\nWith this limitation in capacity and the urgency of response required by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no immediate readiness to repurpose facilities for large-scale production through partnerships.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore vitally important that African vaccine manufacturers establish supply networks to export to markets (in Africa and elsewhere). Supply chain could use the existing economic zones in Africa. For example, the Economic Community of West African States,\u201d WHO advised in a report.",

Alphonsus Bello in the farmland behind the Catechetical Training School, Malunfashi while the whereabouts of Fr. Joe Keke was still unknown.\n\nHe said: \u201cLast night, one of the parishes of the Sokoto Diocese \u2013 St. Vincent Ferrer Catholic Church Malunfashi, in Katsina State \u2013 was attacked by unknown gunmen.\n\n\u201cTwo priests were kidnapped, Frs.

          "text": "Ukpono Ukpong, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has said the implementation of financial autonomy for the state legislature and judiciary would commence next week.\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, disclosed this in his office after a conciliation meeting to resolve the strike of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN).\n\nNgige said the striking legislative and judiciary workers will call off their prolonged strike as soon as implementation starts.\n\nAddressing the press, Ngige said the parties signed a document containing the framework for each of the state governments to grant autonomy to their legislature and judiciary.\n\nHe noted that Governors had studied the document and were in agreement with it, adding that the implementation would commence next week with the distribution of the April allocation from the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC).\n\nHe added that whatever comes from FAAC, even the state governments yet to put their fund allocation committees in place, would wait to do so, to ensure that the money goes down there.\n\nThe parties involved both agreed to the adoption and signing of a Memorandum of Action (MOA) which also contained that strike would be suspended upon implementation of financial autonomy as from Monday May 24, when the April FAAC to states is expected to start dropping.\n\n\u201cThe Governments of the respective States shall credit the Accounts of each State House of Assembly and each State Judiciary with the pro-rata amount due each of the two arms of Government under the 2021 Appropriation for each State in accordance with B (iii) of this Memorandum of Action commencing from April 2021 State Allocation from the State Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) as a sign of good faith.\n\n\u201cThe B (iii) in reference says \u201cwhenever there is Revenue shortfall, lower than the Budgeted fund, the monthly allocations to each arm of government shall reflect a percentage of the appropriated sum or an irreducible minimum amount to be allocated every month for the purpose of meeting its costs whichever is higher.\n\nThis percentage will reflect as 100% in Personnel Cost. The Running Cost and Capital Cost will be pro-rata of Revenue performance as per the State Appropriation Law.\n\n\u201cUpon fulfillment of the above, \u201cthe ongoing Industrial Action shall be suspended with immediate effect from the date of the agreements contained in this Memorandum of Action (MOA), provided item D above is effected immediately and others effected within the 45 days window as prescribed in this MOA.\n\nThe framework adds, \u201cannually upon the determination of budget ceilings or envelopes from the Budget Committee of the State, anchored by the Budget Office of the State headed by the Commissioner in-charge, each arm of government \u2013 Executive, Judiciary, Legislature, acting through its own Budget and/or Funds Management Committee, shall prepare its Budget Estimates/Details and submit same to the State House of Assembly;\n\n\u201cThere shall also be established in each State a State Account Allocation Committee (SAAC) to be given legislative backing in the various Fund Management Laws and charged with the responsibility to oversee the distribution of available resources to each arm of Government. Membership to reflect the template of the FAAC.\n\n\u201cEvery State Commissioner of Finance and State Accountant General shall on a monthly basis furnish the Committee with the revenue performance of the State within a stipulated timeline not exceeding 7 days after each FAAC meeting.\n\nBased on the revenue receipt, evaluations and the needs of each arm, the Committee shall work out an appropriate budget release based on the Appropriation for each Arm of Government for that year.\n\n\u201cThe Presidential Implementation Committee shall give a biweekly appraisal and follow-up.\u201d\n\nNgige described the signing of the document by all parties as historic and a fundamental kick-starting of restructuring being clamoured for by some Nigerians, acclaiming the President for the unmatched political will.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, it will be pertinent to point out to those clamouring for restructuring that this is a fundamental restructuring of the Nigerian Federation.\n\nThis is a restructuring that has granted autonomy to the state judiciary and legislature. I am happy that we are part of this history making and that we made this history in the life of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nHe praised the President for achieving this feat through the instrumentality of the fourth alteration that gave birth to Section 121 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the Presidential Executive Order 10 and the establishment of the implementation committee.",

There is so much condemnation from Nigerian Governors, Northern Governors, Southern Governors etc.\n\n\u201cThese groups and individuals should never be condemned and must be praised for their bold comments trying to modernise and improve cattle rearing in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnother reason why we should shun away from open grazing is the way old methods of settlements of crises between herdsmen and farmers have been abandoned,\u201d he said.\n\nJibrin congratulated all the governors for the bold steps they are taking to curve the menace of open grazing, kidnapping and banditry.\n\nHe said Nigeria must remain one entity and one Nigeria as against what is happening now.\n\n\u201cWe should rely more on dialogue and mediation with herders, Fulani leaders, Traditional rulers and our Governors in order to end this feud.\n\n\u201cFinally I strongly appeal to the Federal and State Governments to maintain all existing grazing reserves by providing special amenities mentioned in my earlier suggestions.\n\n\u201cIt is also necessary that Government uses the services of World Bank to archive all plans that will come out of well modernised Grazing Reserves in Nigeria,\u201d he suggested.",

          "text": "A leaked audio tape has disclosed one of the moments when Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State schemed with his officials to frustrate the Nigeria Labour Congress protesters and \u201cneutralise them.\u201d\n\nThe 16-minute audio tape, obtained was believably captured on Tuesday by one of El-Rufai\u2019s kitchen cabinet members.\n\nThe audio captured the governor\u2019s anger with the NLC.\n\nEl-Rufai and other voices in the tape were caught implying that the NLC leaders first camped in Kano State before they reached Kaduna and were mobilised from there by the Kano State government, making a hidden citation to Governor Abdullahi Ganduje\u2019s officials.\n\nAlso in the tape, the governor was also clued in on the activities of alleged hired thugs and the plan to disturb the peaceful protest on Wednesday and he was excited about the development.\n\nThey also examined the police personnel whom they accused of giving protection to the NLC protesters and not siding with the state government.\n\n\u201cWe pray they come out tomorrow, let them come out. We will mobilise,\u201d one of those with him said.\n\nAnswering a phone call believably from the Minister of Transportation. Rotimi Amaechi, as captured in the tape, the governor said, \u201cOh Amaechi, excellency, how now? Oga sir, how are you doing? Hello, can you hear me?\n\n\u201cOga sir, I may not be able to come today because I still have a situation on my hands. I think we will have neutralised them by tomorrow or next. I don\u2019t know whether you are still in town.\n\n\u201cGive me today and tomorrow. Let\u2019s plan for Thursday evening. Thursday afternoon, we will be in economic summit. It will be virtual but I will be busy. Thuraday evening will be fine.\n\n\u201cPoliticians\u2026nobody wants to confront the unions. I am the only North politician in Nigeria. This whole thing is being financed. They came from Kano right? They brought aides from Kano. They went to Kano.\u201d\n\nHe also accused an unnamed governor of providing mobilisation funds for the NLC to destabilise the northwestern state.\n\nWorkers in the state workers had on Monday begun a five-day strike over El-Rufai administration\u2019s retrenchment of 45,000 workers and his alleged anti-labour policies.\n\nWhile addressing fellow governors at the meeting, he said, \u201cI would like to inform the forum that one of our colleagues, a state governor actually gave the NLC money to come to Kaduna to do this because people think everything is politics. This is not politics. This is a monster that will consume all of us. It will not consume Kaduna I\u2019m confident of that.\u201d\n\nWhen reminded that the NGF issued a statement from the office of the chairman on the subject, El-Rufai replied, \u201cThat press release with the greatest respect was unhelpful. It was unhelpful. It said nothing. It was trying to play both sides.\u201d\n\nIt was reported Tuesday that hoodlums reportedly loyal to El-Rufai disturbed the peaceful protest embarked upon by the NLC in Kaduna State.\n\nThe governor in a tweet had earlier said the labour union leaders were declared wanted for \u201ceconomic sabotage and attacks on public infrastructure under Miscellaneous Offences Act.\u201d\n\nHe said there would be a \u201chandsome reward\u201d for anyone who knows the whereabouts of the union leaders.\n\nA source said while the protest was going on in Kaduna on Tuesday, some suspected thugs in different vehicles, started stoning the protesters.\n\nThe NLC later on Thursday ended the five-day warning strike.",

He projected that Ahoada-Kaima Section II is expected to be commissioned soon.\n\nAt Obikwere flyover, the site contractor informed the minister of the failed drainage system which has caused constant water retention around the corridor, adding that the proposal to correct the anomaly would be sent to the Ministry for approval.\n\nWhile inspecting Section IIIA, Alasoadura said the contract was awarded to ensure safe and efficient movement of traffic along the already dualized 15KM stretch of the Highway from the Onne Port Refinery, Eleme Petrochemicals and other industries along the highway by eliminating traffic bottlenecks and ensuring well drained and durable road.\n\nSen. Alasoadura added that the completion of the East-West road which was awarded 20 years ago, is a major priority of the present administration, even if it involves borrowing.\n\nThe minister further decried the devastated state of the Aleto Bridge in Section IIIA of the East-West road and sought for urgent attention before it collapses, if not it would affect the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cWe have to put all our resources, energy and goodwill together to ensure that it is urgently reconstructed for the movement of goods and services that will benefit the people of region and the nation at large\u201d, he added.\n\nResponding to the minister, the Chief Engineer, Reynolds Construction Company Nigeria Limited (RCC), Zavontenik Igor, recalled that the contract was awarded in December 2014, at the contract sum of N43,869,381,730.23, with a completion period of 24 months.\n\nSpeaking further, he maintained that fund constraints and increase in the overhead cost of materials has caused the slow pace of work, assuring that the project will be completed within the stipulated time if the company is mobilized on time with the required capital.\n\nAlso, President-General of the Ogoni Youths Federation (OYF), Comrade Legborsi Yamaabana, appealed to the Minister to order the contractors to speedily commence payment of compensation to affected families during the cause of expansion and dualization of the East-West road for peace to reign.",

          "text": "Former Head of State and elder statesman, Gen. Yakubu Gowon , has urged the Citizenship and Leadership Training Center CLTC to strengthen its synergy with the National Youth Service Corps NYSC for the growth of our youth and nation.\n\nSaid this while delivering his good will message via zoom during the 70th anniversary of the CLTC yesterday in Abuja.\n\nThe retired general noted that the NYSC has been a platform for human development since its inception, hence the need for a more strengthened collaboration from the CLTC, being a Centre under the ministry of Youth and Sports Development.\n\nHe thanked the CLTC for 70 years of commitment to bettering the lives of the youth and instilling core ethics and leadership values.\n\nAccording to him, \u201c The youth service Corp has been serving the nation so predictably in all areas of human development and service since its inception in 1973.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for these two citizenship and leadership training schemes to work in synergy for the growth of our youth and nation.\u201d\n\nThe Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, represented by Nebeolisa Anako, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, during a keynote speech, gave insight on the history of CLTC which he said was established as the \u201cMan O War Bay\u201d before the modification in 1989.\n\nHe further spoke on the several values and mandates of the CLTC and thanked the Centre for not lagging in delivering its mandates and core responsibilities.\n\nThe Minister stated that technology has caused Nigeria and the world at large, tremendous economic change and demolishing old boundaries. He however, decried the decline in morals, citizenship and leadership values the advent of technology has caused.\n\nIn his analysis of the national ethics, he mentioned that the attainment of peace is key for development. Reason why he believes in deployment of the national ethics as instruments for settling conflicts so they don\u2019t degenerate to chaos.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs you may already know, the centre was established as the \u2018\u2019Man O War Bay\u2019\u2019 training centre in 1957 and located in Victoria, Southern Cameroon before Nigeria attained independence. It was given a legal status by an Ordinance published in the extra-ordinary Gazette NO 45 of 10th August, 1960 and modified by Decree NO38 of December, 1989 which changed the Name of the Citizenship and Leadership Training Centre.\n\n\u201cThe law that established the Centre saddled it with the responsibility to provide strategic training to Nigerians on morals, ethics, values, self-confidence, self-reliance, good citizenship and responsible leadership as well as other social related challenges of the society.\n\n\u201cYou will agree with me that Technology is sweeping through the world, Nigeria inclusive, demolishing old boundaries and simplifying processes thereby expanding opportunities for economic growth and prosperity. However decline in morals, ethics, character and citizenship values present a real and potent threat to the attainment of these potentials with its attendant\u2019s negative effect on peace and nation building.\n\n\u201cSection 23 of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended dwells on the national ethics to include Discipline, Integrity, Dignity of Labour, Social justice, Religion Tolerance, Self-reliance and Patriotism. A deeper analysis of these national ethics indicates that citizens imbibing and internalising these ethics is an indispensable roadmap for the attainment and sustenance of peace which itself is a panacea for development.\n\n\u201cLet me quickly mention here that peace is not necessarily the absence of conflicts but has to do with the instruments put in place to manage conflicts so that it does not degenerate into chaos and restiveness.\n\n\u201cThis is where Citizenship and Leadership Training Centre comes in. The Centre is a unique establishment which by its mandate plays an important role in the creation of awareness as it relates to the promotion and sustenance of pace and peaceful co-existence in the society.\u201d",

We are highly shocked and pained.\u201d\n\nLalong while condoling with the the President and Commander in Chief Muhammadu Buhari, the Nigerian Army, families of the deceased officers and men, as well as the entire Nigerian Armed Forces said the sad event is deeply regrettable but should not deter the Armed Forces from giving their best in the service of the nation just as the deceased COAS, officers and men did before their tragic death.\n\nHe prayed God to grant the deceased eternal rest and comfort their families.\n\nDevastating to Nigeria\n\nNiger State Governor and Chairman of the North Central States Governors\u2019 Forum, Abubakar Bello, said the death was devastating to the nation at its trying moment of insecurity.\n\nGovernor Sani Bello disclosed this in a statement signed by his spokesperson, Mary Noel-Berje.\n\nHe said the death of COAS and others was coming at a time when the newly appointed Chief of Army Staff along with other Service Chiefs have developed renewed efforts in tackling insecurity in the country.\n\nThe Governor said the late Chief of Army Staff has, within his short time in the office, demonstrated and showed remarkable commitment and professionalism in the course of discharging his duty.\n\nHe called on the family, the Nigerian Army, friends and associates to accept the death as the will of Allah and bear the irreparable loss.\n\nThe Governor enjoined all to pray for the repose of his soul and other officers, and for Allah to give their families the strength to accept their divine call as all souls shall taste death.\n\nA national tragedy\n\nThe Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN described the crash and deaths as a national tragedy.\n\nMalami received the news of the crash of the military aircraft in Kano while attending to guests in preparation for the wedding ceremony of his second son, Abiru Rahman Malami billed for tomorrow, according to a statement from his media office.\n\nHe described the Late Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru and members of his team as dedicated patriotic Nigerians whose efforts to improve the security situation of the country was manifest.\n\nMalami prayed Allah to grant eternal salvation for all that lost their lives in the air mishap.\n\nHe also prayed that the family members have the fortitude to bear the loss\n\nThe Minister said the late Army Officer who died in active service to the nation will always be remembered as a selfless and patriotic Nigerian who is passionate in duty.\n\nA shining star\n\nIn his reaction to the disaster, Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, said Lt.Gen. Attahiru was a shining star whose sudden death has robbed Nigeria of an officer striving to bring new drive to secure the country against terrorists and other threats to national security, according to a statement signed by the state\u2019s Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan.\n\n\u201cThe Governor said the news of General Attahiru\u2019s death has left him deeply shaken, with a sense of great personal loss, coming so soon after his appointment had brought immense pride and a sense of hope to the people of Kaduna State,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cGovernor El-Rufai on behalf of the Government and People of Kaduna State, has extended his condolences to President Muhammadu Buhari, all branches of the military, especially the Nigerian Army, and the family of General Attahiru, as well as the families of all the officers who have lost their lives in this national tragedy.\n\n\u201cHe prayed to Allah to forgive their shortcomings and grant them eternal rest, and comfort their families as the nation, grapples with this colossal and very painful loss.\u201d",

We achieved our goals, we did it with passion and we did it together,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cFirstly, I want to thank the supporters, who have all played such an important part in helping us reach new heights for Wolves, and the people of the city, who embraced us and made us feel at home.\n\n\u201cI, of course, want to thank all of the staff at Wolves, for their support and total commitment, every single day.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, I want to thank each-and-every player that we\u2019ve worked with since the day we started, for their loyalty, their dedication, hard work and talent. They are the ones who have made this amazing journey possible for us.\n\n\u201cSunday will be a very emotional day, but I am so happy that the fans will be back in Molineux and we can share one last special moment together, as one pack.\u201d\n\nNuno signed a three-year deal on his arrival in the Midlands in May 2017, days after he was sacked by Porto at the end of a trophy-less season.\n\nIn his first season at Molineux, he won the Championship title with two games to spare leading the club back to the Premier League after a six-year absence, which earned him a contract extension until June 2021.\n\nHe established Wolves as Premier League regulars in the following seasons, securing back-to-back seventh-placed finishes which earned the club a spot in the Europa League, their first European qualification in 39 years.\n\nAfter three qualifying rounds which included victory over Serie A side Torino, Wolves came second in a group including Braga, Besiktas and Slovan Bratislava.\n\nTheir European path was interrupted by a late 1-0 defeat to eventual winners Sevilla at the quarter-final stage.\n\nWolves executive chairman Jeff Shi praised Nuno\u2019s influence at the club and says the return of fans at Molineux on Sunday will provide the manager a fitting farewell as he seeks a new challenge.\n\n\u201cNuno has brought us some incredibly special moments at Wolves that will never be forgotten, but every chapter comes to an end,\u201d Shi said.\n\n\u201cHis loyalty and dedication over the last four years has been immeasurable, and we cannot thank him enough for the progress he has made for Wolves.\n\n\u201cSunday was already going to be a very special day, welcoming our supporters back for the first time in more than a year; but it will also now be a fitting goodbye for someone who will forever remain an important part of Wolves history.\u201d\n\nTottenham have distanced themselves from the Portuguese boss for their own managerial vacancy, with the Molineux departure believed to not be linked to any role another club.",
