          "text": "The Indigenous People of Biafra has accused security operatives of house-to-house abduction and killing of youths in the South-East.\n\nWhile denying any involvement in the killing of 128 security personnel in Imo State as alleged, the secessionist group said neither IPOB nor its security outfit, Eastern Security Network, had been involved in any attack on security personnel in Imo or any part of the country.\n\nThe group\u2019s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, in a statement, accused the Nigerian Army and other security agencies of desperately looking for ways to incriminate IPOB and ESN to justify the continued extrajudicial killings of their members.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe attention of the Indigenous People of Biafra has been drawn to the fallacious and fabricated statements credited to the Commander, 34 Field Artillery Brigade Obinze, Gen. Raymond Utasaha, and Commissioner of Police, Imo State, Alhaji Abudu Yaro, that IPOB killed 128 security personnel in Imo State.\n\n\u201cThe statements are not only fabricated, but ridiculous and untenable. How could IPOB that is not armed be able to kill as many as 128 security personnel in one state? What an illogical and ridiculous claim.\n\n\u201cWe therefore wish to declare for the records that IPOB did not kill any security personnel in Imo or any state for that matter. IPOB, since inception, has remained a peaceful movement with the sole mandate of restoring Biafra.\n\n\u201cWe have not changed our non-violent philosophy for the restoration of Biafra. If for any reason we need to change our peaceful approach, we shall make same public, but for now, we have not gone into arms struggle, and don\u2019t intend to.\n\n\u201cIt will be necessary again to clarify that IPOB is not, and should not be taken for \u2018unknown gunmen\u2019 that have been reportedly having issues with security agencies in parts of the country, especially the defunct Eastern Nigeria. IPOB should not be held responsible for the activities of a group not commissioned by us.\n\n\u201cImportantly, the Eastern Security Network set up in December 2020 has no relationship whatsoever with the unknown gunmen. ESN was a child of circumstance established to resist the killer herdsmen rampaging our communities. ESN operatives are in the forests where they are keeping their appointments with those invading our ancestral land.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The pains are not mere emotional flashes but a piercing sting. He was a great philanthropist whose death has created a vacuum difficult to fill.\n\n\u201cHe demonstrated humility with a large heart to accommodate the feelings of the downtrodden, hence the need to bring his body to his place of birth in Arigidi Akoko.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis financial intervention can be seen in electricity and security; he provided patrol vehicles for both police and army and he also created employment at various projects he embarked upon just to mention a few.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Gov. Nasir El-Rufai has said that tackling insecurity requires cooperation of all states and for security managers as well as intelligence agencies to share information.\n\nThe governor gave the advice during the 2021 second quarter meeting of Directors of the Directorate of State Security (DSS) in North West states, on Thursday in Kaduna.\n\n\u201cAny plan that seeks to address the problem in only one state will at best yield a temporary respite as the criminals will retreat to safe havens.\n\n\u201cThe security agencies need to strengthen intelligence gathering, to establish not just the identities, plans, and locations of these criminals, but to actively disrupt their capacity to organise and mount attacks on our citizens.\n\n\u201cBut it is also very important to ensure that prompt and coordinated action becomes the default response of the Armed Forces and the Police to the profusion of actionable intelligence that is already available,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nEl-Rufai said that the governors of the North west and Niger state appreciated the salient fact of inter-state cooperation as far back as 2015.\n\n\u201cThey came together to fund simultaneous operations by the federal military and security agencies across the largely ungoverned Kamuku-Kuyambana forest swathes that straddle about seven of our states up to Dajin Rugu.\n\n\u201cThese operations disrupted the cattle rustling gangs, but were unfortunately not sustained as a continuous exercise to dominate these spaces and assert within them the authority of the Nigerian state,\u2019\u2019 he recalled.\n\nAccording to the governor, the criminal gangs have become more daring and dangerous since recovering from their near defeat in 2015.\n\n\u201cAs the lead agency for domestic intelligence and counter-intelligence, the DSS has a vital role to play in providing the reliable information needed by the Police and Armed Forces for the total defeat of these dangerous insurgents,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nEl Rufai warned of looming food crisis in the country, because \u2018\u2019 farmers in various communities are unable to go to their farms, that is when they are lucky not to have fled their remote villages under pressure from the criminals.\u2019\u2019\n\nEarlier, the DSS Director in Kaduna State, Mr Idris Ahmed-Koya, commended Kaduna State Government for its support to the command.\n\n\u201cThe current efforts by the state government to establish a drone centre for intelligence gathering and support of other security operations is highly commendable.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to him, the centre will be a game changer in tackling insecurity not only in Kaduna state but the North-west and even North-central zones when it becomes operational.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, all our successful operations are made possible and easy through the requisite working tools provided by the State Government. The IMSI Grabber is one of such tools,\u2019\u2019 he disclosed.\n\nAhmed-Koya, however, appealed to the governor to provide the command with operational vehicles to help in carrying out operations.\n\nNAN\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Despite the many challenges we are facing, I want Nigerians to rest assured that we will secure this country.\n\n\u2018\u2018We will secure our infrastructure, our highways, our communities and our forests. We will secure the lives of our people,\u2019\u2019 it further quoted him as saying.\n\nThe president told members of the Nigeria Police Force that government would strive to improve their welfare and capacity, but added that the citizens equally had expectations from them.\n\n\u2018\u2018First, let me commend the Inspector-General of Police and the entire Force for the recent efforts to restore peace to troubled parts of the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have charged the Inspector-General to leave no stone unturned in rebuilding the morale of his officers and men, especially in the aftermath of the mindless violence associated with the EndSARS protests, as well as the recent spate of attacks on Police Stations in some parts of the country.\u201d\n\nWhile commending the Lagos governor for providing the security equipment and assets, the president noted that it would go a long way in boosting the morale of the Police and further enhance the capacity to fight crime and combat criminality.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is even more touching in the light of the unwarranted violence that ensued in the wake of the ENDSARS protests last October during which the security architecture in Lagos State was severely damaged,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president added that it was commendable that Lagos State, the Centre of Excellence, had shown a truly resilient spirit in the face of the massive destruction it suffered last October.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2018You did not allow yourselves to be deterred by the severe setback; instead, you have bounced back and already boldly rebuilding the confidence of residents and investors in the State.\n\n\u2018\u2018I acknowledge the initiative taken to kick-start the rebuilding process, through the establishment of the Lagos State Rebuild Trust Fund, and through this very laudable effort by the Lagos State Security Trust Fund.\n\n\u201cI enjoin other State Governments to emulate your bold, proactive and resourceful initiative.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe president also reiterated that government was taking its constitutional oath to secure the lives and properties of the Nigerian people very seriously.\n\nAccording to him, his administration is conscious of the fact that lasting security is a necessary foundation for business, investment and true prosperity.\n\nBuhari declared that no federal government, since 1999, had been as committed as his administration toward reforming and repositioning the Nigeria Police Force and national policing architecture.\n\n\u2018\u2018In 2019, I signed into law the Act establishing the Nigeria Police Trust Fund, the first in the history of the Force, to provide guaranteed funding to support Police welfare, logistics and equipment.\n\n\u2018\u2018In 2020, I assented to the Bill amending the Nigeria Police Act, which was originally enacted in 1943.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new Act, a vast improvement over the old one, among other things, spells out the modalities for the implementation of a National Community Policing Scheme in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new scheme will build confidence within our local communities and make them active stakeholders in the safety and security of their environs.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are currently recruiting 10,000 Police officers to reinforce our personnel capacity across the country.\n\n\u201cIn addition to this, I have directed the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission to carry out an upward review of Police salaries and benefits,\u2019\u2019 he said.

Why is the whole conversation surrounding OTT regulations and licences coming at a time the President\u2019s indecent tweet was justly deleted?\n\nNigeria\u2019s Twitter ban, affront on nation\u2019s democracy \u2013 Yiaga Africa\n\n\u201cIt tells a lot about the proverbial witch that cried at night and the child\u2019s death in the morning! Clearly, the authorities are only hiding under the pretext of \u2018regulation\u2019 to strangulate the voice and liberty of the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cThe right to internet and access to digital information are human rights that cannot be arbitrarily derogated without lawful justification. The Buhari regime\u2019s growing lust for despotism is enough yardstick to reject any dangerous OTT regulations.\n\n\u201cThe real trouble with Nigeria is leadership, not social media. Given that the internet space seems to be the only platform patriotic Nigerians ventilate their grievances, the planned OTT regulation appears like a cynical attempt to cover up the failure of our rulers by clamping down on the right to social media.\n\n\u201cThe current leadership of our country lacks the legal, constitutional and moral rights to make delicate policies that are capable of endangering basic human rights and democratic liberties.\u201d\n\nOgun added that a serious government would focus more on security, poverty, job creation, infrastructure and getting the economy out of the woods, instead of trying to gag the media through the \u201cundemocratic policies\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will resist the policy by all forces permissible under our laws\u201d, the Convener of the Civil Coalition for Constitutional Governance added.\n\nIn a statement, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa urged activists, civil society organisations and all lovers of democracy, to boycott any events organized by the Buhari administration in commemoration of the June 12.\n\nHe said it will be hypocritical of the government to claim to celebrate the ideals of the date, when the same is in gross violation of people\u2019s freedom of expression.\n\nAdegboruwa condemned the \u201cillegal ban of Twitter and the unwarranted censorship of all media organisations\u201d.\n\nThe activist stressed that June 12 represents total freedom, the free expression of the will of the people, justice, equality and respect for human rights.\n\n\u201cThe decision of the government to suspend the operations of Twitter and to force media organisations to comply therewith, are contrary to the spirit of June 12.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue to live in a nation where the rights of citizens depend on the personal idiosyncrasies of those in power; where the institutions of State are deployed whimsically to settle personal grievances, as President Buhari is doing in respect of his personal dispute with Twitter\u201d, he said.\n\nThe Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and scores of citizens have dragged the Buhari administration to the ECOWAS Court.\n\nThe suit, filed by Femi Falana (SAN), is demanding a dismissal of the threat to arrest Twitter users, an end to the repression of human rights, freedom of speech, media freedom, among others.",

          "text": "By Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja; Precious Igbowelundu, Oluwakemi Dauda, Oyebola Owolabi and Alao Abiodun\n\nPresident inaugurates Lagos-Ibadan rail, Sanwo-Olu\u2019s security equipment\n\nMaritime security project takes off\n\n\u2019Lagos mention not reference to Tinubu\u2019\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari reiterated on Thursday his determination to \u201cfirmly and decisively\u201d secure the country.\n\nHe said his shooting-on-sight order for illegal bearers of AK 47 rifles and other assault weapons remained in force.\n\nHe condemned attacks on police stations and other government assets and wanton killing of security operatives.\n\nThe President spoke on insecurity and other critical national issues at two different fora \u2013 an interview with panellists on Arise News TV aired yesterday morning and at the inauguration of equipment procured for the police by the Lagos State government.\n\n\u201cLet me also use this opportunity to reiterate that my directive to security agencies, to shoot any person or persons found illegally wielding AK-47s and other assault weapons, remains in place.\n\n\u201cAs Commander-in-Chief, my primary responsibility remains the security of the country and the safety of all citizens.\n\n\u201cDespite the many challenges we are facing, I want Nigerians to rest assured that we will secure this country. We will secure our infrastructure, our highways, our communities, and our forests, and we will secure the lives of our people.\n\n\u201cTo effectively accomplish this goal, however, we require the support of all stakeholders, including the other tiers of government, and non-government actors like traditional, community and religious leaders, the private sector, civil society organisations, and citizens themselves.\n\n\u201cSecurity is a collective effort, and credible intelligence, which is a necessary ingredient for preventing and fighting crime, cannot be obtained without the full cooperation of citizens and communities,\u201d the President said.\n\nBuhari said the new equipment would boost the morale of officers and men.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis is even more touching in the light of the unwarranted violence that ensued in the wake of the ENDSARS protests last October, which saw the security architecture in Lagos state being severely damaged.\n\n\u201cIt is commendable that Lagos State, the Centre of Excellence, has shown a truly resilient spirit, in the face of the massive destruction it suffered last October. You did not allow yourselves to be deterred by the severe setback.\n\n\u201cInstead, you have bounced back and are now boldly rebuilding the confidence of residents and investors in the State.\n\n\u201cI acknowledge the initiative taken to kick-start the rebuilding process, through the establishment of the Lagos State Rebuild Trust Fund, and through this very laudable effort by the Lagos State Security Trust Fund. I enjoin other State Governments to emulate your bold, proactive and resourceful initiative.\n\nIn the interview of Arise TV News, the President warned the youths to embrace peace if they want jobs to be created so that they can work.\n\nHe said in response to a question on the low inflow of Foreign Direct Investment.\n\n\u201cNobody is going to invest in an insecure environment. Tell the youths that if they want jobs they should behave themselves. Nobody will invest in an unstable environment. So you behave yourselves, make Nigeria secure so that foreigners will invest.\u201d\n\nThe President also inaugurated the Lagos-Ibadan rail project for commercial use and $519 million Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety (NIMASA) Deep Blue Security Project.\n\nLagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu delivered crime-fighting equipment, including 150 units of double cabin vehicles, 30 patrol saloon cars, four high-capacity troop carriers and two anti-riot water cannon vehicles to the police at the ceremony held at the Police College in Ikeja.\n\nWar against bandits in Northeast \u2018very difficult\u2019\n\nHe said he had asked the police and the military to treat bandits in the Northwest \u201cin the language they understand.\u201d\n\nBuhari said the security crisis in the region was partly fueled by unemployment and poverty.\n\nHe said he believed the majority of the Boko Haram members are Nigerians after being told so by Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum.\n\nAccording to him, his government had done a lot to fight the terrorists but the problem in the \u201cNortheast is very difficult.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cProblem in the Northwest \u2013 you have people over there stealing each other\u2019s cattle and burning each other\u2019s villages. We are going to treat them in the language they understand.\n\n\u201cWe have given the police and the military the power to be ruthless. You watch it in a few weeks, there will be a difference.\n\n\u201cBecause we told them if we keep people away from their farm, we are going to starve. And the government can\u2019t control the public.\n\n\u201cIf you allow hunger, the government is going to be in trouble and we don\u2019t want to be in trouble. We are already in enough trouble. So we warn them sooner than later you\u2019ll see the difference.\u201d\n\n\u2018IPOB a dot in a circle\u2019\n\nThe President added that with the assurance of \u201cthe elderly people\u201d and \u201cthe youth\u201d of the Southsouth that the region had no intention of seceding, IPOB has no escape route.\n\nBuhari reiterated his statement that IPOB members will be treated in the \u201clanguage that they understand\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was encouraged by what I heard, nobody told me. Two statements from the Southsouth: one by the elderly people, they said this time around there would be no (secession). And again the youth made the same statement; such encouragement.\n\n\u201cSo that IPOB is just like a dot in a circle. Even if they want to exit, they\u2019ll have no access to anywhere. And the way they are spread all over the country, having businesses and properties. I don\u2019t think IPOB knows what they are talking about.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn any case, we say we\u2019ll talk to them in the language that they understand. We\u2019ll organise the police and the military to pursue them.\u201d\n\nGazettes on open grazing, cattle routes to be dusted\n\nThe President said farmer-herder clashes had persisted because old cattle routes and grazing areas had been affected by development.\n\nHis words: \u201cI have asked to dig up gazettes of the First Republic. There are cattle routes and grazing areas. The routes and the areas are known. You have to stay there and if you allow your cattle to stray into another person\u2019s farm you will be arrested.\u2019\n\n\u201cTheir route is known; grazing area is known. So, I asked for the gazette to make sure that those who encroached on the cattle route and grazing areas will be dispossessed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a cattle thing between the Tivs and Fulanis. The Governor of Benue, Samuel Ortom, said I\u2019m not disciplining the cattle rearers because I\u2019m one of them.\n\n\u201cI cannot say I\u2019m not one of them but Ortom was unfair to me and I told him that the Nigerian cattle rearer was not carrying anything more than a stick or machete to cut some trees.\n\n\u201cBut those sophisticated ones are going with AK 47. Fulani from some parts of Africa looks the same. They think they are the Nigerian ones. So, I assure you we are trying to resuscitate these cattle routes and grazing areas and make them accountable.\u201d\n\nMy appointment not lopsided\n\nBuhari said he appointed Maj-Gen. Farouk Yahaya as the chief of Army Staff because of his on-field experience.\n\nThe President said: \u201cDo you know where he was serving before he became the chief of army staff? Maiduguri. You can\u2019t just pick somebody just because he is wearing the seniority rank.\n\n\u201cYou put somebody who has been in the mill, who has suffered with the soldiers. They know him, and he fought with them and so on. \u201c\n\n\u2018My appointments are based on merit\u2019\n\nOn alleged lopsided appointments, the President said his decisions had always been based on seniority.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou\u2019re saying someone who had gone through military and police training all his life should not be appointed to lead the military or police department he works with just because we must balance appointments? What are you saying?\n\n\u201cThe system didn\u2019t restrict anyone from joining the military or the police, and if you decided not to join, we will not force you but you too will not force us to bring someone who is not qualified in training and experience when it comes to leadership of these institutions just because we want to balance some appointments.\u201d",

We will secure the lives of our people,\u2019\u2019 it further quoted him as saying.\n\nThe president told members of the Nigeria Police Force that government would strive to improve their welfare and capacity, but added that the citizens equally had expectations from them.\n\n\u2018\u2018First, let me commend the Inspector-General of Police and the entire Force for the recent efforts to restore peace to troubled parts of the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have charged the Inspector-General to leave no stone unturned in rebuilding the morale of his officers and men, especially in the aftermath of the mindless violence associated with the EndSARS protests as well as the recent spate of attacks on Police Stations in some parts of the country.\u201d\n\nWhile commending the governor for providing the security equipment and assets, the president noted that it would go a long way in boosting the morale of the Police and further enhance the capacity to fight crime and combat criminality.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is even more touching in the light of the unwarranted violence that ensued in the wake of the ENDSARS protests last October during which the security architecture in Lagos State was severely damaged,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president added that it was commendable that Lagos State, the Centre of Excellence, had shown a truly resilient spirit in the face of the massive destruction it suffered last October.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2018You did not allow yourselves to be deterred by the severe setback; instead, you have bounced back and already boldly rebuilding the confidence of residents and investors in the State.\n\n\u2018\u2018I acknowledge the initiative taken to kick-start the rebuilding process, through the establishment of the Lagos State Rebuild Trust Fund, and through this very laudable effort by the Lagos State Security Trust Fund.\n\n\u201cI enjoin other State Governments to emulate your bold, proactive and resourceful initiative.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe president also reiterated that government was taking its constitutional oath to secure the lives and properties of the Nigerian people very seriously.\n\nHe said his administration is conscious of the fact that lasting security is a necessary foundation for business, investment and true prosperity.\n\nBuhari declared that no federal government, since 1999, had been as committed as his administration toward reforming and repositioning the Nigeria Police Force and national policing architecture.\n\n\u2018\u2018In 2019, I signed into law the Act establishing the Nigeria Police Trust Fund, the first in the history of the Force, to provide guaranteed funding to support Police welfare, logistics and equipment.\n\n\u2018\u2018In 2020, I assented to the Bill amending the Nigeria Police Act, which was originally enacted in 1943.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new Act, a vast improvement over the old one, among other things, spells out the modalities for the implementation of a National Community Policing Scheme in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new scheme will build confidence within our local communities and make them active stakeholders in the safety and security of their environs.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are currently recruiting 10,000 Police officers to reinforce our personnel capacity across the country.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has said his administration would reinstate cattle routes and grazing areas across the country to ensure that herders have free access for their animals.\n\nHe also directed the military and police to deal ruthlessly with insurgents and other criminals across the country.\n\nBuhari, who expressed confidence that the order would yield positive results within weeks, recalled that he had in the past visited Chad, Niger and Cameroon as part of efforts to promote good neighbourliness and security at the nation\u2019s borders.\n\nWarning that the country might experience food shortage, Buhari said there was the need to decisively tackle insurgents who are keeping farmers away from their farms.\n\nThe president also defended the administration\u2019s appointments, insisting that there were made based on merit.\n\nThe president, who expressed the hope that Nigerians would be fair to him while assessing his administration, also urged them to question previous regimes on what they did with the nation\u2019s humongous earnings.\n\nHe spoke, yesterday, during an interview with Arise TV.\n\nIn apparent response to the ban on open cattle grazing by the 17 Southern governors, he said when the governors gave the directive that open grazing would be banned, he referred them to the gazette that makes provisions for cattle routes and open grazing areas.\n\n\u201cWhat I told the governors was to ask them to go and dig up the gazette. There are certain routes and grazing areas so that when cattle rearers were moving from the north to the west, they were allowed to go through there. But if you allow your cattle to stray into any farmer\u2019s farm, you are arrested and the farmer is invited to submit his claims. Those who encroach on these cattle routes and grazing areas would be dispossessed. The problem is trying to understand the culture of the cattle rearers. The Governor of Benue said I am not disciplining the cattle rearers because I am one of them and I told him that the Nigerian cattle rearer doesn\u2019t carry anything more than a stick or a machete. But I can tell you that we are trying to resuscitate these cattle routes and grazing areas.\u201d\n\n\u2022Anti-graft war\n\nBuhari said fighting corruption in a democratic setting is a difficult task to accomplish.\n\nHe, however, stressed that his administration had succeeded in easing out corrupt public officials without making noise about it.\n\nBuhari recalled that much was achieved in the fight against corruption when he was military Head of State in the early 80s \u201cwhen a lot of people were sent to prisons before I was also booted out.\u201d\n\nThe president frowned at the way and manner local government system was being managed, saying the local government administration was almost non-existent in the country.\n\nHe cited situation where state governors continued to starve the local governments of funds saying \u201cin a situation where N300 million is allocated to local government and they are given N100 million is not fair\u201d.\n\n\u2022IPOB like a dot in a circle \u2014 we\u2019ll defeat them\n\nHe described the Indigenous People Of Biafra (IPOB) as a dot in a circle, saying the group is isolated in its call for secession.\n\nBuhari said he has been assured by the elderly people and the youths from the South-South that they have no intention of seceding.\n\nHe said IPOB will not have access to anywhere even if they eventually secede from the country.\n\nThe president then reiterated his statement that IPOB members will treated in the language that they understand.\n\n\u201cI was encouraged by what I heard, nobody told me. Two statements from the south south: one by the elderly people, they said this time around there would be no (secession). And again the youth made the same statement; such encouragement.\n\n\u201cSo that IPOB is just like a dot in a circle. Even if they want to exit, they\u2019ll have no access to anywhere. And the way they are spread all over the country, having businesses and properties. I don\u2019t think IPOB knows what they are talking about.\n\n\u201cIn any case, we say we\u2019ll talk to them in the language that they understand. We\u2019ll organise the police and the military to pursue them.\u201d\n\nIPOB has been agitating for the secession of the South-East.\n\n\u2022Bandits in N/East\n\nOn activities of Bandits and kidnappers particularly in the North West and North Central zones, President Buhari said he had given the police and armed forces instructions to be ruthless with bandits and vandals terrorising innocent citizens across the country.\n\nHe said he had told the security agencies to treat bandits and other criminals in the \u201cthe language they understand\u201d.\n\n\u201cProblem in the north-west; you have people over there stealing each other\u2019s cattle and burning each other\u2019s villages.\n\n\u201cLike I said, we are going to treat them in the language they understand.\n\n\u201cWe have given the police and the military the power to be ruthless. You watch it in a few weeks\u2019 time there will be difference.\n\n\u201cBecause we told them if we keep people away from their farm, we are going to starve. And the government can\u2019t control the public.\n\n\u201cIf you allow hunger, the government is going to be in trouble and we don\u2019t want to be in trouble.\n\n\u201cWe are already in enough trouble. So we warn them sooner than later you\u2019ll see the difference,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuhari dismissed the assertion that majority of Boko Haram members were foreigners.\n\n\u2022State police\n\nOn call for the creation of state police, Buhari revealed that two governors from the South-West governors visited him with complaints about encroachment by herdsmen on farmlands in their states but he urged them not to be idle but that they should work hard to protect their states because that is why they were elected.\n\n\u201cTwo governors from the South West came to be complaining about herdsmen encroaching on their farms and I told them that they campaigned to be elected, so they should go back and secure themselves. They cannot go round and win elections and think that someone will do their jobs for them, so I sent them back.\u201d\n\nOn the calls by Southern governors for devolution of powers, the president said if the three tiers of government were working as they should, there would not have been such social problems. He said the local governments which are under the control of state governors are dead, which he says is bad for the country.\n\n\u201cThe local governments are virtually dead and it is not good for this country because if your local government is supposed to receive N300 million, they will sign that they have received N300 million but they will be given only N100 million. So our local governments are dead.\u201d\n\n\u2022Anti graft war\n\nWhen asked about the success of the fight against corruption which was one of his campaign promises, the President said that fighting corruption in a democracy is more difficult than fighting corruption under military rule. However, he said that despite that, if anyone he receives intelligence about anyone in his administration, the person will be held accountable and eased out.\n\n\u201cCorruption fight is very difficult under this system and even under the military system and luckily I have experienced both sides. When I arrested people, I put them in Kirikiri and said that they were guilty until proven innocent. I set up investigation panels based on geo political zones for political leaders and civil servants. Then people didn\u2019t get positions until they declare their assets but what happened? Eventually, I myself was arrested and detained. I will not change but the system is making it difficult as a court case can take 10 years to resolve. But I assure that despite the problem we are having with the system, whenever we have intelligence about anyone, we would hold him accountable and ease him out. We don\u2019t give it to much publicity. We don\u2019t tolerate corruption,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Zoning\n\nOn zoning the presidency, Buhari said nobody has the power to decide for the All Progressives Congress (APC). He said only members of APC has the power to decide the party\u2019s fate while reiterating that the acting leadership of the party is working to reposition the party.\n\n\u201cThe hope of this administration is to see APC last beyond it. Therefore we should allow the party to decide. You cannot sit here in Lagos, for instance and decide on the fate of APC on zoning. The restructuring of the party has begun from the bottom to the top with the membership card registration. Every member of the party must be involved. We will soon conduct our convention. No single member of the party will be allowed to go against the wish of the party. The political party has to know how many mewmbers it has state by state. This the right step to go about. This administration under APC has achieved a lot. Go look at what was on ground before we came in and now. My succession plan depends on the party. The party will sit and make decision by the constituency they want and so on. So, those who want to be president should better join APC,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Merit\n\nThe president also reacted to criticisms of nepotism and appointing more northerners in strategic positions. He faced backlash after the recent appointment of the Chief of Army Staff, Yahaya Faruk, who was picked over many of his seniors who had spent more years in service and were forced into early retirement as a result.\n\nHe denied the allegations, saying that his appointments are based on merit, not ethnic balancing or federal character and that he cannot jettison seniority and merit for balance and federal character. \u201cPeople who have been there for 18 years or even for 10 years, they trained in Zaria or in Abeokuta, they come through the ranks. And because they served under all the circumstances, the crises and everything and they gradually rise to that status and you think you just pick somebody just to balance up? These positions have to be earned,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022DFI\n\nWhen asked about his administration\u2019s plans to make Nigeria more attractive for foreign investments, the President said that youths would have to behave well if they want better jobs. He also alleged that the EndSARS protests were attempts by Nigerian youths to remove him from office and attributed the loss of foreign investment to the protests.\n\n\u201cThis question was answered when there were the EndSARS protests. You remember the young people who wanted to match here and remove me. I have ordered the members of the executive council to go to each state to speak to the governors, the traditional leaders, the business people to tell the youths that if they want jobs, they would have to behave themselves and make sure Nigeria is secured. This is so that people can come in to invest because people know Nigeria is secured. We are a rich country, and God had endowed us,\u201d he said.",

T. Y. Danjuma, and Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, Senators Ike Ekweremadu and Enyinna Abaribe had urged the president to embrace the norms of democracy.\n\nOhanaeze recalled that Obiozor had at a world press conference in Enugu on June 4, reiterated the Igbo position that Ndigbo will not support break-up of Nigeria but Ndigbo will not be victims of Nigerian unity.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari has a choice between dialogue on one hand and an avoidable war against the Igbo on the other. Again, history shows that our thoughts are very infinitesimal to the immutable law of the universe.\u201d\n\nLeading Igbo groups, the Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) and Association of South East town Unions (ASETU) claimed Buhari had not repented in his avowed threat of annihilating the Igbo.\n\nADF advised him to play the role of a nationalist and a patriot instead of looking for excuses to play up his Fulani supremacist agenda.\n\nOn its part, ASETU said the statements from Buhari were troubling and not presidential.\n\nIts National President, Emeka Diwe and National Secretary, Gideon Adikwuru, who addressed newsmen in Enugu, said if the injustices against Ndigbo in Nigeria were erased today, the agitations will end the next day.\n\nIn his reaction, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, expressed anger over Buhari\u2019s description of the South East as dot in a circle.\n\nKanu assured him that same dot in a circle will soon join the rest of the progressive countries as Committee of nations.\n\nReacting in a statement through the group\u2019s media and publicity secretary, Emma Powerful, Kanu: \u201cThe earth is also a dot within the galaxy. But it\u2019s still as great a dot as Biafra shall soon be amongst the comity of nations.\u201d",

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nThe Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) has registered discontent with the level of recognition accorded Islam in the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe bishops observed that Islam was mentioned many times in the Constitution, while no mention was made of Christianity, or any other religion.\n\nThe clerics stated this in their presentation to the Senate Committee on Constitution Review where they demanded for changes in the proposed constitution amendment to either give equal recognition to all religions, or expunge the recognition given to Islam.\n\nPresident of CBCN, Most Rev. Augustine Akubueze, who disclosed the position of the bishops in a statement in Abuja, yesterday, said of the 1999 Constitution: \u201cIn the first place there was no time Nigerians convened as individual stakeholders or as represented citizens to decide on or give to themselves as a binding law or constitution. The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is a product of an imposition of the military.\u201d\n\nAkubueze said by granting recognition to only Islam in a secular state, the 1999 Constitution, had put adherents of other religions in a disadvantaged position.\n\n\u201cThe particular aspect we want to address for this constitution review has to do with the place Islam as a religion has assumed in our Constitution vis-a-vis our national life, to the extent that the 1999 Constitution put Christians and adherents of other religions at a disadvantage in any place with Muslim majority. Complaints abound on the lack of adequate compliance with the provisions of the 1999 Constitution of the against the establishment of any state religion, respect for the freedom of religion, including the right to freely change one\u2019s religion, and equality of all religions before the law. In particular, there have been complaints about the special bias, recognition and prominence accorded to Islam in the Constitution of Nigeria.\n\nThis should be redressed. To ensure peace and unity of the nation, there must be an end to the practically established status that Islam enjoys in our Constitution. Senate should see this constitution review exercise as an opportunity to give sincere listening ear to Nigerians to whom the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) was imposed on.\u201d",

          "title": "The Return to Igangan",
          "text": "DIALOGUE WITH NIGERIA by Akin Osuntokun\n\n\u201cI have been asked to speak to you all on the topic Nigerian Unity and Nation Building. Under normal circumstances that would have been considered an easy task to undertake. However, given that the circumstances in our times can no longer be considered normal in the light of the level of violence, criminality and divisiveness which is now our daily experience, the undertaking becomes a challenge and a dilemma. There was a time that some of our leaders especially in the military era would glibly tell us that Nigerian unity is non-negotiable. Most people in the present situation we find ourselves will consider such an affirmation not only hollow but clearly now as uninformed and ignorant. This situation would not have arisen five, ten or twenty years ago. So what went wrong and why?\u201d- Professor Anya. O. Anya\n\nWhatever becomes of the spiralling inter-ethnic (mutually assured destruction) cycle of violence in Nigeria, Igangan, Ibarapa in Oyo State, will be remembered as a turning point. Symbolically, Igangan has always been associated with critical phases of Yoruba history. Those familiar with this history will recall that at the institution of the Aare Ona Kakanfo in the sixteenth century, the first title holder of the unique institution was Kokoro Igangan. The warlord was said to hail from Iwoye but my gut feeling is that the coincidence of his name with the ancient town of Igangan was not accidental. The appointment was reserved for the best acclaimed warlord of the day and could be appointed from any part of the empire.\n\n\u2018It is a title akin to a field marshal, and is conferred upon the greatest soldier and tactician of the day. After installation, the Kakanfo leaves Oyo, the Alaafin\u2019s city for his own domain; it is forbidden that the Kakanfo and the Alaafin live together in the same town. In addition, the Kakanfo is required to wage war against any peoples and territories at the behest of the Alaafin, and is expected to win, or return a corpse\u2019. Like so many cultural innovations, the institution was a testimony to the sophistication of the Oyo Empire. And, ironically, when the empire was going to unravel, the Kakanfo (in the person of Afonja) proved to be its nemesis.\n\nIn a manner of speaking and given the rapid political retrogression of Nigeria back into its precolonial ethno national elements, the Yoruba appears to be reliving this history especially in the aspect of securing the realm against external aggression. It is what has given rise to warlordism encapsulated in the Sunday Igboho phenomenon. And we now talk more of charms than bullets as an instrument of prosecuting local wars.\n\nIn the contemporary experience of the savage humiliation to which the Yoruba have been subjected right in their regional homestead, there is not much that is exceptional about Igangan. What is exceptional was the long imagined retributory response mounted by a counter Yoruba militia spearheaded by Igboho. Hitherto pummelled and stupefied into inaction and self-pity and endlessly betrayed by a conniving (by omission or commission) Nigerian security forces, the response captured the imagination of the Yoruba community and ignited a spirit of militant nationalism. In the circumstance, the Igboho embodied rebellion was a direct consequence of this connivance (running the gamut of wilful neglect and covert complicity) of a compromised Nigerian security establishment.The Alaafin of Oyo recently lamented the futility of seeking the law and order intervention of the Nigerian police into crimes involving the fulani who appeared to enjoy a licence to impunity and would sooner be spared of any penalty regardless the severity of the crime at issue. It was a fraught situation that brought to the fore the legitimate imperative of recourse to self-help and self-defence.\n\nGeneral Theophilus Yakubu Danjuma had captured the moment a few years ago: \u201cThe armed forces are not neutral. They collude with the armed bandits that kill people, kill Nigerians. They facilitate their movement. They cover them\u2026If you are depending on the armed forces to stop the killings, you will die one by one,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe ethnic cleansing must stop in Taraba State. It must stop in all the states of Nigeria, otherwise Somalia will be a child\u2019s play. I ask everyone of you to be at alert and defend your country, defend your territory, defend your state. You have nowhere else to go,\u201d he further added.\n\nTaking the cue in Igangan, the compound and properties (including several luxury vehicles) of the suspected godfather of the Fulani kidnap-for-ransom-consortium, the Seriki Fulani were torched and burnt down. He was declared persona non grata and banished from the community along with his proteges and sundry field operatives. There was bound to be a reprisal attack and the surprise was that when it came, it caught both the Igboho guerilla army and the regular security forces pants down. More shocking was the disproportionate scale of the violence, in magnitude and sheer savagery, reminiscent of the Fulani militia campaign of terror and pacification in the Middle Belt region. Obadiah Mailafia sounded the early warning system.\n\nAbout a week ago, the Oyo State Amotekun Commander, Kunle Togun, similarly raised the alarm (that the worst is yet to come) that was more remarkable for its potential to obfuscate and misdirect. There was an inherent exculpation of domestic Nigerian component in his obsessive attribution of all that is going awry in the South-west to non-Nigerians. \u201cThe foreign Fulani herdsmen have invaded South-west. There is nowhere in the South-west that they are not. They are there. \u201cThey are the Okada riders. They are the ones using wheelbarrows to sell carrots and other things. I said they are foot soldiers. They said they have come in to take the inheritance given to them by Allah and that is Nigerian land, particularly South-west. So, they will still strike. I am not just screaming aloud. So, everybody has to be ready\u201d. The question then arises, is the Seriki Fulani of Igangan a foreigner? Are his accomplices including the notorious Wakili from Mali and Niger? To the contrary, many of those caught have identified and have been identified as Fulani with deep roots in Nigeria including, for that matter, the Yoruba society (especially Ilorin) dating back generations.\n\nAdding to the confusion is the enactment (of the precedent of Moses and the Israelites) who were given to renouncing their liberation at the encounter of any difficulties in their journey to freedom. And so, with the savage reprisal attack on Igangan has come the criticism and strictures blaming Igboho for initiating the rebellion to begin with. In the affectation of wisdom and sobriety and beyond the specific instance of Igangan, there have been remonstrations from those who identify with the status quo that coming to terms with cohabitation in hell can be a better option than the uncertain promise of heaven. As if anyone has cultivated belligerence and bellicosity as second nature and goes around looking for war as hobby. Short of the philosophy of turning the other cheek it is difficult to see what options are left for the oppressed confronted with the perennial menace of a murderous bully. In all of this, there is the psychological injury to the victims. They are liable to wonder if it is conceivable that a group of Yoruba marauders would have the audacity to besiege Azare or Daura the way the criminal Fulani militia are running rampant over Yorubaland.\n\nIn what is fast degenerating to an unbroken chain of violence and terror, it is near inevitable that in one form or another, a Yoruba response to this reprisal attack on Igangan is on the way especially if, typically, no one is called to account. The continuous radicalisation and escalation of the cycle of violence raises the question of how all this harvest of ill-wind will end. President Buhari has announced his preferred option in a revealing tweet and it is straight out from the civil war conquistador playbook.\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of thedestruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in\n\nthe language they understand,\u201d. First, the fact that the social media tech giant, Twitter, deems it fit to delete this tweet and cite it as \u2018abusive behaviour\u2019 towards the Igbo, tells a familiar story of Buhari. It corroborates his well documented penchant for violent verbiage. You will recall such bloody minded threats as the \u2018dog and the baboon will soak in blood\u2019. \u2018I can die for the cause of Islam if necessary. We are ready to fight another civil war\u2019. For those at the pinnacle of the federal alliance power structure that prevailed in the war, resort to this \u2018might is right\u2019 precedent is always a irresistible temptation. The perennial utility of the threat to \u2018national unity\u2019 has come in handy as a blank cheque on which any pretext for scapegoating a convenient victim and target can be requested. Those who like Buhari are given to hacking back to the civil war and national unity in this proprietorial manner should be asked what are the lessons Nigeria should learn from this defining tragedy. That any evil is justified in the self-serving pursuit of the distorted notion of national unity as an end unto itself? Shouldn\u2019t we be told that prior to the declaration of Biafra secession, another group of Nigerians were openly contemplating Araba and the other verbalised the intention to follow suit if Biafra becomes a reality? I have always held the opinion that (on the template of equity and justice) if the Igbo should be blamed, it can only be for not being in a position to actualise its justified aspiration. At the end of the day what made the difference was not the moral imperative of sustaining a desirable and worthy national unity but that a protagonist was in a position to enforce its will and the other was not. If Nigeria is ever to transcend this balance of terror predicate, it would have to learn that the road to enduring national unity does not go through the barrel of the gun and the imposition of unrestrained regional hegemony.\n\nQUOTE\n\nIf Nigeria is ever to transcend this balance of terror predicate, it would have to learn that the road to enduring national unity does not go through the barrel of the gun and the imposition of unrestrained regional hegemony.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

During Nigeria\u2019s military rule, scorched-earth activism/criticism was the definitive approach to the government and rightly so. Down with the Kaiser! If you betray any emotion for the Kaiser, then you are a traitor who must be hanged \u2018\u2019comrade-style\u2019\u2019.\n\nI used to be that guerrilla critic; always hungry for an attack. And truly so, there were always reasons \u2013 good reasons. But I realised that if you prime yourself for complaints and fault-finding, you will always have reasons. You only see what you want to see. This does not vitiate the very important task of holding the government to account. No!\n\nInsecurity remains a detraction to the achievements of the Buhari administration. While most of us agree that the performance of the government on security has not been impressive, very few may want to acknowledge the fact that President Buhari has made appreciable gains on infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Buhari administration has done well on infrastructure. It is a leap from where we used to be. We can agree that security remains a challenge but still acknowledge the good outcomes when we see them. At a time Nigeria was fortuned by favourable crude oil prices \u2013 in the past administration \u2013 funds for infrastructure were either diverted or frittered away. Contracts were awarded as a meal for political cronies. I am aware that the contract for a famous road in Abuja was awarded without a design \u2013 but funds were paid to the contractor who happens to be a cousin of the former president. That road was abandoned afterwards.\n\nLet me get down to brass tacks. On rail, the 157km Lagos-Ibadan standard-gauge rail was inaugurated today. The benefits of this infrastructure are immense. The project is a relief for those who ply the tortuous Lagos-Ibadan road. The 327km Itakpe-Warri standard-gauge rail was completed and inaugurated 33 years after construction began. Abuja light rail was completed in 2018. Financing negotiations for Ibadan-Kano standard-gauge rail project are also in progress.\n\nSome road projects have been completed and more are in progress. Also, more than N360 billion worth of Sukuk Bonds was raised in 2017 for many crucial road projects across all the six geopolitical zones. New terminals for international airports in Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt were completed. The construction of new runways for Abuja and Enugu international airports was also completed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet it appears insecurity is eclipsing the achievements of the Buhari administration in this area. The basic responsibility of any government is to protect lives and property. We can only ride on the train and use the roads if we are alive. In fact, road trips have become an attempt at self-murder. The roads are gravely unsafe. Security comes first in the hierarchy of needs. It is the nucleus.\n\nThe Buhari administration must do well to address insecurity \u2013 for its own reckoning. Any achievement it records in other sectors will be obviated and dampened by daily episodes of killings and kidnappings.\n\nThe administration will be cheered and applauded by more Nigerians for its achievements when it saves Nigeria from the grim reaper rampaging everywhere in the country.\n\nBy Fredrick \u2018Mr OneNigeria\u2019 Nwabufo\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter @FredrickNwabufo",

          "title": "#TwitterBanNigeria: Is it even legal?",
          "text": "The short answer is no. The long answer...\n\nOn Friday the 4th of June, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, announced that the country\u2019s federal government would be suspending Twitter\u2019s operations within Nigeria. This came after Twitter deleted a tweet by the country\u2019s president where he threatened \u201ccivil war\u201d type violence on citizens of the country.\n\nFollowing this announcement, in the early hours of Saturday, June 5, Nigerian Twitter users found that they could only access the site with the use of a VPN (Virtual Private Network) which allows people to access blocked websites by masking their actual locations.\n\nThe loss of access formally took place after the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) issued a directive to all telcos and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) instructing them to restrict their users\u2019 access to the social media platform.\n\nWhile there are ongoing debates around how the ban affects Nigeria\u2019s digital economy and what it means for freedom of speech in the country, one issue that hasn\u2019t been addressed is the legality of this action by the executive arm of the Nigerian government.\n\nIn a democracy, various arms of government exist to work together and keep each other in check.\n\nWhile one arm makes laws, another enforces; but it is unusual for one arm to enforce a law that the other did not make. This is the situation in Nigeria today as the directive barring the use of Twitter is not currently backed by any law passed by the country\u2019s legislature.\n\nIn response to the Twitter ban, Malechi Okafor, a lawyer and managing partner at M & O Legal Services said, \u201cIt is unprecedented because we never thought we would get to a point where a democratically elected leader would try to take away the voice of the people.\u201d\n\nWhile he is currently a democratic leader, President Buhari, a retired army general and former military head of state, is not a stranger to muzzling the media as his regime in the 1980s was one wrought with media clampdowns.\n\nIn what seems like an encore performance, President Buhari\u2019s 1984 media clampdowns have taken a new form as the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, issued a directive on the 5th of June that citizens found still using Twitter were to be prosecuted.\n\nWith this we suddenly have two things to be addressed: was blocking Twitter legal and should people be prosecuted for carrying on tweeting with their VPNs.\n\nThe Almighty NCC\n\nIn my discussion with Imade Iyamu, a corporate lawyer at Banwo and Ighodalo, she shed some light on what actual powers the Nigerian Communications Commission has when it comes to telcos and ISPS.\n\n\u201cJust like the CBN has a lot of power over banks, the NCC has the power to issue directives,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the fact that a directive is issued does not make it entirely legal. This is why the courts exist, to allow citizens or concerned entities to challenge directives or actions performed by the government or its parastatals.\n\nSo to reverse the decision, we must head to the courts then?\n\nWell, not exactly. In Nigeria, the courts have been inactive for weeks as the court workers, under the umbrella of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN), have been on strike for weeks now. It has however been reported on Wednesday that the strikes have been suspended and the courts will reopen on Monday the 14th of June.\n\nJUSUN has very clear demands. In 2020, President Buhari signed an executive order mandating that state governors adhere to a provision in the country\u2019s 1999 constitution that gives the judiciary financial autonomy and access to a federal fund. The governors have ignored this.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly has a budget that they manage. The judiciary should have one as well to pay themselves and handle their affairs \u2013 to be truly independent,\u201d Okafor tells me during our talk.\n\nA truly independent judiciary would be the recourse of the people at this time but that is not something that is currently available.\n\nWithout the courts, the directive by the NCC stands unchallenged and while this is in itself a problem, the bigger problem lies in the directive issued by the country\u2019s attorney general and minister of justice.\n\nThen there\u2019s Malami\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t declare that people should be prosecuted without a written law,\u201d this sentiment expressed by Iyamu during our call is one I have heard from several lawyers both offline and on Twitter.\n\nThe directive issued by the attorney general is unlawful. That much is clear.\n\nOne of the tenets of a democratic society like ours is the idea that laws are deliberated on and passed by a body of elected officials \u2013 the legislature. These laws can then be enforced by the executive branch and interpreted by the judiciary. The attorney general falls into the class of the former but in this regard, he has no law to enforce. Just one he has made himself.\n\nTwo days ago, the country\u2019s house of representatives invited the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, to ask questions regarding the Twitter ban.\n\nThere has been no official statement from the legislature regarding Malami\u2019s declaration that the use of Twitter will be met with prosecution. While VPNs provide momentary succour from the irrational directive of the NCC, Malami\u2019s push for prosecution might be harmful to citizens who continue to use Twitter as is protected by their right to free speech.\n\nSo, is the current Twitter ban with the threat of prosecution illegal? You bet it is. But until the courts open on Monday and the people get a chance to exercise their rights, I guess we\u2019ll have to wait.",

          "text": "Kenya, this week, became the first and only African market where Bolt has introduced electric bikes, tuk tuks (tricycles) and scooters on its platform. This comes as the on-demand transport company looks to tackle the twin challenge of fuel price fluctuations and environmental pollution in the East African country.\n\nBolt\u2019s addition of electric vehicles to its fleet is in line with an expansion plan for greener transport options in Kenya, particularly in its delivery unit, with the ultimate goal of reducing the company\u2019s environmental footprints.\n\nA study by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that ride-hailing companies were responsible for nearly 70% more carbon pollution than the modes of transport they displace, like mass transit, biking, and walking. To address this, they have been called on to reduce emissions with more concerted efforts such as electrifying their fleet of vehicles.\n\n\u201cThis is a great step towards realising environmentally conscious ways for people to move around in the city, reduce our ecological footprint, decrease air pollution and increase access to clean transportation modes,\u201d Regional Director for Bolt Africa, Hillary Miller-Wise, said at the launch.\n\nFor now, the electric bicycles and tuk tuks will be used by Bolt Food couriers only. The food delivery business launched in Nairobi three months ago amid a resurgence in global coronavirus infections, with Bolt looking to tap into the boom in demand for contact-less services recorded since the Covid-19 pandemic began. It offers users access to a diverse list of restaurants and menus in the capital city.\n\n\u201cWe will be making deliveries using the newly launched tuk tuks and bicycles within Nairobi as we expand into other towns across the country. Our customers will now have more Eco-friendly and sustainable options to choose from,\u201d Bolt Food Country Manager, Edgar Kipngetich Kitur, said.\n\nThe fleet of electric scooters and e-motorbikes essentially helps Bolt fulfill the demand for light, smarter and greener modes of transport that are also less expensive to maintain. It is perhaps the cost factor that was the biggest consideration that propelled the company to introduce the new vehicles.\n\nAccording to Bolt, electric vehicles will also help evade challenges associated with a fuel price crisis that has greatly affected its drivers and couriers. Last month, the ride-hailing company raised fare prices across all cities in Kenya due to the increased cost of fuel in the country.\n\n\u201cWe trust that this is a stride forward to mitigate the impacts of constant fluctuating fuel costs and will stabilise the growth and sustainability of driver earnings and cost of doing business,\u201d Hillary added.\n\nWhile the vehicles will initially be used by Bolt Food couriers, the company plans to include them in the passenger business as well. Bolt will also expand its green transport options in other African markets where it has a presence, it said, without specifying which will come next. On the continent, Bolt Food is only available in Kenya, South Africa, and Ghana.",

          "title": "How seamless customer onboarding is transforming fintech growth",
          "text": "According to McKinsey, Nigeria is now home to over 200 fintech standalone companies. And thanks to increasing smartphone penetration, many of these services use apps. Many of these apps have extensive marketing spending to drive user growth. In recent times, Abeg app and Patricia were announced as sponsors of Big Brother Nigeria.\n\nYet, beyond marketing spend, there\u2019s another simple way that fintech startups are ensuring that people want to use their products, and it is through onboarding. Onboarding is the process of introducing a new user to your app or product.\n\nOnboarding is essential for several reasons; it can lead to customer drop-offs if the process is difficult or complicated, or it can be such a delight that customers end up telling others about your app.\n\nOn Friday, May 21, VerifyMe Nigeria and TechCabal held the \u201cDigital Identity Matters\u201d event to talk about the importance of onboarding and the nuances that surround it. The event had Babs Ogundeyi, the CEO of Kuda Bank, Dayo Ademola, the Managing director of Branch Nigeria, and Esigie Aguele, the co-founder and CEO.\n\nOne of the critical things in onboarding a customer is the Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement.\n\nWhat does the onboarding process look like at Kuda bank?\n\nAccording to Babs Ogundeyi, Kuda has different levels of onboarding because not everyone in Nigeria has the same type of identification, and some people do not have any identification at all. In June 2020, the Director-General of the NIMC, Aliyu Aziz, said only 38% of Nigerians have any form of identification.\n\n\u201cThe way we think about it is that we need to do enough to capture everybody and to give everybody a chance to be onboarded. So we have three tiers of customers, which is in line with the Central Bank guidelines for Microfinance banks.\u201d\n\nFor Kuda, the minimum requirement for KYC is that the bank needs to know what you look like, so while it asks users to take a selfie as part of its onboarding, it uses technology to be sure that the person taking that selfie is the owner of the account.\n\nIt also relies on Bank Verification Number (BVN) to compare the pictures of account holders with what is in the system. These levels of verification are important to prevent forgeries, fraud and attempt to circumvent processes.\n\nIn a nutshell, the more documents you have to corroborate, the better your onboarding process. It also helps to think of them as a never-ending process because bad actors never stop trying and fintech startups need to stay ahead of them.\n\nWhat would make the lives of customers easier?\n\nWhile BVN has been a gamechanger for verifying customer details, there\u2019s still some work to be done. According to Dayo Ademola, one important part of onboarding should be verifying the address of customers.\n\n\u201cTypically, you would ask for a utility bill but at the highest level of KYC, someone has to physically verify the address of the customer. What we are trying to do is, if we say that we are a bank in your pocket, then we have to find workarounds to make this happen.\u201d\n\nOne workaround is comparing the address on a customer\u2019s BVN with the address they have listed with a commercial bank. This is because commercial banks often physically verify the addresses of their customers.\n\nIt already sounds cumbersome in an industry where customers are asking for speed. \u201cBeing able to onboard pretty quickly is important; how quickly can customers download your app, verify their information and become an actual user instead of gaps where the app needs to verify.\n\n\u201cThe top thing that new users are really looking for is speed. Another pattern we see is that customers start to drop off when you start asking for a lot of information, you see a lot of drop-offs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, if you ask costumes to wait 24-48 hours before you verify them, that poses a problem.\u201d\n\nIn the end, bank customers will still face lengthy wait times while a bank is running verifications checks in the background. Nigeria still functions as a low-trust environment; and despite accelerated changes to our financial ecosystem, banks and their customers agree that the KYC process is crucial to prevent fraud and cybercriminal activities.\n\nFind the full video of this conversation on YouTube.

We\u2019ve got nice thin bezels around the edges; we\u2019ve got the hole punch selfie at the top. As I said, 6.95 inches \u2013 if you are watching movies or playing games, this is going to give you a really immersive experience.\u201d\n\nAnother UK tech reviewer, Tech Spurt said, \u201cThe batteries are integrated with ultra power saving mode so you can get an extra 58 hours of call time even when the battery is at 5% capacity\u201d. Another tech reviewer, the Tech Chap also said, \u201cWe do also have that fast 33W charger, which actually charges up 50 minutes faster than the previous generation of this phone \u2013 a nice upgrade there.\u201d\n\nIn the words of a British tech reviewer, SuperSarf, \u201cA 90hz refresh rate at this price, that\u2019s just insane.

The panels are based on IPS LCD technology, which typically does quite well in color gamut and maximum brightness (480 NITs).\u201d \u2013 Hubert Nguyen, Ubergizmo\n\n\u201cWith the new 33W X-Charge a 0-100% charge takes 50 minutes less than it did on the previous Note model. A quick 5-minute top-up is enough for 2 hours of gaming.\u201d \u2013 Peter Bonov, GSMArena\n\nMeanwhile, the Note 10 online launch was brimming with thrill and excitement around the main features of the Note 10 \u2013 speed, beauty, power, strength \u2013 as the functionalities of the new smartphone were tested live.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "An insight into how Texas-based VC, Sputnik ATX, invests in African startups",
          "text": "In May 2021, CribMD, a Nigerian healthtech startup, closed a $2.6 million seed round led by US-based venture capital firm, Sputnik ATX.\n\nFounded by Dr Oksana Malysheva \u2014 a physicist with stints at McKinsey and Motorola \u2014 and Joe Merrill \u2014 a former US diplomat to Nigeria, South Korea, and Bosnia \u2014 Sputnik ATX runs an accelerator programme where founders receive $100,000, with the potential for more in follow-on funding.\n\nSince its inception, the firm has invested in over 30 startups across various industries.\n\nTechpoint Africa spoke to Joe Merrill, a partner at the firm, and he gave some insights into how they invest in startups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFun fact: Sputnik is a Russian word meaning partner. It is also the name of the first artificial satellite launched into space.\n\nTell us how Sputnik ATX came about\n\nMy business partner, Oksana Malysheva, and I founded ATX in 2017 after we had managed a fund together.\n\nWe were looking for ways to improve our returns and be more impactful. In our research, we discovered a massive gap with early-stage financing that would give entrepreneurs the tools needed to grow their businesses and then follow-on funding to scale and grow quickly.\n\nWe founded Sputnik ATX so that we could do that. We joke that we teach nerds how to sell, so if they have a minimum viable product (MVP) and a customer and are looking to try and figure out how to grow their startup, we teach them how to grow and build a big company.\n\nWhat does VC investment mean to Sputnik ATX?\n\nDr. Oksana Malysheva, Managing Partner, Sputnik ATX\n\nWe are early-stage investors, and to us, VC investment is the ability to help very brilliant, gritty, hardworking, humble people get access to capital at an early stage to accelerate their company\u2019s growth.\n\nWe also help them by giving them business skills, particularly in sales and marketing, so that they can refine their product and grow their business in a sustainable way that would help them to produce an amazing company.\n\nEvery VC has an eye or eyes in specific markets. Tell us what market(s) Sputnik ATX is interested in and why?\n\nWe\u2019re not necessarily interested in specific markets but in people who have a big impact. So, for example, we talk about this thing called consumer surplus \u2014 an economic term that refers to the difference between what you\u2019re willing to pay for something and what you pay for it.\n\nAnd when we see people who are generating lots of consumer surplus, it means they\u2019re generating lots of value in the market. And we want to help them to do just that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe name Sputnik comes from the first thing mankind launched into space \u2014 the Sputnik 1 satellite \u2014 and like Sputnik, we\u2019re looking for people who are doing big things.\n\nDoes that mean you invest more in founders than in startups?\n\nIt has to be both. There\u2019s this statement about whether you invest in the jockey or the horse, and we think that you invest in both because good jockeys and good horses work together.\n\nWe think that the best ideas are where you have a fantastic person with incredible technology that the world desperately needs.\n\nBy Sputnik ATX\u2019s standards, what shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nJoe Merrill, Partner, Sputnik ATX\n\nI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a wrong answer to that question. If you\u2019re a startup founder, you should be asking yourself if what you\u2019re doing is making the world a better place, and if it\u2019s making the world a better place, then the question is how much better.\n\nSome startups that make the world a better place may not generate many financial returns, and that\u2019s okay. There\u2019s nothing bad about that.\n\nBut as venture investors, we have a responsibility to get a return for our investors. So while those are worthy businesses, the economics don\u2019t work for venture capital.\n\nWe have to invest in companies that are making an impact where additional money and resources can go a long way in building the business and generating a return for the investors, the founders, and ultimately something really great for the customers using the service or product.\n\nWhat is your average ticket size?\n\nWe start small by giving them a $100,000 cheque, and we have an option to increase that to $500,000, but we would continue to invest in companies as they grow. We have invested millions in some of the companies in our portfolio.\n\nWe\u2019re just getting started. Right now, we\u2019re raising a $100 million follow-on fund, and we have raised over half of the money. We plan to continue to write cheques worth $5 million to $10 million for companies as they continue to grow.\n\nIs there any other African startup in your portfolio other than CribMD?\n\nCribMD is probably the second. The first was Vybe Software, and even though Vybe was based in the United States, like CribMD, most of their customers were in Africa. Vybe has an app called Leia that enables people to launch a website.\n\nIt is free, but for 99 cents a month, you can upgrade and get a much nicer package. It uses artificial intelligence to build completely unique, beautiful websites for anyone.\n\nThat company did really well in Nigeria. Lots of merchants were able to create little marketplaces where they could advertise their businesses online.\n\nHow does Sputnik ATX deal with bad investments?\n\nI hate saying bad investments because bad is kind of like this judgement where something is morally repugnant, and that\u2019s not the case. What happens is someone starts a company, and the company is generating insufficient financial returns to justify the investments, but that doesn\u2019t make them bad.\n\nIt just means that it didn\u2019t work out, and there are a couple of choices. Sometimes those companies can continue to operate because they\u2019re profitable; they\u2019re not just going to get very big.\n\nHowever, if they\u2019re losing money, and if they continue to lose money, you usually sit down with the founders, and you decide if it\u2019s a good time to shut the company down. If there\u2019s some value in the asset that another company would find valuable, you sell the asset to other companies because while you may not be able to do a lot with it, someone else might.\n\nI\u2019ll be frank, it\u2019s okay if a startup doesn\u2019t work; we expect that to happen. It\u2019s how you do it that matters. If you realise your company is not viable, you shut it down in an orderly way. What you do says a lot about the quality and the integrity of the founder.\n\nWhen founders shut things down properly, we love to invest in them because they acted with integrity.\n\nWhat industries are of most interest to Sputnik ATX?\n\nWe invest in anything that is not evil. We have a strict policy of not investing in evil. We have everything, including a company that makes nutritious doughnuts.\n\nEverybody likes doughnuts, but they\u2019re not good for your health. This was a bunch of American football players with such strict diets who worked tirelessly to figure out how to make nutritious yet delicious doughnuts.\n\nWe also have a company producing an engine that will replace the one in cars, and it\u2019s beautiful. This thing would single-handedly stop greenhouse gas emission, and Shell just announced that they are investing in that company.\n\nIt works, and in 20 years, we could all be using this product. So when we see companies with amazing technologies like these, we want to invest in them.\n\nWhat opportunities have Sputnik ATX regrettably passed on, and why?\n\nMy biggest regret is a company called FloatMe. It\u2019s in San Antonio, and we almost accepted them. We limit the number of companies that we can accept to between five and seven for each group. They were the company that just missed the cut.\n\nWe liked the founders, and we should have done it. The company has been very successful. I still love the founders. They\u2019re incredible, and I think the world of the company.\n\nIt\u2019s such an incredible service. It puts a little money into people\u2019s accounts when they are about to overdraft them. I wish we had invested, but it turns out they didn\u2019t need our money, and they\u2019ve done very well.\n\nThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m just happy to see smart people do awesome things that help other people even if we don\u2019t get to invest.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nThey can go to sputnikatx.com. They can also find me on Twitter @Austin_VC. I get and accept DMs from people.\n\nMy business partner is @Oksana_ATX. You can read all about her on our website. I also have a blog where I write about business, economics, and startups because I\u2019m an economist and an entrepreneur.\n\nI talk about Nigeria ever so often on my blog. I love Nigeria.",

Terms and conditions apply.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nPossible Twitter negotiations with the Nigerian government\n\nAndroid 12 beta 2 launch and Apple iOS 15\u2019s features\n\nTwitter reaches out to the Nigerian government for negotiations\n\nNigeria\u2019s online space has been abuzz since the government announced the suspension of microblogging and social media platform, Twitter on Friday, June 4, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, according to Channels Television, Minister for Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, says Twitter has reached out to the government to negotiate. He made the statement on Wednesday, June 9, 2021, while addressing the State House correspondents after the Federal Executive Council meeting.\n\nThe Minister added that the suspension has been effective, saying Twitter has made significant losses since the ban.\n\nNothing from Twitter: However, the social media platform has kept mum about negotiating with the Nigerian government.\n\nBut the company, via its Public Policy account on June 5, 2021, said that the platform would \u201cwork to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect with the world.\u201d\n\nAsk Malami? When Mohammed was questioned about the section of the law that prosecutes Nigerians who continue to use Twitter, he referred journalists to the country\u2019s Attorney General, Abubakar Malami\u2019s comment.\n\nTwitter should pay tax too: The Minister discussed the Federal Government\u2019s move to ensure social media and over-the-top (OTT) platforms \u2014 WhatsApp, Facebook, Netflix, et al. \u2014 are registered in the country and pay tax for the billions they earn.\n\n\u201cQuiz 1: How many topics did we discuss in the first edition? Mention two.\u201d\n\nOn a non-Twitter related note, Apple has announced the new features coming to its new iOS 15.\n\nThe announcement was made during Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). The event, dedicated to software, is held annually to showcase new features coming to operating systems across Apple\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nThis year\u2019s edition kicked off Monday, June 7, and will end Friday, June 11, 2021.\n\nFaceTime, a feature known to be exclusive to iOS devices, will now work outside the ecosystem; it will include options to share screens like video conferencing platform, Zoom. The new operating system will continue Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency feature that started with the previous upgrade.\n\nAnother interesting feature coming to the new iOS is Live Text. The iPhone camera will now be able to recognise text within an image. So, texts \u2014 phone numbers, words, symbols \u2014 in an image can be copied and saved.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before: While this feature is new to iOS, it bears a close resemblance to Google Lens on Android devices, which can translate and save text from an image using the camera. However, whatever upgrades Apple has introduced to this feature will be ascertained when the operating system launches officially.\n\nThere\u2019s more on Apple\u2019s WWDC here.\n\n\u201cQuiz 2: If you noticed, Emmanuel and Oluwanifemi did something different with previous Thursday editions. What was the first topic in this trend?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Android, Google has released the second beta version of its latest operating system, Android 12. Launched Wednesday, June 9, 2021, the second version will come with more of the features promised at the Google I/O event in May.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Google will bring more beta testers on board with the Android 12 beta 2 release. They will be testing out features like the new privacy dashboard, Quick Setting toggle, and Internet Panels that make switching between Internet providers easy.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nHow to install the developer beta of iOS 15.

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing\n\nNigeria\u2019s information minister\u2019s invitation for questioning over Twitter ban\n\nNigerian Uber and Bolt drivers\u2019 partnership with local ride-hailing companies\n\nBolt\u2019s electric tuk-tuks and e-bikes in Kenya\n\nNigeria\u2019s information minister invited for questioning over Twitter ban\n\nIn yet another twist to Nigeria\u2019s Twitter saga in Nigeria, the House of Representatives has invited the Minister for Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, to brief the house over the ban on the social network.\n\nThis is coming after widespread criticism by citizens over lawmakers\u2019 silence since the ban was announced. We even had some lawyers discuss the legality of the ban.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the resumption of plenary duties, the House set up a Committee on Communication, Justice, Information and Culture, and National Security and Intelligence.\n\nWhat has been said? The speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, ordered the Committee to investigate the legality of the Federal Government\u2019s ban and report to the house within 10 days.\n\nHe noted that the legislative body recognised the value of social media as a tool for communication and commerce in the country but insisted that it must be balanced with the need to protect national interests.\n\nExternal pressure? Various bodies, including High Commissions and Embassies of foreign nations spoke out against the Twitter ban. However, this is the first response by the country\u2019s lawmakers.\n\nUber and Bolt drivers set to partner with local companies\n\nFighting back? The National President, Professional E-Hailing Drivers and Private Owners Association (PEDPA), Mr Idris Shonuga, has announced plans by members of the body to ditch Uber and Bolt in favor of local companies, Active Rides and My Cab App.\n\nThe drivers hope that this new arrangement would improve their welfare and customer service while giving the Association a greater say in decisions affecting its members.\n\nRecall that in April 2021, riders on Uber and Bolt drivers embarked on a week long warning strike. They called on the ride-hailing companies to review prices in line with increased living expenses in the country.\n\nUber responded with a 13% price hike for its UberX offering. However, it appears that the drivers remain dissatisfied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe not enough: While it seems drivers are getting improved conditions with this new arrangement, it is not yet clear how the Association\u2019s plan to partner with the local ride-hailing companies would play out. Its success would most likely hinge on users\u2019 adoption of the two partners which are relatively unknown.\n\nGo deeper with this article: Uber, Bolt drivers move to dump ride hailing companies, partner with indigenous firms\n\nBolt unveils electric tuk-tuks in Kenya\n\nBolt Foods electric motorcycles. Source: Techish\n\nBolt has unveiled electric tuk-tuks \u2014 tricycles \u2014 and e-bicycles in Kenya. The move is geared towards eliminating the challenges associated with fluctuating fuel prices.\n\nWith this, Kenya becomes the first African country where Bolt has launched its electric bike service as it continues a trend of eco-friendly initiatives in the country.\n\nIn March 2021, the mobility startup introduced Bolt Green using electric and hybrid cars to reduce emissions during trips.\n\nFor now, only Bolt Food couriers would use these bicycles and tuk-tuks as they look to expand into other towns.\n\nThese initiatives are part of Green Plan \u2014 Bolt\u2019s global environmental strategy \u2014 which aims to reduce the company\u2019s environmental footprint by providing commuters with eco-friendly options.\n\nOur reporter, Joy Matthew, delved deeper into this story here.\n\nSME Clinic by Techpoint\n\nOne of the lessons we learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic was how technology could make a difference for small and medium enterprises.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari says his administration would be decisive in dealing with terrorist hoodlums causing unrest in the country, in an interview on Thursday with Arise TV, his first since he was re-elected in 2019.\n\nPresident Buhari spoke on a wide range of issues bordering on infrastructural development, appointments, insecurity, farmers/herders clashes, etc.\n\nHere are five takeaways from the interview\n\nInsecurity\n\nThe President said his administration had decided to tackle the worsening security situation in Nigeria headlong, adding that after changing the head of security agencies he had given them a directive, especially to the police, to be ruthless with anyone or group causing unrest in any part of the country.\n\nThe President said the security situation, especially in the North, had become a serious concern as the people of the region were suffering a lot of casualties, stressing that though there had been significant progress in the Zamfara State, where foreigners carrying out illegal mining activities had been expelled.\n\nHe dismissed the secessionist agitations of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and other groups, saying that security forces had been instructed to use force against them.\n\nBuilding infrastructure to Niger Republic\n\nPresident Buhari justified the continued building of roads, railways and other infrastructure projects to connect the country to Niger Republic, noting that Niger Republic and other neighbouring countries were crucial to the country\u2019s fight against terrorism and insurgency.\n\nThe President said there was the need for an access road between Nigeria and Niger, especially now that country had discovered crude oil, stressing that the move had also become necessary so that the country could serve as a transit route for the products rather than Niger using other neighbouring countries\u2019 routes.\n\nBan on open grazing/efforts to end farmers/herders clashes\n\nAccording to the President, record shows that Nigeria had grazing routes for herders in the First Republic, which were equipped with infrastructure, while herders with animals that grazed on people\u2019s farms were fined or their animals confiscated.\n\nHe said the solution to the constant farmers and herders clashes in the country was the resuscitating of the cattle grazing routes across Nigeria, which would further make herders better managed, accountable and taxable.\n\nHe lamented that the country had been invaded by foreign herdsmen from the West African region, adding that his administration was on top of the situation.\n\nOn complaints of lopsided appointments\n\nThe President defended his appointments, saying that all the appointments he made were strictly based on merit and not based on ethnic or regional balance.\n\nHe cited the case of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NPPC), noting that most top position holders rose through the ranks, had put in years of service to earn their positions.\n\nHe said there were several Igbos in Nigeria\u2019s civil service, adding that the Igbos must compete with qualified Nigerians from other regions for positions, as it was impossible to bypass qualified individuals to favour them.\n\nOn Nigeria losing foreign investments\n\nBuhari said the spate of insecurity had adversely affected the flow of foreign direct investments to Nigeria in recent time, saying it had become increasingly difficult to attract investors to Nigeria with the spate of insecurity plaguing the country.\n\nThe President advised the youths to shun violence and maintain peace, stressing that the recent EndSARS protests across the country had further complicated the security situation and affected investors\u2019 confidence in Nigeria.",

          "text": "Against early forecasts that COVID-19 infection and mortality rates in Africa might spell mind-boggling catastrophe, the pandemic on the continent remains a puzzle that Africa Centre for Disease Control (ACDC) has not yet found answers.\n\nDespite over 4.8 million infections, largely believed to be an underestimation of the scale of exposure to the virus, the mortality rate still does not represent a picture of the predicted devastation for the continent, John Nkengasong, director, ACDC, said speaking at the 2021 Mo Ibrahim Forum.\n\nSerologic surveys conducted in some African countries such as Nigeria for instance show that at least 20 percent of the population in Lagos has been exposed, yet deaths barely over 2,000 country-wide and 130,000 in Africa.\n\nThis is unlike India where the virus surprised the country and the devastation has been very visible. So, there is a paradox or puzzle between the last number of people that are potentially infected and the relatively low rate of mortality.\n\nHowever, the director fears that the pandemic will begin to normalise deaths as more comparisons are made with the rest of the world.\n\nRead Also: FG okays N895.5bn supplementary budget for military, COVID-19\n\n\u201cHere I am referring to 130,000 people as if they were 130 people. No. When Ebola hit West Africa and within two years, about 12,000 people died, we said never again. And here we are four or five years later with a raging pandemic that has claimed so much more in Africa,\u201d he said, raising fresh concerns over vaccine shortage on the continent.\n\nThe persisting shortage of vaccines in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa at a time when hospitals in some Western countries are being relieved of COVID-19 cases took the centre stage as African leaders deliberated on health systems strengthening at the forum.\n\nThe conference, which saw a review of governments\u2019 responses to the pandemic, gave a renewed push to tackling the challenge of health inequalities amplified by vaccine shortage.\n\nNkengasong again urged countries with surplus doses to offer them for redistribution at speed and scale, saying \u201cAfrica will definitely move towards the endemicity of this virus on the continent, and that does not bode well for our collective global health security.\u201d\n\nOver the last week, the continent has seen an average increase of 14 percent in case, according to Africa CDC. Some countries are tilting slowly towards the third wave and others are battling to level the second wave.\n\nIt is also likely that in the next coming months, some countries that have gone through the third wave will begin to edge towards the third wave, the director said, noting that the public health measures in place had helped and avoided the devastation earlier predicted.\n\nMaking the case for vaccine equity, Tedros Ghebreyesus, director-general, World Health Organisation, said although Africa had not yet seen the same scale of devastation from the COVID-19 pandemic as some parts of the world.\n\nSo far, Africa has administered just over 31 million COVID-19 vaccines doses or 2 percent of the global total, he stated, noting that the final solution will be to build health capacities, not only for COVID-19 vaccines but for other vaccines.\n\n\u201cAfrica has not escaped COVID-19 and we cannot let down our guard. What has happened in many other parts of the world can also happen in Africa.\n\n\u201cWHO is working to bring immediate solutions for equitable vaccine distribution. But it is clear that Africa cannot rely solely on imported vaccines from the rest of the world,\u201d Ghebreyesus said.",

          "title": "Scrapping of NYSC: Scapegoating Only Aggravates Our Woes \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nIt\u2019s longer news that the corporate existence of Nigeria is threatened by the unabating attacks of insurrectionists, bandits, terrorists and the aberration of unknown gunmen. Due to the helplessness of the government to curb this ugly and incessant attacks on the precious lives and property of the citizens, Nigerians are taking recourse to their primordial ethnic cocoons which decimates the Nigerian state to the threshold of near collapse.\n\nThe security conundrum has put everyone in danger. The activities of these anti-state actors have imperiled farmers, traders, students, political leaders, travelers and ofcourse corps members who are entrusted with the patriotic mandate of rendering selfless service to the motherland.\n\nConcerned Nigerians are asking what the way out of the quagmire could be. It is this existential question that has birthed a precipitous bill seeking to scrap National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). Sponsored by Awayi Abiante from Rivers State, the bill has now reached the second reading at the Green Chamber. This bill has brought NYSC to the stead to be a whipping boy for our insecurity as lawmakers debate it relevance to the nation after 48 years of existence.\n\nHon. Awaji-Inombek Abiante in the explanatory memorandum of the proposal, listed various reasons why the NYSC should be scrapped.One of the reasons, according to Abiante, is due to incessant killing of innocent corps members in some parts of the country due to banditry, religious extremism and ethnic violence.\n\nHon Abiante also gave economic exploitation of Corpers by private agencies as another reason for his bill seeking the discontinuation of the scheme as they \u201care no longer recruiting able and qualified Nigerian youths, thus relying heavily on the availability of corps members who have not been well remunerated and get relieved with impunity at the end of their service year without any hope of being gainfully employed.\u201d\n\nApart from serving in their various places of primary assignment, corps members are often deployed for key assignments such as working as ad hoc electoral staff during elections which he also explains endangers the safety of corps members since elections in Nigeria are most times volatile.\n\nIt is worthy to note that since the inception of nysc itself in 1973 the program has been trailed by waves of protest . Just so you know that the scheme has always been a bone of contention right from the day it\u2019s decree was promulgated in 1973. In the words of the scheme\u2019s founder, Gen. Yakubu Gowon \u201cthe establishment of the scheme was followed by a protest throughout the length and breadth of the country\u201d\n\nThe administration of Gen. Gowon established the NYSC with the promulgation of Decree No 24 of May 22, 1973, the objective was to ensure that Nigeria remained an indivisible entity that would be focused on sustainable development and four decades later the scheme can do better but it\u2019s relevance to the socio economic fabrics of Nigeria can be attested to by well meaning and patriotic citizens of Nigeria though not devoid of challenges.\n\nIt was the same General Yakubu Gowon who launched the famous 3Rs which are reconstruction, rehabilitation, reconciliation in order to galvanize the wartorned Nigeria after the devastating civil war the giant of Africa was plunged into between 1967 to 1970 and he found young graduates as one of the veritable tools of nation building. Reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation should be seen as an ongoing efforts of nation building just as government is a continuous process.\n\nThe NYSC posts Corps members to cities or villages and states far from home and states of origin, where they are expected to mix with people of other tribes, social and family backgrounds where they could learn the culture of the indigenes in the place they are posted. This of course fosters mutual understanding of the country\u2019s diverse cultures and national cohesion. What if there was no NYSC?\n\nNYSC should be seen as a work in progress. The government should strengthen the scheme to ensure it meets the current socio-economic reality of our country but scrapping it because of insecurity is like a farmer throwing away his hoe because he\u2019s unable to use it. The problem is not the hoe but the farmer\u2019s inability to use it.\n\nNigeria is one of the most terrorized countries in the world and no society can thrive in an atmosphere of severe insecurity like the one in Nigeria. Government must live up to it\u2019s primary responsibility of providing security of lives and property to citizens. This is the least citizens can ever ask of any government.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSinafi Omanga is a serving corps member with the Nigerian Observer.\n\nEmail: benomanga01@gmail.com\n\n...",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Nigerian government is counting on Standard Chartered Plc for funding as it moves on with the ambition to develop two key rail lines in the country\u2019s south, a departure from its original resolve to source the loan from a syndicate of lenders based in China.\n\nIt is now in the midst of negotiation with the British multinational bank, which focuses on providing financing to African, Asian and Middle East markets, with a view to funding an upgrade of a narrow-gauge track in the South-East and the building of a standard-gauge on the coast, both projects estimated at $14.4 billion, Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi told Bloomberg in an interview.\n\nThe railway infrastructure will be constructed by China Civil Engineering Construction Corp (CCECC), which has entered pact with the government.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve moved away from China in some of our projects,\u201d the minister said on Saturday in Abuja, and added during his discussion with Bloomberg that Zainab Ahmed, his counterpart in the finance ministry, would lead Nigeria\u2019s talks with Standard Chartered.\n\nChoosing not to borrow from China could be a ploy by the government to cut Nigeria\u2019s exposure to the country, which stood at $3.4 billion as of the end of March, going by the figures issued by the debt office on Wednesday.\n\nNigeria spent about 12.6 per cent or $195.5 million of the entire money it used to service its external debt last year to pay part of its debt to China.\n\nMr Amaechi\u2019s spokesperson did not respond to phone calls by PREMIUM TIMES, requesting comment.\n\nStandard Chartered commenced operation in Nigeria 22 years ago, and midwifed the inflow of investments in the sum of $2.5 billion into Africa\u2019s largest economy in 2020 alone of the total $9.7 billion, the biggest by any bank, Bloomberg said Thursday, citing data from the statistics office.\n\nMr Amaechi had in March said at the groundbreaking of the CCECC\u2019s revamp of the Eastern Line connecting Port Harcourt to Maiduguri that a consortium of Chinese financiers would support the project.\n\nState-owned CCECC inked a deal valued at $11.2 billion with Nigeria in 2014 for the building of the Coastal Line that would link Lagos with Calabar in the South-South.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari disclosed in 2017 China\u2019s Export-Import Bank would soon endorse a $3.5 billion facility to help tee off the development of the standard-gauge line, spanning 1,400 kilometres, planned to be constructed in segments.",

The constitution never contemplates nor approve of the situation under Buhari where 90% of the commanding heights of the armed forces and security architecture will be from only northern Nigeria and only the two zones of North East and North West.\n\n\u201dIn any case, anyone familiar with the history of Buhari leadership will appreciate that he is the only Nigerian leader, even among military Heads of state, whose government government, himself, second in command as Chief of staff Supreme headquarters (Idiagbon) and top echelon were all northerners. It was after his death that many Nigerians knew Idiagbon was Fulani of Ilorin.\n\nOn the governors, the group said that \u201dthe President owned up to the statements of Garba Shehu, his most uninformed spokesman, that the ban on open grazing by the Governors was illegal and he could not make a new statement that would contradict him.\n\n\u201cHe is delighted that Governors are Chief Security Officers without any security powers, yet he asked two of the South West Governors to exercise a non-existent powers to deal with terrorists herdsmen who he acknowledged bear arms, even as foreigners , against Nigerian citizens.\n\n\u201cIt is pitiful that our President has no solution rather than the braggadocio of re-opening grazing routes in states by repossessing such lands for his beloved herdsmen.\n\n\u201dLet the President be told that the Yoruba people are solidly behind our Governors that not an inch of land in our territory will be carved out for any grazing reserves or cattle Colony.\u201d",

          "title": "Why we are honouring Daily Times icons \u2013 Fidelis Anosike",
          "text": "Dr. Fidelis Anosike, Chief Executive Officer of Folio Holdings, publishers of the Daily Times Newspaper, has lined up activities to honour heroes of the newspaper, as part of activities designed to mark its 100-year anniversary.\n\nIn this interview, Anosike, an astute media entrepreneur who founded Folio Communications at 24, the company that went on to acquire Daily Times in 2004, explores his journey into the media industry, as well as speaks about the activities he is lining up to honour former MDs and editors of Nigeria\u2019s oldest surviving newspaper.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nYou have come a long way. You set up Folio Communications at 24. How did it all start?\n\nI will say that I started life rather early. I got into the university drawing portraits, so I am a graphic and creative artist. I graduated from the University of Benin. I still tell people that the creative industry is not just my passion, it is my job. I also did loads of self-development. I got enrolled at Harvard Business School Owner President Management course (OPM 39). So, to that extent I am a Harvard alumnus, and being at Harvard made me understand how to businesses properly.\n\nYes, at 24, I established Folio Communications, which went on to acquire Daily Times of Nigeria, the oldest surviving newspaper and noteworthy media organization in Nigeria. Since then, I have been trying to see the much I can do with the resources available to me, both access to capital and knowledge, to expand the frontiers. Besides the media, I also have investments in other areas such as water resources and renewable energy, and I am also financing some global companies on major research on mobility and renewable energy space.\n\nOn how I was able to set up a company at 24, I think it\u2019s important for us as human beings to pray for God to give us consciousness. You can get consciousness at 10, you can get consciousness at 30, you can get consciousness at 70. If you pray for the grace of God, you can get consciousness early. I think I was lucky to get consciousness early and importantly, an opportunity. So, how did I set up Folio? There is an uncle of mine who worked with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). He introduced me to the Head of Communication at the bank, a certain Mr. Bolarinwa of blessed memory, and one Mr. Amobi. They allowed me to enter for CBN creative jobs. At that time, if they want to make a Christmas or Eid cards, or something like that, they would make the bid open and whoever wins; that is if, they pick your design, you will be commissioned to do the work. I won on three occasions, and the price for each was N14,500. With that, I was able to get my office, and went on to create an ecosystem of my friends that studied graphics with me. Whenever a company needed design services, we all made design submissions and as fate often had it, one of us always won. Together we won on many occasions and got contracts from institutions like First Bank, NNPC and CBN.\n\nThat was how I was able to build up capital to go into the communication business. I created a standard for myself and my friends and became a relationship manager for them because they were all on paid jobs. Whoever made a design that was successful shared the proceeds with others. It was a case of all for one and one for all. We designed, restructured and produced all the diaries of NNPC for two years running through open and competitive bid process. We introduced Nigerian idioms into those diaries rather than white labeled ones from FT and so on, which gave it local content. This is because we felt that we should promote our own country. I am full Nigerian. I am proud of my ethnicity as an Igbo man, but this is Nigeria, our country. None of us chose to be here, but we are here all the same, and we must make our country work.\n\nWhen exactly was Folio Communications established?\n\nThat was in 1991. In 2004, Daily Times was put up for sale. Before then, they had tried to sell the shares through public offer via the stock exchange. But it failed, so BPE resorted to Core Investor Sale which refers to a situation where whoever buys it, takes full management control. Folio Communications was already a thriving communication company, and so felt that we needed a media voice and had to create a media company. Long before then, I was already involved in some creative work for ThisDay, and that was how I met Chief Dele Momodu. I had a lot of background knowledge. I reasoned that if I had to make my dream known, I needed a media voice. Therefore, I entered the bid as the singular company involved, others were consultants and consortiums. We were pre-qualified, and made a deposit of $10,000 and put in our technical bid. We were number one. We actually scored 81 per cent. The terrain was known to me. I learnt under Dele Momodu and Nduka Obaigbena; these are men who are far ahead of their time.\n\nI\u2019m sure that until Dele celebrated his 60th birthday, people may have thought he was 90, same as Nduka. They are my pillars, including Okagbue Aduba. About how I was able to understand Nigeria and how it works, I connected with their energy which was infectious. At that point I already had $1 million for the bid bond. This is a security for your integrity, and so no bank will lend you money for a bid bond. You can only finance it with equity. It is money you lose if at the end of the day, you did not pay the bid price. Daily Times Bid Bond then was N100 million. Like I said, they had tried selling it via shares, hoping that people will buy and someone will acquire the majority share, but nobody came in. This was because the media industry in Nigeria is not bankable; it has not been restructured so it doesn\u2019t have capital flowing into it. We bid and attracted N1.25 billion into the media industry as far back as 2004. Our first bid was, I think N327 million. Our competitor, bid N800million in their first bid. That was N500 million above us. But we knew the bid was in two rounds. Our second-round bid was N1.25 billion, while our competitor\u2019s second round bid was N1.05 billion, so we won.\n\nWhen we bought and took over Daily Times, its liability was N1.9 billion. The assets were N2.3 billion. The enterprise value was N700 million or slightly above that. We bought Daily Times at almost twice the price the government was hoping to get. It is on record, and I was about 35 years old then. Nobody would have given an \u2018Igbo boy\u2019 a chance to buy Daily Times. I am a testimony that things can work in Nigeria if you believe. I had no godfather, only by faith and audacity of hope.\n\nThe Folio Media Group (FMG) has come a long way. Today, it has access to the technology space and we are also doing consolidated media offering to clients. the Folio Investment and Trading Company (FITC) is an investment company focused on media, creative and cultural industry investment and innovation. We also have as part of the group, Folio Media and Creative Academy (FMCA), which is working in tandem with relevant authorities to train journalists and creative industry practitioners. The aim is to train 50,000 in those key fields in five years.\n\nDoes the Creative African eXchange perform the same function?\n\nNo, that is Folio Media and creative Academy. The Creative African eXchange (CAX.caxafrica.com) is part of the Folio Media Group. It is part of the initiative we are trying to use to consolidate the continental space of the creative and cultural industry.\n\nCan you shed more light on 1st October and Miss Nigeria as offshoots of Folio Media Group?\n\n1st October Limited is a publishing company that we set up in 2007 to publish the birth of Nigeria. It has evolved overtime because we have done over 10 different publications on Nigeria and state governments. It also went ahead, in 2014, to give birth to a global public perception movement for Nigeria called \u2018Nigeria, Our Heritage.\u2019 This was launched at the Kennedy Centre, and it was the first ever African event at the Kennedy Centre, Washington DC on the sideline of Obama African heads of Government meeting. What we are trying to do with 1st October and Nigeria, Our Heritage, is to see how we can transition the love of Nigerians to love of Nigeria. We saw a gap there in terms of country branding. We want to create a platform that will enable us to use Nigerians, specially those in the Diaspora, to drive the love for country. This is important because at the end of the day, other countries spend millions of dollars in country branding. Even the United States spends up to $240 million annually to brand their country. You see, once you are in Europe as a Nigerian, you take a 30 per cent cut. If Aliko Dangote walks into an office in New York, and says he is a Nigerian, he takes a 30 per cent minus. That is huge! That\u2019s one of the reasons our national development is stunted; because our brand, the brand Nigeria, has so much deteriorated. There are many reasons: political instability, military government of thirty plus years, advanced fee fraud, imperialistic gang up and many more. So you can see the reason it has happened over the years.\n\nSo we as Nigerians, we doing what we can to change this for the future because people only do business with those they can trust. Without that trust, we cannot have foreign direct investment coming to Nigeria. You can have $10 billion like in Lagos State, and you are happy, but you could have $100 billion. You can begin to see how that affects national security, the issue of banditry and so on. The problem is image. Nobody wants to do business with anybody that is dirty. If you wear dirty clothes, you become non attractive. There are options; people can sit down in New York and put their money in Scottish windows or savings accounts and make returns. But if you want people to come from China or America, you must present yourself in a way that will make them to fly in first before realising that there are challenges. Of course, there are challenges everywhere. Afghanistan is probably receiving more investment than Nigeria even as they are beset by terrorism. So it is a matter of how you package yourself as a country. Nigerians must help to improve the whole because when the whole collapses, the part, which may be fantastic, will automatically collapse. That is what 1st October is doing. It is a big project. We just recently partnered with the Nigeria Diaspora Commission, and in October, we will start an immersion programme, which is going to bring 100 young Nigerians from all the Ivy League schools in the Diaspora to Nigeria. We will train them on issues of national development and deploy them to about 100 companies, and expose them to what Nigerians are doing right. We know that a lot of things are going wrong, but let\u2019s amplify the right ones and let\u2019s also inculcate this into the young people. So, it is going to be a deliberate effort to raise 1000 people young people that can become advocates for the country. This is what 1st October is all about. This is a positive national development platform.\n\nWe have also remodeled Miss Nigeria to become more than just beauty pageant. It\u2019s more of female empowerment platform. It was founded in 1957. It gave life to all other pageants in Nigeria. Our very first Miss Nigeria is still alive at 86, Chief Mrs Grace Oyelude. We shall also institute a commemorative lecture in her honour as a DTN icon. Every Miss Nigeria is an ambassador of the Green Girl Company, with projects like Green Dignity Kit (GDK) and Green Girl Academy, among others. Nigeria is our country, nobody chose it; it chose us and we have to make it work. We must not use all the energy we have to think of how to break the country. What is happening today is a consequence of long-time inaction; of doing the wrong things, and not having ideas for doing the right thing. Most of the governors were busy building airports they don\u2019t need, but neglected the primary schools that are supposed to train people that would shape the future. They neglected education, and dwelt on less important things. So when you lose empathy, you start approaching things from the middle. That explains why conspiracy theory comes in.\n\nWhat attracted you to the Daily Times and what has been your experience running the company?\n\nDaily Times has huge pedigree. The company was created by Adeyemo Alakija and the London Mirror Group. It went on to have Dr. Ernest Ikoli, Alhaji Babatunde Jose, Amb. Dele Cole, Aremu Segun Osoba, Chief Tunji Oseni, Prince Tony Momoh, Dr. Yemi Ogunbiyi, Chief Innocent Oparadike, Dr. Onyema Ugochukwu, Chief Sam Amuka Pemu among others. The Daily Times was the biggest mouthpiece in the country. At one time, Alhaji Jose was asked if he would run for president, and he said he was already chairman of Daily Times. That was how big the Daily Times was. It was indeed the fourth estate of the realm. Because I did appreciate the enormity of what I took upon my shoulder when I took it over, the commercial problems arising from property didn\u2019t weigh me down. I am not a property person, the only personal property I own in Abuja was bought with my money. No government or minister can claim to have given me any land.\n\nWhen we took over Daily Times, there were about 400 staff in the company. Money from the government was not coming anymore, so we had to restructure. We had to downsize, and fought with the union for two years. During the fight, the business was closed down. Then Hallmark Bank, which loaned us the money, took over the company. We didn\u2019t recover the company through legal means until September 2007. So, I acquired the company in 2004, it was hijacked by Hallmark Bank. Everyone was interested in the assets, but no one was thinking about the liabilities. We had to go to court. There was this man, Mr Adrian Wood, one time CEO at MTN who joined us at Folio Communications. His mandate was to revive Daily Times, and put it on the same pedestal as the New York Times. He employed people from all walks of life; both Nigerians and other Africans to make it a model. We knew that without a dominant and strong media organization in Nigeria, the issues of national development will fail. That is why in America, they have Fox, CNN, etc., based on their ideological beliefs, and tied to politics.\n\nWithout a strong media, there will be fragmentation, and that explains why the masses don\u2019t have a voice. We wanted to make Daily Times what it used to be. Thereafter, all sorts of people started taking us to court. All these people came from third parties because Folio acquired Daily Times alone. In the typical Nigerian context, everything is contentious, not to talk of when you acquire a national asset. We adapted to many things in the course of all these.\n\nWe have continued to push. The first Times Heroes Awards [email protected] in 2017 was massively supported. We interacted with many governors in the process. See what Nyesom Wike of Rivers State is doing today. We are proud of him. We saw the character the man brought with him to the office from day one, and gave him an award. We gave award to people like Yahaya Bello of Kogi State. You know, sometimes you have to encourage people with potential or you lose them.\n\nWhy did you retain the name Daily Times after acquiring it? Is it because of its influence?\n\nNo, it is not because of the influence. Daily Times owns the largest archives. It is 95 years now, and will be 100 years in five years. How many media companies in Nigeria are 100 years old? Daily Times is beyond a newspaper company. It was here before Nigeria. It created the Nigeria Stock Exchange. It has produced two or three state governors. It is a national development company.\n\nDaily Times will mark 100 years in five years. You have lined up events to mark the anniversary. Can you tell us about that?\n\nYes, in the run up to our 100 anniversary, we have created an event to celebrate icons of Daily Times \u2013 our heroes; Times Heroes. The first one that we have designed is for Ambassador Dele Cole. We are hoping to do these in their states of origin. Ambassador Cole\u2019s event will be held in Port Harcourt. It will be a two-day event. On day one, we are going to train about 500 journalists in the area. On day two, there will be a proper Lecture where the likes of Dr. Mrs Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Dr Adewunmi Adeshina and other distinguished scholars and technocrats of Nigerian origin will be invited as Keynote Speakers. There is nothing like making impact in your home state. We have lined up about 15 of our former heroes. The first one will be in Rivers State because that is where Amb. Cole comes from. We don\u2019t want to keep celebrating people when they are dead; we want to celebrate them while they are alive, and learn something from them. We will talk about national development and the role the media play.\n\nIn Nigeria, we let out heroes die without transferring knowledge. We need to have teach History in Nigeria because if you don\u2019t know where you are coming from, you won\u2019t know where you are going. We must return history to our schools. And that is what we are doing at Folio Communications. It is important therefore, that we get this first one right.\n\nSecondly, we are developing a book, which Dr. Onyema Ugochukwu will co edit with Chief Tunji Okegbola, DTN Librarian of over 40 years, to be launched at our 100-year celebration. Amb. Dele Cole proved himself to be an epitome of politics without bitterness, media game changer and diplomat per excellence. He created the legacy of The Guardian and revived the legacy of Daily Times, and when the government was becoming overbearing, he created a new legacy at The Guardian.\n\nWe are also planning for the First Onyema Ugochukwu\u2019s lecture, which will hold on 9th November, 2021. We will celebrate Ernest Ikoli, the first ever indigenous and founding editor of the Daily Times. We are also looking at celebrating Allahaji Babatunde Jose, Aremu Segun Osoba, Dr Yemi Ogunbiyi, Chief Sam Amuka-Pemu, Mrs Grace Oyelude \u2013 first miss Nigeria, Prince Tony Momoh, among others. Our goal between now and the next five years, is to institute a minimum of 10 lectures. Each of them will be in respective home state of the icon, most of them and their governors have accepted. Indeed, they are all excited about it. We will send a letter to Governor Wike believing he will be gracious enough to accept and host the 1st Amb Patrick Dele Cole lecture.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari, has said that the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has businesses everywhere, adding that his government had mobilised and would continue to mobilise the military and the police to go after them.\n\nBuhari who spoke in in a pre-recorded interview on Arise News Television, categorized all Igbo People as IPOB members, noting that despite having businesses everywhere, nobody is disturbing the group.\n\nHe said some leaders of the South South, had approached him to say they have no business with IPOB, which according to him, means that they will be encircled.\n\n\u201cIPOB is just like a dot in a circle and they have nowhere to turn to. They are spread everywhere and they have investments and properties everywhere and in other areas,\u201d Buhari said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know what they are doing. How we will handle them is to mobilise the police and the military to go after them. I\u2019m happy that some South-South leaders came to me and said they have nothing to do with IPOB, so they will be encircled\u201d\n\nBuhari also contradicted himself while trying to defend his administration\u2019s nepotism and lopsided appointments.\n\nSpeaking on the general perception that his administration had concentrated appointments in the North than Southern Nigeria, the president said \u201cYou better get the list of our civil servants if you think there are no people from the South East. There are people from the South East, but they know they have to go through the mill.\u201d\n\nOn the failure of his administration to adequately include people from the South East and the entire southern region in his government, especially into security services and Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs), he said: \u201cPeople who have been there for 18 years\u2026they trained in Zaria or in Abeokuta, they climbed through the ranks and because they found [themselves] under all the circumstances, the crisis and everything, and they gradually rise to that status and you think [I will] just pick somebody just to balance up? These positions have to be earned. There are people who have been there for 10-15 years.\u201d\n\nHe added that geographical balance should not be the basis for appointing security chiefs.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t join, you\u2019re not forced to join, but when you join, you go through the rigmarole\u2026and you learn by the system,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the massive retirement of major generals from the army over their subordinate as Chief of Army Staff, he said: \u201cDo you know where he (Major General Farouk Yahaya) was serving before he became the Chief of Army Staff? You can\u2019t just pick somebody because he is wearing seniority (sic). You will put somebody who has suffered with the soldiers, they know him, he fought with them and so on. I tell you the truth, on individual basis, I have forgotten some of these chaps, I don\u2019t know them.\u201d\n\nAsked if years of operational experience did not matter in appointing the service chiefs, Buhari said \u201cIt is, [but] for the soldiers to be effectively led, it must be somebody they know\u2026\u201d\n\nThe president also defended his government\u2019s decision to spend $1.9 billion on a rail project to the Niger Republic, saying he has family members there.\n\nAccording to him, his government\u2019s decision to build rail lines from Kano to the country was to allow his Nigerien relatives easily have access to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI have cousins, family members, etc., in Niger Republic. I shouldn\u2019t just cut them off,\u201d Mr Buhari said.\n\nHe also cited transportation of oil from the neighbouring country to Nigeria and job creation as other reasons for constructing the rail line.",

Even if they want to exit, they will have no access to anywhere.\n\n\u201cAnd the way they are spread all over the country, having businesses and properties, I don\u2019t think IPOB knows what they are talking about.\n\n\u201cIn any case, we say we\u2019ll talk to them in the language that they understand. We\u2019ll organise the police and the military to pursue them.\u201d\n\nBuhari said the #EndSARS protest which held across the country last year was aimed at forcing him out of office, but to no avail. He equally defended the $1.9bn Nigeria-Niger Republic railway project, also stating that he has been assured by \u201cthe elderly people\u201d and \u201cthe youths\u201d from the South-South part of the country that their region has no intention of seceding.\n\nHe said IPOB will not have \u201caccess to anywhere\u201d even if they eventually secede from the country.\n\nThe President then reiterated his statement that IPOB members will be treated in the \u201clanguage that they understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was encouraged by what I heard, nobody told me. Two statements from the South-South. One by the elderly people, they said this time around there would be no (secession). And again, the youths made the same statement; such encouragement,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nMeanwhile, Buhari on another occasion reiterated that his directive to security agencies, to shoot any person or persons found illegally wielding AK-47s and other assault weapons, remains in place.\n\nThe President also vowed that his administration will act firmly and decisively \u2018\u2018against any and all persons fomenting or carrying out attacks on our Police Force and other security personnel.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President spoke at the handing over of security equipment by the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to the Lagos State Police Command during his one-day official visit to the State.\n\nBuhari warned that \u2018\u2018a nation that turns its Police personnel and infrastructure into targets of violence and destruction is a nation on the path of self-destruction.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018As Commander-in-chief, my primary responsibility remains the security of the country and the safety of all citizens. Despite the many challenges we are facing, I want Nigerians to rest assured that we will secure this country.\n\n\u2018\u2018We will secure our infrastructure, our highways, our communities, and our forests, and we will secure the lives of our people,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President told members of the Nigeria Police that as the government strives to improve their welfare and capacity, the citizens equally had expectations from them.\n\n\u2018\u2018First let me commend the Inspector-General of Police and the entire Force for the recent efforts to restore peace to troubled parts of the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have charged the Inspector-General to leave no stone unturned in rebuilding the morale of his officers and men, especially in the aftermath of the mindless violence associated with the EndSARS protests, as well as the recent spate of attacks on Police Stations in some parts of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nCommending the Lagos State Governor on the newly-acquired security equipment and assets, the President noted that it would go a long way in boosting the morale of the Police, and further enhance their capacity to fight crime and combat criminality.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is even more touching in the light of the unwarranted violence that ensued in the wake of the ENDSARS protests last October, which saw the security architecture in Lagos State being severely damaged,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President added that it was commendable that Lagos State, the Centre of Excellence, has shown a truly resilient spirit, in the face of the massive destruction it suffered last October.\n\n\u2018\u2018You did not allow yourselves to be deterred by the severe setback; instead you have bounced back and are now boldly rebuilding the confidence of residents and investors in the State.\n\n\u2018\u2018I acknowledge the initiative taken to kick-start the rebuilding process, through the establishment of the Lagos State Rebuild Trust Fund, and through this very laudable effort by the Lagos State Security Trust Fund. I enjoin other State Governments to emulate your bold, proactive and resourceful initiative,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President also used the occasion to reiterate that the \u2018\u2018Federal Government takes very seriously our constitutional oath to secure the lives and properties of the Nigerian people, adding that his administration was conscious of the fact that lasting security is a necessary foundation for business, investment and true prosperity.\n\nPresident Buhari declared that no Federal Government since 1999 has been as committed as his administration in reforming and repositioning the Nigeria Police Force and national policing architecture.\n\n\u2018\u2018In 2019, I signed into law the Act establishing the Nigeria Police Trust Fund, the first in the history of the Force, to provide guaranteed funding to support Police welfare, logistics and equipment.\n\n\u2018\u2018In September 2020, I assented to the Bill amending the Nigeria Police Act, which was originally enacted in 1943.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new Act, a vast improvement over the old one, among other things spells out the modalities for the implementation of a National Community Policing Scheme in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new scheme will build confidence within our local communities and make them active stakeholders in the safety and security of their environs.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are currently recruiting 10,000 new Police officers to reinforce our personnel capacity across the country. In addition to this, I have directed the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission to carry out an upward review of Police salaries and benefits,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

          "text": "*Uduaghan wades into kingship feud\n\nBy Gabriel Omonhinmin\n\nIn the absence of the 378 years old missing Itsekiri crown, the Ginuwa Princes have settled for a new one for the throne, clearing way for the official coronation of Omoba Tsola Emiko on Saturday, August 21, 2021.\n\nPrince Emiko is already in \u201cIdanike\u201d (seclusion) for the event as the 21st Olu of Warri Kingdom. The question on the lips of most people now is, will this important event hold on that day or not?\n\nIt is this riddle that men like the former Governor of Delta State, Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan, who is an Itsekiri chief, have been making frantic efforts to solve.\n\nChief Johnson Amastserunleghe JP, the Iyatsere of Warri Kingdom, who also doubles as the Acting Chairman, Olu\u2019s Advisory Council, after the alleged suspension of Chief Ayiri Emami, as the Ologbotsere of Warri Kingdom by the Ginuwa Ruling House, made the proclamations about the official burial rites of His Royal Majesty, Ogiame Ikenwoli and the coronation ceremonies of Tsola Emiko as the 21st king of the Itsekiri on May 27, 2021.\n\nSince then, the relative peace hitherto brokered by some Warri chiefs and indigenes seems to have suddenly evaporated.\n\nA group of prominent Itsekiri sons and daughters such as Prince Michael Diden, popularly known as Ejele, who kept his cool while the crises raged, last week, called a press conference, where he asked for the entire process that brought about the selection of Tsola Emiko, to be reversed and the proper thing done, if peace must continue to reign in the kingdom.\n\nHe described all the actions taken to date as illegal and violations of the Itsekiri tradition and customs, especially the 1979 edict, which stipulates in very clear terms, the steps to be followed before an Olu-designate is selected.\n\nHe added that the process that threw up the candidature of Tsola Emiko and his eventual selection as the Olu-designate was faulty and a complete violation of the law, and cannot stand.\n\nIn an effort to end what looks like a major crisis that could forestall the coronation of Tsola Emiko, notable Itsekiri personalities such as Chief Uduaghan (the Atema of Warri Kingdom), who was in London when the crisis began, have now delved into the imbroglio.\n\nUduaghan is said to be doing all within his powers to bring together the major warring factions to maintain peace.\n\nPalace Watch gathered, that on Monday, June 7, 2021, Uduaghan invited Chief Ayiri Emami, the Ologbotsere of Warri, to his personal residence in the oil city.\n\nAfter their discussion, Uduaghan told him that a meeting has been scheduled for Emami, to meet with the Tsola Emiko and Prince Yemi Emiko in the Olu-designate\u2019s temporary palace in Warri.\n\nUduaghan was said to have driven Emami to the venue of the planned meeting. But surprisingly, when they arrived at the venue, Uduaghan and Emami met Tsola Emiko, Amastserunleghe, Chief Brown Mene, Chief Roland Oritsejafor, and the present Regent of Warri Kingdom, Prince Emmanuel Okotie-Eboh, waiting for them.\n\nWhen Emami was asked to state his grievances, he clear stated that he could not discuss anything meaningful in the presence of the people seated at the meeting because they were all junior to him in ranking as Warri palace chiefs.\n\nYemi Emiko, who is a major factor in the Warri chieftaincy crisis, was said to have been livid with anger, saying the invitation and presence of the above named persons at the meeting, which he never expected, \u201camounted to an \u2018ambush\u2019 which is most unacceptable to him.\u201d\n\nConsequently, nothing meaningful was discussed on that day. The Olu-designate was said to have told Emami that the Itsekiri people were deeply offended with him for shredding a letter that the Princes of the Ginuwa Ruling House wrote him and forwarding the pieces to them.\n\nHe added that for peace to reign, Emami should do a letter of apology to the Ginuwa Ruling House requesting to be forgiven, and the matter of his suspension as Ologbotsere will be looked into and resolved.\u201d\n\nEmami was alleged to have seized the opportunity to formally congratulate Tsola Emiko as the Olu designate and promised to do the letter.\n\nPalace Watch reached out to the Ologbotsere descendants over Emami\u2019s alleged recognition of the Olu designate and acceptance to write letter.\n\nThe Spokesperson of the Ologbotsere descendants of Warri Kingdom, Comrade Alex Eyengho, shouted and said the claims were false.\n\nHe said that what most people don\u2019t understand is that Chief Emami usually briefed the Ologbotsere descendants about all that happened in all the meetings he attended.\n\nAccording to him, there is no way that Emami will ever contemplate doing such a letter, without first tabling the matter for exhaustive discussions in the Ologbotsere descendants\u2019 meetings, which now virtually hold every other day.\n\nUduaghan, who was said to have observed the drama with amusement, without uttering a word, immediately after the failed meeting, called for another enlarged one for Wednesday 9th June, 2021, in his residence in Warri.\n\nDuring the Wednesday meeting, the following persons were said to be present: Chief Gabriel Awala, Chief Yayah Pessu, Chief Isaac Jemide, Chief Richmond MacGrey, Dr. Andrew Ayu (a retired General Manager, Medical Services at NNPC), Chief Eroro Emiko, Chief Barrister Ariyo, Emami, Prince Yemi Emiko, Dr. Alex Ideh (who has been a Commissioner twice in Delta State), Barrister Ekeoko, Chief Pa Akoma (the Olarebi of the Ginuwa Ruling House) and Godwin Abigoro.\n\nUduaghan was said to have thanked everyone present for attending and said sadly, two persons invited were, however, absent. They were Amastserunleghe and Diden (\u201cEjele\u201d).\n\nUduaghan was said that the essence of the meeting, was to first see how lasting peace could be brokered between the warring factions.\n\nSecondly, to see how some of the people present at the meeting, especially Emami and MacGrey, could help locate the missing crown and the two sons of the immediate past Olu (Ogiame Ikenwoli), Princes Oyowoli and Omasholi, who have gone out of circulation since the crisis became heightened some months back.\n\nUduaghan was said to have promised to pay for the flight tickets of the two princes once their whereabouts are located anywhere in the world, so that as demanded by the Itsekiri tradition, they could participate fully in the traditional burial rites of their father, which will soon begin before the coronation of Tsola Emiko.\n\nEmami was said to have promptly responded that he was not in any position to help find thecrown and the two princes. According to him, Amastserunleghe, who was absent from the meeting, should be the right and proper person to help find the crown, some of the Olu of Warri regalia/artifacts and the two Princes.\n\nMacGrey, who was also asked to assist on the whereabouts of the crown and the Princes, was said to have told the meeting, that there was no way he could be of help.\n\nYemi Emiko was said to have intervened at this juncture, saying, \u201cif the missing crown is not found before the coronation date, we are already making a new and more beautified crown than the missing crown, which we will use to crown Omoba Tsola Emiko as the 21st Olu of Warri Kingdom come August 21st 2021.\n\nI\u2019m ready, to provide accommodation for Princes Oyowoli and Omasholi and ensure their safety in Warri during the traditional burial rites of their late father.\u201d\n\nHe was said to have stressed that the missing crown and other items at the palace were last seen there when the two Princes fled the place.\n\nYemi Emiko\u2019s comments were said to have angered MacGrey, who asked him whether he was sure that the two Princes, who were seriously traumatized by thugs allegedly brought to the palace by a chief, while the duo children were still in the place before they were chased away, were still alive.\n\nMacGrey was said to have told Yemi, that the \u201creckless\u201d allegation he has just made against the two Princes were not only unfounded, but can\u2019t be proved against the duo.\n\nMacGrey then asked Yemi Emiko where he was and what he did to ensure the safety of Oyowoli and Omasholi, when the two Princes were trapped in the palace for days, begging for help as they were almost killed in the process;\n\nand why does he, Yemi, think that the two Princes will believe him or take him seriously when he could not help them when they needed his assistance the most, and were fighting for their lives immediately after the death of their father;\n\nand why does he think the children will believe his promise to accommodate them and ensure their safety, when they were neither told when their father\u2019s remains were to be interred nor shown the grave.\n\nChief MacGrey was said to have asked of what use will the two Princes presence be in Warri, now that the burial rites of their father is about to begin?\n\nMacGrey, who said, he and his family members have been sufficiently embarrassed over this matter, promised to seek redress in court any moment from now.\n\nIdeh and Jemide were said to have told the gathering that if reconciliation can\u2019t be reached now, the possibility of finding the crown and the children will be extremely difficult.\n\nThey again stressed that, no matter the beauty of the purported crown that is now being made or procured, the old missing one would remain more valuable and forever the symbol of the Itsekiri people.\n\nHence, there is need to find the crown at all costs. Pessu and Jemide, who are part of the five kingmakers sidelined from the new process, were said to have expressed how deeply hurt they were over the matter.\n\nPessu, however, promised not to pursue the matter in court, saying there were better ways of resolving issues like this without litigation.\n\nAnother source at the meeting, who did not want his name mentioned, alleged most people are not surprised that Amastserunleghe, has not been cooperating with all the peace initiatives so far made.\n\nHe said, contrary to most opinions that he is the problem, he is actually not, but Chief Brown Mene, who was the right hand man of Ogiame Atuwase II, the father of Tsola Emiko.\n\nHe alleged that Mene served the late Ogiame Atuwase II for 28 years, and he was his man Friday before his death.\n\n\u201cMene is the man pulling all the strings behind the scene; whatever, he asks the Iyatsere to do, is what he does without questioning the rationale behind such actions,\u201d the source claimed.\n\nAnother Chief was said to have cautioned those fighting as if this is the end of the world, to thread gently.\n\nHe said the people fighting in support of Tsola and those backing Prince Oyowoli were also battling for the ruling family as the two principal contenders to the Warri throne are all Emikos, adding: \u201cwhy should anyone die because of this disagreement?\u201d\n\nUduaghan has fixed another meeting for tomorrow, Saturday 12 June, 2021 in his residence in Warri, to find a way of settling the problem.",

          "text": "PHILIP CLEMENT, ABUJA\n\nFormer Technical Adviser to the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Rabiu Suleiman, has called for higher investment in Information and Communications Technology to fully harness the huge economic potential in the petroleum sector.\n\nThe expert, however, listed insecurity as the major challenge facing the industry, followed by economic recession and the Coronavirus Disease that almost grounded the world economy.\n\nHis words, \u201cMany countries passed through the recession. There was a lowering of oil reserves because production was halted in some countries and, therefore, production became low. There are other challenges related to high production cost.\n\n\u201cIf you do a comparative analysis between Nigeria and other countries, cost of production per barrel in Nigeria is significantly very high.\n\nIt went as high as $32 per barrel and crude oil price at the international market went as low as $9/barrel. But quickly, it went up to $140/barrel later and then crashed to below zero per cent during COVID-19.\u201d\n\nPointing out that the 2021 edition of the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit, which started on June 6, 2021, in Abuja, provides a great opportunity for the oil and gas sector in Nigeria, with the focus on leveraging ICT to transform the sector, Suleiman said, \u201cICT plays a significant role in optimisation, efficiency and technological advancement.\n\n\u201cThe most sensitive equipment in the process plans in the oil and gas industry are the programmable logic controllers, online analysers and other instruments that control process, temperature, flows and pressure. So, if a company such as Huawei focuses on optimisation, efficiency, control and improvement, maximisation of production will be very good.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, ICT is also key insecurity and one can easily integrate various ICT components terms to monitor volume flows, temperature, attack, corrosion and contamination, communication.\n\n\u201cICT has proven to be useful across industries. I believe it is time for the oil and gas industry to embrace more ICT. ICT innovations are coming up to help tackle most of the challenges in the industry. I know Huawei Technologies has been coming up with some new solutions for the petroleum industry,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Usman Alkali Baba, the inspector-general of Police, IGP, narrowly escaped death as a canopy nearly collapsed on him during an official function on Wednesday, June 9, 2021.\n\nThe incident took place at the Lagos State Police Headquarter Ikeja when the newly confirmed IGP, who was on his first official visit to the state, was about to address senior police officers.\n\nIt was about 2:15 p.m. when he came down from office of the state Commissioner of Police, Azeez Odumosu, when a heavy wind started blowing.\n\nAt about 2:20 p.m. the wind got heavier, soon accompanied by heavy rain. At about 2:30 p.m. the rain and wind became heavier just as the IGP was being introduced. As soon as the National Anthem was over the rain increased in intensity while the raging wind pulled down canopies covering both journalists and senior police officers.\n\nBoth the police and journalists scampered for safety.\n\nREAD ALSO: NATFORCE: Group appeals to NSA to reverse disbandment order\n\nAt that point the IGP and AIG Zone Two Lagos, Johnson Kokumor, as well as AIG Force CID Galandi, CP Odumosu, and other senior officers rushed out \u2013 and then the canopy collapsed.\n\nThe IGP arrived at the Command at about 1:40 p.m. and was only able to take the National Anthem before the downpour started. The wind blew up all the canopies erected. This development forced the IGP and other senior officers to run to the conference room while others and journalists sought safety in available.\n\nThe IGP on arrival in Lagos at 10:00 a.m., had visited Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu at the Lagos House, Marina, and the Oba of Lagos before coming to the command headquarters at about 1.40 p.m.\n\nOn arrival at the command, he met briefly with some senior officers at the conference room before coming to address other senior officers, including Area commanders, DPOs, squadron commanders before the rain started.

          "text": "Michael Adeshina\n\nFemi Adesina has described Nigerians as people who rejoice at iniquity, evil \u201cand they think somebody is being done in.\u201d\n\nAdesina stated this in his weekly article titled \u201cLET\u2019S GARLAND BEN AYADE,\u201d which he wrote to celebrate the defection of the Cross River governor to the All Progressives Congress.\n\nAccording to the presidential aide, many Nigerians are not like Ayade who saw character, honour, commitment, selflessness, transparency in President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAdesina added that Ayade joined APC because of his love for Nigeria.\n\nHe urged Nigerians to emulate Ayade and change their ways.\n\nAccording to Adesina, Nigerians celebrate when terrorrists kill soldiers, when students are being kidnapped but keep mute when the economy makes a gain.\n\nPlease read Femi Adesina\u2019s article below:\n\nI felt like embracing Governor of Cross River State, Ben Ayade, a couple of weeks back when he left the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) for the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nWas that because I work with a President elected on the platform of the APC? Not necessarily so. Yes, I\u2019ve never really liked the PDP because I felt there was too much of buccaneering in the party, but I\u2019d always been honest enough to give some governors in the fold of the party who were doing well their dues. I always mentioned Rotimi Amaechi of Rivers State (he was still in PDP then), Danjuma Goje of Gombe State, and some others. They stood out for the good works in their states.\n\nWhen the APC came, and made Muhammadu Buhari its presidential candidate in 2014, I gladly threw in my lot with the party, not as a registered member though. Whither Buhari goest, I go.\n\nAyade\u2019s crossing over to APC was very good for the party. The more governors, the merrier, and the brighter your chances of retaining power at the centre.\n\nWe will come back to that, but first, my reason for being happy with Ayade, to the point of considering a warm embrace.\n\nHear the Governor when he gave reasons for crossing the carpet: \u201cHaving seen and known the President and his commitment to this country, his nationalistic disposition and all the efforts he has made to bring Nigeria to where we are today, it is obvious that at this point, we needed to join hands with him to build a Nigeria that we can be proud of.\n\n\u201cWe need all governors to recognize that it is not the party that matters, it is character, honour, commitment to the vision of this great nation.\u201d\n\nThis resonates deeply with me. For if there is one thing lacking in our country, it is love for the nation. Some Nigerians actually rejoice when negative things happen to their own country. They rejoice at iniquity, at evil, and they think somebody is being done in, not knowing that the land is the ultimate loser. They swallow poison, and think it would kill their neighbors. Pity!\n\nAlso lacking in our blessed but blighted country are virtues like character, honour, commitment, selflessness, transparency, which President Buhari has a-plenty, and which Gov Ayade has seen, and which brought him into the APC.\n\nThat is the reason for the intended embrace.\n\nCross River State has always been PDP, and may still be largely so, but Ayade did not mind.\n\nHe was actuated by enough love for country to know that his former party was not the way to go any longer, not minding the personal consequences.\n\nNow, listen to this one that bowled me over completely.\n\nThe Governor came to see the President, and spoke to journalists covering State House. He told them:\n\n\u201cWhat do I stand to gain? If police stations are attacked, policemen are killed, soldiers are killed, there is kidnapping everywhere, it makes the ruling party unpopular, and that is good for me. My party is likely to win. But that is what I want to depart from. The cumulative impact of that is you are celebrating while your country is undergoing a bloodbath. And the cascading effect is that your country is becoming ungovernable over a period of time.\n\n\u201cSo, why don\u2019t we join hands with a party that says we are open, rather than being at war with each other?\u201d\n\nThat is the crux of my admiration for Ayade. His decamping is not strictly about himself, but about our country. Love for fatherland. That is food for thought. Something we need to ponder about, and check ourselves in the mirror. Michael Jackson sang about the man in the mirror. \u201cI\u2019m starting with the man in the mirror, I\u2019m asking him to change his ways.\u201d\n\nYes, Nigerians are the men in the mirror. We must change our ways. You rejoice when Boko Haram kills our troops.\n\nYou are the man in the mirror. You exult when bandits carry away students into captivity. You are the man in the mirror. You dance when bombs and explosives go off, killing innocent souls. You are the man in the mirror. When economic indices are released, and things are looking down, you trumpet it from the rooftops. But when the economy makes gains, you pretend not to know. You are the man in the mirror. It\u2019s time to learn from Ayade. It\u2019s time to change your ways, and think Nigeria first. That is the lesson of the decampment, even when it is at great personal cost.\n\nBut if we can do some political permutations (which is allowed) Gov Ayade has given APC a shot in the arm, the very same thing Gov Dave Umahi of Ebonyi did some months back.\n\nAPC started this dispensation with about 24 governors, while PDP had 12. All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) had one, which it still does today. Due to schisms and internal wranglings, APC dwindled to 19 governors. They were lost to PDP, which began to make strong showings. And then, Umahi came. Ayade came. Before you knew it, APC was back to 21 governors. The winner takes it all, the loser standing small.\n\nBy the nature of our politics, the more states you control, the easier it is for you to win the Presidency. APC has 21, and still counting. Some things are sure to happen in the months ahead. APC\u2019s gain will be PDP\u2019s loss.\n\nWhat APC lost in the South-South by being ousted in Edo and Bayelsa states, it has now got by having Cross River in the kitty. Things are looking up. Politics is still a game of numbers.\n\nBeyond politics, however, I think we should garland Governor Ayade. He has made a move in which he was not thinking of just himself, but of the good of the country. He deserves our praises and our emulation. If only we think of the good of our country first, we would then change our ways.\n\nI\u2019m closing with the man in the mirror, I\u2019m asking him to change his ways.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity",
          "summary": "According to the presidential aide, many Nigerians are not like Ayade who saw character, honour, commitment, selflessness, transparency in President Muhammadu Buhari.\nAdesina added that Ayade joined APC because of his love for Nigeria.\nAccording to Adesina, Nigerians celebrate when terrorrists kill soldiers, when students are being kidnapped but keep mute when the economy makes a gain.\nThey rejoice at iniquity, at evil, and they think somebody is being done in, not knowing that the land is the ultimate loser.\n\u201cI\u2019m starting with the man in the mirror, I\u2019m asking him to change his ways.\u201dYes, Nigerians are the men in the mirror.",

Therefore, we should allow the party to decide. You cannot sit there in Lagos, for instance, and decide on the fate of APC on zoning.

The party leaders remain firmly committed to the principles that succession must be through the democratic norms and processes.\n\n\u201cThe mention he made of Lagos was not a reference to the respected party leader, Senator Bola Tinubu, as the opposition party\u2019s predatory designs would put it in order to damage the excellent relationship between the two of them.\n\n\u201cThe President, the Asiwaju and the rapidly growing members of the party, want a dynastic succession of elected leaders.\n\n\u201cThe APC should not be distracted from its progress as a democratic party.\u201d",

          "title": "BUHARI at Arise TV: We\u2019ll return to First Republic\u2019s open grazing practice",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the country\u2019s return to open grazing as obtained during the First Republic where herdsmen used designated grazing routes to move their cattle to all parts of the country.\n\nTo this end, the president said he had asked the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), to begin the process of recovering land from persons who have converted cattle grazing routes for their personal use.\n\nBuhari said this during an interview with Arise Television aired Thursday.\n\nHe said the grazing routes were designated in the 1st Republic when \u201cNigerians used to obey laws.\u201d\n\nBuhari was reacting to a question on the decision by 17 southern governors to ban open grazing.\n\nThe AGF had kicked against the declaration by the governors, saying it was like northern governors banning spare part trading, a job synonymous with the south easterners.\n\nWhen asked if he agreed with the AGF\u2019s position, Buhari laughingly responded: \u201cYou want me to contradict my attorney-general? What I did was ask him to go and dig the gazette of the 1st Republic when people were obeying laws. There were cattle routes and grazing areas. Cattle routes were for when they (herdsmen) are moving up country, north to south or east to west, they had to go through there.\n\n\u201cIf you allow your cattle to stray into any farm, you are arrested. The farmer is invited to submit his claims. The khadi or the judge will say pay this amount and if you can\u2019t the cattle is sold. And if there is any benefit, you are given and people were behaving themselves and in the grazing areas, they built dams, put windmills in some places. There were even veterinary departments so that the herders are limited. Their route is known, their grazing area is known.\n\n\u201cBut I am telling you, this rushing to the centre (sic) so I asked for the gazette to make sure that those who encroached on these cattle routes and grazing areas will be dispossessed in law and try to bring some order back into the cattle grazing.\u201d\n\nOn Ortom\n\nHe also lamented the style and utterances of Benue state Governor Samuel Ortom, who had not only implemented an aggressive anti-open grazing law but had accused Buhari of failing to take actions against herdsmen because he is also a member of the Fulani herders.\n\nBuhari said indeed, he is a Fulani man but Ortom was being unfair to him.\n\nThe president said he had told Ortom that the herdsmen perpetrating the attacks were not the Nigerian ones.\n\nThe president further explained that the Tiv, who form the majority in Benue, and the Fulani had been engaged in cultural conflicts for a long time.\n\n\u201cThe problem is trying to understand the culture of the cattle rearers. There is a cultural difference between the Tivs and the Fulanis. So, the governor of Benue said I am not disciplining the cattle rearers because I am one of them.\n\n\u201cI cannot say I am not one of them but he is being very unfair to me and I told him that the Nigerian cattle rearer was not carrying anything more than a stick sometime with a machete to cut some trees and feed his cattle but those sophisticated ones move with AK 47.\n\n\u201cSo, from other areas, people rush to Nigeria you know and Fulanis from Mauritania and Central Africa look the same, so they feel they are the Nigerian ones and I assure you that we are trying to resuscitate these cattle routes, grazing areas and make them accountable,\u201d Buhari said.\n\n$1.9bn Nigeria-Niger Republic railway project\n\nOn the $1.9billion Nigeria-Niger railway project, the president justified the decision, saying it would further strengthen the bond of friendship between the two countries.\n\nHe said borders were arbitrarily drawn by the French colonialists without taking into cognisance the cultural similarities of the people of Niger and Nigeria, pointing out he has first cousins in Niger Republic just like some people in the South-West similarly have cousins in neighbouring Benin Republic.\n\nBesides, the president said the Nigerian government embarked on the project to further boost the friendly relationship with Niger which has helped Nigeria in the insurgency fight.\n\n\u201cIf you recall, when I came, I went to Chad, I went to Niger, I went to Cameroon. Look at what happened with Boko Haram. If we were not in a good relationship with Niger, Chad and Cameroon, Boko Haram would have done worse things to us and you say I am going to Niger.\n\n\u201cI told you the border between us and Niger is 1,500km. And Niger (sic). I spoke to one French man and I had to tell him this. He spoke nonsense and I told him look, in 1885, you sat down and drew lines (boundaries). I said I have first cousins in Niger. There are Kanuris, there are Hausas, there are Fulanis in Niger Republic just as there are Yorubas in Benin. You can\u2019t absolutely cut them off,\u201d the president explained.\n\nBuhari said the new rail would help Nigeria compete with Benin Republic which has cornered entrepot trade in the region.\n\nHe said, Niger, as a landlocked nation, has discovered oil, and \u201cwe want them to come through Nigeria. We want them to send their exports through Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIPOB\n\nConcerning the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and their activities, the president said the group is like a dot in a circle that has nowhere to go.\n\nHe said: \u201cThat IPOB is just like a dot in a circle. Even if they want to exit, they will have no access to anywhere. And the way they are spread all over the country, having businesses and properties, I don\u2019t think IPOB knows what they are talking about.\n\n\u201cIn any case, we say we\u2019ll talk to them in the language that they understand. We\u2019ll organise the police and the military to pursue them.\u201d\n\nHe also said \u201cthe elderly people\u201d and \u201cthe youths\u201d from the South-South part of the country had assured their region had no intention to seceding.\n\nBuhari said IPOB would not have \u201caccess to anywhere\u201d even if they eventually secede from the country.\n\n\u201cI was encouraged by what I heard, nobody told me. Two statements from the south-south. One by the elderly people, they said this time around there would be no (secession). And again the youth made the same statement; such encouragement,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nLG system\n\nOn the local government administration in the country, the president frowned at the way the tier of government was being run, saying it had become almost non-existent in the country.\n\nHe said state governors continued to starve the local governments of funds, saying \u201cin a situation where N300 million is allocated to local government and they are given N100 million is not fair.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the spate of activities by bandits and kidnappers, particularly in the North West and North Central zones, the president said he had given the police and armed forces the instructions to be ruthless with bandits and vandals terrorising innocent citizens across the country.\n\n\u201cProblem in the North-west; you have people over there stealing each other\u2019s cattle and burning each other\u2019s villages. Like I said, we are going to treat them in the language they understand.\n\n\u201cWe have given the police and the military the power to be ruthless. You watch it in a few weeks\u2019 time there will be (a) difference.\n\n\u201cBecause we told them if we keep people away from their farm, we are going to starve. And the government can\u2019t control the public.\n\n\u201cIf you allow hunger, the government is going to be in trouble and we don\u2019t want to be in trouble. We are already in enough trouble. So we warned them, sooner than later, you\u2019ll see the difference,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also dismissed the assertion that majority of Boko Haram members were foreigners, saying his administration had done a lot to fight the terrorists and insurgents but the problem in the \u201cNorth-East is very difficult.\u201d\n\n#EndSARS\n\nSpeaking on last year\u2019s #EndSARS protest against police brutality, the president said it was targeted at removing him from office, even as he said the protest was responsible for the dwindling inflow of foreign direct investment to the country.\n\n\u201cThis question was answered last year when there was the #EndSARS protest. You remember the young people that wanted to march here and remove me?\n\n\u201cTell the young people to behave themselves and make the country safe, then we can attract real investors to the country.\u201d\n\nPDP faults claims on rail project\n\nBut the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) berated President Buhari for allegedly laying claims to projects done by the PDP-led governments.\n\nPDP National Publicity Secretary Kola Ologbondiyan started this while briefing journalists Thursday in Abuja.\n\nHe said rather than \u201caddressing issues and providing direction for our nation, President Buhari allegedly made very provocative comments that could embolden terrorists as well as serve as recipe for further division and violence in the country.\u201d\n\nThe party\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cOn Infrastructure, it is ludicrous to us in the PDP that Mr. President can disingenuously seek to subtract the deliverables achieved by past PDP administration from his so-called achievement on infrastructure.\u201d\n\nOlogbondiyan said Nigerians were also aware that President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was elected on the party\u2019s platform of the PDP, introduced a 25 years national development plan upon assumption of office in 1999.\n\n\u201cThis included the massive construction and expansion of road network, power plants, railways projects, inland and coastal waterways, airports, housing, agricultural and health projects as well as establishment of new universities and other legacy projects in various parts of our country,\u201d he added.\n\nOlogbondiyan further said: \u201cWe want to inform President Buhari, since he is not always aware, that successive governments elected on the platform of the PDP built on these development plans leading to the expansion of major trunk roads across our country, railways and other legacy projects which, probably, his handlers are making him to believe are his.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that President Goodluck Jonathan also took on a massive expansion of our international and domestic airports, across the country, built and commissioned railway stations.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to state that where projects were yet to be completed, it is only a natural occurrence for any Nigerian elected as President to proceed, in the national interest, to complete such projects.\n\n\u201cThe PDP therefore considers it tacky for Mr. President to seek to claim any credit for projects he never conceptualized, commenced or built to near completion, just because he found himself in office at the point of completion.\u201d",

          "text": "Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna state has urged security agencies to engage in interagency synergy and collaboration to address the spate of insecurity in Nigeria, if the country is to avoid a looming food crisis.\n\nSpeaking while declaring open the 2021 quarterly meeting of the Directors of the State Commands of the Directorate of State Security (DSS) in the Northwest on Thursday in Kaduna, el-Rufai said, if Nigeria was to avoid food crisis, finding immediate and enduring solution to the spate of kidnapping, banditry, killings, herders-farmers clashes is key, to enable farmers return to their farms in the advent of the rains.\n\nAccording to the governor, there is immense security challenges across the Northwest states, which have led to devastation of rural economy, displacement of farmers from their communities, loss of lives and properties and travel challenge.\n\n\u201cAddressing this grave problem and restoring order require that security managers and intelligence agencies constantly share information and experiences. These criminals operate across state lines. Therefore, tackling them requires cooperation and collaboration by the various states. Any plan that seeks to address the problem only in one state will at best yield a temporary respite as the criminals retreat to safe havens.\n\n\u201cThis is an urgent priority, in the face of the looming food crisis that we face if our farmers do not go to the farms. The rains are here, but farmers in various communities are unable to go to their farms, that is when they are lucky not to have fled their remote villages under pressure and attacks from the criminals. This cannot be allowed to continue.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe security agencies need to strengthen intelligence gathering, to establish not just the identities, plans and locations of these criminals, but to actively disrupt their capacity to organise and mount attacks on our citizens. It is also very important to ensure that prompt and coordinated action becomes the default response of the Armed Forces and the Police to the profusion of actionable intelligence that is already available from the DSS,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on how the criminals gained this much ground, el-Rufai said, \u201cthe governors of the Northwest states and Niger state as far back as 2015 came together to fund simultaneous operations by the federal military and security agencies across the largely ungoverned Kamuku-Kuyambana forest swathes that straddle about seven of our states up to Dajin Rugu in Katsina state.\n\n\u201cThese operations disrupted the cattle rustling gangs but were unfortunately not sustained as a continuous exercise to dominate these spaces and assert within them the authority of the Nigerian state. That the criminal gangs have become more daring and dangerous since recovering from their near defeat in 2015 is obvious across the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the lead agency for domestic intelligence and counterintelligence, the Department of State Services has a vital role to play in providing the reliable information needed by the Police and Armed Forces and other security agencies for the total defeat of these dangerous insurgents,\u201d el-Rufai said.\n\nThe Kaduna state Director of State Service, Alhaji Idris Koya said the quarterly \u201cmeeting was originated by the Director General, State Service, Alhaji Yusuf Magaji Bichi to enable the State Directors regularly come together and brainstorm on the changing spate of insecurity bedeviling the Northwest, exchange ideas and proffer possible solutions that would aid in containing contemporary threats, effectively efficiently and with minimum cost.\n\n\u201cThe region is currently confronted by security threats of kidnapping, armed banditry, insurgency, Farmers/herders conflicts, arms trafficking and several other contemporary security issues that require concerted effort to address, including the pivotal input of the respective state governments.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe current efforts by the state government to establish a drone centre for intelligence gathering and support of other security operations is highly commendable and it is our hope that it will come into service soon as it will be a game changer in tackling security challenges not only in Kaduna state but the Northwest and even Northcentral zones.\u201d\n\nThe Kaduna state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr Samuel Aruwan, said criminals, bandits and terrorists are collaborating to a devastating effect on the people of the state, noting that if there had been more robust collaboration among the security agencies, several serious attacks would have been prevented.",

          "text": "*As Senate donates truckload of items worth N10m\n\nSenate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan has appealed to Nigerians in leadership positions to always show empathy to the Internally Displaced Persons, IDPs in the country by ensuring that their lives and dignity are protected.\n\nLawan, who spoke yesterday when he led a delegation of senators to the Wasa IDP camp in southern Abuja to commemorate the 2nd year anniversary of the Ninth Assembly, said the planned visit was a conscious and collective decision of the upper legislative chamber.\n\nThe Senate delegation during the visit donated food items and other materials worth N10 million to the IDPs.\n\nLawan said: \u201cThis is an Internally Displaced Persons Camp. None of our sisters and brothers in this camp wanted to be here or wish to be here.\n\n\u201cAll of them are forced to be in an IDP camp, and those of use especially in leadership positions are supposed to show empathy and commitment in ensuring that while there our compatriots are in this camp and, indeed, any other camp, their life and dignity is protected.\n\n\u201c(And) of course, I\u2019d like to mention here that we must ensure that these Nigerians who are in this camp and other refugee camps, who are vulnerable in so many ways, receive what is due to them from the government.\n\n\u201cThat is to say, there must be sufficient security presence here and, indeed, across the country to protect them.\n\n\u201c(But) they also need the government to do what is right. We are supposed to as a government provide some livelihood here. We must be able to give them something to eat, and we should do so responsibly.\n\n\u201cWhen I use the word responsibly, I mean not to throw away a few things and leave them to eke a living, because it is going to be impossible for these people here to eke any meaningful living on their own.\n\n\u201cThis is a price we have to pay because of the security situation we have found ourselves in. Food alone is not enough.\n\n\u201cSo, we will take particular interest in the health facilities available to this camp and, indeed, others.\n\n\u201cWe would like to know the details of how and when they fall sick from a major sickness that would go beyond the capacity of primary health care \u2013 that requires a secondary health care intervention.\n\n\u201cWe have a national policy on refugees and people in camps like these, how are we up-to-date with the implementation of the provisions of that national policy? It may sound too hard, but they are necessary questions and we owe these people.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President added that the amendment to the Electoral Act by the National Assembly seeks to provide an electoral climate that would enable Nigerians to elect their leaders and representatives.\n\nHe explained further that the review of the Constitution by the Ninth Assembly is aimed at ensuring that governance is improved in the country.\n\nAccording to him, this can be realized through the provision of a legal framework that would provide for good governance at all levels of government.\n\nLawan disclosed that the National Assembly has been working closely with the executive arm of government to provide more resources to the armed forces and security agencies in the fight against insecurity.\n\nHe gave the assurances of the National Assembly to expedite action on the request when received, so as to ensure the return of internally displaced persons to their respective communities across the country.",

          "text": "Onicha Ugbo indigene, Eze Asia has disowned a purported voice conversation with Azuka Jebose on Idumuje Ugboko crisis.\n\nSpeaking from Turkey where he resides, Asia dismissed the voice notes in circulation by Azuka as fake and labeled him serial blackmailer\n\nBelow is a recorded voice message along with transcript of Asia\u2018s rejoinder disclaiming any audio chat with Azuka.\n\n\u201cThe recorded voice sent to social media and everywhere, I was not the one who recorded it. Azuka Jebose did it, because the first time I traveled down here (Turkey) was after three days he called me on phone.\n\n\u201cHe was asking me some certain things \u2013 how they went to Ugboko; how they killed somebody from Kogi or something like that; asking me how somebody died in swimming pool; asking how they killed Onicha Ugbo people and I was there. I replied him. I said Azuka, you are a very useless man. How do you think they will kill an Onicha Ugbo man when I am working with Hon. Prince Ned Nwoko and I will keep quite?\n\n\u201cBut he said that they said Ned always sends us. I said you said they said, is he a military man? And that if people are telling you things concerning Ned and you are writing it and you did not verify, you are wasting your time; that everybody is aware; that you are asking me that during the time of Ugboko crisis we mobilised our men to go there and destroy. I said Azuka, bros, it\u2019s like you want enough insult\u2026you are a useless man. During the time of the crisis at Ugboko, I was in the hospital, lying down in the hospital.\n\n\u201cThis young man you are asking me that we should blackmail and let\u2019s plan together and write against him, that if not for this man I would have been a dead man by now. If Ned did not spend money on me during the time I was lying down at the hospital, he spent nothing less than N5million\u2026concerning my leg issue.\n\n\u201cYou are asking me now to give you information. Somebody in the hospital, can I fly in the hospital to come tell you what happened in Ugboko; am I (a) witch? If something happened in Ugboko, I was not aware. The way they told you was the way I heard it. Before you write against somebody you have to verify well. Like the way you are Azuka Jebose, somebody will come and meet me because I am from Onitcha Ugbo, because I know you, I should come and tell them bad things about you; what will I tell them?\n\n\u201cOkay you want me to start telling you things about Ned, like what you said that you want to nail Ned. You want to destroy his political career; that you want to do many things. Has Ned ever one day called me to go and kill somebody? Ned cannot send me to go and kill somebody\u2026 I am not a thug and he is not using me as a thug.\n\n\u201cThis young man you are accusing, if not because of Ned I wouldn\u2019t have been here (Turkey) today. He was the one who assisted me with money to leave the country. So what do you want me to tell you about him? You were asking me that somebody died in the swimming pool and how can I be from Onicha Ugbo and such thing happened.\n\n\u201cI said thank God you said I am from Onicha Ugbo and you now feel that I am from Onicha Ugbo and they will kill my own brother in my presence and I will keep quiet; that you are a stupid man. You were asking me about Prince Nonso. I told him, stop putting mouth in things that do not concern you. Nonso and Ned are brothers. The day two of them will settle none of you will be there. Steer clear of a matter you don\u2019t know. I have no business in Ugboko because I am not from Ugboko.\n\n\u201cYou were asking me how did they kill somebody; I was not aware because I was at the hospital. Those people telling you what to write still go and meet them to tell you what to write. By the way, how did you get my number? You were telling me to forget about that one that we should work.\n\n\u201cWhat work?. Working together to blackmail my boss, a man who saved my life; a man who has spent a lot of money on me? That if not for the man Ned Nwoko I would have been a dead man by now. If not for Ned I would not have travelled out. How many youths from Onitcha Ugbo did you help? You said you are a big man, how does it affect me?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know you to start with. I only hear about your name. I don\u2019t know you and I don\u2019t want to know you. So stop telling me that I should come and write against my boss. Because I did not accept what you told me, the next thing, you moved to go and manipulate my name to write against me with my voice. But anything you are doing, God is watching you. God will bear witness\n\n\u201cI will be the last person in this life, this world, that will fight against Ned. Ned has never one day treated me bad. If not for the young man I wouldn\u2019t have been alive today. So you want to spoil my name. You want to destroy my life; you are destroying your life, not me.\n\n\u201cThe voice note you sent to people, I have received it. Thank you very much. But you will also remember that everybody has evidence. Everything you said about Ned was recorded. I reserved my comment for now, till then. May God keep us alive; but anybody planning evil for my life or against my family, evil will go back to that person. I never one day planned evil against anybody. If I have offended someone I will be the one to meet the person and say I am sorry. I work on my own; I don\u2019t look for trouble.\n\n\u201cTelling me I should come and write against my Oga, what am I going to tell you. Has he sent me one day to go and destroy? Has he told me to go and do something stupid? What am I going to tell you? A good man, a man of all people. Somebody who is trying to help the community. You are not from there. You are destroying their own community. Go back to your own town. That was what I told you.\n\nYou were asking me about Prince Nonso. Does he know me? The prince knows it was police who arrested him. You were asking me how did we carry prince. Who is the prince? Have I ever one day called Ugboko youths to come out? Have they ever seen me fighting in Ugboko? What am I going to write; something I know or something I don\u2019t know? I will never wish Ned Nwoko evil because he always wished me good luck.\u201d",

Freedom of expression and access to information both online and offline are foundational to prosperous and secure democratic societies,\u201d read a statement posted on the Department of State\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cWe support Nigeria as it works towards unity, peace, and prosperity. As its partner, we call on the government to respect its citizens\u2019 right to freedom of expression by reversing this suspension.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Twitter Deletes Buhari\u2019s \u2018In The Language They Understand\u2019 Tweet\n\nIn a move that has caused ripples across the nation, many Nigerians in the wake of the ban devised several means to bypass the blockade including using Virtual Private Networks (VPN).\n\nNigeria\u2019s Minister of Justice and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami had in a swift reaction ordered the prosecution of people using the social media platform in the country.\n\nBut the US government has faulted the move as well as the National Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s order to broadcast houses in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe United States condemns the ongoing suspension of Twitter by the Nigerian government and subsequent threats to arrest and prosecute Nigerians who use Twitter,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThe United States is likewise concerned that the Nigerian National Broadcasting Commission ordered all television and radio broadcasters to cease using Twitter.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: #TwitterBan: SERAP Drags FG To ECOWAS Court\n\n\u2018You Must Register In Nigeria\u2019\n\nNigeria has one of the largest social media users in Africa. Friday\u2019s ban by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government has triggered a flurry of reactions from far and near.\n\nTop diplomatic missions and rights groups have condemned the move and critics believe it is an attempt to cage the opposition.\n\nREAD ALSO: FG Says It Has Indefinitely Suspended Twitter Operations In Nigeria\n\nWhile the government has met with foreign envoys following the heavy outcry that greeted the suspension, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama says the tech giant is negotiating with the Nigerian government.\n\n\u201cThere are discussions ongoing with Twitter, we will see how that progresses, so I cannot say for now the duration of the suspension,\u201d Onyeama said after a meeting with diplomats over the issue.\n\nInformation and Culture Minister Lai Mohammed who is a leading figure in Nigeria\u2019s battle with the US-based technology firm on Wednesday maintained that social media platforms will be regulated in the country.\n\nHe explained that all social media platforms must be registered before doing business in Africa\u2019s most populous nation.\n\n\u201cWhat we are saying is that for all platforms, you must register in Nigeria. You must be a corporate entity before you can do business in Nigeria,\u201d the minister said after the weekly cabinet meeting in Abuja.\n\n\u201cWhether it is Netflix, Iroko, or Facebook\u2026they are all doing business in Nigeria, making money and they are not paying taxes. This is in addition to being able to regulate them. They are making billions of naira out of this country and they are not paying tax. That can\u2019t be allowed to go on.\u201d",

Despite the many challenges we are facing, I want Nigerians to rest assured that we will secure this country.\n\n\u2018\u2018We will secure our infrastructure, our highways, our communities, and our forests, and we will secure the lives of our people,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Maritime Crimes: Buhari Inaugurates New Security Assets To Combat Piracy\n\nThe President told members of the Nigeria Police that as the government strives to improve their welfare and capacity, the citizens equally had expectations from them.\n\n\u2018\u2018First, let me commend the Inspector-General of Police and the entire Force for the recent efforts to restore peace to troubled parts of the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have charged the Inspector-General to leave no stone unturned in rebuilding the morale of his officers and men, especially in the aftermath of the mindless violence associated with the EndSARS protests, as well as the recent spate of attacks on Police Stations in some parts of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nCommending the Lagos Governor on the newly acquired security equipment and assets, the President noted that it would go a long way in boosting the morale of the Police, and further enhance their capacity to fight crime and combat criminality.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is even more touching in the light of the unwarranted violence that ensued in the wake of the ENDSARS protests last October, which saw the security architecture in Lagos State being severely damaged,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President added that it was commendable that Lagos State, the Centre of Excellence, has shown a truly resilient spirit, in the face of the massive destruction it suffered last October.\n\n\u2018\u2018You did not allow yourselves to be deterred by the severe setback; instead you have bounced back and are now boldly rebuilding the confidence of residents and investors in the State.\n\n\u2018\u2018I acknowledge the initiative taken to kick-start the rebuilding process, through the establishment of the Lagos State Rebuild Trust Fund, and through this very laudable effort by the Lagos State Security Trust Fund. I enjoin other State Governments to emulate your bold, proactive and resourceful initiative,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President also used the occasion to reiterate that the \u2018\u2018Federal Government takes very seriously our constitutional oath to secure the lives and properties of the Nigerian people, adding that his administration was conscious of the fact that lasting security is a necessary foundation for business, investment, and true prosperity.\n\nPresident Buhari declared that no Federal government since 1999 has been as committed as his administration in reforming and repositioning the Nigeria Police Force and national policing architecture.\n\n\u2018\u2018In 2019, I signed into law the Act establishing the Nigeria Police Trust Fund, the first in the history of the Force, to provide guaranteed funding to support Police welfare, logistics, and equipment.\n\n\u2018\u2018In September 2020, I assented to the Bill amending the Nigeria Police Act, which was originally enacted in 1943.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new Act, a vast improvement over the old one, among other things spells out the modalities for the implementation of a National Community Policing Scheme in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new scheme will build confidence within our local communities and make them active stakeholders in the safety and security of their environs.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are currently recruiting 10,000 new Police officers to reinforce our personnel capacity across the country. In addition to this, I have directed the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission to carry out an upward review of Police salaries and benefits,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
