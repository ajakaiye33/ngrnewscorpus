          "text": "The Coalition of Northern Groups, on Monday, expressed sadness over the death of Kano politician and former candidate of the National Republican Convention on the June 12, 1993, presidential election, Alhaji Bashir Othman Tofa, describing him as \u201ca great statesman and mentor.\u201d\n\nThe CNG in a condolence message issued by its spokesperson, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, said it owed immeasurable gratitude to the late Bashir Tofa whose leadership, sacrifice, statesmanship, patriotism and unwavering commitment to the interests of the people of Northern Nigeria and citizens of Nigeria as a whole has few parallels.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe mourn the passing of this great man from whose life and works we have drawn inspiration and we must strive, in all we do, to live by the personal and social values and standards he lived and set for himself.\u201d\n\nThe late Tofa, Suleiman said, was \u201ca passionate believer of the organic links between generations who was always available for young people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe North certainly lost a great statesman, but the youth lost a mentor, a guardian, a living history and an embodiment of all the exemplary qualities young Northerners should strive to achieve.\n\n\u201cWe pray the Almighty Allah to overlook his shortcomings, forgive his gentle soul, admit him to Jannah and grant his family the fortitude to bear the loss\u201d, CNG said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The University College Hospital, Ibadan has narrated that the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji, died at the Intensive Care Unit of the hospital at 01.15 am.\n\nThe hospital in a statement by its Deputy Director of Information and Public Relations Officer, Toye Akinrinola, said the monarch was referred to UCH from a private hospital in Ibadan about 9.30 pm on Saturday.\n\nAccording to Akinrinola, the Chief Medical Director CMD, Prof. Jesse Abiodun Otegbayo, immediately directed a high-powered medical team to provide medical treatment to the late monarch.\n\nThe CMD was said to write the Governor, Seyi Makinde, to inform him of Olubadan\u2019s death.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe Olubadan of Ibadanland, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji, Aje Oguguniso 1, on January 2, 2022, passed on at the Intensive Care Unit of the University College Hospital, Ibadan at 1.15 am.\n\n\u201cThe late Monarch was referred to the UCH from a private hospital in Ibadan at about 9.30 pm yesterday. \u201cHe was immediately admitted at the ICU where the Chief Medical Director CMD, Professor Jesse Abiodun Otegbayo directed that a high-powered medical team be constituted to provide the best medical treatment to him.\n\n\u201cBy 1.15 am today, His Imperial Majesty breathed his last breath.\n\n\u201cThe CMD was at the ICU in the early hours of today to pay the late Olubadan his last respect.\n\n\u201cAfterward, the CMD wrote a letter of notification of the demise of the revered Monarch to His Excellency Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State which was received by the Permanent Secretary of the Oyo State Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Matters, Dr. Bashiru Olanrewaju on behalf of the Oyo State Government. A similar letter was written to the Family of the departed Olubadan.\n\n\u201cThe CMD further ensured that the remains of the late Monarch were taken care of in a manner befitting to the late Olubadan.\n\n\u201cProfessor Otegbayo also escorted the corpse of Oba Adetunji from the ICU to a waiting ambulance and handed the corpse to the family and other dignitaries on the ground.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Vice-Chancellor, University of Ibadan, Prof. Kayode Adebowale, commiserated with the immediate family, good and progressive people of Ibadanland, Oyo State, and Nigeria on the death of Adetunji.\n\nHe described Oba Adetunji as a pillar of support to the University, who indeed, never missed an opportunity to offer wise counsel and words of support for the progress of the institution.\n\nThe VC noted that Oba Adetunji was an enthusiastic investor and consummate people manager who contributed immensely to the success of many Nigerians.\n\nAdebowale said, \u201cMy last engagement with Oba Adetunji was on 16 November, 2021, when he received our Chancellor and Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, on a courtesy call, in his Popoyemoja Palace. Kabiyesi demonstrated that he was UI\u2019s father and Chief Landlord. UI was, indeed, honoured and celebrated on that memorable visit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI must say, Kabiyesi Adetunji lived humbly; served humbly; came loving; lived loving; and served loving.\n\n\u201cOba Adetunji knew how to serve God; how to serve humanity; how to lead humanity: how to serve others; how to lead others; how to assist others; how to develop others and how to mentor others. He had the true formula of how to lead the community and society. He was a leader of leaders.\n\nFor Prof. Adebowale, \u201cOur consolation lies in the great deeds of the late Olubadan which are engraved unforgettably in the hearts of women and men. Such deeds, which knew no ethnic or religious boundaries, bear clear testimony to the late Olubadan\u2019s triumph over death.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the governing council, management, staff, and students of the University of Ibadan, we sincerely commiserate with the Governor of Oyo State, Engr. Seyi Makinde, the immediate family of the late Olubadan, Olubadan-in-Council, Central Council of Ibadan Indigenes (CCII), and all Ibadan indigenes and residents.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Lekan Balogun tipped as successor as Olubadan dies",
          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nThe traditional structure of ascension to the throne of Olubadan ohas been well-arranged such that it is seamless. The chieftaincy system makes the royal succession tradition largely free from rancour, litigation and usurpation. Any male child title-holder of the metropolitan centre of Ibadan is a potential king.\n\nIn Ibadanland, the two ruling lines are the \u2018Egbe Agba\u2019 (civil) and \u2018Balogun\u2019 (military) from where Olubadans are appointed on rotational basis to occupy the stool on the demise of a monarch.\n\nThe two high chiefs that are next in rank to the Olubadan from the two lines are the Otun Olubadan and Balogun of Ibadanland. The duo are recognised as second-class traditional rulers under the Western Nigeria Law.\n\nThe fact that Oba Adetunji was produced by the Balogun Lineage has automatically positioned the Otun Lineage to produce the next Olubadan. And the most senior chief is Senator Lekan Balogun, who was in the Senate for Oyo Central from 1999 to 2003.\n\nSince the news broke that Oba Adetunji has joined his ancestors, it was a sort of mourning of the departed soul at Popoyemoja Compound of the monarch. But at Ali-Iwo Compound of Senator Balogun, it has been jubilation galore that it is time for one of their own to occupy the stool as long as God allows him to live.\n\nIn an interview with Daily Sun in May 2017, Balogun said: \u201cWhen I became Mogaji of Ali Iwo Compound, there were a lot of much older people, whose kids were even older than me. My compound used to produce the oldest person as Mogaji before my time. Yet, these people insisted I should be made Mogaji in the late 1970s. The Olubadan that we have produced so far \u2013 Ali Iwo I, reigned for three months as Olubadan. If I make it to the throne of Olubadan, I will be Ali Iwo II. After I became Mogaji, many young and educated men have been made Mogajis, which is the self reforming nature of the Olubadan chieftaincy system.\u201d\n\nDaily Sun, however, enquired from the Ekefa Olubadan, Oloye Lekan Alabi, how long it usually takes for new Olubadan to be installed after the demise of a monarch. He answered by saying Olubadan-in-Council, which is the body of kingmakers, comprising the 11 High Chiefs and Iyalode of Ibadanland, would meet and decide when a new Olubadan would emerge.\n\nHe explained that the usual practice has always been that the Olubadan-in-Council would meet and commiserate with the bereaved royal family, and would select the successor that is always known. He added that what the council would do would only be ratification of the next in rank to the late occupier of the throne. The council, he said, would then make recommendation to the state government for approval. After the approval, a date would then be set for installation ceremony.\n\nThe Laws of Oyo State of Nigeria 2000 Cap 28 spell out the power of the governor in relation to the appointment of recognised chieftaincies in the state. Irrespective of recommendation from the kingmakers, the laws empower the governor to pick among four most senior chiefs on the line, whose turn it is to produce Olubadan, based on certain parameters, such that the candidate for the throne must not be suffering from any serious physical infirmity, must not be a lunatic and must not be an ex-convict. But no governor in the state has ever changed the ratification made by the Olubadan-in-Council.\n\nIn this instance, the four most senior chiefs on the Otun Line are Senator Balogun as the Otun Olubadan; Senator Rashidi Ladoja, former governor of Oyo State, as Osi Olubadan; Eddy Oyewole as Ashipa Olubadan and Abiodun Kola-Daisi, as Ekerin Olubadan. Every chief on the Otun Line has to ascend 22 steps and every chief on the Balogun Line has to climb 23 steps to occupy the stool. It usually takes decades to groom an Olubadan for the stool through the stages of chieftaincy promotion, which is an average of 35 to 40 years.\n\nJagun is the first step on the two lines that produce Olubadan on rotational basis. But for a chief to become Jagun on either of the two lines, he must have been a \u2018Mogaji\u2019 (compound head) . Mogajis are installed by reigning Olubadan, and there are about 500 mogajis at present.\n\nOlubadan died 2 months to 6th coronation anniversary\n\nOba Adetunji, Aje Ogungunniso I, joined his ancestors at the age of 93, barely two months to the celebration of his sixth coronation anniversary, having been crowned on March 4, 2016.\n\nPersonal Assistant/Director of Public Affairs to the late monarch, Mr. Adeola Oloko, said his principal was hospitalised for five days before he joined his ancestors.\n\nIn an interview with journalists in his office at the Popoyemoja palace of Oba Adetunji, yesterday, Oloko said the late paramount ruler was initially hospitalised at a private hospital for five days, before he was rushed to the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, by 9:30pm on Saturday January 1, 2022 for enhanced medical attention.\n\n\u201cIt was a brief illness. At about 9pm on Saturday, he was taken to UCH, Ibadan. After four hours at UCH, which was 1a.m., he joined his ancestors. He was aged 93 years. May God repose his soul.\u201d\n\nOloko, however, cleared the speculation that Oba Adetunji, who celebrated his 93rd birthday in August 2021, died of COVID-19, saying: \u201cOlubadan did not die of COVID-19. If he was infected, his corpse would not be brought to the palace. The scores of sympathisers here would not be allowed into the premises. You journalists would not even come here. So, COVID-19 did not kill him.\u201d\n\nThe remains of the late monarch were conveyed to the palace in an ambulance of the UCH, yesterday morning. However, the Chief Medical Director of UCH, Prof Abiodun Otegbayo, in a statement by Mr. Toye Akinrinlola, deputy director of Information and Public Relations Officer, said Oba Adetunji passed on at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at 1.15 a.m., adding that the late monarch was referred to the UCH from a private hospital in Ibadan at about 9.30 pm on Saturday. He was immediately admitted to the ICU where Prof. Otegbayo directed that a high-powered medical team be constituted to provide the best medical treatment to him. By 1:15 am, yesterday, the king breathed his last breath.\n\nThe corpse of Oba Adetunji, was committed to mother earth within the premises of his palace at Popoyemoja, Ibadan at about 4pm yesterday following. a fidau prayer, led by the Chief Imam of Ibadanland, Sheikh Abdul-Ganiy Agbotomokekere, held at the popular Mapo Hall, Ibadan.\n\nDeputy Governor Rauf Olaniyan led the government delegation to the funeral ceremony.\n\nAll markets in Ibadanland close\n\nThe Babaloja-General of Oyo State, Alhaji Yekini Abass Oladapo, has announced the closure of all markets in Ibadanland today in honour of the late Olubadan.\n\nThe decision was taken at an emergency meeting of council of market leaders in the state presided over by Oladapo (YK Abass).\n\n\u201cThe council agreed that all market in Ibadanland should be closed on Monday 3rd January, 2022 to honour the demise of the paramount ruler of Ibadanland,\u201d he said.\n\nOladapo noted that the contributions of Oba Adetunji to the development of Ibadanland prompted markets in the state to witness patronage.\n\nThe market leaders commiserated with all sons and daughters of Ibadanland, the Oyo State Government, being led by Governor Seyi Makinde, the Central Council of Ibadan Indigenes (CCII), the state Traditional Council, Olubadan-in-Council and the queen, Olori Rasheedat Adetunji, over the demise of monarch.\n\nBuhari, Kalu, Tinubu, Dare pour tributes, encomiums\n\nEminent Nigerians have paid glowing tributes on the late Olubadan.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari described him as a visionary and compassionate leader, who used the spheres of his influence as a respected traditional ruler and a lover of the creative industry to advance the progress of his people, encouraging and motivating them to give their best in their vocation and to the nation.\n\nAccording to a statement by Mr. Femi Adesina, Buhari said the monarch\u2019s demise understandably leaves a huge void to fill and urged the people of Ibadan and Nigerians from different walks of life to honour the eternal memory of the deceased by imbibing the virtues he cherished so much: generosity, peace, tolerance and devotion to unity.\n\nBuhari, in his condolence message to the government and people of Oyo State, the Royal Family, the Olubadan-in-council and the people of Ibadan, assured that the process of selecting his successor would be guided by wisdom, understanding and good judgment that exemplified the life he lived.\n\nIn his reaction, former governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu described the demise of Olubadan as a huge loss to the nation.\n\nKalu, while acknowledging the noble roles played by the late monarch in promoting peaceful co-existence among all ethnic groups in Ibadanland, stressed that Oba Adetunji lived a purposeful life dedicated to the service of humanity.\n\nIn his condolence message, Kalu, who is Ashipa Seriki Mayegun of Ibadanland conveyed his heartfelt condolences to the people of Ibadanland.\n\n\u201cThe demise of Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji, is a big loss to the nation.\n\n\u201cThe late monarch was a rallying point for the people of Ibadanland. He contributed to nation building in various capacities. The late traditional ruler lived a fulfilled life and left behind good legacies for his loved ones to sustain.\u201d\n\nThe Ashipa Seriki Mayegun of Ibadanland prayed to Allah to make Al- Jannah Firdaus the final abode for the late monarch and give the people of Ibadanland the fortitude to bear the loss.\n\nSimilarly, the All Progressives Congress National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, described the late Oba Adetunji as humble, humane, mature, calm and decent, always a symbol of unruffled dignity.\n\nIn a condolence message released by his Media Office and signed by Mr. Tunde Rahman, Asiwaju Tinubu said:\n\n\u201cThe late Olubadan was a sage. He was humble, humane, mature, calm and decent, always a symbol of unruffled dignity.\n\n\u201cBefore he mounted the throne, Oba Adetunji had made his name as a successful businessman and music and entertainment promoter who contributed a lot to uplift the careers of many top musicians in the land, thus contributing his quota to the growth of our country\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cOn the throne, the late Olubadan worked assiduously for peace and stability of not only Ibadanland, Oyo State and Yorubaland, but also the entire country. He superintended over the ancient city with even-handedness.\u201d\n\nMinister of Youth and Sports Development, Chief Sunday Dare, in his message of condolence, said he had fond recollections of the late Olubadan as a warm, sociable, peaceful and progress loving father who was always interested in the growth and progress of people without minding where they come from.\n\n\u201cI am highly delighted that my path crossed with that of the late Olubadan and I want to say, meeting and having a good relationship him is a thing that I will cherish for the rest of my life. I will miss him sorely, but I take solace in the fact that Baba was a great success as a merchant, an unblemished actor as a socialite and a grand success as the 41st Olubadan of Ibadan land.\u201d\n\nMakinde, Ortom, Oke, Adams, others mourn Olubadan\n\nGovernors Seyi Makinde of Oyo State and Samuel Ortom of Benue State, Speaker of Oyo State House of Assembly, Adebo Ogundoyin; President of The Sword of the Spirit Ministries and President, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Bishop Wale Oke; the Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, also extolled the virtues of the late Oba Adetunji.\n\nGovernor Makinde described him as a great leader of his people and an exemplary royal father, whose demise was painful despite his old age, adding that his wisdom and wealth of experience would be sorely missed.\n\nA statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, quoted the governor as saying Kabiyesi gave his all to see that Ibadanland is developed and took its pride of place as one of the major cities in Africa.\n\nBenue State Governor, Samuel Ortom said his passage came at a time his wealth of experience garnered over the years, his immense wisdom, and his commitment to a united and greater Nigeria with a better Oyo State are unrivalled.\n\nBishop Wale Oke noted that his era ushered in progress, stability and peace to Ibadanland, its environs, the state and the country and implored the legacy of his good works must not be allowed to die in whatever form.\n\nIn the same vein, the Iba Gani Adams said the demise of the first class monarch has robbed Nigeria and the entire Yorubaland of a mature and peaceful monarch.\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Kehinde Aderemi, the Aare-Onakakanfo said the late monarch was mostly loved by sons and daughters of Ibadanland, having the most peaceful reign in Ibadan in recent times.\n\nSpeaker of Oyo State House of Assembly, Ogundoyin, in a condolence message, described the passage as shocking and unbelievable while House of Representatives member, Tolulope Akande-Sadipe, described him as a brave and courageous leader.\n\nShe noted that the late monarch led his people with utmost diligence and unassuming dedication, commending his strong adherence for peace, progress and development.\n\n\u201cKabiyesi lived a very value-added and meaningful life ascending the throne in 2016. Prior to that he had a fruitful fashion designing business and his music label promoted the likes of famous musicians such Wasiu Ayinde Marshal and Dauda Epo Akara.\u201d",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu , Romanus Ugwu, Godwin Tsa, Abuja, Sola Ojo, Kaduna, Sunday Ani and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has been challenged to go beyond \u201cmere rhetoric\u201d and muster political will to end insecurity and immediately restore peace and prosperity across the country.\n\nThe Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), the Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere and the Arewa Consultative Forum were among groups and individuals who, yesterday, advised the APC-led Federal Government on what to do to bring about peace as the New Year dawns.\n\nSpecifically, the MBF decried the plight of people of the Middle Belt who have continued to suffer severe and persistent attacks from marauding gangs of murderous herdsmen. It said it would no longer tolerate the destruction of communities and unprovoked killings of defenceless citizens.\n\n\u201cThese killings have become the trend in many parts of the Middle Belt region of southern Kaduna, Niger, Plateau, Benue, Adamawa, among others. In Damboa Local Government Area of Southern Borno, Boko Haram elements have completely taken over the LGA in the past three years without any challenge from security personnel. It is from Damboa LGA that Boko Haram launches attacks on communities, including the recent attack that killed a military general. Allowing the terrorist organisation to mount roadblocks in any part of Nigeria amounts to telling the world that there are two sovereignties in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn the New Year, we call on President Muhammadu Buhari to send a clear message to the security forces to defeat Boko Haram and throw them out of Damboa LGA. The destruction of our communities and the unprovoked killings of defenceless citizens can no longer be tolerated. When innocent and vulnerable people are left unprotected from the terror of criminals, there can be no option left than self-defence,\u201d Its National President, Dr. Pogu Bitrus, in a statement, yesterday.\n\nThe forum called on relevant security agencies not to relent in cleansing the Middle Belt communities of terrorists who take pleasure in kidnapping, destroying communities and dislocating people. It said the continuous wielding of arms by criminals in daylight to intimidate locals must be stopped in order to protect communities and not force then to embrace self-defence.\n\n\u201cWe do not need a prophet to warn us of the dire consequences of what this massive displacement of our farming population holds for our people. In the face of these severe attacks that have not attracted commensurate responses from the security personnel, we call on security agencies to smoke out these murderous bandits from their holes and bring them to justice. As an umbrella organisation of ethnic nationalities in the Middle Belt Region, we call on President Buhari to swiftly order the security agencies to stop the human carnage ripping across Nigeria, especially in the Middle Belt.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze\u2019s message on how to restore sanity in the country, according to its National Publicity Secretary, Alex Chiedozie Ogbonna, is in two forms.\n\n\u201cFirst, he should ask himself a question on how he wants to be remembered when he leaves office; second, he should do to the South East what Obasanjo did to the North West when he said it was their turn to produce the president.\n\n\u201cHe should also say it is the turn of the Igbo to produce the president of Nigeria and with it, there will be peace in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ogbonna also identified poverty and injustice as Nigerians\u2019 major problems, stressing that if President Buhari supports a president from Igboland, he would have solved the problem of injustice because such a move would amount to justice.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, said the Buhari administration must use this year and the remaining part of 2023 before its tenure expires to right the wrongs that have occurred since it came to power.\n\n\u201cThe administration must step up efforts in two specific areas \u2013 security and the economy. Various parts of the country are experiencing unprecedented insecurity. Kidnapping in the manner we have never had it is rampant everywhere. The welfare of Nigerians has gone down so low.\n\n\u201cThe president must ensure the security agencies are empowered to secure Nigerians. It should no longer be a matter of \u2018we are on top of the situation.\u2019 So far, the issue of security has been mere rhetoric and that is why kidnappers and those claiming territory are having a field day. It is not acceptable and the government must do something about it. The government has to give these people an ultimatum to lay down their weapons, and if they refuse, the government should be able to deal appropriately with them.\u201d\n\nFormer Secretary-General of ACF, Anthony NZ Sani, said unless and until the Nigerian elite come together to be a part of the solution, Nigeria\u2019s problems would persist as no president can address it alone.\n\nHe disagreed with Katsina State Governor, Aminu Masari, on communities bearing arms to defend themselves against bandits\u2019 attacks.\n\n\u201cAllowing communities to bear arms may not be helpful because even America which is 245 years old is grappling to roll back the law that allows citizens free access to arms that has turned out not to be a blessing but a curse that kills Americans every year.\n\n\u201cA developing Nigeria cannot afford such a situation. It is better to have enough and well trained and equipped security personnel who are motivated to secure the nation\u201d, he noted.\n\nSolution to insecurity must dominate APC Natl convention \u2013 Govs DG\n\nDirector-General of the APC Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Dr Salihu Lukman, challenged leaders of the party to prioritise finding solutions to security challenges at its February national convention.\n\nLukman in a statement titled: \u201cIssues for successful APC National Convention\u201d said: \u201cAs a party preparing for its national convention in February 2022, we must appeal to APC leaders to include debate about what needs to be done by all APC government to mobilise the support of Nigerians to bring to an immediate end the current national security challenge in the country.\n\n\u201cAs a party, APC needs to do everything necessary to refocus national debates towards strengthening the initiatives of President Buhari-led government to produce the desired outcome of securing the country. Strengthening the capacity of APC-led Federal Government to produce the desired outcome, in the short run is about massive recruitment of police and military personnel in the country, in addition to the investment that has been made towards procurement of arms, including the A-29 Tucano jets. In the long run, it is about providing good conditions of service and sustainable funding framework for the operation of police and security services in the country.\u201d",

          "text": "*Blames anomaly on weak internal control system at Force Headquarters\n\nUdora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe Office of the Auditor General for the Federation (OAuGF) has disclosed that about 178,459 different types of arms and ammunition got missing from the Nigeria Police armoury in 2019, without any trace or formal report on their whereabouts. Of the figure, 88,078 were AK-47 rifles and 3,907 assorted rifles and pistols from different formations nationwide. These could not be accounted for as at January 2020.\n\nDetails of the missing arms were contained on pages 383 to 391 of the Auditor General for the Federation\u2019s annual report on non-compliance, internal control weaknesses issues in Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of the Federal Government of Nigeria for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was submitted to the National Assembly.\n\nReferenced AuGF/AR.2019/02, the report seen by THISDAY at the weekend, was dated September 15, 2021, signed by the Auditor General for the Federation, Adolphus Aghughu, and addressed to the Clerk to the National Assembly.\n\nThe report accused the Nigeria Police headquarters of lacking comprehensive details of unserviceable weapons, lamenting that such could fall into unauthorised hands for illegal use. It stated that the action of the Nigeria Police contravened paragraph 2603 of the Financial Regulations, which stipulates that in the event of any loss of stores, the officer in charge of the store in which the loss occur shall report immediately to the head of department or unit but not later than three days, by the fastest means possible if the loss occurs away from headquarters.\n\nThe AuGF report stated, \u201cAudit observed from the review of Arms Movement Register, Monthly Returns of Arms and Ammunition and Ammunition Register at the Armoury section that a total number of lost firearms as reported as at December 2018 stood at 178,459 pieces.\n\n\u201cOut of this number, 88,078 were AK-47 rifles, 3,907 assorted rifles and pistols across different police formations, which could not be accounted for as at January 2020. Formal report on the loss of firearms through dully completed Treasury Form 146 (loss of stores) were not presented for examination.\n\n\u201cRecords obtained from force armament at the Force headquarters showed 21 Police Mobile Force (PMF) Squadron, Abuja, did not report a single case of missing firearm, whereas, schedule of missing arms obtained from the same PMF showed a total number of forty six (46) missing arms between year 2000 and February 2019.\n\n\u201cThe value of the lost firearms could not be ascertained because no document relating to their cost of acquisition was presented for examination.\n\n\u201cThe above anomalies could be attributed to weaknesses in the internal control system at the Nigeria Police Force Armament. Several numbers of firearms from the review of arm issue register, monthly returns of arms and ammunitions obtained from Force Armament, Force headquarters for various States Commands, Formations, Zonal offices, Training Institutions, squadrons and physical inspection of firearms and ammunition at the Force Headquarters have become unserviceable and dysfunctional.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cSimilarly, returns were not submitted by some Police Training Institutions and some Formations, and Physical verification of firearms and ammunition at the Force Armament, Force Headquarters showed large quantity of damaged and obsolete firearms which needed to be destroyed.\n\n\u201cThe damaged and obsolete firearms and ammunition should be treated in line with Financial Regulations 2618 which requires the destruction to be carried out in such a manner as to render the firearms unusable for their original purpose.\u201d\n\nThe AuGF report also queried the police hierarchy for the award of contracts without evidence of project execution. It revealed that 10 contracts worth N1, 136,715,200.00 were awarded to a single proprietor in the name of different companies with details of the three companies as the same.\n\n\u201cThe three companies did not disclose their relationship in accordance with the fundamental principles of procurement as required by extant regulations,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe report also indicted the Nigeria Police for paying the sum of N924.985 million for 11 contracts involving construction of three units of Gunshot Spotter System, supply of 50 units of Ballistic Roller Trolley and 20 units of Ballistic Mobile Surveillance House in some selected Commands and Formations without evidence of project execution.\n\nThe report, therefore, asked the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, to provide details of the expenditure to the public accounts committees of both Senate and House of Representatives, account for the funds, and answer to other irregularities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u00b7 Seek removal of impediments to doing business in Nigeria\n\n\u00b7 Want government to prioritise forex allocation to manufacturers\n\nDike Onwuamaeze\n\nMembers of the organised private sector (OPS) have advised the federal government to make deliberate efforts to remove impediments to the conduct of business in the country in 2022, especially with respect to clearing of goods at the ports, stressing that its war clearing goods at the country\u2019s seaports.\n\nAlso, following President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s promise to improve foreign exchange (FX) supply to manufacturers this year, the OPS members also appealed to the federal government to remove other hindrances to manufacturing.\n\nIn addition, they supported recent call by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, to strip the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) of the responsibility of revenue collection and generation.\n\nThe OPS advised the federal government to direct efforts toward accelerated industrialisation for the Nigerian economy in 2022.\n\nThe leaders of the real sector spoke in separate chats with THISDAY. They noted that removing hindrances to the activities of manufacturers and other key players in the country\u2019s real sector would enhance productivity, especially as Africa prepares to fully implement the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nSome of the major constraints they asked the government to address included low FX supply and poor electricity to the real sector, challenges at the country\u2019s seaports, and low patronage of made in Nigeria goods.\n\nPresident of the Nigerian Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA), Mr. Taiwo Adeniyi, told THISDAY it was important for government to do everything possible to remove all impediments to industrialisation. Adeniyi said NCS should be freed from the task of being a revenue-generating agency of government.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is important that government should pay attention to industrialisation and do everything possible to remove all the impediments affecting ability do business in this country, like the issue around our ports.\n\n\u201cEven when you struggle to bring in materials, it is war at the port to get them out. The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) is always like never wishing us to clear our goods at a time meant for them to be cleared.\n\n\u201cWe are also calling on the government to begin to consider seriously making customs a non-revenue generating agency. As long as it remains a revenue-generating agency with a target to meet, the NCS will not do its work professionally. Moreover, the NCS should be audited and published.\u201d\n\nAdeniyi also advised the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to fashion out strategy to support manufacturers in the country with improved access to forex.\n\nHe stated, \u201cYes, the president has made a promise to us. But it will remain a promise until it is implemented. What we are pleading is this: let the government prioritise manufacturers in the allocation of the little forex at its disposal.\n\n\u201cIn fairness, the government has been giving us special financing windows. But these windows are in naira. We cannot use naira to buy machines that we need to expand our operation. Most businesses that benefited from these funding were not able to use them because there was no forex.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, Director General of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Mr. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, advised the CBN to expedite the process of unifying exchange rates in the various forex windows in the country. Ajayi-Kadir said stakeholders from the private sector should be nominated to monitor the disbursement of forex by commercial banks to ensure transparent and timeous allocation to bona fide manufacturers.\n\nHe also highlighted the need for government to take steps to relieve manufacturers of the burden of spending over N73 billion annually to provide alternative energy.\n\nAjayi-Kadir said, \u201cSo the immediate step to take in 2022 is for Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to remove all the bottlenecks inhibiting manufacturers\u2019 access to the 2,000 megawatts of stranded electricity, as envisaged under the Eligible Customer Scheme.\n\n\u201cOther measures would include up-scaling efforts at further development of electricity value-chain.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cMinistries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) of government should compulsorily and strictly prioritise the patronage of made in Nigeria items in all their purchases and contracts. For instance, local manufacturers of LPG gas cylinders are specifically designated as priority providers of the 10 million cooking gas cylinders to be procured by the federal government for 12 states in the federation.\u201d\n\nHe also warned that the looming increases in excise and tax rates, especially for carbonated non-alcoholic drinks, dairy products, should be discountenanced, arguing that the manufacturing sector would not be able to accommodate any form of increase.\n\nThe MAN director general added, \u201cAs we approach the actual commencement of trading under the AfCFTA, the government should intentionally support manufacturing by creating the enabling environment, providing trade information through the commercial desks of Nigerian embassies in African countries, and up-scaling the involvement of the private sector in negotiations and implementation processes.\u201d\n\nAccording to Director General of the Nigerian Association of Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), Ambassador Ayo Olukanni, \u201cThe effective implementation of the 2022 Appropriation Act for inclusive economic growth and development should be a top priority. The real challenge is to see how the budget, which has been tagged \u2018Budget of Growth and Sustainability,\u2019 will positively impact the lives of the people and various sectors of the economy.\n\n\u201cWe must ensure that budget 2022 makes a significant impact on the energy sector if it is to be meaningful and be a budget of growth and sustainability.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for The Promotion of Private Enterprises (CPPE), Dr. Muda Yusuf, urged the government to untangle the cargo clearing processes at ports by reducing the number of agencies involved. Yusuf also canvassed the deployment of technology to aid the customs clearing process.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe use of the scanner is particularly very important. It is a sad commentary that the largest economy in Africa has been examining cargoes and containers physically and manually for the past few years. The effect of this on the cost of imports has been humongous.\n\n\u201cThe interest payment on the import, demurrage charges arising from delays, the extra charges by shipping companies, the additional charges by the truck drivers, all of these have put a lot of burden on cost on investors and citizens.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Cost of borrowing in global commodity industry to surge in 2022\n\n*Despite headwinds, Wood Mackenzie predicts over $400bn global spending\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nNigeria\u2019s desire to continue reaping the benefits of its oil and gas resources before the world fully embraces renewables may face serious headwinds this year, with the global finance community tying up over $130 trillion capital to funding carbon-free energy investments.\n\nThis means that funds available for lending to International Oil Companies (IOCs), and by extension the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited which acts as their Joint Venture (JV) partners could be severely curtailed.\n\nNigeria has continued to struggle to ramp up its production volume in the upstream of the country\u2019s oil and gas industry, but had largely failed due to years of under-investment, ageing infrastructure and inability to procure modern equipment to deter incessant oil theft and sabotage.\n\nThe much-needed investment would also enable operators adopt artificial intelligence systems as well as deploy virtual and machine learning in exploration and production.\n\nIn August last year, the country enacted the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) which was expected to stimulate necessary investments in the industry, but that dream appears to be under threat as global financing organisations continue to withdraw funding for fossils in preference for renewable sources of energy.\n\nIn its latest report, Wood Mackenzie, a global energy, research and consultancy group, noted that though the oil and gas sector would continue its rally in 2022, the positive outlook was tempered by concerns about the future of the industry.\n\nIn its oil and gas outlook for 2022, Wood Mackenzie predicted that record cash flows would come under increasing scrutiny as operators would begin to align with their pledges on decarbonisation.\n\nIt further projected that the existing cracks in the fragile service sector would widen and explorers will keep options open for the energy transition.\n\nThrough the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), over $130 trillion of private capital have now been committed to net zero from over 450 firms across 45 countries.\n\nIn its progress report published recently, GFANZ had announced that financial sector commitments to net zero exceeded $130 trillion, a 25-fold increase in the last few years.\n\nThe global funding organisations are committing more funds to renewables include banks, insurers, pension funds, asset managers, export credit agencies and stock exchanges as well as credit rating agencies, index providers and audit firms.\n\n\u201cFinancing oil and gas was getting harder before COP26, but the pressure will ratchet up in 2022. Institutions with over US$130 trillion of capital under management have joined the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero.\n\n\u201c(As we) watch for the pool of backers to shrink, borrowing costs will increase, and project financing for oil will get harder,\u201d the renowned research firm stated.\n\nDespite the upsides for this year, Wood Mackenzie stated that for many stakeholders and even some CEOs, the sector\u2019s risks outweigh the gains, stressing that \u201cthis tension will define 2022.\u201d\n\nAs a follow-up from COP26, the research firm projected that more radical moves to downsize oil and gas will take place, but however noted that, \u201copportunists\u201d could take up the slack and spend more on development and acquisitions.\n\nIt stressed that while lending would not dry up immediately, demand recovery could be halted by new global headwinds including additional Covid-19 variants, derailing prices and the promised wall of cash from upstream.\n\nStressing that oil and gas reinvestment rates remained critical to meeting demand, Wood Mackenzie made a forecast that with capital discipline prevailing, the industry could experience a 9 per cent increase in investment compared to last year.\n\n\u201cA nine per cent year-on-year increase will take spend over $400 billion again in 2022. Despite this, at 40 per cent, the global reinvestment rate will remain near record lows at our forecast price,\u201d it pointed.\n\nAccording to the firm, the focus would be on advantaged barrels, low-breakeven projects and low-carbon deepwater projects, which it noted will dominate greenfield Final Investment Decisions (FIDs).\n\nIt added that most operators would hesitate to sanction projects without short payback periods and low emissions, while companies would allocate more capital to upstream decarbonisation.\n\nIncreased transparency and emissions benchmarking reporting, it said, would put pressure on upstream players, increasing action on decarbonisation.\n\nThe firm noted that while 2021 was a big year for upstream Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), 2022 would be bigger as the world continues its push for cleaner sources of fuel.\n\nIt stated that conventional exploration would follow the disciplined path set in 2021, despite improved prices, forecasting that spend will total $20-$25 billion, led by the oil majors and larger National Oil Companies (NOCs).\n\n\u201cIn 2022, more governments might join those with exploration bans. But they are unlikely to include basins holding substantial prospective resources. Of more concern is the possibility that the development of new discoveries may be prohibited,\u201d Wood Mackenzie noted.\n\nAt a projected 1.86 million barrels daily oil production in the country\u2019s 2021 budget, Nigeria recorded a huge deficit of almost 200 million barrels of the liquid in the first 11 months of last year.\n\nNow unable to meet its Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production allocation for months and with just 12 out of the country\u2019s 53 oil rigs currently active, the oil and gas sector desperately requires huge inflow of these investments to help accelerate the pumping of more oil.\n\nChief Executive Officer, NUPRC, Gbenga Komolafe, who recently attributed the declining production to theft, insecurity, aging facilities, decline in exploration and production enhancement initiatives, noted that Nigeria was aspiring to increase its reserves to 40 billion barrels and raise production to three million barrels per day.\n\nFigures from the NURPC obtained by THISDAY last week indicated that while Nigeria was expected to pump approximately 635 million barrels of oil by November 2021, it only struggled to produce 441 million barrels for the entire period.\n\nAlthough OPEC expects Nigeria to produce 1.683 million bpd in January 2022, meeting that target would be an uphill task as the country has maintained an average of 1.25 million barrels in the last few months.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "OBITUARY: Bashir Tofa, MKO Abiola's opponent who rejected declaration of June 12 as Democracy Day",
          "text": "There is that epochal moment \u2014 a landmark happening that defines a person\u2019s life. Some people are the main characters when this significant moment happens. However, some are outshined by a bigger star in this all-important moment. Bashir Tofa happened to be one in the latter group of individuals who have been relegated to the supporting cast in their own story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen his death was announced on the balmy morning of January 3, 2022, most headlines had Moshood Abiola and the annulled June 12, 1993, presidential election alongside his name. Yet Tofa, who died at 74, is beyond just another \u201copponent\u201d in Nigerian politics but a businessman and industrialist. He was chairman of International Petro-Energy Company (IPEC) and Abba Othman and Sons Limited, and one of the prominent voices against the violence in the northern part of the country.\n\nBACKGROUND AND POLITICAL JOURNEY\n\nTofa was born on June 20, 1947, in Kano, where he had his primary education at Shahuci Junior Primary and City Senior Primary School. From 1962 to 1966, he continued his education at Provincial College in the same city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpon completing his secondary education, Tofa was employed at the Royal Exchange Insurance company, where he worked from 1967 to 1968. He then proceeded to the City of London College for further studies.\n\nIt was in 1976 Tofa began his political journey after he was elected the councillor of Dawakin Tofa LGA in Kano. After a year of stewardship at the local government level, he climbed up the political ladder and was elected a member of the Constituent Assembly.\n\nHe joined the National Party of Nigeria (NPN) and quickly became the party\u2019s national financial secretary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the collapse of the NPN at the end of the second republic, Tofa joined the National Republican Convention (NRC) in 1990.\n\nJUNE 12 ELECTION\n\nDuring the build-up to the 1993 election, Tofa was relatively unknown in other parts of the country except for his base in Kano. Despite the Social Democratic Party (SDP) choosing Abiola, who was popular across the country, Tofa inexplicably was selected NRC candidate ahead of more popular aspirants.\n\nAs the votes started rolling in at polling stations across the country on Election Day, Abiola was racing to an early lead that seemed insurmountable. There were reports that Tofa almost conceded the election. He had told his associates to wait for more results to be declared so that the pattern would be clearer. Suddenly, his tune changed as he demanded an outright cancellation of the election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIbrahim Babangida, then head of state, reportedly bowed to pressure and annulled the election, plunging the country into chaos.\n\nIn 2013, 20 years after that saga, Tofa spoke in a manner suggesting that he did not agree that Abiola actually won. Addressing reporters in Kano, he said: \u201cEvents of June 12 are fiction. Those still celebrating the dead issue have nothing to do with their time. It is for those who don\u2019t have anything to offer this country to move forward that can still be talking about June 12 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIf you have learnt any lesson out of it good, if you have not, keep quiet, let this country make progress, but for one to still be talking about something that occurred 20 years ago is a colossal waste of time.\u201d\n\nREJECTED DECLARATION OF JUNE 12 AS DEMOCRACY DAY\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2018, President Muhammadu Buhari declared June 12 as the new date for the celebration of Nigeria\u2019s Democracy Day, while conferring Abiola with a posthumous Grand Commander of the Federal Republic (GCFR) honour. The federal government, in a statement signed by the president, described Abiola as \u201cthe presumed winner of the June 12, 1993, cancelled elections\u201d.\n\nA few days after the declaration, Tofa called for the \u201creconsideration\u201d of the decision, describing it as a product of \u201csentiment and politics\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhatever may be the prevailing sentiment and politics in Abuja, the idea that June 12 should be the new Democracy Day is also a matter that deserves serious reconsideration,\u201d he had said.\n\nKICKED AGAINST ZONING THE PRESIDENCY\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTofa was one of the few people who spoke against the zoning of the presidency among the regions of the country. The former presidential candidate once described it as \u201ca very divisive and myopic formula\u201d and \u201cutterly undemocratic and unfair to qualified people who have ambitions to lead their country\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have never supported the rotational presidency for the simple fact it is an idea that will never promote unity amongst Nigerians. It is a very divisive and myopic formula. What Nigeria needs is a Nigerian President, not a sectional or zonal President, who is there simply because he/she is from a particular zone or region of the country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor zones to be clamouring for presidency as a do or die affair during each election cycle, is certainly one major factor for the utter disunity we experience in these difficult times. Rotational presidency is utterly undemocratic and unfair to qualified people who have ambitions to lead their country but won\u2019t be availed with the opportunity because they are from the wrong zone at that material time. The shouts of \u2018it must be our turn\u2019 from one or two zones, and \u2018no, it is not\u2019, are the consequence of a rotational presidency, which are very inimical to the unity of this country.\u201d\n\nTHE ABUJA ROUNTABLE\n\nTofa, alongside Attahiru Jega, former INEC chairman, and other northern leaders, created a non-partisan organisation tagged \u2018Abuja Roundtable\u2019, which was to lead engagement with the federal government on the rising security challenges facing the region.\n\nFamily sources said Tofa died at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH) in the early hours of Monday after a brief illness.\n\nHe was said to have been at the intensive care unit (ICU) at the hospital for days but was recovering. He eventually succumbed to the illness.\n\nHe was buried according to Islamic rites on Monday. Funeral prayers were held at his residence in Gandun Albasa, Kano.

          "text": "There is that epochal moment \u2014 a landmark happening that defines a person\u2019s life. Some people are the main characters when this significant moment happens. However, some are outshined by a bigger star in this all-important moment. Bashir Tofa happened to be one in the latter group of individuals who have been relegated to the supporting cast in their own story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen his death was announced on the balmy morning of January 3, 2022, most headlines had Moshood Abiola and the annulled June 12, 1993, presidential election alongside his name. Yet Tofa, who died at 74, is beyond just another \u201copponent\u201d in Nigerian politics but a businessman and industrialist. He was chairman of International Petro-Energy Company (IPEC) and Abba Othman and Sons Limited, and one of the prominent voices against the violence in the northern part of the country.\n\nBACKGROUND AND POLITICAL JOURNEY\n\nTofa was born on June 20, 1947, in Kano, where he had his primary education at Shahuci Junior Primary and City Senior Primary School. From 1962 to 1966, he continued his education at Provincial College in the same city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpon completing his secondary education, Tofa was employed at the Royal Exchange Insurance company, where he worked from 1967 to 1968. He then proceeded to the City of London College for further studies.\n\nIt was in 1976 Tofa began his political journey after he was elected the councillor of Dawakin Tofa LGA in Kano. After a year of stewardship at the local government level, he climbed up the political ladder and was elected a member of the Constituent Assembly.\n\nHe joined the National Party of Nigeria (NPN) and quickly became the party\u2019s national financial secretary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the collapse of the NPN at the end of the second republic, Tofa joined the National Republican Convention (NRC) in 1990.\n\nJUNE 12 ELECTION\n\nDuring the build-up to the 1993 election, Tofa was relatively unknown in other parts of the country except for his base in Kano. Despite the Social Democratic Party (SDP) choosing Abiola, who was popular across the country, Tofa inexplicably was selected NRC candidate ahead of more popular aspirants.\n\nAs the votes started rolling in at polling stations across the country on Election Day, Abiola was racing to an early lead that seemed insurmountable. There were reports that Tofa almost conceded the election. He had told his associates to wait for more results to be declared so that the pattern would be clearer. Suddenly, his tune changed as he demanded an outright cancellation of the election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIbrahim Babangida, then head of state, reportedly bowed to pressure and annulled the election, plunging the country into chaos.\n\nIn 2013, 20 years after that saga, Tofa spoke in a manner suggesting that he did not agree that Abiola actually won. Addressing reporters in Kano, he said: \u201cEvents of June 12 are fiction. Those still celebrating the dead issue have nothing to do with their time.

I was asked to just move somewhere else other than Adoration ground or my house.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was being tracked that night. Before the next day, you people started searching for me. Their plan was to capture me that night and drag me to Cubana Hotel and take me to Mobil where prostitutes stay and then take me around and then, show video of me in the place so that people would ask: \u2018What is Mbaka searching for in a brothel\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThen, they will again, drag me to Igboeze, another spot for prostitutes.

          "text": "EDITORS\u2019 NOTES\n\nOur dear readers, I want to say a big thank you for loving the brand, engaging with the publication, sharing our articles and reports, attending our events, and doing business with us. It\u2019s been an incredible year for us in which we launched TechCabal 3.0 to build a truly pan-African technology publication. We established a physical presence in Kenya and hired Nairobi-based African American technology journalist, Alexandria Williams. Our newsroom grew in order to expand our coverage beyond startup reporting to include consumer tech and Big Tech, which covers the telecoms and banking payment sectors. We broke the earth-shattering news of the dissolution of First Bank\u2019s board by the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele, and the unsuspected high churn of tech talent within Nigeria\u2019s fifth-largest lender Guaranty Trust Bank, which was responsible for its poor mobile services. We have held hands with high-profile leaders in technology and governance to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill to straighten things up as the country\u2019s startup ecosystem witnessed shocking regulatory interruptions this year. Thankfully, the bill has been approved by the executive and is now headed to parliament, hopefully for passing into law soon. 2022 will see us expand into more countries and hire writers on ground across the continent to bring you unrivalled reports on the impact of technology in Africa. Thank you once again and remember to share our articles with your network, because everyone is invited! Happy new year! Adegoke Oyeniyi, Editor-in-Chief Hey everyone, So, how about 2021, am I right? What a whirlwind of a year for Africa\u2019s technology and business ecosystem. We raised money, backed new founders, launched new venture funds, acquired smaller companies, and expanded into new markets. I joined TechCabal in January of this year to help drive TechCabal\u2019s transition from a Nigerian tech publication to a pan-African tech and media publication. This transition had already begun before I said \u201cyes\u201d to the job, but TechCabal 3.0 really grew legs and picked up speed in 2021. And what a hectic year it was for the newsroom. Two brilliant TechCabal reporters moved to other companies (Alexander Onukwue is now at Quartz, and Muyiwa Olowogboyega is doing great work with Lemonade Finance). We brought in new reporters, contributors, and editors onboard (Michael Ajifowoke, Damilare Dosunmu, Timi Odueso, Alexandria Williams, Sultan Quadri and Kelechi Njoku). And as always, we wrote about the impact of technology in Africa. TechCabal Wrapped is our way of walking you through our most-loved and most-read articles in 2021. I encourage you to (re)read, share, and discuss your favourite pieces with your friends and peers. Thanks for sticking with us this year. I can\u2019t wait to connect with you in the new year. Happy holidays. \ud83e\udd42 Koromone Koroye, Managing Editor\n\nHere\u2019s what you enjoyed reading from TechCabal in 2021\n\nIn 2021, TechCabal published 683 articles, 265 editions of TC Daily\u2014including this one\u2014and 50 editions of Next Wave. the Next Wave. Of all these articles, here are the top ten you enjoyed reading the most:\n\n1. iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple released the iPhone 13 series with newer features like larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 terabyte storage), new A15 Bionic processors, smaller notches, and new camera features. In this article, we reached out to trusted Apple retailers across the country and explored the prices of the new iPhones in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. 2. The Next Wave: When tweeting becomes a crime The Next Wave is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that serves as a post-pandemic guide. In this edition, Alexander Onwukwue examined digital regression and social media activism in the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing Twitter ban. 3. Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nIn October, the High Court of Kenya finally issued its ruling on the issue, highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry. 4. Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures\n\nThe Great Resignation hit one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks and, like in other countries, was brought on by rampant stress and the shift to remote work.\n\nIn this article, Daniel Adeyemi and Goke Oyeniyi took us behind the scenes of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures, a phenomenon that plagued many of the bank\u2019s customers in the first half of 2021.\n\n5. Five top instant loan apps in Nigeria\n\nThis year, loan apps on the continent have garnered a reputation for their uncouth recovery methods. Loans, however, still remain the go-to outlet for developing businesses or personal finances.\n\nAs countries continue to clamp down on the unethical practices of some of these apps, TechCabal made a list of some of the best instant loan apps democratising access to credit and bridging financial inclusion with healthy practices.\n\n6. Meet Abeg, Big Brother Naija sponsor and app of the hour\n\nWith an audience of 309 million and billions of impressions across social media, Big Brother Nigeria is one of West Africa\u2019s most-watched television programmes.\n\nLast year, tech companies like Kudabank, Patricia, and even Flutterwave threw their weight behind the show with sponsorship. This year, one of the biggest sponsors of BBN, however, was a newcomer platform called Abeg, who reportedly sponsored the show with $2 million.\n\n7. Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank freezes bank accounts of fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka\n\nAs this year marks several wins for the Nigerian startup scene at large, it\u2019s also the year the Nigerian government came down hard on the ecosystem. From crippling bans to questionable policies, Nigeria went after creators and founders in the economy.\n\nIn August, this manifested with the Central Bank of Nigeria freezing the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka.\n\n8. From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate\n\nOne of the trending questions of the ecosystem in 2021 was: How can more people get into tech?\n\nTo this end, TechCabal wrote quite a number of articles and flagships to help people navigate the wonderful world of tech. This article, however, takes a different approach with a narrative voice that follows the story of Kemi, who went from hawking dry fish to working as a software engineer at Bloomberg.\n\n9. How Herconomy raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours\n\nIn 2021, Nigerian startups raised about $1.4 billion. TechCabal has done a number of stories on some of these raises, most of which are led by venture capitals or private equity firms.\n\nVery few have angel investors leading the raises and even fewer have product users participating in those ventures. In this article, we explored how one startup, Herconomy, raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours, with members of its community as angel investors.\n\n10. Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem pays tribute to Nnena Nkongho\n\nNnena Nkongho.\n\nThe African tech ecosystem mourns the passing of Nnena Nkongho, an African investor who championed diversity and excellence.\n\nAs a way of remembering Nkongho\u2019s greatness and contribution to technology communities at home and abroad, TechCabal published tributes sent to us by people who knew and worked with Nkongho during her lifetime.\n\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed any of our articles, please forward and share them with your networks on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "21 things that happened for the first time in 2021 in the African tech scene",
          "text": "2021 has been a noteworthy year that has seen the African tech sector bounce back from the difficulties it faced in 2020. Here\u2019s a list of 21 things that happened for the first time in the African tech scene this year.\n\nAfrican artists raked in thousands of dollars from selling NFTs (digital art)\n\nThe growing popularity of NFTs has puzzled many, yet it has opened the door for artists and creators from Africa to sell their content to a global audience. With global sales of NFTs topping $2.5 billion in the first half of 2021, we saw African artists like Niyi Okeowo and Nyahan Tachie-Menson sell thousands of dollars worth of NFT; Osinachi sell $75,000 worth of crypto art in 10 days; and Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s work got featured on the New York Times Square billboard.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened in Malawi.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened its doors in July, in Malawi. The school was built by 14Trees, a joint venture between a British development firm and a Swiss company that specialises in building materials. The school\u2019s walls were printed in just 18 hours, compared to the several days it takes to build with conventional building materials. The process in general significantly minimises the time, cost, and materials used for building houses and schools. Hopefully, this technology can help address the severe shortage of schools in the country.\n\nThe African startup ecosystem raised a record $4 billion+ in venture capital funding\n\n2021 year was a landmark year for the African tech ecosystem, raising over $4 billion via 754 deals in venture capital funding. The Big Four\u2014Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt\u2014accounted for 80% of the total amount raised and 76% of the deals.\n\nAn autonomous drone was deployed to attack humans in Libya, the UN says\n\nA report published in March 2021 by the United Nations (UN) Panel of Experts on Libya stated that a drone had been used to \u201chunt down and remotely engage\u201d soldiers who are believed to have been loyal to Libya\u2019s General Khalifa Haftar. This case revisits the conversation on the ethics of using drones in military attacks. How reliable is the technology behind drones, and what could be the implication of a malfunction or error?\n\nApple appointed its first-ever country leader for Nigeria\n\nApple has sold over a billion smartphones (iPhones), yet they account for less than 10% of the smartphone market in Nigeria. In March, the announcement of the appointment of Teju Ajani as Apple\u2019s first-ever managing director for Nigeria is an indication of the tech giant\u2019s interest in Nigeria.\n\nAfrican regulators began responding to the unethical practices of digital lenders\n\nAfter many years of complaints about the predatory tactics of digital lenders, regulators in Nigeria and Kenya began taking steps to curtail it. A Nigerian regulator imposed a \u20a610 million naira ($18,000) fine on Soko Lending company and the Kenyan government recently put a law in place to curtail the excesses of digital lenders.\n\nApple Pay launched in Africa\n\nEight years after Apple launched Apple Pay, its payment and digital wallet system, the tech giant finally brought it to Africa, with its launch in South Africa this year. This launch came three years after Samsung launched its Samsung Pay in South Africa. This move speaks of Apple\u2019s intention to increase its penetration in sub-Saharan Africa where the adoption of digital payments has increased since the start of the pandemic.\n\nGhana kicked off its first fully digital census in West Africa\n\nIn June, Ghana started its first fully digital national census\u2014the first ever in West Africa. The country\u2019s last census was in 2010, and it put the population at 24.6 million. The country has, every 10 years since 1981, conducted the Population and Housing Census (PHC) but was forced to postpone the 2020 census due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nNigeria became the first African country to roll out a digital currency\n\nOn October 25, Nigeria became the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world, to introduce a digital currency. Developed by Barbados-based fintech company Bitt Inc., the eNaira is a legal tender just like the naira. According to the country\u2019s central bank, it must be accepted by all merchants and business outlets as a form of payment in Nigeria. The digital currency is expected to boost cross-border trade and financial inclusion, make transactions more efficient as well as improve monetary policy.\n\nSenegalese TikTok megastar Khaby Lame hit a 100 million followers milestone without saying a word\n\nIn August, Senegalese-born Khaby Lame became the second person ever to hit and cross the 100-million-followers mark on TikTok. Lame, a 21-year-old former factory worker living in Italy on a Senegalese passport, has crafted a comedic brand that has resonated around the world by putting so-called life hacks or complicated manoeuvres through the lens of intuitive everyday options.\n\nGoogle announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa\n\nAt the first virtual Google for Africa event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company\u2019s plan to invest $1billion over five years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\neCommerce giant Amazon stepped up its presence in Africa\n\nFor a long while, there have been questions about when Amazon will kick off operations in Africa. Well, Amazon answered that question this year. First, it affirmed its commitment to Egypt by replacing Souq.com as Amazon\u2019s selling platform in the country with Amazon.eg. This announcement also came with the inauguration of an Amazon fulfilment centre in Egypt. There was also the announcement of Amazon\u2019s controversial African headquarters in South Africa.\n\nThere was an acquisitions spree across Africa\n\nThis year saw a number of companies being acquired, most of them for undisclosed amounts. MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider, was acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nMFS Africa acquired Baxi. MaxAB, an Egyptian B2B marketplace, acquired WaystoCap. Ghanaian fintech startup, Zeepay, acquired 51% of Zambian counterpart Mangwee. Plentywaka acquired Stabus Ghana after $1.2m seed funding. Other notable acquisitions include JIji acquiring Autochek, and Ourpass acquiring Storemia.\n\nThe Ethiopian government launched its own mobile money service\n\nIn May 2021, Ethio telecom launched its own mobile money service, TeleBirr, to cater for the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. Two months after its launch, TeleBirr reported that it has gained six million users. The new service is expected to make a difference in Ethiopia where the banking system is seen as inefficient, with only 19 commercial banks serving the entire population.\n\nFrancophone Africa got its first unicorn in Wave\n\nWave, a spinoff from Asia- and Africa-focused remittance company Sendwave, raised $200 million in a Series A round to become the first unicorn from the French-speaking region of Africa. Why Wave? The startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nSix months and counting: Nigerian Twitter ban\n\nThe Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in June, following the social media platform\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by Buhari, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter has since then triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nSudanese tech got its first foreign funding in 30 years\n\nalsoug, the largest digital marketplace in Sudan, raised a $5 million investment round co-led by Egyptian fintech unicorn, Fawry, and a \u201cwider consortium of Western venture capital firms\u201d. This investment marked the first foreign venture capital investment into the Sudanese tech ecosystem since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period.\n\nSomalia got its first Visa card payment service\n\nVisa partnered with the International Bank of Somalia (IBS Bank) to launch Somalia\u2019s first Visa card payment service. This came six years after Mastercard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market. This partnership is an important indicator that Somalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headway towards reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nEthiopia awarded its first telecom license\n\nIn May, Ethiopia awarded its first telecom licence to a consortium made up of Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc, and Sumitomo Corp. The next month, Ethiopia launched a tendering process for the proposed sell-off of a 40% stake in the state-owned Ethio Telecom to private investors. These actions are all parts of the government\u2019s broader plan to open up the economy.\n\nTwitter opened its first Africa office in Ghana\n\nIn April 2021 social media giant Twitter announced Ghana as its choice for an African headquarters. The move came as a surprise to some who expected it to be Nigeria, a country with more Twitter users and a larger population overall. Twitter cleared the air by stating that its reasons for choosing Ghana were because the country was a \u201csupporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet\u201d.\n\nThe continent produced a record number of new unicorns in a year\n\nThere are a total of eight tech unicorns in Africa right now, with five of them\u2014Flutterwave, Andela, ChipperCash, Wave, and Opay\u2014attaining this status in 2021. Notably, fintech is having its moment as the majority of the unicorns are fintechs. The other companies that attained unicorn status before this year are Interswitch, Jumia, and Fawry.\n\nThat\u2019s all for 2021! What events did we miss out on, and what first-time surprises do you think await us in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ask an Investor: Twelve insights from Africa\u2019s top investors",
          "text": "At one point or the other, every startup founder or CEO was a newbie in navigating the murky waters of institutional investment. They maybe even got burnt because they didn\u2019t know the right questions to ask, or what to look out for.\n\nSo, we started the Ask an Investor series to help explain why and how investments in companies happen in Africa from the people who make them happen.\n\nIn the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed over 20 investors who\u2019ve shared their thoughts on what investors look out for in founders and startups before investing, the lessons learnt and mistakes made, key trends, and other relevant nuggets.\n\nI\u2019ll be highlighting a few insights from the published interviews here and think you should read the full version of the interviews.\n\nFounders Factory: A hands-on approach\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that I learnt early on from my conversations with different investors, it\u2019s that all investors are not the same. Their approach to investing is often influenced by their background and experiences. While most people easily associate investors with just money, Founders Factory Africa (FFA) would rather have you think of more.\n\nIn a conversation with Sam Sturm, one of the founding partners of FFA, he explains why:\n\n\u201cWe believe that capital isn\u2019t the only way to support a business. You need it so that you can execute but at the end of the day, capital isn\u2019t what solves problems. We believe that the challenges of product-market fit, customer acquisition, or retention are not the kind of challenges that capital alone can solve. Those are the challenges that you\u2019re looking to entrepreneurs to solve, that you\u2019re looking to the team to solve. If you can supplement them with experienced and talented people, you\u2019d be successful.\u201d\n\nAlongside providing capital, FFA is a venture building studio, this means that a portfolio startup can expect to get support from private coaches, product managers, product designers, etc.\n\nMicrotraction: A novel approach\n\nFive years ago, Yele Bademosi saw that it was difficult for people to raise funds if they didn\u2019t have a wealthy relative or network, so he set out to make it easier for founders to raise money.\n\nBut first, the Microtraction team had to do away with the status quo. This meant no batches, no programmes, and no demo days. Microtraction invested on the go.\n\nAnother different thing about Microtraction\u2019s approach is its bias for investing in startups with technical founders/co-founders. Why?\n\n\u201cIf we give you money, and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders.\u201d Bademosi explained. \u201cWe\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\u201d\n\nAcumen: Patient capital\n\nThe original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. So Acumen goes a step further beyond providing donations and grants to startups. It\u2019s a non-profit that uses donations received to invest in startups working on socially relevant issues.\n\nMeghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen, explained this: \u201cIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen, and we redeploy and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\u201d\n\nAcumen is able to invest at an early stage and wait a little longer than other traditional venture capital firms because they don\u2019t have to return the money back to donors.\n\nSawari Ventures: North Africa\u2019s leading VC firm\n\n2021 was an exciting year for North Africa as it garnered a lot of attention and funding. Before the boom, Sawari Ventures, which was founded over a decade ago, has been backing North African startups. The founders of Sawari Ventures also founded Flat6Labs\u2014the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator.\n\nIn our conversation, Tamer Azer explained the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup.\n\n\u201cVC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime. They have a 10-year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing, and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\n\u201cJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing cheques, we have to get the money to be able to write these cheques first. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these cheques. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\u201d\n\nUnconventional Capital: Removing gut feelings and bias in startup investment\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of my conversation with Franziska Reh, CEO of Unconventional Capital, I understood why the word \u201cunconventional\u201d was befitting.\n\nHere\u2019s how early-stage investment mostly happens: An investor and an ambitious entrepreneur get talking. After a few background checks and business plan conversations, the investor decides whether to invest. But not before checking their gut feeling. Along the way the investor is constantly asking, \u201cDoes this feel right?\u201d\n\nAt Uncap, the team decided to flip this approach upside down by relying on algorithms to make these decisions.\n\nReh explained, \u201cAt Uncap, in our investment process, no one in our team makes investment decisions. The selection process is based on an algorithm that focuses very much on the potential of the entrepreneur. It\u2019s a model that measures entrepreneurial potential as a predictor of future success. Afterwards, we invest through a standardised model.\u201d\n\nThis model allows Uncap to invest in thousands of entrepreneurs. Interestingly, Uncap exits the portfolio companies gradually over a period of time\u2014an unconventional exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThese companies we invest in buy back their equity through 5% of their quarterly revenues. They transfer 5% of their quarterly revenues to us. By this act, over time, they buy back the whole investment, plus the price that we\u2019ve paid before. It\u2019s a fixed multiple on the investment, it\u2019s basically the same for everyone.\u201d\n\nTomi Davies: Tales of an African angel Investor\n\nThe conversation with Tomi Davies, or TD as he\u2019s fondly called, started off with him explaining how he was able to partner with some of the brightest minds on the continent to build the angel investment space in Africa. He was part of the team that started the Lagos Angel Network and the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nWhile many know TD for his role in the African Angel community, but he\u2019s more than that.\n\n\u201cI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, and sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum,\u201c Davies said.\n\nHe also shared his proprietary framework for investing in startups.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\n\u201cFinally, you ask: is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also, is the business model sustainable? Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\u201d\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: Angel investor and startup advisor\n\nWhen I visited Ghana in July, Ato Bentsi-Enchill was one of the people I met. One thing that stood out to me was that he moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did he learn all these?\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network.\u201d Bentsi-Enchill explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\u201d\n\nAs a startup advisor, he helps African startups raise capital and protects them from difficult investors. In our conversation, he cites some instances where he\u2019s helped.\n\n\u201cFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts\u2014a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\u201d\n\nAdam Molai: African industrialist\n\nZimbabwe is known more for the Victoria Falls (the largest waterfall in the world) than its tech ecosystem, but still, Adam Molai is one of the few investors looking to change that.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice, and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and, through the Jua Fund, has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove, and many others.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye, he shared one of the best practices startups should adopt in getting funded.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund, this is what I must put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\u201d\n\nSunu Capital: A pan-African fund with a solo general partner\n\nSince Benjamin Schmerler left the United States at the age of 18, he\u2019s lived and worked in nearly every corner of the globe. Interestingly, he stumbled on the name for his firm\u2014SUNU Capital\u2014 while in Senegal.\n\nHe heard the word sunu in a song, and when he found out that it meant \u201cour\u201d, it resonated with him. \u201cI used it as the name of my firm because it\u2019s a simple word and, more importantly, because I believe in collective effort; working together to build more wealth for everyone and leave this planet a better place for our children,\u201d Schmerler said.\n\nOne thing he\u2019s been thinking about recently is how to aggregate African markets.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is how to break the borders between countries so we can get a larger aggregated market that can be efficiently served. I believe if we can do this, we would see exits on a scale beyond anything we have seen to date.\n\n\u201cI talk to entrepreneurs all the time and they show me the total addressable market (TAM) of Africa, a map of 54 countries. They hint at the possibility of expansion, and I\u2019m thinking, how do we unlock Gabon? What does it take to be a part of Cameroon as well? There is so much untapped potential all over the continent that I am absolutely excited by infrastructure that turns the 4 or 5 markets where all the activity is happening into 10, 20, 30 countries over the next handful of years.\u201d\n\nKepple Africa: Creating new industries\n\nA few minutes into our conversation, Satoshi Shinada reminded me that I need to visit more African countries. At the age of 18, he left Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years.\n\nFor Kepple Africa Ventures, the big vision is to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nIn our conversation, Shinada shared some mistakes he\u2019s made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything, and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\n\u201cAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\u201d\n\nLoftyInc: Not playing by the rules of VC investing\n\nIn 2012, Idris Bello and his partners, then in their early 30s, left their lucrative jobs and raided their savings to create the LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund. Over the years, through trials and errors, they\u2019ve seen some level of success. Today, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella.\n\nBello, who believes in sharing a full picture of his investor journey, shared some notable deals missed or mistakes made along the way.\n\n\u201cThose are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process there. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\n\u201cMost of the mistakes we made were as a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 cheque. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\u201d\n\nCapria ventures: Backing local funds and startups\n\nFive years ago, Jack Knellinger, Dave Richards and Will Poole formed Capria ventures, an investment firm that started out investing in local funds (VC firms) across the global south\u2014Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Recently, Capria Ventures has begun investing directly in startups, providing the much needed growth stage capital for them.\n\nToday, Capria Ventures has investment activity in about 50 countries with $650 million worth of current assets under management.\n\nIn my conversation with Jack Knellinger, he enlightened me on how they support VC firms\u2014a subject rarely spoken about.\n\n\u201cObviously, the main thing top of mind is fundraising\u2014helping them close their fundraising. Here, it involves everything from introductions to reviewing pitch materials. We look at how the funds are being positioned as well as the terms and negotiations with limited partners to ensure there\u2019s alignment between the fund managers, general partners, and limited partners.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the fundraising is done, we move to portfolio management. How are they putting in place the right systems and processes to grow, scale, and institutionalise the firm? Here, there\u2019s a wide range of things to be done in that regard, from team development to appropriately conducting due diligence before investing. When the fund managers have built up their portfolio of companies, we move to how they think about exits. What\u2019s the right time to exit? Do they want to look at partial exits?\n\nWhen a firm has mastered these aspects and gone on to raise multiple funds. We look at how they\u2019re telling the story of the firm and the funds you\u2019ve managed.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all for this year! Thank you to all the investors who took their time to talk to me and help others learn more about investing in startups.\n\nWhich investors/firms will you like me to talk to in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Jack Dorsey\u2019s Btrust members\u2019 plan to facilitate financial freedom",
          "text": "Bitcoin technology is powered by software developers or contributors that work on a pro bono basis. So, the Bitcoin infrastructure would be threatened if these highly skilled developers refuse to work or are not skilled enough to maintain the code that sustains the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIn recent times, there have been efforts to prevent this from happening by supporting Bitcoin software developers to make Bitcoin more private, resilient, and decentralised. In May, popular crypto derivatives exchange, BitMEX, partnered with global non-profit, Human Rights Foundation (HRF), to provide a $150,000 grant for Calvin Kim, a Korea-based Bitcoin scaling researcher, and a $50,000 grant for Abubakar Nur Khalil, a Nigeria-based Bitcoin wallet developer.\n\nIn February this year, Twitter co-founder and former CEO, Jack Dorsey, had also taken a similar path when he announced that he was launching a new endowment called \u201c\u20bftrust\u201d, in partnership with rapper Jay-Z, to fund Bitcoin development in India and Africa.\n\nHe promised to donate 500 bitcoins ($23 million) to the endowment fund and give its board complete autonomy to use the funds as they deemed fit. But he has one ask: \u201cMake Bitcoin the Internet\u2019s currency.\u201d\n\nLast week, he unveiled the members of the board\u2014four of them\u2014to the world: Nigeria\u2019s Abubakar Nur Khalil, Obi Nwosu, and Ojoma Ochai; and South Africa\u2019s Carla Kirk-Cohen.\n\nBoard members with a game plan\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account. He became a contributor to Bitcoin Core\u2014there are less than 40 of them in the world\u2014when he was just 19. But the journey began in late 2017 when he heard about Bitcoin\u2019s price and started reading about it. The following year, he got into programming and built a blockchain-based app, before becoming a contributor to Bitcoin Core in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, he co-founded Recursive Capital, a venture capital that provides crypto-focused startups with seed and early-stage investments, with the aim of contributing to the development of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Recursive Capital is on a mission to facilitate online sovereignty\u2014tools, protocols, and ventures that democratise data ownership and promote privacy, encryption, and financial sovereignty\u2014all driven by Bitcoin. Despite being founded before the Web 3.0 buzz, Recursive Capital had decided that it wanted to enhance financial freedom by decentralising the financial monetary system.\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account.\n\nKhalil, who was recently named Recursive Capital\u2019s CEO\u2014after serving as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO)\u2014explained that Recursive Capital realised that Africa\u2019s financial infrastructure is underdeveloped and cannot handle the amount of load being put on it.\n\nHe explained that this is why it is hard to send and receive money across two African countries, and even more difficult across continents. But he believes that Bitcoin will level the playing field since the requirements for participating are low. All you need is a phone and internet access, and a bitcoin address or lightning address\u2014think email address but for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is democratising financial freedom on a global scale. It is also providing a unified monetary network where individuals from any part of the globe can transact instantly and have settlement across the global ecosystem cheaply,\u201d he told TechCabal in a call.\n\nTalking about the barrier to entry for Bitcoin, Khalil believes a misconception lies in the way people approach it. He explained that Bitcoin should be seen as an investment over a long time. This way, investors don\u2019t bother about how high its current price is. He also believes that an easy-to-use interface on mobile and web-based wallets should be created, so that non-technical individuals can use Bitcoin. This would help in lowering the barriers to entry.\n\nEarlier this year, after realising there is a dearth of Bitcoin developers in Nigeria and Africa, Khalil also founded Qala, to begin a revolutionary campaign of expanding the pool of Bitcoin and lightning developers on the continent.\n\nAll selected \u20bftrust board members\n\nOjoma Ochai, one of the newly appointed board members to \u20bftrust, explained that her selection was based on a combination of her experience in Africa\u2019s creative and digital economy and demonstrated interest in writing and talking about emerging technologies on the continent. Ochai has vast experience in non-profit management and governance across Africa and has run creative and digital economy projects across policy and practice in these sectors, on the continent and beyond. She also has board experience, being the board chair of the British Council Nigeria Programmes entity for two years. She was also involved in initiatives like the African Tech and Creative Group, which aims to capture value for African creatives and the tech sector.\n\nOchai also started a company with CcHub, The Creative Economy Practice, to capture more value for the African creative economy through projects that stimulate innovation and technology and enhance value chains and business models.\n\nWhat will Bitcoin do for Africa?\n\nKhalil believes in educating and enlightening individuals about Bitcoin\u2019s long-term benefits: economic freedom for the entire continent. Khalil believes Africa needs Bitcoin more because the currency of most of its countries are volatile, making it pointless for people to save long term in their native currencies.\n\nHe said that the reason many people see Bitcoin as volatile is that they approach it as a short-term asset: \u201dBitcoin is only volatile in a short timescale\u2014 a week, three months. But if you look at the asset across, for example, an entire year, it is quite stable, compared to some national currencies.\u201d\n\nOn fraud claims around Bitcoin, Khalil argues that Bitcoin is one of the most open monetary systems because the majority of fraudulent transactions still pass through the traditional financial system, where it is relatively easy to track parties involved.\n\nOchai believes that bitcoin will eventually become a viable medium for Africans to do business without restrictions. She added that it would also help the creative industries easily monetise content.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for Africans to be more involved in building solutions that work for us so that we move away from the paradigm of things being done to us and for us to a paradigm where we contribute our skills, worldview, and capabilities towards solving our own problems and being part of a global seismic shift,\u201d Ochai said.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s cinema industry emerged stronger from the ravages of a global pandemic last year with ticket sales doubling figures realized in 2020.\n\nThe total weekend movie ticket sales rose by 100 percent to N2.4 billion in 2021 from N1.2 billion in 2020 according to data by the Cinema Exhibitors Association of Nigeria (CEAN).\n\nHowever, this figure was 41.5 percent lower than the N4.1 billion recorded as ticket sales in 2019.\n\nAnalysts say the data suggests the industry is shaking off the impact of the coronavirus pandemic paving way for better performance in 2022.\n\n\u201cIf there is no severe disruption in the sector this year, we should see movie ticket sales getting to the level of 2019 or slightly higher,\u201d said Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst\n\nThe postponement of Hollywood box office releases because of the pandemic in 2020 drove turnout in 2021 after countries began opening up cinemas previously shut down to contain the virus.\n\nTaiwo Ogunlade, an official at Filmone, a Nigerian cinema company, said he is optimistic that 2022 will see an improved performance due to big Hollywood movies like Black Panther II, The Batman, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Avatar 2 among others expected to be released in 2022.\n\nThe resurgence of cinema culture in Nigeria is driven by a growing middle class in the cities, increased investment in production quality and millennials who have come to accept cinema as an entertainment lifestyle choice, analysts say.\n\nIn the past, Nigerians converged at cinemas to watch foreign movies but recently, people are beginning to appreciate the local movies at the cinemas.\n\nRead also: News Roundup: 11 key moments of 2021, Key issues Nigerian businesses should worry about, Ten most rated Nigerian movies on Netflix in 2021\u2026\n\nIn 2020, the industry became one of the worst-hit, as it recorded zero activity and revenue for six months (late March-Late September) occasioned by the lockdown and safety measures imposed by the government at the peak of the fight against the pandemic.\n\nWhen the cinemas opened in September, there were fears that challenges such as operating at 60 percent capacity and low-quality foreign content could affect revenues.\n\n\u201cOur market is usually content dependent. It depends on what type and quality of films are coming out that year,\u201d Ogunlade said.\n\nNollywood took advantage of the lack of foreign content by releasing quality local films like Omo Ghetto, Fate of Alakada, Quam\u2019s Money, Dear Affy, Rattlesnake: The Ahanna Story, Who\u2019s the Boss, This Lady Called Life, Voiceless, \u00ccf\u00e9, Introducing The Kujus, The Ghost and The Tout 2, Bad comments, King of Boys \u2013 Return of the King, Aki and Paw, Namaste Wahala, etc. These movies glued the Nigerian audience to cinemas across the country.\n\nAccording to CEAN data, cinemas made N20.6 million from movie ticket weekend sales in the month of September 2020.\n\nThe numbers improved from there, as cinemas earned N27.6 million in the opening weekend of October, figure movie distributors assured would increase to N30 million weekly and over N100 million at the end of October.\n\n\u201cThe situation is getting better and more people are willing to go to the cinemas now,\u201d Josephine Okaka, a film distributor said.\n\nShe adds, \u201cWe now maximise the viewing times for a good film so that we can increase revenue.\u201d\n\nThough many fear that Omicron, the new COVID-19 variant may yet further disrupt the sector, forcing governments to impose new restrictions, industry operators say this would have limited impact as they are innovating new ways to stay afloat. They also believe the availability of vaccines would help cushion the impact.",

          "text": "MTN Nigeria and Mafab Communications may have secured the provisional license bag for the 5G spectrum at the cost of $273 million, but there are still hurdles to face.\n\nFour of these hurdles may include meeting the condition for payment, unfinished business with right of way charges and state policies, power generation, and economic case for 5G.\n\nCondition for licence payment\n\nThe Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) had noted that the two winners are expected to complete payment of the $273.6 million licence by February 2022. The NCC, however, said the payment has to be made in naira at the prevailing Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) exchange rate.\n\nThe local currency, Naira, is currently experiencing high volatility which might present a problem for the winners. On 13 December 2021, the day the auction was completed and the companies that won announced, the naira was trading at N414/$1. On 31 December, less than three weeks after the auction was announced, the naira rose to N435 weakening further against the dollar.\n\nThe implication is that should the two telcos had resolved to pay for the licences on the day the announcement was made in naira at the prevailing CBN exchange rate as stipulated by NCC, they would only have paid about N113 billion ($273 at N414 rate). However, should they decide to pay on 31 December, the price of the licence goes to N118.75 billion ($273 at N435 rate).\n\nThe naira has fluctuated widely in 2021 around a largely fixed spot rate of around N415 as investors try to make sense of the CBN\u2019s exchange rate direction. The apex bank has been selling the greenback at between N437 to N444 per dollar to investors since early October 2021. If the volatility rates continue MTN Nigeria and Mafab are likely to pay close to or more than N200 billion for the licence.\n\nExperts BusinessDay spoke to who wouldn\u2019t want to be put on record are betting for MTN Nigeria to afford the licence. The telco had approached the local debt market to borrow N200 billion in April 2021 after securing the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch an N200 billion bond issuance programme. By November the company announced that it had completed the programme in a two-legged process which was oversubscribed. In December the telco unveiled a public offer of 575 million shares which ended after a two weeks sale campaign.\n\nAt a stakeholders meeting, Karl Toriola, MTN Nigeria CEO said the fundraising was part of the telco\u2019s mission to raise N600 billion which it intends to invest in telecom infrastructure in Nigeria.\n\nMafab Communications on the other hand, according to an unconfirmed report, is said to be planning to raise $350 in equity as part of a larger $1.9 billion fundraising campaign. Several sources close to the company BusinessDay spoke to were not able to confirm this report.\n\nRight of Way\n\nIn 2020, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy made an effort to impress on the 36 states governors in Nigeria about the need to reduce their charges for Right of Way for fibre cables and adopt the agreed N145 signed by the National Executive Council. The engagement was able to get about 7 governors to publicly comply with the agreed fee and in the case of Kaduna State waive it.\n\nRead also: Outlook for 2022: Telcos to focus on cloud, Internet of things, 5G adoption\n\nUnfortunately, there are about 29 states in the country that are not aligned with the N145 fee. Lagos, the state that hosts the majority of telecommunication customers is also among these 29 states. In the case of Lagos State, a proposed new policy mandates operators to utilise the unified duct infrastructure project that is yet to be completed. The project is expected to gulp about $200 million or N82 billion (N410/$) on completion. At the moment, the state\u2019s right of way fee is at N796 per linear meter.\n\nAbuja is also unyielding in its approach to right-of-way policy. Apart from Right of Way requiring stringent documentation, securing approval to build a base transceiver station in the capital territory could take several months if not up to a year according to a source at the NCC.\n\nPower generation\n\nNigeria\u2019s installed power generation capacity stands at 12,522MW, however, maximum power transmitted has failed to surpass 5300MW. This is hardly enough to power the entire Lagos State, much less the entire country.\n\nDue to the heavy power demand of most telecom infrastructure, operators in Nigeria have to generate and distribute the power they use. For example, the about 40,000 base transceiver stations in the country are powered by diesel generators and solar power systems. Grid power is used as an alternative instead of the primary source.\n\nA study jointly released by InterDigital and ABI Research titled Environmentally Sustainable 5G Deployment, noted that as 5G usurps LTE, energy consumption is expected to increase 160 percent between 2020 and 2030 due to the energy demands of powerful network elements like massive MIMO and edge servers, the proliferation of 5G cell sites, and the flexibility of the 5G networks in both consumer and enterprise use cases.\n\n\u201cThe advent of 5g holds unprecedented promise for the wireless ecosystem and our world, but we must remain clear-eyed about the staggering energy demands of 5G and its life-changing use cases to develop appropriate and timely solutions,\u201d said Henry Tirri, Chief Technology Officer, InterDigital. \u201cWe must consider the environmental footprint, in addition to the technological impact, to ensure 5G and future generations of wireless technologies exist and thrive in a responsible and energy-stable world.\u201d\n\nEconomic case for 5G\n\nThe potential of 5G technology for economic development in any country, has been heavily reported in different journals and by various researchers. 5G undoubtedly has bigger potential than previous network generations.\n\nHowever, the entire process of deploying the technology; from the capital raise, to resource distribution and human personnel recruitment, and making returns for investment describes the economic case.\n\nIn countries where broadband penetration is at its peak, it would be easy to present a solid economic case for 5G. But Nigeria\u2019s penetration is at 39.89 percent as of October 2021, representing a decline from 42.93 percent in January. South Africa, the first country in Africa to roll out 5G, has over 80 percent broadband penetration.\n\nWhile the number of internet users in Nigeria is the highest in Africa, the majority of the unique users are hooked on 3G coverage, even then it is less than 60 percent of the adult population. 4G coverage is at a mere 30 percent.\n\nPart of the reasons for the decline or slow pace of growth in broadband penetration is insufficient investment in infrastructure. Another problem is the growing number of people in the low income bracket, many of which cannot afford to pay for internet services. The World Bank estimates that the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed an additional 8 million Nigerians into poverty bringing the total to over 90 million people. This is largely why after the lifting of the ban on SIM card sales in April 2021, the telcos continued to record decline in subscriptions.\n\nExperts however project that MTN Nigeria is in a better position to prove the economic case for 5G In the long run. The telco has a robust infrastructure already deployed and has garnered experience from running 2G, 3G, and 4G.\n\nMafab was only incorporated in July 2020, about 18 months ago. It may need to merge or acquire an existing telco in order to leverage the existing infrastructure. Otherwise, it would need to build its infrastructure from scratch which would cost it more for a technology like 5G.",

          "text": "Nigeria will need more than oil to lift economy\n\nNigeria will get another chance this year to lay the building blocks of a long-touted transition away from oil and finally set the economy on the path to robust growth.\n\nThere is a consensus among development economists and analysts that Africa\u2019s largest economy is due for a new growth driver after several years of gorging itself on petrodollars.\n\n\u201cAs the world shifts its attention to non-fossil energy sources, it is important that Nigeria gets its non-oil economic strategy right,\u201d analysts at FBNQuest said.\n\nA non-oil economic strategy is simply a growth strategy that is not dependent on oil and it could mean either of several things, according to economists polled in a BusinessDay survey.\n\nIt could mean an investment-led growth whereby the government goes on an energetic pursuit of private capital to plug the gaps in infrastructure and several sectors of the economy. This would mean that the several challenges confronting the ease of business in the country are tackled once and for all, according to Muda Yusuf, former director-general of Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI).\n\n\u201cIf there were any doubts before, it is now well known that the government alone cannot create jobs for our fast-growing population and reduce poverty because it doesn\u2019t have the resources,\u201d Yusuf told BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cIt is time we tried a more viable approach which is to allow the private sector to play the lead role while the government creates an enabling environment rather than compete with or stifle the private sector,\u201d Yusuf said. The private sector is the primary source of jobs the world over, even in Nigeria.\n\nThe quarterly job creation reports by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show that public sector jobs accounted for a miserly 2 percent between 2009 and 2015, while private-sector jobs \u2013 a combination of formal and informal jobs accounted for 98 percent.\n\nIn 2016, the last year the NBS published the reports, public sector jobs were shrinking, which meant that rather than create new jobs, existing ones were lost. In the first quarter, public sector jobs were negative -3,038 as against the 79,465 jobs created in formal (21,477 jobs) and informal jobs (61,026 jobs).\n\nThe lack of jobs makes the government\u2019s poverty reduction goal a pipe-dream.\n\nAnother non-oil export strategy could be an export-led growth whereby the manufacturing sector is empowered to tap the export market in the way Vietnam did with good success.\n\nNigeria\u2019s power challenges, inconsistent policies, and low adult literacy make this option difficult, according to Bongo Adi, an economist.\n\n\u201cFrom its imports, you know a country that is serious about an export-led strategy, they import more of raw materials but that is not the case with Nigeria,\u201d Adi said.\n\nAmong Nigeria\u2019s top imports in the last 10 years are refined petroleum products and food. That has however started to change slightly in recent times with imports of machinery and equipment increasing but still not enough to suggest a booming manufacturing sector.\n\nAnother strategy Nigeria can adopt is one where investments are channeled towards human capital like education and health.\n\nThe amount spent on fuel subsidy would have a better impact if education and health were subsidised.\n\nThe World Bank is of the view that increased investment in human capital translates to higher economic prosperity.\n\n\u201cWith the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is even more important to understand why countries should invest in human capital (HC) and protect hard-won gains from being eroded,\u201d the World Bank economists said in a report.\n\nDonald Johnston, secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development could not agree more.\n\n\u201cKnowledge, skills, and competencies constitute a vital asset in supporting economic growth and reducing social inequality in OECD countries,\u201d Johnston said in a report.\n\n\u201cThis asset, which is often referred to as human capital, has been identified as one key factor in combating high and persistent unemployment and the problems of low pay and poverty.\n\n\u201cAs we move into \u201cknowledge-based\u201d economies the importance of human capital becomes even more significant than ever,\u201d Johnston said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s huge population, 200 million, means it has an advantage if it takes the counsel of the World Bank and OECD.\n\nSlowly but surely: The end of oil-led growth\n\nFrom poor crude oil production in 2021 to big oil companies excluding Nigeria from their 2022 spending plan, the challenges in Nigeria\u2019s oil sector further intensify the need for increased attention to the non-oil sector, findings have shown.\n\nThe oil sector of Africa\u2019s largest economy marked its sixth consecutive period of contraction in the third quarter of 2021, thanks to poor crude oil production capacity.\n\nThe sector failed to ride on the gains of higher crude prices, the international Brent crude price rose to a three-year high in October 2021, to exit recession as it contracted by 10.73 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2021, as analysed from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data.\n\nWhile many oil companies with a presence in Nigeria have recovered from the 2020 crisis with bumper cash flows in 2021 and are making plans to boost their capital spending next year, Africa\u2019s top crude producing nation is not their top investment destination.\n\nPreferring to be identified as energy companies, five Western majors \u2013 British Petroleum, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, and TotalEnergies, are overlooking Nigeria and moving forward with spending capital expenditure in Libya, Ivory Coast, Kazakhstan, Guyana, Brazil, Singapore, among others, as obtained from their Capex outlook for 2022.\n\nExxon management, for example, reiterated that Capex in 2021 will come in at the lower end of its $16 billion \u2013 $19 billion range, but the board would soon approve a $20 billion \u2013 $25 billion annual Capex programme from 2022 onward.\n\nLast week, Royal Dutch Shell yet again halted crude shipments from the 200,000 barrels per day Forcados export terminal after a malfunctioning barge obstructed tanker path. This comes only a month after the company restored flow from its Bonny Island facility.\n\nAccording to Simon Anderson, director, performance improvement sub-Saharan Africa at Wood Mackenzie, the significant drop in investment by these IOCs in Nigeria goes beyond capital discipline alone.\n\nWith policy uncertainties and security challenges weighing on the minds of foreign investors, experts say Nigeria is punching below its weight in terms of attracting the right kind of investments in its energy sector.\n\nRead also: Oil workers face job loss on IOCs\u2019 divestment\n\n\u201cNigeria may drop further in status as Africa\u2019s biggest producer if the government does not urgently address the situation,\u201d Abiodun Adesanya, CEO of Lagos-based oil consultancy, Degeconek, told S&P Global Platts. \u201cAlready, the country has fallen behind Libya in terms of output.\u201d\n\nWhile the oil sector continues to be a major source of the Federal Government\u2019s revenue and export, the contribution of the oil sector to the economy (7.5%) has continually shrunk.\n\n\u201cDue to weaker crude oil production linked to operational and maintenance issues as well as reduced investment in the sector, the oil sector remained in depression,\u201d Ayo Ebo, head, retail investment, Chapel Hill Denham said.\n\nNigeria has had an incessant report of production shortening and declaration of force majeure at major export terminals that have realised production losses for Nigeria, according to Seun Arambada, investment research associate, Meristem Securities.\n\nThe country\u2019s crude oil production has been languishing at only two-thirds of its full capacity this year, especially many of its large oil fields in the Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cSo while we can produce more oil by OPEC quota, production losses arising from the factors mentioned earlier capped oil prices, this explains why we are experiencing a deficit,\u201d Arambada said.\n\nMeanwhile, a recent report- Opportunities in the Export Market, by the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC), highlighted 22 products, divided into two categories that can help Nigeria to meet its non-oil ambitions.\n\nAccording to the Abuja-based institution, if the 22 products are considered a priority it could earn Nigeria $30 billion in non-oil exports and 20 percent of GDP by 2025, as well as half a million additional jobs created annually.\n\nNigeria\u2019s non-oil exports currently average about $5billion per annum and accounted for 8 percent of national GDP in 2020 (with the exemption of transhipment from Nigeria to other West African countries).\n\nThe first category of the products as listed by NEPC includes petrochemicals and methanol, gold, nitrogenous fertilisers and ammonia, hides and leather, and cash crops such as soybeans, cotton, palm oil, rubber, and cocoa.\n\nAccording to the institution, the export target for this category is approximately $28bn or around 7 percent of global trade.\n\n\u201cOver the past decade, the Dangote Group, Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) and Indorama have all developed interests in petrochemicals, fertilisers, and ammonia capacity. Indorama is ahead of the group, exporting fertiliser from its Eleme plants. Dangote Fertiliser commissioned its three million tons per annum facility in Lekki this year,\u201d FBNquest said.\n\nThe second category under the NEPC\u2019s plan comprises cement and clinker, fresh and processed tomato, banana, plantains, cashew, sesame seeds, cassava, oranges, spices, ginger, shea butter, and cowpea.\n\nTo promote the zero-oil plan, the NEPC is focusing on quick interventions such as providing shared processing facilities for businesses exporting agricultural produce, decongesting the Apapa ports, cold room facilities for those seeking to export perishable items such as vegetables and developing field-to-export transport corridors which would match infrastructural investments to key goals by Nigeria\u2019s federal government.\n\n\u201cUltimately, a lot depends on the country\u2019s ability to achieve these targets and successfully diversify its revenue streams from oil,\u201d research analysts at the asset management arm of FBN Holdings said.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most populous nation recently launched a medium-term economic plan, (National Development Plan 2021 \u2013 2025) the NDP. The Plan succeeds the Vision 20:2020 introduced in 2009 and the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) introduced in 2017 both of which expired in 2020. The NDP is also a bridge for the country\u2019s long-term plan currently being developed, that is, Nigeria Agenda 2050.\n\nThe vision as stated in the NDP is \u201cto make Nigeria a country that has unlocked its potential in all sectors of the economy for a sustainable, holistic, and inclusive national development\u201d.\n\nThe six broad objectives of the plan include economic diversification, investment in infrastructure, security and good governance, educated and healthy population, poverty alleviation, and economic and social development across states.",

And yet these palace jesters gather in the safety of Benin City, provided by the excellent leadership of Governor Godwin Obaseki and mouth non-existent chaos.\n\nThe APC wants a state of emergency declared in a state that did not only pay salaries and pensions of state government workers by 14th of December, but also released funds to the local governments to ensure that their employees are also paid salaries in time for the yuletide celebrations, while the APC-led Federal Government was struggling to meet their FAAC obligations for the end of year.\n\nDoes the party want a state of emergency in a state where every flight, or bus coming into the state is fully booked with air carriers and road transporters jostling to keep up with the pressure of travellers trooping into the state?\n\nThey want a state of emergency where investments are rolling in large numbers with consortiums setting up tech parks, establishing malls, processing factories, coupled with the expansion of the real estate sector, which are creating job opportunities for youths in the state?\n\nIn Nigeria, it is common knowledge that the level of fidelity and honesty expected from the ilk of politicians that these APC jesters represent is extremely low. It is rather shameful for old men \u2013 grandfathers, for that matter \u2013 to sit comfortably, look into the camera and tell bare-faced lies about the Edo State Judiciary, the state legislature, the newly reconstructed Government Science and Technical College (GSTC), street-lighting project, Edo Tech Park, Edo Innovation Hub, among others.\n\nIt is now apparent that the Edo APC are stuck in the past, refusing to accept the reality that government has evolved and no longer dwell on the anachronistic ideas they are used to when they were in government. Today, the advances in technology deployed in public service administration, basic education reform, youth empowerment, and other areas of technology intervention are too sophisticated for them to comprehend, which is why they have elected to launch these futile attacks.\n\nWe are not surprised by this outburst as it is their stock in trade. Hence, we advise the public to be wary of the antics of the APC, their stale lies and baseless propaganda.\n\nThe PDP-led government in Edo State has and will continue to put the interest of the people over and above the interest of all others. Our programmes, reforms and initiatives are targeted at improving the quality of life and placing them at the centre of our politics. The vituperations of APC and their minions will never in any way derail this sacred mandate given freely by the majority of Edo people in September last year.\n\nAndrew Emwanta JP\n\nCommissioner for Communication and Orientation, Edo State\n\nDecember 30, 2021\n\n...",

          "title": "2022 Budget Insertions: No Rift Between Buhari, NASS \u2013 Presidency",
          "text": "The Presidency has cleared the air regarding what it described as widely-viewed/reported episode on Friday, December 31, 2021 at the State House in Abuja during the signing of the 2022 Budget and Finance Bill 2022 by President Muhammadu Buhari; specifically on the insertions in the 2022 Appropriation Act, of 6,576 new schemes worth about N37billion by the National Assembly.\n\nPresidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, in a statement on Sunday said while it is true that the President expressed disagreement with these and many of the other alterations, including the \u201creduction in the provisions for many strategic capital projects to introduce \u2018Empowerment Projects\u2019,\u201d innumerable lies were being spread about the President being \u201cangry\u201d at, had \u201cblasted\u201d or \u201clashed out\u201d at the Parliament.\n\nAccording to him, this cannot be farther from the truth.\n\nHe said as the President of the Senate, Dr Ahmed Lawan, said shortly after the budget-signing ceremony, disagreements as the ones listed by the President were normal in the everyday Executive-Parliamentary relationship because, as he explained, \u201cexecutive and legislative judgements don\u2019t always have to be the same.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said, \u201cWhile we note that there are people who are trying to create a fiasco between the two arms of government on account of the budget, we assure that they will, in the end, be disappointed.\n\n\u201cThe Executive and the 9th National Assembly have since moved away from the wild, destructive political games of the past, conducting themselves in a way that puts national interest supreme in their decisions.\n\n\u201cWe doubt if there is a patriotic citizen who wants to see the return of the operating environment engendered by the 8th Senate when an elected government was held in chains, held hostage to the desperate political ambitions of a clique, and the public denied needed services including that which impinged on national security. Happily, the 9th National Assembly is more about policy than politics.\n\n\u201cUnder the constitution, both arms of government are coequal and at the same time, independent and interdependent. The rule of the game is cooperation and the President, as a democrat fully accepts this.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShehu further stated that Mr. President was clear and candid in expressing his reservations with the numerous changes to the 2022 Budget made by the National Assembly, which would hamper its implementation.\n\nHowever, he said it was necessary to respond to critics that questioned why President assented to the Budget if it was so severely tampered with, citing reasons for the action.\n\n\u201cAlthough over 10,733 projects were reduced and 6,576 new projects were introduced into the budget by the National Assembly, there are tens of thousands more provisions in the 2022 Budget, all of which, when efficiently and effectively implemented, will have significant developmental impact on the lives and livelihoods of ordinary Nigerians.\n\n\u201cGiven Mr. President\u2019s commitment to improving the lot of the Common Man, it was felt that it would not be wise to throw away the baby with the bathwater. Ongoing Capital Projects, Critical Recurrent Votes, Priority New Projects \u2013 all feature in the 2022 Budget and Mr. President\u2019s forbearance in assenting to the Budget will save these provisions from implementation delays and other challenges.\n\nThe presidential spokesman further stated that President Buhari is a democrat who deeply believes in the supremacy of the Constitution, with its checks and balances across the three arms of Government.\n\nAccording to him, in terms of the passage of legislations like the Appropriation Act and other Money Bills, the National Assembly has equal responsibilities with the Executive.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIndeed, he noted if Mr. President had declined assent to the 2022 Appropriation Bill, the National Assembly has powers to override the President\u2019s veto if they can drum up a 2/3 majority vote as stipulated by the constitution.\n\n\u201cHappily, this situation has not arisen during the tenure of Mr. President\u2019s Administration, and the Executive\u2019s relationship with the Leadership of the 9th National Assembly is much improved over what happened with the 8th National Assembly.\n\n\u201cIt is on account of his confidence in the strength of this excellent working relationship that Mr. President has directed that an Amendment Budget Proposal should be prepared and submitted to the National Assembly, once they return from their recess.\n\n\u201cIt is hoped that the National Assembly will carefully consider and approve the 2022 Amendment Budget Proposals, once presented to them in due course, for the benefit of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is important therefore that, in place of \u201canger\u201d or confrontation, President Buhari showed the democracy-loving side of his personality as he signed the budget at the same time calling for dialogue with the parliament to resolve the contentious issues.\n\n\u201cThe Presidency under Muhammadu Buhari and the parliament under Lawal and Gbajabiamila are committed to a good neighborly relationship and this or any other disagreement between the two arms of government will not alter the dynamics of that relationship,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Since its release on Netflix on New Year\u2019s Day, Nollywood comedy film Chief Daddy 2: Going for Broke has largely been panned by movie-watchers and critics.\n\nThe film, directed by Niyi Akinmolayan and produced by EbonyLife\u2019s Mo Abudu, is a sequel of the original Chief Daddy film, which premiered in 2018.\n\nThe original film follows a ragtag group of immediate and extended family members as they struggle to claim a part of the wealth left behind by the titular Chief Daddy.\n\nIn the sequel, the struggle to claim this wealth continues.\n\nDespite its star-studded cast, including the rapper Falz and Nollywood heavyweights such as Shaffy Bello, Funke Akindele-Bello and Joke Silva, the general consensus is that the sequel would have benefited from better screenplay and direction.\n\nIn reviewing the film for The Premium Times, Onu Stephen describes it as a \u201cpointless, repetitive, and incredibly predictable sequel.\u201d\n\nReacting to the film, Nigerian screenwriter, Dami Elebe, appealed that emphasis should be given to screenplay by Nollywood filmmakers.\n\nShe tweeted, \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m happy people are having the conversation. Maybe some people in Nollywood will stop hiring writers after they\u2019ve casted and got location.\n\n\u201cMaybe some of you will give story development a chance and also pay well for it. Maybe you people will stop hiring only famous people, confusing them as influencers. Maybe talent will thrive this year.\u201d\n\nFor Twitter user @I_Am_Winter, \u201cChief Daddy 2 is such an embarrassment to Nollywood.\u201d\n\nAnother Twitter user @Innanoshe calls the film \u201can atrocious hodgepodge of terrible acting and directing and ghastly writing.\u201d\n\n@IfeanyiOlabode, however, thinks that the film benefits even from the bad publicity.\n\n\u201cThis Chief Daddy 2 strategy is working. Make an unbelievably terrible movie, make everyone talk about it. Make everyone want to watch it to confirm it\u2019s terrible,\u201d the user tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, on her Instagram page on Sunday, the film\u2019s producer and EbonyLife boss, Mo Abudu, celebrated the movie for being \u201cthe number 1 in Nigeria today\u201d on Netflix.

Mohamed Buba Marwa (Rtd) has asked all those still involved in the illicit drug business to turn over a new leaf or risk losing their freedom and assets in the new year.\n\nThe anti-drug czar in his new year message said the NDLEA and its workforce are moving into 2022 \u201cwith a resolution to rid the country of illicit substances and to continue our aggressive pursuit of drug cartels, barons and traffickers anywhere they may be within the country or even outside.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cGiven our pedigree in 2021, there should be no doubt whatsoever about our capability to carry out these stated objectives.\n\n\u201cIn the past year, we have scaled up our capability and reinvigorated our anti-narcotic activities. Our efforts have yielded arrests and interdictions. That should be a clear signal to anyone in the drug trade that the rules of the game have changed.\n\n\u201cIn 2022, our goals remain the same: to dismantle drug cartels and syndicates, and that include arresting and having drug offenders jailed by the court and ultimately to rid our society of all traces of illicit substances.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Air Force Kill Two Notorious Bandit Leaders, Several Others In Zamfara\n\nWhile leaving open a window of repentance for those in the trade, Marwa said; \u201cthere is still a window of opportunity for drug traffickers and barons: Now is the time for them to turn over a new leaf before NDLEA turn on the heat and they lose it all. Since most of them are in the business to amass wealth and now they have made fortunes from this trade that harms society, therefore, it is time to quit.\n\n\u201cWe call on them to think about the common good, to think about the future of this country, to think about the young and coming generations. Let commonsense prevail and on your own volition make a significant contribution towards the effort to have a drug-free society where peace and harmony reign.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the havoc of illicit drugs from the ugly development in parts of our nation due to drug abuse by youths and also from the general blight caused by abuse of Cannabis across the country.\n\n\u201cThose who heed this warning will thank themselves for taking the wise decision to quit the drug trade in the days ahead. Those who think and act otherwise can be assured of a tough year in 2022.\n\n\u201cThey can take a cue from what happened in 2021, where the Agency secured various jail terms for over 1, 200 drug traffickers, including nationals of other countries and we brought to book six drug barons, including those outside the country and those who had been on the run for as long as 10 years.\u201d\n\nEmphasising Nigeria\u2019s determination to win the drug war, Gen. Marwa said with the full support of President Muhammadu Buhari, the National Assembly, the Judiciary and the citizenry, NDLEA will leave no stone unturned to fulfill its mandate in 2022.\n\n\u201cIn this campaign against drug abuse and trafficking of illicit substances, the Agency has the public support 100%.\n\n\u201cThe Presidency is backing NDLEA to the hilt. Lawmakers are giving the Agency the necessary leverage. And in the court of law, as proven by recent developments, there is no respite for drug traffickers and barons. Likewise, we have a good rapport with international partners.\n\n\u201cHence, those who deal in illicit substances can be certain that NDLEA\u2019s long arms will reach them and they will face severe penalties from the law,\u201d he added.",

          "title": "With $130trn Tied to Renewables Globally, Nigeria Walks Tight Rope in Bid for Oil Sector Investment",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s desire to continue reaping the benefits of its oil and gas resources before the world fully embraces renewables may face serious headwinds this year, with the global finance community tying up over $130 trillion capital to funding carbon-free energy investments.\n\nThis means that funds available for lending to International Oil Companies (IOCs), and by extension the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited which acts as their Joint Venture (JV) partners could be severely curtailed.\n\nNigeria has continued to struggle to ramp up its production volume in the upstream of the country\u2019s oil and gas industry, but had largely failed due to years of under-investment, ageing infrastructure and inability to procure modern equipment to deter incessant oil theft and sabotage.\n\nThe much-needed investment would also enable operators adopt artificial intelligence systems as well as deploy virtual and machine learning in exploration and production.\n\nIn August last year, the country enacted the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) which was expected to stimulate necessary investments in the industry, but that dream appears to be under threat as global financing organisations continue to withdraw funding for fossils in preference for renewable sources of energy.\n\nIn its latest report, Wood Mackenzie, a global energy, research and consultancy group, noted that though the oil and gas sector would continue its rally in 2022, the positive outlook was tempered by concerns about the future of the industry.\n\nIn its oil and gas outlook for 2022, Wood Mackenzie predicted that record cash flows would come under increasing scrutiny as operators would begin to align with their pledges on decarbonisation.\n\nIt further projected that the existing cracks in the fragile service sector would widen and explorers will keep options open for the energy transition.\n\nThrough the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), over $130 trillion of private capital have now been committed to net zero from over 450 firms across 45 countries.\n\nIn its progress report published recently, GFANZ had announced that financial sector commitments to net zero exceeded $130 trillion, a 25-fold increase in the last few years.\n\nThe global funding organisations are committing more funds to renewables include banks, insurers, pension funds, asset managers, export credit agencies and stock exchanges as well as credit rating agencies, index providers and audit firms.\n\n\u201cFinancing oil and gas was getting harder before COP26, but the pressure will ratchet up in 2022. Institutions with over US$130 trillion of capital under management have joined the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero.\n\n\u201c(As we) watch for the pool of backers to shrink, borrowing costs will increase, and project financing for oil will get harder,\u201d the renowned research firm stated.\n\nDespite the upsides for this year, Wood Mackenzie stated that for many stakeholders and even some CEOs, the sector\u2019s risks outweigh the gains, stressing that \u201cthis tension will define 2022.\u201d\n\nAs a follow-up from COP26, the research firm projected that more radical moves to downsize oil and gas will take place, but however noted that, \u201copportunists\u201d could take up the slack and spend more on development and acquisitions.\n\nIt stressed that while lending would not dry up immediately, demand recovery could be halted by new global headwinds including additional Covid-19 variants, derailing prices and the promised wall of cash from upstream.\n\nStressing that oil and gas reinvestment rates remained critical to meeting demand, Wood Mackenzie made a forecast that with capital discipline prevailing, the industry could experience a 9 per cent increase in investment compared to last year.\n\n\u201cA nine per cent year-on-year increase will take spend over $400 billion again in 2022. Despite this, at 40 per cent, the global reinvestment rate will remain near record lows at our forecast price,\u201d it pointed.\n\nAccording to the firm, the focus would be on advantaged barrels, low-breakeven projects and low-carbon deepwater projects, which it noted will dominate greenfield Final Investment Decisions (FIDs).\n\nIt added that most operators would hesitate to sanction projects without short payback periods and low emissions, while companies would allocate more capital to upstream decarbonisation.\n\nIncreased transparency and emissions benchmarking reporting, it said, would put pressure on upstream players, increasing action on decarbonisation.\n\nThe firm noted that while 2021 was a big year for upstream Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), 2022 would be bigger as the world continues its push for cleaner sources of fuel.\n\nIt stated that conventional exploration would follow the disciplined path set in 2021, despite improved prices, forecasting that spend will total $20-$25 billion, led by the oil majors and larger National Oil Companies (NOCs).\n\n\u201cIn 2022, more governments might join those with exploration bans. But they are unlikely to include basins holding substantial prospective resources. Of more concern is the possibility that the development of new discoveries may be prohibited,\u201d Wood Mackenzie noted.\n\nAt a projected 1.86 million barrels daily oil production in the country\u2019s 2021 budget, Nigeria recorded a huge deficit of almost 200 million barrels of the liquid in the first 11 months of last year.\n\nNow unable to meet its Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production allocation for months and with just 12 out of the country\u2019s 53 oil rigs currently active, the oil and gas sector desperately requires huge inflow of these investments to help accelerate the pumping of more oil.\n\nChief Executive Officer, NUPRC, Gbenga Komolafe, who recently attributed the declining production to theft, insecurity, aging facilities, decline in exploration and production enhancement initiatives, noted that Nigeria was aspiring to increase its reserves to 40 billion barrels and raise production to three million barrels per day.\n\nFigures from the NURPC obtained by THISDAY last week indicated that while Nigeria was expected to pump approximately 635 million barrels of oil by November 2021, it only struggled to produce 441 million barrels for the entire period.\n\nAlthough OPEC expects Nigeria to produce 1.683 million bpd in January 2022, meeting that target would be an uphill task as the country has maintained an average of 1.25 million barrels in the last few months.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "title": "Nigeria: Private Sector Bemoans Difficulty Clearing Goods at Ports",
          "text": "Members of Nigeria\u2019s organised private sector (OPS) have advised the federal government to make deliberate efforts to remove impediments to the conduct of business in the country in 2022, especially with respect to clearing of goods at the ports, stressing that its war clearing goods at the country\u2019s seaports.\n\nAlso, following President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s promise to improve foreign exchange (FX) supply to manufacturers this year, the OPS members also appealed to the federal government to remove other hindrances to manufacturing.\n\nIn addition, they supported recent call by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, to strip the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) of the responsibility of revenue collection and generation.\n\nThe OPS advised the federal government to direct efforts toward accelerated industrialisation for the Nigerian economy in 2022.\n\nThe leaders of the real sector spoke in separate chats with THISDAY. They noted that removing hindrances to the activities of manufacturers and other key players in the country\u2019s real sector would enhance productivity, especially as Africa prepares to fully implement the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nSome of the major constraints they asked the government to address included low FX supply and poor electricity to the real sector, challenges at the country\u2019s seaports, and low patronage of made in Nigeria goods.\n\nPresident of the Nigerian Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA), Mr. Taiwo Adeniyi, told THISDAY it was important for government to do everything possible to remove all impediments to industrialisation. Adeniyi said NCS should be freed from the task of being a revenue-generating agency of government.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is important that government should pay attention to industrialisation and do everything possible to remove all the impediments affecting ability do business in this country, like the issue around our ports.\n\n\u201cEven when you struggle to bring in materials, it is war at the port to get them out. The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) is always like never wishing us to clear our goods at a time meant for them to be cleared.\n\n\u201cWe are also calling on the government to begin to consider seriously making customs a non-revenue generating agency. As long as it remains a revenue-generating agency with a target to meet, the NCS will not do its work professionally. Moreover, the NCS should be audited and published.\u201d\n\nAdeniyi also advised the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to fashion out strategy to support manufacturers in the country with improved access to forex.\n\nHe stated, \u201cYes, the president has made a promise to us. But it will remain a promise until it is implemented. What we are pleading is this: let the government prioritise manufacturers in the allocation of the little forex at its disposal.\n\n\u201cIn fairness, the government has been giving us special financing windows. But these windows are in naira. We cannot use naira to buy machines that we need to expand our operation. Most businesses that benefited from these funding were not able to use them because there was no forex.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, Director General of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Mr. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, advised the CBN to expedite the process of unifying exchange rates in the various forex windows in the country. Ajayi-Kadir said stakeholders from the private sector should be nominated to monitor the disbursement of forex by commercial banks to ensure transparent and timeous allocation to bona fide manufacturers.\n\nHe also highlighted the need for government to take steps to relieve manufacturers of the burden of spending over N73 billion annually to provide alternative energy.\n\nAjayi-Kadir said, \u201cSo the immediate step to take in 2022 is for Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to remove all the bottlenecks inhibiting manufacturers\u2019 access to the 2,000 megawatts of stranded electricity, as envisaged under the Eligible Customer Scheme.\n\n\u201cOther measures would include up-scaling efforts at further development of electricity value-chain.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cMinistries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) of government should compulsorily and strictly prioritise the patronage of made in Nigeria items in all their purchases and contracts. For instance, local manufacturers of LPG gas cylinders are specifically designated as priority providers of the 10 million cooking gas cylinders to be procured by the federal government for 12 states in the federation.\u201d\n\nHe also warned that the looming increases in excise and tax rates, especially for carbonated non-alcoholic drinks, dairy products, should be discountenanced, arguing that the manufacturing sector would not be able to accommodate any form of increase.\n\nThe MAN director general added, \u201cAs we approach the actual commencement of trading under the AfCFTA, the government should intentionally support manufacturing by creating the enabling environment, providing trade information through the commercial desks of Nigerian embassies in African countries, and up-scaling the involvement of the private sector in negotiations and implementation processes.\u201d\n\nAccording to Director General of the Nigerian Association of Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), Ambassador Ayo Olukanni, \u201cThe effective implementation of the 2022 Appropriation Act for inclusive economic growth and development should be a top priority. The real challenge is to see how the budget, which has been tagged \u2018Budget of Growth and Sustainability,\u2019 will positively impact the lives of the people and various sectors of the economy.\n\n\u201cWe must ensure that budget 2022 makes a significant impact on the energy sector if it is to be meaningful and be a budget of growth and sustainability.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for The Promotion of Private Enterprises (CPPE), Dr. Muda Yusuf, urged the government to untangle the cargo clearing processes at ports by reducing the number of agencies involved. Yusuf also canvassed the deployment of technology to aid the customs clearing process.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe use of the scanner is particularly very important. It is a sad commentary that the largest economy in Africa has been examining cargoes and containers physically and manually for the past few years. The effect of this on the cost of imports has been humongous.\n\n\u201cThe interest payment on the import, demurrage charges arising from delays, the extra charges by shipping companies, the additional charges by the truck drivers, all of these have put a lot of burden on cost on investors and citizens.\u201d\n\nDike Onwuamaeze",

          "text": "The Office of the Auditor General for the Federation (OAuGF) has disclosed that about 178,459 different types of arms and ammunition got missing from the Nigeria Police armoury in 2019, without any trace or formal report on their whereabouts. Of the figure, 88,078 were AK-47 rifles and 3,907 assorted rifles and pistols from different formations nationwide. These could not be accounted for as at January 2020.\n\nDetails of the missing arms were contained on pages 383 to 391 of the Auditor General for the Federation\u2019s annual report on non-compliance, internal control weaknesses issues in Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of the Federal Government of Nigeria for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was submitted to the National Assembly.\n\nReferenced AuGF/AR.2019/02, the report seen by THISDAY at the weekend, was dated September 15, 2021, signed by the Auditor General for the Federation, Adolphus Aghughu, and addressed to the Clerk to the National Assembly.\n\nThe report accused the Nigeria Police headquarters of lacking comprehensive details of unserviceable weapons, lamenting that such could fall into unauthorised hands for illegal use. It stated that the action of the Nigeria Police contravened paragraph 2603 of the Financial Regulations, which stipulates that in the event of any loss of stores, the officer in charge of the store in which the loss occur shall report immediately to the head of department or unit but not later than three days, by the fastest means possible if the loss occurs away from headquarters.\n\nThe AuGF report stated, \u201cAudit observed from the review of Arms Movement Register, Monthly Returns of Arms and Ammunition and Ammunition Register at the Armoury section that a total number of lost firearms as reported as at December 2018 stood at 178,459 pieces.\n\n\u201cOut of this number, 88,078 were AK-47 rifles, 3,907 assorted rifles and pistols across different police formations, which could not be accounted for as at January 2020. Formal report on the loss of firearms through dully completed Treasury Form 146 (loss of stores) were not presented for examination.\n\n\u201cRecords obtained from force armament at the Force headquarters showed 21 Police Mobile Force (PMF) Squadron, Abuja, did not report a single case of missing firearm, whereas, schedule of missing arms obtained from the same PMF showed a total number of forty six (46) missing arms between year 2000 and February 2019.\n\n\u201cThe value of the lost firearms could not be ascertained because no document relating to their cost of acquisition was presented for examination.\n\n\u201cThe above anomalies could be attributed to weaknesses in the internal control system at the Nigeria Police Force Armament. Several numbers of firearms from the review of arm issue register, monthly returns of arms and ammunitions obtained from Force Armament, Force headquarters for various States Commands, Formations, Zonal offices, Training Institutions, squadrons and physical inspection of firearms and ammunition at the Force Headquarters have become unserviceable and dysfunctional.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cSimilarly, returns were not submitted by some Police Training Institutions and some Formations, and Physical verification of firearms and ammunition at the Force Armament, Force Headquarters showed large quantity of damaged and obsolete firearms which needed to be destroyed.\n\n\u201cThe damaged and obsolete firearms and ammunition should be treated in line with Financial Regulations 2618 which requires the destruction to be carried out in such a manner as to render the firearms unusable for their original purpose.\u201d\n\nThe AuGF report also queried the police hierarchy for the award of contracts without evidence of project execution. It revealed that 10 contracts worth N1, 136,715,200.00 were awarded to a single proprietor in the name of different companies with details of the three companies as the same.\n\n\u201cThe three companies did not disclose their relationship in accordance with the fundamental principles of procurement as required by extant regulations,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe report also indicted the Nigeria Police for paying the sum of N924.985 million for 11 contracts involving construction of three units of Gunshot Spotter System, supply of 50 units of Ballistic Roller Trolley and 20 units of Ballistic Mobile Surveillance House in some selected Commands and Formations without evidence of project execution.\n\nThe report, therefore, asked the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, to provide details of the expenditure to the public accounts committees of both Senate and House of Representatives, account for the funds, and answer to other irregularities.\n\nUdora Orizu in Abuja",

Any allegations of mismanagement of security votes against sitting governors can and should be investigated pending the time they leave office and lose immunity. The findings of such investigation can also be the basis for initiating impeachment proceedings against any indicted governor.\n\n\u201cSERAP urges you to instruct the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) to jointly track and monitor spending of security votes by the 36 state governors.\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 14 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter.
