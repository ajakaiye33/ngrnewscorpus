          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nFormer President of the Nigerian Medical Association, Prof. Mike Ogirima has asked the Minister of Labour and Productivity, Dr. Chris Ngige, to stop issuing threats to the striking doctors under the aegis of the National Association of Resident Doctors.\n\nOgirima noted that Nigige should rather invite the doctors for negotiation to resolve issues relating to the strike.\n\nAccording to the Professor of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery, the Federal Government cannot solve the problem of the doctors by resorting to threat.\n\nThe former NMA boss made the call during an exclusive interview with PUNCH HealthWise.\n\nHe expressed concern over the government\u2019s incessant failure to fulfill its part of an agreement reached with doctors as well as other labour unions.\n\nRecall that Ngige had last week announced that the Federal Government will invoke the no-work-no-pay policy this week against the striking doctors.\n\nBut President of NARD, Dr. Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi while reacting to the minister\u2019s threat said the threat will not in any way compel members of the association to call off their ongoing strike now on its ninth day.\n\nOkhuaihesuyi said members of NARD were not moved by the threat by Ngige, insisting they were determined to stand their ground against every form of intimidation.\n\nNARD had on August 2 began a nationwide industrial action over unpaid salaries, benefits to families of members that lost their lives to COVID-19 pandemic and hazard allowances, improved conditions, and failure to domesticate Medical Residency Training Act 2017 in states, among others.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise over the impasse between NARD and the Federal Government, Prof. Ogirima pleaded with the striking doctors and their employer to go to the round table to negotiate and discuss how to resolve the ongoing issues of the resident doctors.\n\nHe said, \u201cThey should try and narrow the gap, patients are suffering. The Federal Government has gone into agreement with the resident doctors and with other professionals. But how far has the government implemented such an agreement? The trust of the resident doctors in the Federal Government is no longer there.\n\n\u201cThe no-work-no-pay clause has been there; of course the resident doctors are prepared for that. It\u2019s like you marched an animal to slaughter and you are expecting the animal at the abattoir to be scared of the knife again.\n\n\u201cI think the minister should mellow down on the choice of words he is using. The resident doctors are mature enough and you can\u2019t win a war by threatening. The minister should be more diplomatic in handling this issue.\u201d\n\nThe former NMA leader reminded the Federal Government that the threat would worsen the situation, stressing that already, many doctors are leaving the country, especially the senior ones.\n\nProf. Ogirima noted, \u201cThe government should check its policies and look inwards to solve the masses\u2019 problem. If you say you are going to sack over 16,000 resident doctors; how are you going to get those doctors back even in the next year?\n\n\u201cMy stand is that the Federal Government should not issue threats to the striking doctors. Ngige is a public servant and should not be tired of negotiating with the doctors. He can\u2019t be tired; that is his work.\u201d he said.\n\nThe professor also advised the resident doctors to continue negotiating with the Federal Government.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

Says additional 5 m targeted before 2023\n\nBy Steve Oko\n\nNo fewer than 197,140 primary school pupils from Abia are currently benefiting from the Home Grown School Feeding Programme of the federal government.\n\nMrs Florence Chukwude of the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Social Development who disclosed this in an interview with newsmen in Abia said 9 million pupils nationwide were currently benefiting from the scheme.\n\nMrs Chukwude who is the Abia Team Lead on the federal government verification task force said the federal government had given the Ministry mandate to reach additional 5 million pupils by 2023.\n\nChukwude, who represented the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq, said the exercise was designed to enable the ministry to \u201cverify, validate and analyse the data from Abia\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe essence of the capturing and enumeration of pupils and schools was to ensure transparency, accountability and sustainability of the programme,\u201d she said.\n\nChukwude said the ministry would in September capture the schools that were not yet on the scheme in order to upgrade the number of benefitting schools from Abia.\n\nShe said the Federal Government initiated the programme in 2017 for pupils in primary one to three to cushion the effect of the harsh economy on parents and guardians.\n\nShe expressed joy that the objective of the programme as envisioned by President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister was being realised.\n\nShe said that the programme had not only shored up school enrollment but had created employment opportunities for the food vendors engaged in the scheme.\n\n\u201d It has also improved local food production thereby enhancing the social welfare of our farmers\u201d, she added.\n\nShe said that 1,030 public schools in Abia were currently on the programme but added that the number could increase by September.\n\nSpeaking also, the Programme Manager, Abia School Feeding, Elder Gabriel Ahuruonye, said that the \u201cFederal Government injects N450 million every month\u201d into the programme.\n\nThe money according to him is paid directly to the account of food vendors engaged in the programme.\n\nElder Ahuruonye who lauded the federal government said the programme had been a tremendous success in the state.\n\nAccording to him, while the federal government feeds pupils from primary one to primary three, the state government complements the efforts by feeding pupils from Nursery one to three, as well as primary four to six.\n\nHe said that school enrollment had increased by 85% across the board since the exercise commenced in 2016.\n\nThe team visited Ahieke Community Primary School and Ugba Primary School where it monitored the feeding of pupils.\n\nHeadmistress of Ahieke Community Primary School, Mrs Ezioma Nwachukwu, lauded the programme saying it has helped to improve school enrollment.\n\n\u201cWe recorded a substantial increase in the number of enrollment courtesy of the programme.\n\n\u201cIt has also been a source of incentive to pupils to come to school regularly.\n\n\u201cThey are always enthusiastic to come to school once they remember the meal,\u201d Nwachukwu said.",

And the greatest nations in the world are multi-racial, multi-religious, and multi-ethnic.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, some of these things are as important as the economy and security\u2026. for the reason that a united people, people who see themselves as one, are more likely to be economically successful, more likely to be able to secure themselves and secure their borders, and more likely to work together for the goodness and greatness of their people.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the Prof. Osinbajo told his guests that were on a courtesy visit that \u201cit is the duty of the leadership, not just political leadership, but also the leadership of social groups and organizations such as yours, to ensure that we are focused on these issues of unity and tolerance.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: National security, economic success, greatness more likely with unity, tolerance \u2015 Osinbajo\n\nHe explained further that \u201cas you know, religious tolerance and unity, is for me, a matter that goes beyond mere advocacy. I believe very strongly that the greatness of nations, wherever those nations may be, have always been on account of leaders who thought it fit to build those nations on the basis of unity and tolerance.\n\n\u201cI think that it is such an important issue that we cannot afford to discount it. There is a need for us to pay more time and attention to these issues in whatever way we can because every once in a while, we see some threats to the unity of our country, and we must not allow it to happen at all, we must continue not just in the advocacy, but in action that will bring about unity and religious tolerance,\u201d Prof. Osinbajo added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the leader of the delegation, Alhaji Maidabino commended Prof. Osinbajo for his innovative approach to governance and the several initiatives of the Buhari administration anchored through his office and prayed God to provide the opportunity to enable him continue to serve the nation.\n\nAlhaji Maidabino noted that through schemes such as TraderMoni, National Homegrown School Feeding Programme, N-Power, and the Ease of Doing Business initiative, among others, the Vice President has impacted many Nigerians across different sectors.\n\nHis words: \u201cwe wish to commend and congratulate you for your contributions in the area of promotion of good governance, transparency, and efficiency as exemplified with the core principles behind the Ease of Doing Business initiative of this government, and for the continuation of your uncompromising dedication to peace, unity, and economic progress, among others.\u201d\n\nHe informed the Vice President of plans by the group to convene a national forum on unity as part of its contributions to entrenching peaceful coexistence and unity among Nigerians.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\u2022Ruling party\u2019s govs back Buni, as Secondus survives in no victor, no vanquished decision\n\nChuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Treasure Chinelobi in Abuja\n\nConscious of the implications of the current state of their parties to surviving the next general election, the leaderships of both the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), have finally got a hold of their respective challenges, setting the parties on new opportunities.\n\nIn the APC, the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), umbrella body for governors elected on the platform of party, has reaffirmed its support for the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Committee of the party led by the Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni and asked it to proceed with the conduct of the local government and state congresses, as well as the national convention of the party, in line with the mandate of the National Executive Committee (NEC).\n\nHowever, in the PDP, after two major meetings of the party\u2019s stakeholders and Board of Trustees (BoT) members, its leadership agreed to allow the Uche Secondus National Working Committee (NWC) to continue in office till the next national convention, which has been brought forward from December to October, but with an understanding that the current NWC members would not seek re-election.\n\nThe APC governors, in a communique issued yesterday and signed by its chairman and Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, following a meeting on Sunday, in Abuja, said after further reviewing the situation, they were convinced that their decision was well informed.\n\nBut a group of party members under the banner of Concerned APC Stakeholders, hasalleged that the caretaker committee of the party and some second term governors were bent on making sure the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) regained power in 2023.\n\nThe Forum said it further reviewed progress being made by the APC Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee in its effort to rebuild structures of the party at all levels and commended members of the committee led by Buni for the successful conduct of the ward congresses across the country.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, Forum reaffirmed its support for the Caretaker Committee to proceed to conduct local government, state congresses and national convention, in line with the mandate of the National Executive Committee.\n\n\u201cForum was further briefed on the July 28, 2021, judgement of the Supreme Court on Ondo State 2020 Governorship election and recognised that the legal status of both the APC Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee as well as its composition has been legally settled.\u201d\n\nHaving reviewed progress in the party, the Forum commended all party members for theircommitment towards rebuilding the party, adding that, it noted with satisfaction reports from various states of commendable mobilisation and participation in the July 31st, 2021 ward congresses, which was successful.\n\nOn the ongoing strike by the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), the Forum stressed that grievances of the Resident Doctors were with state governments, and therefore appealed to them to negotiate with individual state governments and issues affecting them.\n\nThe Forum endorsed the initiative of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) and supported the call by the federal government through the Minister of Labour, Dr. Chris Ngige for the immediate suspension of the strike to allow negotiations to continue.\n\n\u201cNoting that most of the grievances of the Resident Doctors are with State governments, Forum appealed to the Resident Doctors to negotiate with individual state governments and issues affecting Resident Doctors in federal establishments should be negotiated with the relevant structures of the federal government,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Concerned APC Stakeholders, have insisted that the recent Supreme Court pronouncement on the Ondo governorship election, which suggested that the Buni-led committee was not constitutional and as such could not organise valid congresses, signalled judicial problems that could cost the APC in future elections.\n\nThe group, in a statement issued Tuesday by its spokesperson, Mr. Abdulahi Dauda, insisted that the caretaker committee remained illegal going by the apex court pronouncement.\n\nIn the group\u2019s statement signed by its spokesperson, Abdulahi Dauda, the group insisted that only a duly constituted National Executive Committee (NEC) could validly hold congresses or nominate candidates and not the Buni-led Caretaker committee.\n\n\u201cBuni is the governor of Yobe State but doubles as APC caretaker chairman, a development,which is at the heart of the current crisis in the party,\u201d said the group, which noted that the caretaker committee was unknown to the party\u2019s constitution and that it was operating without reference to the party\u2019s constitution\n\nIt added: \u201cFor the love of our great party, we asked that the leaders of our party and those,who genuinely love our party to rise up now and stop Buni and his second term governors that have spent 8yrs and have nothing to lose if the courts hand victory to PDP in 2023 through court pronouncement.\u201d\n\nThe group was of the view that there was need for the caretaker committee to stop running the affairs of the party, as all their activities were not recognised in the APC constitution and therefore, illegal.\n\n\u201cIf not controlled or expeditiously managed, the caretaker committee may end up becoming a disgrace and will spell doom for the party. that is why we are here to raise our voices as we don\u2019t want the party we laboured for to go into extinction like it happened in Rivers, Bayelsa and Zamfara,\u201d it said.\n\nIn the PDP, sources told THISDAY that the decision by the Secondus NWC to jettison re-election at the national convention, which has just been brought forward to a new date, was a gentleman understanding out of their freewill, seeing too that they had to shift grounds in collective interest, and in a no victor, no vanquished resolution. The governors, THISDAY learnt had earlier come into the meeting with a position to exclude NWC members from the election. But this was opposed by some members who pointed out the illegality of such a move.\n\nEven the gentleman understanding by the NWC members was said not to have gone down well with some members of the party, who described the decision as illegal and unconstitutional, leaving the door open for a possible challenge at a later date.\n\nAlso, the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, has dismissed any such thing, saying \u201cthe party wishes to clarify that no decision was taken to bar any member of the NWC from exercising his or her rights under the constitution of the PDP to contest in the forthcoming National Convention of the party,\u201d his position has been dismissed as a volte face by other members of the party.\n\nOlogbondiyan said the explanation had become imperative given misrepresentations of the outcome of the intervention by elders and leaders of the party on the challenges faced by the PDP, adding: \u201cWhile the PDP has put these challenges behind it, the NWC states that it will continue to adapt itself to the Constitution, traditions and practices of the party in carrying out its responsibilities.\u201d\n\nBut despite Ologbondiyan\u2019s explanation, party leadership hierarchs, members as well its supporters, breathed a sigh of relief that some form of peace has been achieved, quelling the raging inferno that had engulfed its ranks in the last few weeks.\n\nThe first meeting was learnt, comprised mainly members of the BoT, current and former governors, former ministers, former Senators and former Presiding and principal officers of the National Assembly, while the second one included the other stakeholders of the party at different levels.\n\nTHISDAY further gathered that the path to the success recorded at yesterday\u2019s meetings had been prepared since Monday, August 9, 2021, when during the meeting of the governors, Secondus and his estranged ally, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, believed to be responsible for his plight, were brought together to confront each other and disclose to the sitting what the exact problem was.\n\nThis is in addition to the fact that THISDAY had exclusively reported yesterday that the party was planning to bring forward its national convention as part of the new deals, preceding the search for a lasting peace, going forward.\n\nAfter both men had allegedly addressed the gathering, especially, that they also saw the need to sheathe their swords in the interest and future of the party, more so with Wike allegedly consenting to the fact that reconciliation was imperative since Secondus would eventually retire to the state, they were both asked to agree to abide by whatever would be arrived at after yesterday\u2019s meeting and they did.\n\nThus, at the joint meeting of the PDP stakeholders, yesterday, convened by the BoT, the party not only succeeded in resolving its leadership crisis, Secondus also survived the plot to remove him from office, even though he had to sacrifice the collective re-election bid (if there was any) of the NWC members.\n\nTo that extent, the governors, BoT members and other stakeholders of the party immediately approved the suggestion to bring forward the date for the party\u2019s national convention, while at the same time, proposed a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting for some time next week, where other pending issues could he addressed.\n\nSecondus is expected to summon NEC for next week to allow the PDP discuss her zoning plans and set up a committee to that effect as well as constitute another committee for the convention, which has been slated tentatively to hold by the end of October.\n\nChairman of the PDP Governors Forum, Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State, while explaining why the party had to come round its internal challenge, dismissed speculations that more PDP governors might still defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC), saying there was neither a party nor government to go to.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen, after the crisis had been resolved, Tambuwal, surrounded by Wike, Secondus and other governors, said the party had no other option but to resolve the crisis because of what was ahead of it.\n\nHis words: \u201cAs party members of the BoT, members of the governor forum, members of former governors forum, former ministers, former Senators, former Presiding officer of the National Assembly and various stakeholders, we are very happy to announce that we have discussed all matters and we have resolved to continue to work as a united family.\n\n\u201cThis meeting has agreed that immediately, the NEC should be convened for the party to constitute the National Convention planning committee and the National Convention should be held latest by the end of October. Also, the zoning committee for the party should also be constituted by the same NEC immediately.\n\n\u201cSo, we thank members of the National Committee for holding up. We thank them for their prayers and support. We also thank well-meaning Nigerians, who have been waiting patiently for the resolution of these issues.\n\n\u201cThe NEC of the party shall meet most likely next week and all the issues will be addressed. And that NEC will be convened by the chairman of the party, who is constitutionally empowered to do so.\u201d Tambuwal stated.\n\nExplaining why stakeholders unanimously resolved to ensure unity in the party, the Sokoto governor said, \u201cYou can see clearly that 13 governors of our party, who are our ambassadors are in this meeting, fully committed to not only resolving the issues at hand, but also working assiduously towards delivering good governance in our respective states and moving our party forward.\n\n\u201cSpeaking on behalf of my colleagues, we have resolved; we are committed to remaining in PDP. Disregard any rumour, every rumour that any of these distinguished leaders are going anywhere. We are in PDP; we are going to remain in PDP and by the grace of God, we shall be working together to salvage Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf you say you\u2019re going somewhere, where will you go? APC is no party. They do not have a ward structures as we speak. They do not have a local government structure as we speak. They do not have a state structure as we speak. They do not have national structure as we speak.\n\n\u201cAPC has never had, and is not having a Board of Trustees. So, where are you going? Are you defecting to federal government? Federal government is not there, because if it is there, asked my colleagues, who are in APC. One of them came out to say that when his students were abducted, that he saw no help.\n\n\u201cHe received no help from the federal government, and he is a governor of APC. So, what are we talking about? There is no party to defect to; there is no government to defect. We better remain together and work together, reinvent our party, and work towards the establishment of government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,\u201d, chairman, PDP governors said.\n\nIn yet another statement on how the crisis was resolved, Tambuwal said that There were extensive consultations with all major stakeholders in the party with a view to bringing all tendencies within together in view of the urgent task facing the PDP as the only viable vehicle to checkmate the abysmally poor governance of the APC-led federal government.\n\n\u201cThe meeting deliberated extensively on the issues thrown up and resolved as follows: That the Constitution, traditions and practices of the party should be strictly adhered to in finding solutions to any problems.\n\n\u201cThat all parties should sheath their sword in the greater interest of the PDP and the need to rescue Nigeria from the avoidable National malaise and drift occasioned by the APC administration.\n\n\u201cThat all processes leading to an early National Convention in October be immediately activated by relevant party organs, especially, National Executive Committee (NEC).\n\n\u201cThat the party should redouble efforts to provide a credible alternative leadership for Nigeria as it still remains the only hope for the Nigerian people for good governance.\n\n\u201cThe meeting requested the NEC to immediately constitute a Zoning Committee for Party Offices and another Committee for National elective Offices.\n\nThe meeting expressed appreciation to party elders for their commitment and wisdom in handling Party affairs. We shall overcome and restore peace, security and development once again to Nigeria,\u201d, he stated.\n\nIn his opening address, Chairman, PDP\u2019s BoT, Senator Walid Jubrin said the expanded meeting of the stakeholders was called to find solutions to the problems affecting the party.\n\nNoting that it was the reason all the 13 governors and deputy governor of Zamfara State were in attendance, he however told the gathering that a former vice president of the country, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar sent his apologies.\n\nSecondus, while briefing the meeting, said the PDP, which belonged to all had reinventeditself and as such, nothing would be difficult in the current challenge to resolve.\n\nIt was gathered that Secondus allegedly told the meeting that the October date for the national convention might not be possible as the party has other activities lined up in October. Competent sources close to the Chairman, believe November would be a more realistic preposition.\n\nHe was alleged to have been overruled but that the NEC should be allowed to decide since it is the final decision-making organ on all party matters.\n\nSenate Minority Whip, Senator Philip Aduda, who represented Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe said, there would be no progress without peace, the need for a quick resolution of the leadership crisis.\n\n\u201cNigerians are waiting to see how we will come out stronger. No meaningful achievements without peace,\u201d he said and commended the BoT for initiating a peaceful process.\n\nAlso, Hon. Segundo Adekoya, the House of Representatives Whip, who represented the House Leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, said, \u201cI have come to tell this gathering the leadership of House is behind the party. Whatever it takes at the National Assembly level, it would be done. We are solidly behind you. No more intimidation.\u201d\n\nPDP e-Registration of New Members\n\nMeanwhile, chairman of the PDP e-registration of new members and revalidation exercise, Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, has said the party was targeting about 40 million new members during the exercise.\n\nHe said since the exercise started Monday, over 10000 members have already registered for the party.\n\nGovernor Obaseki explained that with the speed Nigerians were registering for the party, its victory in 2023 general election would be an accomplished mission.\n\nObaseki, who spoke at the BoT meeting of the party said, \u201cOur target is to register 40 million Nigerians as members of PDP and once we achieve that, we shall win every election landslide going forward and there will be no bases to cheat us as was done in the past\u201d.\n\nHinting on details of the e-Registration exercise, he said, \u201cI want to reiterate that the process of e-registration is local; it is meant for us leaders at the ward level and at the local government level to own our party, the PDP.\n\n\u201cEvery leader must now show us their followers by registering their followers as members of the party, PDP. Once you have registered and completed the process, your party card will be printed here at the party Secretariat and sent to the ward for distribution to members of the party,\u201d he explained.\n\nOn the overall update of the exercise that started Monday, Obaseki said, \u201cAs at today, we are launching a pilot of the resignation exercise using the following state as pilot: Adamawa, Ekiti, Osun, where we almost have 250,000 new voters registered mostly by our party in the ongoing continuous voter registration exercise.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea is to make sure that the bulk of those new voters are members of our party and will work for our party in the upcoming election in Osun State. The other states are Taraba, Anambra, Enugu and Edo States. We will run a pilot from today till Sunday this week and from Monday next week, we shall commence a full national rollout,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

(cuts in)Anonymous: By the way; is he from Yola south?\nAdamu: As for me, being a party administrator, even Buhari himself, what is his impact on the party?\nHow I wish he had contracted the deadly corona virus, so that Osinbajo would take over...

          "text": "Royal Dutch Shell will continue to run Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo) despite moves to divest from its shallow water and onshore oil assets in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSNEPCo, Shell\u2019s 100 percent business, pioneered the deepwater oil and gas production from the Bonga field in the Gulf of Guinea, where depths reach more than 1,000 metres.\n\nTen days ago, the company appointed Elohor Aiboni as its first female managing director in the more than six decades of its operations in Nigeria.\n\nIn a report seen by TheCable, the Wood Mackenzie group, an analytical and consulting firm, analysed the company\u2019s deepwater business in Nigeria and the valuation of its assets ahead of the final closure of divestment moves.\n\nThe report said Shell is preparing for a new era in Nigeria with a much smaller, advantaged portfolio after \u201cdecades of dominance,\u201d citing the energy company\u2019s SNEPCo, which is centred on OML 118.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIts deepwater business run by SNEPCo is centred on OML 118. That\u2019s been hugely successful since Bonga came onstream in 2005. Deepwater Nigeria offers economic advantage through the scale and quality of the reservoirs and resources; as well as lower emissions intensity through a single production hub,\u201d the report reads.\n\n\u201cA new negotiated set of fiscal terms similar to the original vintage will enable fresh investment. And, of course, it is removed from the risks of the onshore delta.\n\n\u201cProduction from OML 118 will grow later in the decade driven by new wells on Bonga North, and eventually the long-awaited Bonga SW, although FID there will be next year at best.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe document also showed Shell\u2019s plan to divest all of its operated joint venture (JV) licences held by the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC). The licences include a 30 percent interest in 19 Oil Mining Leases (OMLs).\n\nIt further stated that expressions of interest (EoI) for the acquisition of Shell\u2019s stake in the OMLs are due by September 10.\n\n\u201cRather than sell single OMLs, Shell is seeking buyers for asset packages in the eastern, western and shallow water delta,\u201d the document further reads.\n\n\u201cBefore all that though, Shell must negotiate with NNPC (holder of 55% in the JV assets), on the terms of a sale. This could cover NNPC\u2019s pre-emption rights, treatment of outstanding JV liabilities including decommissioning, the fate of the JV\u2019s terminals, transfer of staff, and host community approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShell\u2019s priority is identifying credible buyers and ensuring deal completion. It wants to limit negotiations to hand-picked bidders only, thus avoiding a long drawn-out process. But it needs NNPC\u2019s buy-in.\u201d\n\nSHELL MAY MAINTAIN INDIRECT INTEREST IN OMLS\n\nShell noted that not many buyers want high-cost, emissions-intensive assets in the Niger Delta.\n\nBut it added that Nigerian independents and new entrants were eager to acquire under-invested assets with plenty of volume upside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShell itself may provide finance to help smooth deals. It may even maintain an indirect interest in the OMLs, perhaps within a special purpose vehicle, coupled with a clear exit strategy,\u201d the document reads.\n\n\u201cThis would get assets off the balance sheet and provide more comfort to lenders. Contingent payments might also feature. Innovative solutions will be needed.\n\n\u201cA complete sell-off would be historic. However, all 19 OMLs will be extremely hard to shift in the current environment. Expressions of interest are due by 10 September.\u201d\n\nSHELL\u2019S JV PORTFOLIO WORTH \u2018$2.3 BILLION\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe analytical and research consulting group added that Shell\u2019s JV assets in Nigeria are valued at $2.3 billion.\n\n\u201cThere could be as much as 4 billion boe (30% net) across the JV. However, we consider only 20% to be commercial due to a lack of investment, crude theft, insecurity and gas market constraints. Five of the OMLs are undeveloped.\n\n\u201cOur valuation of Shell\u2019s 30% in the JV (excluding export pipelines and terminals) is US$2.3 billion, (NPV10, Jan 2021, US$50 long-term oil price). But this is based on the current sub-optimal, business-as-usual investment profile.\n\n\u201cA competent buyer/operator, giving priority to the assets, could commercialise much more than 20% of the resource base, although the availability of funding for the JV partners will, as ever, dictate how much.\n\n\u201cThe recently passed PIB overhauls the fiscal regime offering materially lower oil royalties and taxes. Hence, there is much more\n\nupside than downside to our base case, which bidders will need to carefully quantify.\u201d\n\nIn May, Royal Dutch Shell had said it was involved in discussions with the federal government to sell its onshore oil assets in Nigeria.\n\nBen van Beurden, chief executive officer of Shell, said the oil giant can no longer be exposed to the risk of theft and sabotage in the Niger Delta.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) agreed to pay the N45.9 billion awarded to the Ogoni people of Rivers state as compensation for oil spills in their communities \u2014 11 years after a court judgement.\n\nIn January, a Dutch court also ruled that the company pay for damages caused by oil spills in the Niger Delta region.

          "title": "Adam Molai: \u201cAll that glitters is not gold, Investors often fall for presentation bias\u201d",
          "text": "By the age of ten, Adam Molai had learnt that the only way to have his own money was to engage in trading.\n\nHe grew up spending his holidays working in his father\u2019s supermarket in Zimbabwe. It was through this experience that he learnt the fundamental principle of business: demand and supply. Selling items he bought from his father\u2019s supermarket at a higher price in a different part of the town meant he always had money.\n\nYears later after obtaining a degree in business from Lakehead University in Canada he returned to Zimbabwe to start the Pacific Cigarette company (formerly Savannah Tobacco). His company went on to break the monopoly that British American Tobacco had in Southern Africa. So far the Pacific Cigarette company has directly created over 250 jobs and contributed to about $100m worth of tobacco exports from Zimbabwe, Africa\u2019s largest producer and exporter of tobacco.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and through Jua Fund, he has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove and many others.\n\nThis edition of Ask an Investor is an adaptation of a TechCabal Live conversation between TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye and Adam Molai.\n\nSeed funding makes up a significant portion of VC funding in Africa, between 2014 \u2013 2020 they accounted for a third of VC funding in Africa. However, when you look at the investment size they\u2019re mostly small cheque size deals because interest in the space is still growing amidst many challenges like lack of context about investing in African startups and poor fund management on the part of startups.\n\nIn this conversation, Adam Molai answered different questions about dealing with the challenges of early-stage investment in startups both from an investor and startup perspective.\n\nKoromone Koroye: What do you look for when deciding who to invest in?\n\nAdam Molai: Most importantly we look at the passion of the entrepreneur. Entrepreneurship is a tough journey that tests you in ways you never imagined. Unless you\u2019re truly passionate about the project, the likelihood of staying through the project is little.\n\nWe look at their knowledge of the business, from a macro and micro perspective. Do they know who the current players are? How can their product come in and create a blue ocean in this industry? Ultimately, if you\u2019re not differentiated you\u2019re not competitive.\n\nHow deeply have they thought through their implementation because every idea is a great idea but it\u2019s how you implement it. Have they gone beyond the what and gotten into answering how they ensure they see this project through? They need to know who is going to do what and what skills they need to see this project through, also when and how they plan to get the skills.\n\nKK: How can policy makers improve the landscape for entrepreneurs?\n\nAM: Our landscape on the continent hasn\u2019t yet evolved to embrace us as Africans and our ideas. Rather it has developed to support foreign direct investments \u2014 foreigners coming to invest in our environment, not enough is being done to develop a framework that\u2019s aligned with local investors. My advice is to start looking at what the needs of local investors and foreign investors are. They need to lower the bar for local investors in terms of taxation and other incentives.\n\nWe need to have more confidence in our own people. One of the challenges local investors have is that regulators are familiar with them. They look at them and say, \u2018look at this young lad, I know him, he grew up in my village or town,\u2019 so already they\u2019ve minimized what you\u2019re presenting and already they\u2019re not taking you seriously. I think we need to take out some of the prejudices and stop seeing investors from a different environment or background as better.\n\nI think we need to start with the right mindset, then level the playing field for local and foreign investors. We should do this first before working on a framework that favours all.\n\nKK: What are some common misconceptions around early-stage investing in Africa and how they limit the opportunities available to startups\n\nAM: We don\u2019t look too far as entrepreneurs. Often we go conventional for example in the type of funding available. There\u2019s not enough work being done by entrepreneurs to look for alternative sources of funding. VC is still developing in Africa, if you look at 2020 alone, there was a 44% increase in tech rounds on the continent and there was a reduction in the total funding (from $2.2b in 2019 to $1.43b). That\u2019s $1.43b that very few of our local entrepreneurs are aware of.\n\nWhen we launched the Jua fund, within a month we had 700 applicants that came from the continent. Yes, 700 sounds significant, but compared to the number of people in need of funding, it doesn\u2019t look like people are out there hunting for funding. We need to move away from convention and encourage entrepreneurs and look at who is coming in with new sources of capital and how do we access these sources of capital.\n\nKK: How can African companies on the radar increase their prospects of attracting funding?\n\nAM: It starts with initiatives like the Jua fund, remember foreigners would take a cue from locals, so if foreigners see us as local investors showing confidence in our people then they\u2019ll come along as co-investors. One of the common issues foreign investors face is that they don\u2019t understand the African landscape. So if they see me as Adam, an African investing fellow Africans, they\u2019re more willing to come alongside me, knowing that I have a better understanding and knowledge of the African landscape.\n\nSo the more Africans we can get investing in the continent and entrepreneurs the more foreigners we\u2019re going to start attracting.\n\nKK: What has been your experience in funding early-stage startups and what are the best practices startups should adopt?\n\nAM: Let\u2019s start from the end. When startups start the application process they should be looking at what the due diligence requirements are. They should be thinking of the requirements that they need to fulfil upon successfully obtaining the fund.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund what should I put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\n\nIt\u2019s important that when pitches are being done, there\u2019s truthfulness in the submission. What you don\u2019t want is to go through a tough competition and then suddenly you can\u2019t raise funds because you\u2019ve been flagged as not being credible. I think it\u2019s important to state the difference between what\u2019s available in the present and what\u2019ll be available in the future.\n\nKK: What are some common mistakes investors make in selecting which startups to fund?\n\nAM: All that glitters is not gold. Investors often fall for presentation bias, some people are fantastic at presenting, others are not great at presenting but have a solid business. Over time investors have to be able to differentiate the substance from the hot air. Often because you\u2019re looking for passion, it\u2019s very easy to confuse passion for great presentation skills. We\u2019ve got to be able to separate the two. Investors need to develop a lens to differentiate the presentation and substance. Most times investors only note the lack of substance when they start going into deeper interrogation of the project, this is something that they could have picked up early on without the presentation bias.\n\nKK: For early-stage entrepreneurs what other challenges do you think they face outside funding?\n\nAM: We need to start walking the entrepreneurs from the stage of developing the ideas to turning it into a business. Also educating entrepreneurs to look at the problems they\u2019re solving using multiple lenses and thinking of different use cases for their solutions.\n\nFor example, there was an entrepreneur who sold computers that are solar powered but what we saw that was bigger than the solar panel computers was that each of these panels could serve as a base station for a very rudimentary cell network that has long distances.\n\nIn another scenario, there was a company that was producing Soy milk, which had no idea of how to increase its sales volumes. They then did some research and found that it helps reduce the strong pungent smells that come from some of the African food we eat. With this alternative use, they were better able to market their product and increased their sales volume.\n\nEarly-stage entrepreneurs should be thinking of how they can find alternative use cases so that as they\u2019re marketing their product they\u2019re finding multiple use cases and revenue streams.\n\nAudience: How can upcoming businesses thrive in an environment where the only lenders are short term lenders?\n\nAM: I\u2019m always reticent when it comes to short term funding because one of the most basic tenets of finance is what we call the matching principle. In this case, it has to do with matching the tenure of your requirements with the tenure of the financing that you seek. To seek short term funding for a long term project is like seeking short term funding to buy a house. If you get a short term funding how do you meet repayments? It means you\u2019re damned before you start.\n\nI believe for short term financing to work you need to have already negotiated that upon hitting some milestones,once you meet the short term condition you\u2019ll have access to long term funding.\n\nOnly in that case will I advise people to use short term funding, because their next level of funding has been fully assured, not promised or probable.\n\nAudience: How does a company balance timing between the transition from proof of concept to fundraising?\n\nAM: I think the right time is when you\u2019ve stress-tested your concept so that when you\u2019re approaching those people, you won\u2019t be approaching them as if you\u2019re coming to present a half baked product.\n\nThere are fewer things investors frown upon like someone who has walked two steps for a ten-step journey. There are certain minimums that should be there. You need to be sure that you\u2019ve stress-tested it from multiple angles and that it\u2019s robust enough.\n\nAudience: What is needed to change the landscape to accommodate bleeding edge technologies like quantum biotech and cleantech?\n\nAM: Right now, we invested $1m through the Jua fund into a big data supply chain entity. What did I know about big data and supply chains? What did our peers know about it? Very little. We took the leap because of the way the project was fully researched, thought through. They were very clear about the next steps they\u2019ll take to see it through. We took that leap of faith because the work has been done. As an investor, we don\u2019t need to fully understand. I remember telling them, I don\u2019t understand your business but I love it.\n\nThe concept and solution being presented were so clear that it was meeting a pain point that was in the market.\n\nAudience: Are investors keen and willing to embrace impact entrepreneurs?\n\nAM: Yes they are, what we\u2019re looking for are businesses that offer maximum impact for the continent. It can start in one industry but scale-out for other industries.\n\nRecently, I was speaking to an impact entrepreneur we\u2019ve backed with about $250k in. They built zero-emission cooking pallets and are selling carbon credits. Their solution solves the pollution and deforestation because people are cutting down trees to get wood for cooking\n\nAudience: What\u2019s the roadmap for the due diligence process for startups registered in different countries ?\n\nAM: We see this a lot in tech, a lot of people go register in Delaware, then when they come and pitch to investors they come as a Nigerian company. Now expect that that company\u2019s due diligence would be done like that of a Nigerian company. Often only after further investigation do we notice that it\u2019s actually registered in Delaware, so we start asking for due diligence requirements for Delaware entities.\n\nI\u2019m just giving you a basic example of some due diligence issues that come up. There have been instances where the location of the founders is different from the location of the business. We\u2019re looking at the fact that you as the founder have to be on the ground running that business. How would you do that? There has to be some congruence with all your facts stated about your business?\n\nNow granted, sometimes companies need to have dual locations, for example, you\u2019re a fintech Nigerian company that\u2019s also registered in the United States.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to do. you need to give a schematic that shows your company\u2019s architecture explaining why it\u2019s the way it is. What we don\u2019t want to do as investors is to invest in one entity not knowing that there are four entities. In some cases, the one you\u2019re investing in does all the spending, while the ones you haven\u2019t invested in generate all the profit. We need to be sure that the entire architecture is tied together.\n\nAudience: What\u2019s a startup you invested in but initially doubted in, how were you able to overcome this?\n\nAM: The ones that I can talk about aren\u2019t within the Jua Fund, because we only started dispersing funds two months ago. There was one instance where we couldn\u2019t fully understand a founder who approached us with an idea for a restaurant business. It was one of those moments where you say it\u2019s not a big investment, let\u2019s give them the benefit of the doubt. I\u2019ve never been in the food industry and we said let\u2019s go for it.\n\nWhat we saw after investing and the evolution of the business was that, had it not been for COVID I believe they would have been able to roll it out as a franchise,\n\nAudience: How many milestones should a startup cross before approaching startups?\n\nAM: I\u2019ve always said the more data points that are available and presented, the stronger the picture you present. So my advice is to get as much done as is feasible without having to invest significant resources.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "Olumide Soyombo: The journey from startup founder to investment mogul",
          "text": "\u201cWhat turns me off is when someone just tells me they have this idea and they haven\u2019t done anything but want me to invest. I always say you have to take a risk on yourself before anybody can take a risk on you.\u201d\n\nUp until October 2020 when Nigerian fintech startup Paystack was acquired by Stripe for $200m, Olumide Soyombo was still relatively investing in the background. He was mostly known by a few as the co-founder of Bluechip technologies, a company that provided data management solutions to companies.\n\nWhat changed? Word got out that he was one of the earliest investors in Paystack. Beyond that, his investment portfolio showed that he had also invested in over 20 notable startups. As a result of these revelations, requests by others to co-invest along with him increased.\n\nHe tried to keep up with the requests but it soon became impossible to carry others along effectively without setting up a more formal structure. So last week he announced that he was launching Voltron Capital, a pan-African venture capital fund.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of FOMO (fear of missing out). Everybody\u2019s keen on having tech in their portfolio. The whole idea of Voltron was to bring people together to form the \u2018Defender of the Universe\u2019,\u201d he told me.\n\nOver a call, we talked about Soyombo\u2019s early influences, building his company and what he\u2019s most excited about right now.\n\nThe early days\n\nAt first, being a doctor was all Soyombo wanted to be until he was given a personal computer.\n\nHe grew up in the 90s with access to a personal computer and to the internet, at a time when most people didn\u2019t have access to such.\n\n\u201cAt first I wanted to be a medical doctor but in secondary school, I got exposed to using the computer and then I knew I was going to do something in technology.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, he got into the University of Lagos (UNILAG) to study Systems Engineering. Notably, he was part of the first set for the newly launched degree program in UNILAG. The degree was less about computers and more about systems, which equipped him with the ability to oversee and understand the different aspects of a project or a system.\n\nWhile pursuing this degree, he enrolled in professional exams such as MCSE, MCP, CCNA and CCNP and passed them before he was 19. He passed the CCNA exam \u2013 a networking exam \u2013 before even seeing a router.\n\n\u201cThis helped build my profile and knowledge of tech. Back then, tech wasn\u2019t as sexy as this but it was still a profession that many aspired to get into.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarly bird or worm?\n\nAmerican psychologist Adam Grant is credited with saying that while it\u2019s true that the early bird gets the worm, the early worm also gets caught. For Soyombo, was being a part of the pioneer set of a newly created degree a case of the early bird or worm?\n\n\u201cThe good part about being the first set was that a lot of focus was placed on us because they needed the success of the first set to generate more interest in the department. We were one of the few people in the UNILAG at that time that had their lectures delivered via PowerPoint.\u201d Clearly, the case of the early bird here.\n\nAfter his first degree, Soyombo went on to get a master\u2019s degree in business and information technology from Aston Business school. During his time in Aston, he learned how to use technology to solve business problems. Upon completion of his master\u2019s degree, he returned back to Nigeria, where for the next year he was a consultant for a bank that needed to build a data warehouse.\n\nWhile on that job he met his future business partner, Kazeem Tewogbade, who was then the lead consultant on the project.\n\nBuilding solutions for banks and telcos\n\nThe two decided to focus on building data warehouses and business intelligence solutions for banks and telcos. In 2008, they founded Bluechip Technologies which has gone to build those solutions and partnered with a number of companies like Oracle and Microsoft.\n\nAt the core of Bluechip technologies, products is business analytics \u2014 bringing data from disparate sources and building models from that data to help businesses to predict things like customer churn, lifetime value of the customer and help the business make better decisions. The company also provides enterprise solutions like voucher management systems that the telcos use.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re buying any airtime from one of the telcos, it\u2019s likely running from one of our solutions. We are basically just looking for problems within businesses and solving them with technology.\u201d\n\nBluechip Technologies is in its 13th year and has expanded beyond Nigeria to four other African countries \u2014 Kenya, DRC Congo, Zambia and Ghana.\n\nWhat has been the driving force behind this growth and expansion? Referrals.\n\n\u201cReferrals are the building blocks for success in the B2B world. For example, we deliver a data warehouse in bank A, when the chief information officer leaves there and goes to bank B, he remembers that we delivered a project successfully for him and he reaches out to us. The price of failure in enterprise startups is high. If you fail on a large project you\u2019re out. So everyone tries to rely on a vendor who can deliver consistently.\u201d\n\nEvery business faces competition. Despite many competing companies coming into the business intelligence space, Soyombo believes the market is big enough for others to come in.\n\n\u201cSometimes people say, when someone says the market is big enough you shouldn\u2019t listen to them, but in this case I can tell you that we can\u2019t do everything ourselves.

But this didn\u2019t work out as planned, as there were no other investors to further invest in the companies.\n\nThey ditched the accelerator model and started investing individually as angel investors. And finally, in 2021 Voltron Capital was launched to bridge the gap of angel investing between his corporate friends and colleagues who have not typically invested in tech and startups that need their money.\n\nAs an influential figure in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem, Soyombo has access to almost any important deal in the market but he\u2019s had to pass up on a few.\n\nHe could have invested in Flutterwave but decided not to because of a personal relationship with one of the founders of Paystack.\n\n\u201cSometimes you put personal relationships with super founders ahead of personal financial gain.\u201d\n\nAnother investment opportunity he passed up on was that of a new startup whose founder didn\u2019t handle the winding down of his previous company well. The bitter taste of how the founder handled the first company didn\u2019t allow Soyombo to invest in the second company.\n\nWhen he thinks about the future, Soyombo is excited about the fact that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting seeing that employees, former product leads and engineers, from maturing startups are going on to start their own companies because they\u2019ve seen how things work in high growth companies. Mono\u2019s founder is ex-paystack, Brass\u2019 founder is ex-paystack and Kudi.

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s MTN Group has repatriated its last year\u2019s dividend of around $280 million (R4.2 billion) from its local unit in Nigeria. The company reported the payout on Monday during the release of preliminary financial results for the six months to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe funds from Nigeria are part of approximately $650 million (R9.3 billion) in cash the pan-African telecoms giant returned from its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Johannesburg-based group had been struggling to get dividends out of its subsidiaries due to the challenges of securing foreign currency in Nigeria and some other markets where it operates.\n\nAs a result, MTN was forced to suspend dividend payout for the 2020 financial year. The company also cited other reasons for the suspension, such as the timing of proceeds from an ongoing asset realisation programme (ARP) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnnounced in March 2019, the ARP seeks to simplify the group\u2019s portfolio, reduce debt and improve returns. Over a three-year period, the programme is expected to bring in proceeds of at least R15 billion ($1 billion).\n\n\u201cCash upstreaming from Nigeria remained challenging in terms of securing foreign currency in the market. During 2020, we upstreamed the equivalent of approximately R286 million from Nigeria, with approximately R4.2 billion yet to be repatriated as of 31 December 2020,\u201d the company said back in March.\n\nThe group has now fully secured its cash dividend from Nigeria, in what is one of the two positive developments concerning MTN that will come as a relief to shareholders.\n\nRespite in U.S. court case\n\nIn addition to the news from Nigeria, MTN also revealed \u201cpositive developments\u201d in a United States court case related to the group and its subsidiaries, MTN Afghanistan and MTN Dubai.\n\nAccording to the company, the magistrate assessing complaints of alleged violations of U.S. anti-terrorism regulation had recommended the dismissal of the case.\n\nThe Group had argued that the court has no jurisdiction over the company given it does not operate in the U.S. It also claims the complaint \u201cdoes not allege any conduct by MTN defendants that violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.\u201d\n\nAfter the news of repatriating money from Nigeria and progress in the U.S. court case, MTN shares reportedly finished 6% higher on Monday at R111.30 (around $7).\n\nThe group\u2019s complete half-year results are expected to be released on August 12 and it has told investors to expect between 75% to 85% drop in profit or earnings per share (EPS). This is due to an impairment charge involving its Yemeni business and the decoupling of its operation in Syria.\n\nThe sale of MTN Group\u2019s 75% stake in MTN Syria is part of ongoing attempts to exit markets in the Middle East over the next three to five years, with a plan to fully focus on core African markets.\n\nMTN plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa, proceeds which will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nIn Nigeria, MTN, through its local unit, has earmarked \u20a6600 billion ($1.5 billion) over the next three years to expand broadband access in Africa\u2019s most populous economy.\n\nMobile subscribers decline in Nigeria\n\nFor MTN Nigeria, half-year 2021 results show that service revenue increased by 24.1% year-on-year, despite the number of its mobile subscribers declining by 7.6 million (nearly 10%).\n\nIn December 2020, Nigerian authorities ordered telecom companies to suspend the sale of SIM cards (until April this year). The directive was part of efforts to verify the identities of all mobile subscribers, who were asked to link their phone numbers with national identity numbers.\n\n\u201cOperationally, our mobile subscribers closed H1 at 68.9 million, down 9.9% from December 2020. This was due to the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations, which was lifted on 19 April 2021,\u201d MTN Nigeria\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, said on an analyst call.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile user numbers fell, MTN Nigeria company managed to increase service revenue to \u20a6790.3 billion (about R27 billion, $1.9 billion) driven by a surge in data usage.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 27.6% to \u20a6417.2 billion ($1 billion) while transaction volume for mobile money increased by 280.8% year-on-year to 55.6 million. Its total MoMo active subscribers reached 6.1 million.\n\nMTN Nigeria aims to sustain \u201cdouble-digit service revenue growth ahead of inflation, driving 4G and rural network expansion,\u201d Toriola said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsa Bank Kenya, a subsidiary of South Africa\u2019s Absa Group, has launched a WhatsApp banking solution called \u201cAbby\u201d to assist users in making basic transactions. According to the Bank, customers can use the service for bill payments, balance enquiry, inter-account transfers, as well as transfers between bank accounts and M-Pesa/Airtel money.\n\nThis move is in line with Absa\u2019s commitment to digitise its services.

However, available data suggests that it could be a massive success in Kenya.\n\nAccording to Global Web Index\u2019s Social Media Marketing Trends in 2021, 97% of Kenyan Internet users use WhatsApp monthly, the highest globally.

With different experiences of education inequality, Co-founders Tao Boyle and Dacod Magagula bonded over their desire to solve this problem at the University of Cape Town.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the coronavirus made it harder for students to attend school and deprived them of education, the co-founders leveraged WhatsApp\u2019s API to provide students with much-needed solutions on a platform that they already use.\n\nVictoria Fakiya has more on this story: How South African API edtech startup, FoondaMate, is helping students study with WhatsApp\n\nOmnibiz\u2019s seed round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmnibiz team. Source: TechCrunch\n\nWhat\u2019s the story? Omnibiz, a Nigerian B2B eCommerce startup, has announced a seed round of $3m. Investors that participated in the round include V&R Africa, Timon Capital, Tangerine Insurance, LoftyInc, Musha Ventures, SUNU Capital, Launch Africa, and Rising Tide Africa.\n\nWhat do they do? Using a mobile app, WhatsApp, and a phone number, Omnibiz digitises the retail supply chain connecting retailers directly to manufacturers of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG).\n\nFounded in 2019, Omnibiz is the brainchild of Deepankar Rustagi, who previously founded VConnect, an online marketplace for local professionals. Omnibiz operates an asset-light business model by working with distributors and logistics providers.\n\nWhen retailers place an order for a product, the third-party logistics drivers pick it from the distributors and deliver it to the retailers. In a chat with TechCrunch, Rustagi revealed that his experience at VConnect prepared him for the challenge of running Omnibiz.\n\nAfrica\u2019s eCommerce value chain is distorted, with no easy way to effectively provide goods and services. However, driven by an increasing Internet and smartphone penetration, entrepreneurs are beginning to do the hard work of digitising the space.\n\nWhile most of the focus has been on B2C models, recent happenings suggest a shift. Sokowatch, Twiga, MaxAB, and Trade Depot are just a few startups that have begun providing solutions for the B2B space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more: Nigerian eCommerce startup, Omnibiz, secures $3m seed to expand across West Africa.\n\nJumia Q2 report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Jumia\n\nWhat happened? eCommerce giant Jumia has released its second-quarter results, and there are interesting points to note.\n\nFirst, phones and electronics now account for less gross merchandise value (GMV) for the retailer, falling from 43% in the second quarter of 2020 to 38% in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nFood delivery and digital finance services offered via JumiaPay also saw growth contributing 14% of GMV in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 9% in the second quarter of 2020.\n\nThe retailer also saw an increase in its logistics offering, delivering 1.3 million packages to 300 clients compared to half a million packages delivered throughout 2020.

We are doing enumeration and biometric data capturing of the pupils enrolled under the programme, getting feedbacks from cooks and head-teachers within the programme.\n\n\u201cWe want to keep an up-to-date record of the programme and make it more responsive as well as meet the beneficiaries to get real-time feedback from them as well.\n\n\u201cThe current enumeration and bio-data capturing is a building block towards the expansion of the programme to include more pupils and schools in the state.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari had earlier announced his laudable intention of an additional 5 million pupils to be enrolled in the programme nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe ministry also wants to know how the programme is being managed on daily basis, the resources available and if there are shortfalls before the expansion would be done in order to tighten loose ends,\u201d she said.\n\nThe minister said that the programme, which started on Feb. 8, 2017, in the state, had pushed up enrollment figures in public schools and increased the daily attendance to school.\n\n\u201cThe programme has helped in the concentration of the pupils during classes since some of them do not feed or are underfed at home before coming to school each day,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nFarouq said that currently, the programme is having 9,196,823 pupils nationwide, with a total of 107,000 cooks supplying the food, which is indigenous and home-made for the pupils nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe programme has a lot of multiplier effects. It has assisted farmers to expand food production and employ more hands in the farms as well as the cooks also employing more hands to assist them,\u2019\u2019 she noted.\n\nSpeaking, the Headmistress of the primary school, Mrs Salome Obi, said that the pupils were \u2018very happy\u2019 to be part of the programme, adding that apart from increasing enrollment, \u201cit has helped in pupils\u2019 retention ability\u201d.\n\n\u201cAfter eating the meals each day, you see the pupils enlivened and eager to continue with their learning rather than feeling dull or hungry,\u2019\u2019 Obi said.\n\nA cook in the programme, Mrs Uzoamaka Ogbu, thanked the Federal Government for engaging her and other women in the programme, which had helped to improve the welfare of their families and other dependents.\n\n\u201cThe challenge we are having is the issue of non-regular payment and the current cost of food stuff in the market, which the N70 per meal (with a fruit) remained inadequate with market realities,\u2019\u2019 Ogbu said.\n\nA pupil, Miss Flavour Anigbo, prayed God to bless and protect President Buhari for providing food for her and her classmates.\n\n\u201cThe feeding makes us happy each day in school. We want them to keep it up and God to bless President Muhammadu Buhari for us,\u2019\u2019 Anigbo said.\n\nThe ministry monitoring and enumerating team later went to a primary school complex within Idaw River area in Enugu South Local Government with five primary schools.\n\n...",

          "title": "Federal Govt To Reintroduce Toll Plazas On Selected Highways",
          "text": "The Federal Government is now set to reintroduce toll collections on some selected dual carriageways across the country.\n\nMinister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, disclosed this to State House correspondents after the federal executive council (FEC) meeting presided by vice president Yemi Osinbajo at the Presidential Villa on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to him, FEC approved for tolling to be reintroduced on dual carriageways of the 35,000 kilometers federal roads.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe added that dual carriageways represent only 5,050 kilometers out of the total 35,000 kilometers.\n\nHe said, \u201cthe Ministry of Works and Housing presented a policy memorandum for the approval of federal roads, bridges, tolling policy, and also a regulation that will provide the legal framework for the tolling policy.\n\n\u201cYou recall that about two years ago, you had asked me several here when roads will be rolled. And I told you, there\u2019s a lot of work. So we have taken another step. So let me be clear, tolls are not going to start tomorrow. So let us be clear about that.\n\n\u201cBut the big step to actual tolling was taken today by presenting for approval the broad policy that will guide the tolling so that local people, states, local governments, all those who manage roads, investors who want to come in, will know what our tolling policy is. And that will form the basis of their financial modeling, their investment decision.\n\n\u201cNow, when will it start? First of all, the tolls will not start until roads are motorable. So let\u2019s be clear about those.\n\n\u201cThere will be agreements that have to be placed, negotiated with the government through the Ministry of Works and the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission.\n\n\u201cSo but the highlights of the policy, I think is what I would like to share. Some of the highlights are that we will adopt an open tolling policy as distinct from a closed tolling policy.\n\n\u201cThe difference is that only open tolling policy, which is what we were used to before. you pay to at a barrier over a fixed or predetermined distance. The close toll systems mean that you will pay tolls over the distance you travel and the size of your vehicle. We haven\u2019t operated that before. So we are going back to what we know.\u201d\n\nStating that the government also approved that consultations must be done, Fashola said willingness to pay surveys must be done before specific roads are tolled.\n\n\u201cWe presented and the council approved that only dual carriageways of the 35,000 kilometers should be eligible for tolling by the federal government. And dual carriageways represent only 5,050 kilometers out of 35,000 kilometers.\n\n\u201cSo the total network of roads today, assuming we wanted to start today, which we\u2019re not that will be eligible for tolling on the federal network will be 14.3% of the total network. So 85.27% will not be eligible for tooling.\n\n\u201cWe have seen that most of those dual carriageways also have alternative roads, but they are single carriageways that\u2019s why we left them. So the only exception to a single carriageway some bridges and they are listed in the regulation,\u201d the Minister added.\n\nHe said the ministry also got approval that the toll will be used to maintain roads, to construct new roads as they accrue and also to pay the investors who invest in building or completing a road and then take a concession on it.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe will also be going through a process of largely electronic toll collection and management system for audit and transparency. We\u2019ll still have some cash at the very many more and hopefully phased that out as we go ahead.\n\n\u201cWe have proposed and council has approved that certain types of vehicles be exempted for paying tolls. Those are bicycles, pedal cycles, try cycles, motorcycles, and other moves have two or three wheeled transport use mainly by disadvantaged members of our community, they will be entitled to a fully 100% exemption, as will be diplomatic vehicles and military and para military vehicles.\n\n\u201cWe concede this as a national policy that\u2019s why we\u2019re making very general framework. So that states can also decide subject to their local laws, local government can do their own tolling based on all of these considerations as a broad framework?\n\n\u201cWell, how did we get here? We met with a lot of people, we met with government agencies first of all, but more importantly, we met with private sector and organised labour.\n\n\u201cNobody that we met with oppose the idea of tolling, at least none of the people that we\u2019ve met with opposed it. Some of people you might wish to know are members of the National Assembly, the Senate, and House of Reps committees oversighting us so that they can take this feedback to their constituents.\n\n\u201cWe had consultations with the Office of National Security Advisor, Bureau of Public Enterprises, the Ministry of communication and digital economy, which will be helping us with the electronic and digital aspect of it.\n\n\u201cWe also then met with those who are affected by the tolls themselves, Ministry of Transportation, who supervises a part of the transport business and then the road transport employers Association, the National Association of road transport owners (NARTO) and National Union Road transport workers (NUTRW) and Ministry of Trade and Investment, the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection council. These are some of the people who have made very useful input which have been embedded in some policies that I have spoken about.\u201d\n\nFashola noted that the ministry also recommended that people who live around toll plaza areas will benefit from what is called frequent user discounts so that because they will be mostly impacted, unlike people who just pass once in a while, saying it is global best practice around the world.\n\n\u201cSo these are some of the highlights of the of the policy. And then we got his start off toll because certain investment decisions have to be made in the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cYou remember I briefly about the HDMI, about the concession about 12 roads, spanning about 1000 plus kilometres. That process has kicked off we have about 70 something applicants who are waiting for a policy. So we need to have a kick off policy. So we\u2019ve classified vehicles into five categories, the cars, the SUVs and the jeeps as a second category.\n\n\u201cPrivate bus and commercial bus as third and fourth categories. And then luxury buses and trucks as a fifth category.\n\n\u201cSo the start off tolls that we have for financial modelling and investment decision making, cars will pay N200, SUVs and Jeeps will pay N300, private busses will pay N300, commercial buses will pay N150, luxury buses and trucks will pay N500.\n\n\u201cNow I think it is important to share with you how we arrived at these prices. Some of these prices were recommended by the operators themselves that I said we met. Some of them were also obtained from a survey we did across the six geopolitical zones, talking to households and talking to people in the garages, motor parks and all of that, which was quite extensive. We covered about 17 or so states or 22 states out of the national framework just to get a sampling of what people felt.\n\n\u201cSo in terms of comparison, for example, we also looked at the tolls being paid at Lekki, Ikoyi bridge and the Lagos airport, Abuja airport toll plazas as a basis for further comparison. And in doing that, we found that the N200 for cars for example, is the same as Lekki, Abuja airport Lagos airport but it is N50 cheaper than Lekki-Ikoyi link bridge.\n\n\u201cFor the SUVs and Jeeps, thr N300 that we got approval for is the same as Abuja airport and Lagos airport and N100 cheaper than Lekki and Ikoyi toll bridges, those ones charged N400 for jeeps.\n\n\u201cPrivate bus is same as Lagos airport toll, N100 less than Lekki toll and Abuja airport toll. Commercial bus, which is the cheapest here in sensitivity to the most vulnerable members of our society the rate is not more than N150. This is N50 higher than the Lekki toll, because commercial buses are not frequent in this toll but it is N50 cheaper than the suggestion of the transport unions themselves. And it is equal to the maximum price that the willingness to pay survey picked up from the streets. Luxurious buses N500. This is the same as Lagos airport, but it is N500 cheaper than Lekki N200 more than the maximum gathered from the willingness to pay survey.\n\n\u201cThe reason why we have no difficulty with this is because those are the vehicles, they are the heaviest axiel load and inflict the most impactful stress on our pavement.\n\n\u201cSo this is the sum and substance broad line and then there is a tolling regulation, which now use regulatory framework to these policy based on the provisions of the Federal Highway Act, that allows the minister responsible for works to issue regulations that define policy of government with regards to roads,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "There was confusion on Wednesday at the popular Mpaper community in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja when bulldozers drove into the community at about 10am, demolishing over 2,000 roadside shanties, containers and other illegal structures said to be obstructing traffic flow on the major roads in the area.\n\nRecall that Mpape has survived several demolitions since 2004 after slums like Idu-Karimo and other squatter settlements were dislodged in Abuja.\n\nLEADERSHIP reports that the latest demolition is coming after over three months of notices and warnings from the authorities.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, this time, the FCTA explained that the demolition exercise was a thorough sanitation, which was requested by residents and landlords who had made passionate appeals to the Minister of FCT, to save them from the traffic gridlock that has made life unbearable in the area.\n\nChairman of the FCT Ministerial Committee on City Sanitation, Ikharo Attah, said that Mpape residents and landlords association begged the Minister to come to their aid as illegal commercial activities have taken over the road corridors.\n\nAttah noted that the sanitation and demolition was long overdue and it was targeted at roadside shanties and other unapproved buildings obstructing the roads.\n\n\u201cMpape demolition is requested by the residents and landlords who came to FCTA, requesting the Minister, Malam Muhammad Bello, to come and clear the road corridors.\n\n\u201cSo what we are doing is in line with the request of the people who want the road corridors to be reclaimed so that there will be ease of movement. As a responsible government, we responded to the cries of the people.\n\n\u201cWe gave them enough notice, but many of them were basking in the euphoria that nobody can clear Mpape. One of the residents that have lived in Mpape for over 20 years has confessed that people can now breathe in the fresh road, because of the widened road,\u201d Attah said.\n\nAlso speaking, Mr. Peter Olumuji, Secretary, Command and Control, FCTA, said that many of the shanties and the demolished illegal structures were being occupied by criminal elements.\n\nOlumuji noted that overtime, reports have shown that criminal activities were on the increase in Mpape, because of so many shanties providing covers for criminals.\n\n\u201cThis part of Mpape harbors the highest numbers of criminal elements and a lot of criminal activities which the residents have been complaining about. What the FCTA is doing here today is to ensure that the mandate of securing the city is carried out,\u201d he stated.",

          "title": "I\u2019ll Renounce My Nigerian Citizenship If Tinubu Becomes President \u2013 Bode George",
          "text": "Olabode George, a former national vice-chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, has stated that Bola Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos State, is unqualified to be Nigeria\u2019s president ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nGeorge, who appeared on Arise TV\u2019s The Morning Show on Wednesday, accused Tinubu of misappropriating Lagos State\u2019s resources and using them to destabilize the PDP.\n\n\u201cWhen I listened to [Adeseye] Ogunlewe saying he is the best candidate for this country, that kept me thinking. Because if you go into your archives you would have seen the comments, vicious comments made by Ogunlewe against Bola Tinubu. Because he\u2019s there now?\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t people be consistent? Why are you dancing like a masquerade in the market? If we take the eight years he spent as governor in Lagos to put on a scale between one and 10, he\u2019ll not score more than 1.\n\n\u201cWe are still talking about the way he has appropriated the resources of this state. Alpha-Beta that he is still using to appropriate the treasury of Lagos state, is still on. For God\u2019s sake, so is that the kind of man we want? No sir.\u201d\n\nDapo Apara, a former managing director of Alpha-Beta, accused Tinubu of laundering money through the consulting firm last year.\n\nGeorge, 75, was replying to Ogunlewe, a former minister of works who appeared earlier in the show and endorsed Tinubu as a strong candidate to govern Nigeria in 2023.\n\nBefore joining the ruling APC in 2019, Ogunlewe, 77, was a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nBetween 1999 to 2007, Tinubu, the national head of the All Progressives Congress, served as governor of Lagos State. Several support groups advocating for his candidacy have sprung up in recent months, despite the fact that he has not officially proclaimed his intention to run for president in 2023.\n\n\u201cI am ready to debate with Ogunlewe anywhere, even in the graveyard at 3 0\u2019clock in the morning. He\u2019s talking absolute nonsense,\u201d Goerge continued.\n\n\u201cThe best man to be Nigerian president? I will do whatever is necessary to review and renounce my citizenship. That kind of fellow? You think Lagos is better off? You all live here. See the traffic. Once the rains are here look at the state, no drains. look at what they put at the Bar Beach.\n\n\u201cWhat about the toll gate? They paid him about 30 something billion for the toll gate, and the Lagos State government is now coming to say they have now taken over the full control of the toll gate. What the heck is going on? This is my state.\n\n\u201cWe have people who are former governors, if they had behaved like what he is doing there would have been nothing for him. So to have it in my head that that character will be nominated, please go and check all of them, something is wrong with them.\u201d\n\nThe Lagos State government terminated the concession agreement on the Lekki Epe expressway with the Lekki Concession Company in 2013. Although the government did not provide the full details of the transaction, it is estimated that it paid about N30 billion to retrieve the concession right on the expressway from LCC.\n\nGeorge also questioned Tinubu\u2019s academic credentials, urging him to present them for scrutiny.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet you any amount of money. Let Bola bring out the certificate of his primary school, his secondary school, and the university he attended. We want to see them.\n\n\u201cBecause I remember in 1998 or 1999 when we had the elections. When they raised his schooling papers that he filled to INEC. They now asked him to produce all those papers. He said he went to Government College Ibadan and the Children Hope School in Ibadan. We went there we checked. Where is your certificate? Nothing. When they were going to hoist him, he quickly said that it wasn\u2019t him that signed it, it was Afikuyomi that filled it.\n\n\u201cIf you have genuine certificate, you went to a particular school, you must have friends because you won\u2019t be the only one in that college. I am shocked that Ogunlewe will be saying this in public. He knows for real that this fellow doesn\u2019t have all the certificates and I\u2019m not hiding it. Let him bring them out. The days of lying and telling a load of bull is over, whatever you have tell us.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, a Lagos Division of the Federal High Court dismissed an application seeking to compel the Inspector-General of Police to investigate Tinubu over allegations of certificate forgery. According to the court, the applicant failed to file the suit within the stipulated time as mandated by the rules of the court.\n\n\u2018Destabilising PDP\u2019\n\n\u201dFirst of all, I didn\u2019t know how that document got to the press. That was meant for discussion at the meeting because it\u2019s a family meeting. I will not divulge my own information in the public. If you have a family quarrel, you don\u2019t go to the marketplace to try and start discussing your issues. I was shocked that the thing got out to the press.\n\n\u201dBut having said that, I\u2019m prepared to defend what I said. I won\u2019t talk publicly because there are people who are involved and it should be an internal consumption for the party people to listen. We know the role he\u2019s playing both in Lagos and outside. He would send some people to come and join our party, to be able to get information about all the plans we are doing. Because he has this humongous amount of money, stolen from the treasury of Lagos State.\n\n\u201dI\u2019m still saying it, that he is the greatest headache in politics in Nigeria today. How can one single man be acquiring almost N9 billion every 30 days? It just doesn\u2019t make sense. And they haven\u2019t done anything. I\u2019m expecting him to have been invited. The man who managing director of Alpha-Beta, he also sent a memo signed by him, of what is going on with the Alpha-Beta, nobody has done anything. It\u2019s a shame. So how he affects our party is for our internal consumption and I won\u2019t discuss that in the public. If it is us versus Bola, I am ready but we should warn our people, we know because of the humongous amount of money that he has stolen, he is ready to, like a cancer, getting into everywhere. It\u2019s not right.\u201d",

          "text": "About 15 state chapters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have petitioned the national secretariat of the ruling party to protest the outcome of the recently conducted ward congresses across the country.\n\nBlueprint correspondent also gathered that election committees sent to 12 states to conduct the said ward congresses were yet to submit reports of the exercise to the party\u2019s national secretariat.\n\nThis is coming as indication emerged that the party is yet to fix dates for the conduct of its local council and state congresses initially billed to hold end of August 2021.\n\nBlueprint gathered Wednesday that 15 states, including different factions from Osun, Ekiti, Enugu, Akwa Ibom, Kwara, Niger, Kano among others, had submitted petitions to protest the outcome of the ward congresses.\n\nA source said: \u201cI know that different groups and interests from 15 state chapters have submitted petitions and only 21 out of the 33 states where the ward congresses held have submitted reports of the July 31, 2021 exercise, while officially congress did not hold in Anambra, Bayelsa and Zamfara states.\u201d\n\nInaugurating the ward congress appeal committee Wednesday in Abuja, National Secretary APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) Senator John Akpanudoedehe said the party was yet to fix any date for the next stage of the congress.\n\nBlueprint observed that going by the schedule published by the party, the appeal committee ought to have finished its assignment five days before it was inaugurated.\n\nWhile charging committee members to be fair in dealing with issues raised by aggrieved party members, Akpanudoedehe urged them to \u201cnote that the outcome of your findings will determine when the Local Council and State Congresses would be conducted.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the crisis arising from the Supreme Court judgment, Akpanudoedehe said: \u201cIn the past few days, the media space has been filled with commentaries on the Supreme Court judgment in Jegede v. Akeredolu, with persons who should know better, coming out with very malicious and self-serving opinions, just to play on the gullibility of the public, while forgetting that our party is made up of very intelligent, sound and intellectually proficient persons who have seen beneath their grandstanding.\n\n\u201cThe majority judgment of the Supreme Court has strengthened the position of the CECPC and our Chairman. The minority judgment serves only for academic purposes, nothing more.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney General of the federation who is the chief law officer of the federation has stated that we are on firm ground and advised that we proceed with the processes of the Congresses.\n\n\u201cThe Progressive Governors Forum through their extensive legal apparatchik have x-rayed the generality of the issue in their meeting of 8/8/2021 and have re-affirmed their support to the CECPC and urged the CECPC to proceed with the Congresses as scheduled.\n\n\u201cIt is trite to note that, the Congresses to produce our party organs across had commenced on the 31st of July, 2021 and you will agree with me that it went substantially well.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is expected that where ever and whenever there\u2019s a competition, of course, there is bound to be contestations.\n\n\u201cTherefore as an organization based on rules and procedures, avenues and channels must be provided for party members who are dissatisfied with the processes, to ventilate their grievances through an internal mechanism, hence this Wards Congresses Appeals Committee in the circumstance of this exercise.\n\n\u201cThis party is for all Nigerians, therefore we must show, not only by words, but by concrete actions that there\u2019s no attempt to exclude or sideline anybody in the course of the exercise. This is very fundamental, not only to the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, but to the preservation of the very essence of the party.\n\n\u201cYour actions in this wise will help engender cohesion, build trust and confidence in this all important exercise.\n\n\u201cToday, you have been entrusted with one of the most solemn obligations of citizenship which is to help deepen our democratisation processes and strengthen the polity.\n\n\u201cYou all were carefully selected based on your proven records. We trust in your strength of character, your integrity and your capacity to be fair in your dealings to those who approach your committees.\n\n\u201cThe Chairman had directed that I remind all party members that this is a family affair, hence differences should be handled with the understanding that no dispute is worth the destruction of the house you jointly erected.\u201d\n\nLeave me out of APC crisis \u2013 Oshiomhole\n\nMeanwhile, former APC National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole has denied plotting to return to office, and asked not to be dragged into the party crisis in whatever form.\n\nThe former party chair said this Wednesday in a statement by his media aide, Victor Oshioke, in Abuja.\n\nHe reaffirmed his loyalty to the APC under the leadership of Governor Mai-Mala Buni.\n\nOshiomhole said: \u201cOur attention has been drawn to a statement credited to Chief Eze Chukwuemeka Eze, a former National Publicity Secretary of the defunct New Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who is now a member of the APC and self-styled aide of Minister of Transportation, Chief Rotimi Amaechi.\n\n\u201cIn the said statement widely reported in the media, Chief Eze was quoted as saying that Mr. Festus Keyamo SAN, Hon. Minister of State for Labour and Employment and others were plotting to bring back Comrade Adams Oshiomhole as national chairman of the APC.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily we would have ignored this nonsensical suggestion. However, it is pertinent to set the records straight and put to rest this ridiculous falsehood being marketed by Eze Chukwuemeka Eze.\u201d\n\nThe former Edo state governor also said Keyamo was in the forefront and provided legal support in court for his removal.\n\n\u201cKeyamo also offered legal advice on the legality of the NEC that was convened for the dissolution of the Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee of APC and emergence of the Governor Mai-Mala Buni led Caretaker Committee.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore frivolous for any right-thinking person to assume that Keyamo who actively supported the removal of the National chairman elected by over 6, 500 party delegates from across the 36 states and the FCT because 8 out of 27 Ward executive members purportedly suspended a national party chairman, would now plot to bring the same Oshiomhole back to the office,\u201d the statement said.\n\nOshiomhole said he won\u2019t be part of any plot to destabilise or ridicule the APC for whatever reason.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity to further reaffirm Comrade Adams Oshiomhole\u2019s loyalty to the APC under the able leadership of His Excellency, Governor Mai-Mala Buni.\n\n\u201cOshiomhole\u2019s position is that all hands should be on deck to support the Governor Mai-Mala Buni led Caretaker Committee to complete its assignment rather than creating distractions that are counterproductive to the mandate of the committee.\n\n\u201cHe congratulates Governor Mai Mala Buni and the entire members of the Caretaker Committee for their efforts in depleting the ranks of Governors of the PDP by winning three of them into the APC fold,\u201d he said.",

There is a need for us to pay more time and attention to these issues in whatever way we can because every once in a while, we see some threats to the unity of our country, and we must not allow it to happen at all, we must continue not just in the advocacy, but in action that will bring about unity and religious tolerance,\u201d Prof. Osinbajo added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the leader of the delegation, Alhaji Maidabino commended Prof. Osinbajo for his innovative approach to governance and the several initiatives of the Buhari administration anchored through his office and prayed God to provide the opportunity to enable him continue to serve the nation.\n\nAlhaji Maidabino noted that through schemes such as TraderMoni, National Homegrown School Feeding Programme, N-Power, and the Ease of Doing Business initiative, among others, the Vice President has impacted many Nigerians across different sectors.\n\nHis words: \u201cwe wish to commend and congratulate you for your contributions in the area of promotion of good governance, transparency, and efficiency as exemplified with the core principles behind the Ease of Doing Business initiative of this government, and for the continuation of your uncompromising dedication to peace, unity, and economic progress, among others.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe informed the Vice President of plans by the group to convene a national forum on unity as part of its contributions to entrenching peaceful coexistence and unity among Nigerians.",

          "title": "US Urges Pregnant Women to Vaccinate as Delta Surges",
          "text": "The Uinted States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged all pregnant women Wednesday to get the COVID-19 vaccine as hospitals in hot spots around the U.S. see disturbing numbers of unvaccinated mothers-to-be seriously ill with the virus.\n\nExpectant women run a higher risk of severe illness and pregnancy complications from the coronavirus, including perhaps miscarriages and stillbirths.\n\nBut their vaccination rates are low, with only about 23% having received at least one dose, according to CDC data.\n\n\u201cThe vaccines are safe and effective, and it has never been more urgent to increase vaccinations as we face the highly transmissible delta variant and see severe outcomes from COVID-19 among unvaccinated pregnant people,\u2019\u2019 CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a statement.\n\nThe updated guidance comes after a CDC analysis of new safety data on 2,500 women showed no increased risks of miscarriage for those who received at least one dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine before 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThe analysis found a miscarriage rate of around 13%, within the normal range.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s advice echoes recent recommendations from top obstetrician groups.\n\nThe agency had previously encouraged pregnant women to consider vaccination but had stopped short of a full recommendation. The new advice also applies to nursing mothers and women planning to get pregnant.\n\nAlthough pregnant women were not included in studies that led to authorization of COVID-19 vaccines, experts say real-world experience in tens of thousands of women shows that the shots are safe for them and that when given during pregnancy may offer some protection to newborns.\n\nThe new guidance comes amid a surge in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S., driven by the highly contagious delta variant.\n\nSome health authorities believe the variant may cause more severe disease \u2014 in pregnant women and others as well \u2014 than earlier versions of the virus, though that is still under investigation.\n\nNational figures show the latest surge in cases among pregnant women is lower than it was during the outbreak\u2019s winter peak. But at some hospitals in states with low vaccination rates, the numbers of sick mothers-to-be outpace those during earlier surges, before vaccines were available.\n\n\u201cThis is by far the worst we\u2019ve seen in the pandemic,\u2019\u2019 said Dr. Jane Martin, an obstetrician with Ochsner Baptist Medical Center in New Orleans. She added: \u201cIt\u2019s disheartening and it\u2019s exhausting. It feels like it doesn\u2019t have to be like this.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic and with each surge, Ochsner had a few pregnant patients very sick with the virus, though the numbers had dwindled in recent months.\n\n\u201cA week or two ago that pace changed drastically,\u2019\u2019 Martin said. \u201cWe have had multiple critically ill pregnant patients admitted\u2019\u2019 every day, most requiring intensive care.\n\nMartin said she has taken care of at least 30 pregnant patients hospitalized with COVID-19 over the last two weeks. Most were unvaccinated.\n\nExperts say the lifting of mask rules and other social distancing precautions and the rise of the delta variant have contributed to the worrisome trend. But also, vaccinations weren\u2019t made available to women of childbearing age and others under 65 until spring.\n\nEarly in her pregnancy, Tennessee kindergarten teacher Sara Brown decided she would wait until the baby was born to get the shots. There wasn\u2019t much safety data yet about getting vaccinated during pregnancy, and at 36, she was young, healthy and \u201cfigured if I did get it, it would probably just be a bad cold.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut what seemed like a sinus infection in June turned into severe COVID-19, landing her in a Nashville intensive care unit for five days, on oxygen and struggling to breathe.\n\nHer daughter Suzie was born healthy on Aug. 2. But it was a harrowing experience.\n\n\u201cNot being able to catch your breath is such a panicky feeling, knowing I had life inside me that could be suffering too,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nAt Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where Brown was treated, there were no infected pregnant patients early in July. Now the hospital is admitting four to five a week, all unvaccinated, said obstetrician Dr. Jennifer Thompson. About 20% of those patients are being treated in the intensive care unit, compared with 11% during previous surges, she said.\n\nFor some pregnant patients critically ill with COVID-19, organs begin to fail and doctors induce labor early or deliver babies by cesarean section as a last resort, said Dr. Jeannie Kelly, an obstetrician at Washington University Medical Center in St. Louis.\n\nAbout 20% of all patients admitted for labor and delivery last week at the St. Louis hospital are infected, more than double the rate during the COVID-19 surge in Missouri last year, she said. About one-third of these women are critically ill.\n\nAround 105,000 pregnant U.S. women have been infected with COVID-19, and almost 18,000 have been hospitalized, according to the CDC. About one-fourth of those received intensive care and 124 died.\n\nPregnancy-related changes in body functions may explain why the virus can be dangerous for mothers-to-be. These include reduced lung capacity and adjustments in the disease-fighting immune system that protect and help the fetus grow.\n\nThe risks are disproportionately high for Black and Hispanic women, who are more likely to face health care and economic inequalities that increase their chances of getting sick.\n\nSome studies suggest the virus can also increase the risks of preterm birth and stillbirth, and in rare cases, it appears to have passed from mother to fetus.\n\nMartin, the New Orleans obstetrician, noted that local hospitals are also treating increasing numbers of children and babies sick with COVID-19, some of whom may have been infected after birth by unvaccinated mothers.\n\nMartin was pregnant when she got her own shots last winter. She delivered a healthy baby girl a week after the last shot.\n\n\u201cVaccinating people is the only way out,\u2019\u2019 she said.",

Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes.\n\nThe court charged al-Bashir with war crimes and genocide for allegedly masterminding the campaign of attacks in Darfur. Sudanese prosecutors last year started their own investigation into the Darfur conflict.\n\nAlso indicted by the court are two other senior figures from al-Bashir\u2019s rule: Abdel-Rahim Muhammad Hussein, interior and defence minister during much of the conflict, and Ahmed Haroun, a senior security chief at the time and later the leader of al-Bashir\u2019s ruling party.\n\nBoth Hussein and Haroun have been under arrest in Khartoum since the Sudanese military, under pressure from protesters, ousted al-Bashir in April 2019.\n\nThe court also indicted rebel leader Abdulla Banda, whose whereabouts are unknown, and janjaweed leader Ali Kushayb, who was charged in May with crimes against humanity and war crimes.",
