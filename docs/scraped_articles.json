          "text": "Stock photo.\n\nasks Oba Akiolu to resist recognition of Serikin Fulani of Lagos\n\nTHE Senior Elders Forum of the Yoruba Council of Elders, on Tuesday, raised concerns over alleged influx of foreign herders into Lagos State saying it portends a great danger for the state.\n\nThe elders, who spoke through a former National President of YCE, Dansaaki Samuel Agbede said with thousands of unknown individuals who have infiltrated Lagos, the State is sitting on a barrel of gunpowder.\n\nREAD ALSO:COVID-19 third wave: Lagos begins phase 2 vaccination Aug 25 \u2014 Sanwo-Olu\n\nHe said the influx of the foreigners coincided with the recent unfortunate comments credited to one Alhaji Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State who allegedly said all Fulani people in the world are Nigerians.\n\nAgbede, a retired military colonel, urged security agencies especially the Lagos State Government to be on their toes in ensuring that there is no breakdown of law and order in Lagos State and other parts of the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cLagos is very vulnerable. With a lot of people who have infiltrated Lagos, the State is sitting not only on a keg of gunpowder but on a barrel of gunpowder. A lot of foreigners have sneaked into Lagos State and the majority of them have no place of abode. They are in every nook and cranny of Lagos.\n\n\u201cWe also wonder about the show of authority by someone who calls himself Serikin Fulani of Lagos State and Oba Rilwan Akiolu is sitting down comfortably looking at this thing? We in YCE salute Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State and the Oba of Benin that any attempt to denigrate their ancient tradition and custom will be resisted.\n\n\u201cFor Nigeria to be at peace, all this nepotism, selfishness, and desire that one person wants to drive away another person out of his land must be urgently addressed.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t say you want to enslave a certain people forever and this is what is causing all these problems we have as a country now. We have been crying over this since 2019 these things are coming and now they are here.\n\n\u201cFor things to work well for us as a nation, we have to come together to dialogue. We still have problems of insecurity in Ekiti State. Some people were kidnapped at Ilejemeje in Ekiti Local Government. Fulani is still holding firm their base in Ekiti. There is much improvement in Osun, Oyo, Ogun but they still need to do more than what they are doing.\u201d",

          "text": "By Udeme Akpan\n\nDr Mike Emuh\n\nTHE Chairman, Host Communities of Nigeria, Producing Oil and Gas, HOSCON, Dr Mike Emuh, Monday, urged different groups in Niger Delta to come together to maximize the benefits of the recent passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB, into law.\n\nNiger Delta groups, including the Host Communities Producing Oil and Gas, HOSCOM, Pan Niger Delta Forum, PANDEF, Ijaw National Congress, INC, the Movement for the Survival of Ijaw Ethnic Nationality in the Niger Delta, MOSIEND, Ikwere People Congress, IPC, Worldwide, Itsekiri Liberation Group, ILG, Forum for Ethnic Nationalities of Niger Delta, FENND, and the Coalition of Rivers Oil and Gas Host Communities, CROGHCOM and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, have opposed the provision of three per cent of the budget of oil companies for the development of host communities in the PIA.\n\nBut in a telephone interview with Vanguard, Emuh, who has been canvassing peace and unity, said: \u201cWe cannot continue to protest at this stage because the PIB has been passed into law. We should work together to articulate our positions for the future review of the PIA.\n\n\u201cThe unity and peace we are talking about are necessary for the successful planning and execution of projects and programmes in the host communities. We should engage experts to produce development plans, work with Local and foreign investors to implement them, knowing that no development will take place in an atmosphere of crises.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: HostCom queries NASS on definition of host communities\n\nEmuh, who praised President Muhammadu Buhari and the 9th National Assembly for the emergence of the new legislation, said: \u201cI have been asking the communities to accept the new Act, even though we intend to canvass for the amendment of some provisions, including the section, which gives a landlord status to the oil companies.\n\n\u201cWith the PIA, we now have direct funds for the development of the communities. In the past, because the 13 per cent derivation was given to States, the oil and gas communities, that suffer the negative impact of operations lost about N44 trillion to the States.\u201d\n\nWhile assenting to the PIB, President Buhari had said: \u201cWe are all aware that past administrations have identified the need to further align the industry for global competitiveness, but there was a lack of political will actualise this needed transformation.\n\n\u201cThis lack of progress has stagnated the growth of the industry and the prosperity of our economy. In the past ten years, Nigeria has lost an estimated 50 billion dollars worth of investments due to the uncertainty created by the non-passage of the PIB.\n\n\u201cThe Act also provides for a direct benefit framework that will enable the sustainable development of host communities. I appeal to the host communities to look carefully at the contents of the Bill, which in the implementation will bring real and lasting benefits to them.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, had also said: \u201cThe host communities are winners as well. It may not be necessarily exactly what some of them had hoped. But you know from zero to over $500 million and with time, such issues will be further addressed.\n\n\u201cThis time around, there should be no excuses for anybody to tamper with this money. The host communities have suffered enough, even when NDDC was established, I\u2019m sure it was established because of the host communities\u2019 issues and yet the host communities did not get much attention.\n\n\u201cThis time, the host communities have been specifically mentioned and these funds should go there. We want to see people who will be appointed, taking this as trust and do what is right.\n\n\u201cOf course, there will be so much employment and jobs especially in the midstream of the value chain. This midstream has not been in existence so to speak. What we have is the upstream and then, the downstream. When our refineries will be better and more will be established, I\u2019m sure the value chain will have opportunities for more Nigerians to have jobs and so on.\n\n\u201cThis is something we all have to address with some optimism and hope that it would be okay. But because we are human beings, no act of human beings could be perfect. So when we are able to see issues, the National Assembly is there. Bring them for amendment.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

In any outbreak like that of cholera, that is the prerogative of the Department of Public Health of the State Ministry of Health.\n\n\u201cWe got a distress call some days ago about people vomiting and having diarrhoea, I directed the Director of Public Health and the State Epidemiologist to go there and the situation has been brought under control. In situations like this, we do surveillance, contact tracing and infection and prevention control.\n\n\u201cWhat we do now is surveillance, especially where our Disease Surveillance Officer stationed in all the 332 wards in the state together with the Infection, Prevention and Control officers offer surveillance and treatment for anybody that has contracted cholera.\n\n\u201cSince cholera involves the loss of body fluids, it is necessary as part of treatment to replace it.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the Ministry of Health has partnered the state Ministry of Environment to enlighten residents of suspected areas on refuse disposal methods and how to make their environments clean.\n\nWhile emphasising that Osun was not listed amongst states that have cholera, he insisted that one recorded incident cannot be considered a problem and the Federal Government would not consider declaring Osun as an outbreak state yet.\n\n\u201cI hope that record will be maintained and to achieve that, our people need to maintain a clean environment and observe both personal and environmental hygiene. If that is done, we should be able to avoid any ugly incidences of cholera outbreak\u201d, he concluded.\n\nRecall that some states in the country have in the last weeks recorded deaths through cholera.\n\nStates like Taraba, Adamawa with 63 cases, Katsina with 60 deaths and 67 percent of recorded vases being children, Niger where 12 persons had died.\n\nOthers include Jigawa with 100 killed, Kano with 169 deaths, Kogi and Ogun states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\nCholera outbreak kills over 100 persons in Jigawa",

Banks and other corporate offices did not open for business.\n\nGovernment offices were opened in obedience to directive of the state government but few workers were at work as many found it difficult to trek to their offices.\n\nReports from Aba said though there were no cases of molestation by hoodlums, residents stayed at home out of fear. Major markets, banks and other public institutions were shut.\n\nIn Imo, the usual traffic jam and commercial activities in Owerri and other urban centres were absent as banks, business centres,markets, filling stations, schools, health centres, mobile food vendors and the hospitality industries were shutdown.\n\n\u201cOur people will continue to stay at home on Mondays until Nnamdi Kanu is released from detention, that is the only way we can stop the Sit-at-home order,\u201d a resident told Daily Sun in Owerri.\n\nLike Owerri, Abakaliki, capital of Ebonyi State was deserted.Our correspondent who moved round the city observed that filling stations and commercial banks did not open for services.The popular Margret Umahi International Market, the building materials market and spare parts market were also shut.However, government offices at the Ochudo Centenary City Secretariat and Old Government House were opened while security agents patrolled the capital city to ensure people were not harassed by hoodlums.\n\nOn Sunday, Commissioner of Police, Aliyu Garba, had urged residents to go about their normal and legitimate businesses without fear of attacks from any group.\n\nIn Enugu, banks, fuel stations and street shops were locked as people were afraid of attacks.\n\nSome supporters of Kanu and IPOB who spoke to Daily Sun said it would be difficult to end the lockdown every Monday except the order comes directly from the IPOB leader.\n\nIn Awka, Anambra State, while some stayed back out of fear, others willfully continued with it. Some shops opened for business while others did not.Many roads were deserted even as some major markets did not open. At the popular Eke Awka Market, some traders came around but did not open their shops while some displayed their wares. There were also some others who simply stayed back at home.\n\nOur Correspondent who monitored the situation in Onitsha reports that all the major markets including Main Market, banks, parks, some filling stations were shutdown due to fear of unknown. Also major roads leading to Main Market Onitsha such as Old Market, New Market, Venn Roads were deserted as young boys turned the roads to football pitches.\n\nAt Upper Iweka and Bridgehead Onitsha most of motor parks were shut while few vehicles were seen going in or out of Onitsha to Asaba.\n\nA trader, Mr. Uche Nwogah, said the exercise has been hijacked by hoodlums to rob and maim innocent citizens in the name of enforcing the sit-it-home order.\n\n\u2022Go tough on IPOB members \u2013IG\n\nInspector General of Police (IGP), Alkali Baba Usman, has charged officers of the Delta State command to deal decisively with any IPOB member.\n\nHe handed down the charge in Asaba while on a one-day working visit to the command.\n\nReacting to challenges raised by the Commissioner of Police, Ari Muhammed Ali during a welcome address, Usman said the proximity of Asaba to Anambra would make it susceptible to aggressions from the eastern part of the country.\n\n\u201cIt is expected that whatever affect Anambra State may likely affect, especially Asaba. It is just the bridge that is separating the towns.\n\n\u201cThere are always spillover of agitations and demonstrations from Onitsha to Asaba.\n\n\u201cThat is why you need to get prepared to deal with any crime or criminality to ensure that those trouble makers are brought to book.\n\n\u201cYou (officers) need to brace up to the IPOB challenge because it is a proscribed organisation, and treat them as such.\u201d\n\nThe IGP was, however, silent on the challenge of incessant farmers/herders clashes in the state.",

          "title": "PDP Crisis Worsens as Court Restrains Secondus from Parading as Chairman",
          "text": "Chuks Okocha, Alex Enumah in Abuja and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nEfforts by elders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to quell the leadership crisis might have come to naught as a High Court of Rivers State yesterday issued an order of interim injunction, restraining Uche Secondus from carrying on as Chairman of the party, pending the hearing and determination of a suit challenging his continued stay in office.\n\nSecondus, according to the ruling, has been ordered to stop parading himself as a member of the PDP on grounds of his suspension from the party.\n\nBut the embattled chairman of the main opposition party has said if he and the party were taken to court, they would defend themselves.\n\nJustice O. Gbasam of the Degema Division of a High Court of Rivers State, sitting in Port Harcourt, issued the orders while delivering ruling in an exparte application by some chieftains of the PDP in Rivers State.\n\nThe Plaintiffs, in the suit marked PHC/2183/CS/2021 were Ibeawuchi Alex, Dennis Amadi, Emmanuel Stephen and Umezirike Onucha, while Secondus and PDP were the first and second respondents, respectively.\n\nMr. H. A. Bello, who argued the exparte application on behalf of the plaintiffs, urged the court to grant the reliefs sought by his clients in the interest of justice, even as he sought an order of court directing that the matter be heard during the court\u2019s vacation owing to the urgent nature of the case.\n\nPart of the prayers were that Secondus be stopped from performing the functions of national chairman of the PDP while on suspension as a member of the party.\n\nIn a short ruling, Justice Gbasam granted the reliefs requested by the applicants and issued an order, \u201crestraining the 1st defendant from parading himself as a member of the 2nd defendant or National Chairman of the 2nd defendant or performing the functions of National Chairman of the 2nd defendant or calling, attending or presiding over any meeting of the 2nd defendant or any committee of the 2nd defendant at ward, local government or state level.\u201d\n\nHe was also asked to stay away from \u201ccalling for any ward, local government or state congresses of the second defendant or setting up committee for such congresses, or participating in any activity of the 2nd defendant whatsoever, while on suspension as a member of the 2nd defendant, pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.\u201d\n\nJustice Gbasam, in addition, ordered that the restraining order and all other orders as well as originating summons and motion on notice be served on Secondus by substituted means.\n\nAccording to the ruling, the order and all other court\u2019s documents were to be pasted on the gate of the residence of Secondus at number 1, William Jombo street, old GRA, Port Harcourt, Rivers State as well as published in a national newspaper.\n\nThe court processes once pasted at Secondus\u2019 residence and published in a national daily, the court held, was deemed to have been properly served on him.\n\nThe latest court action against Secondus might not be unconnected to the failure of his National Working Committee (NWC) to conduct a NEC meeting recently directed by the expanded Board of Trustees (BoT) meeting of the PDP.\n\nThe BOT, at a recent meeting to resolve the face-off between Secondus and some aggrieved leaders of the PDP, particularly the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, decided that Secondus should continue in office and that a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting be summoned to constitute the members of the National Convention of the party slated for the end of October,2021.\n\nThough the NWC had immediately advanced reasons why the NEC could not hold, the resort to litigations was not foreseen.\n\nBefore the extended meeting of the BoT, there were two opposing groups: those plotting the removal of the NWC led by Secondus and those, who wanted him retained till the end of his tenure in December 2021. The agenda of the meeting was to discuss the expected implosion in the party, due to the intractable leadership crisis.\n\nHitherto, the PDP was in serious crisis following the defection of three governors \u2013 David Umahi of Ebonyi State; Ben Ayade of Cross River State and Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State \u2013 and members of the National Assembly, who were elected on its platform. They all defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe mood dampening situation in the party was becoming worrisome as the PDP had lost 17 senators. The membership of the party in the House of Representatives had also diminished. Thus, some members believed the best way to resolve the crisis was by sacking the Secondus-led NWC.\n\nThe crisis, however, took a twist for the worst, when seven national deputies resigned in one day. Those who resigned were the Deputy National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Organising Secretary, Deputy National Legal Adviser, Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Deputy Woman Leader and Deputy National Auditor.\n\nThe resignation had ruffled feathers of the NWC, and was like a joke taken too far, as it triggered several reactions from stakeholders. First, was the PDP governors\u2019 forum through its chairman, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, the governor of Sokoto State, who summoned a meeting of his colleagues to resolve the crisis.\n\nIn line with series of meetings and a determination to resolve the crisis to save PDP, Chairman of the PDP Board of Trustees, Senator Walid Jubrin, summoned an expanded board meeting.\n\nThe perception in some quarters was that the new wave of crisis that has engulfed the PDP might not be unconnected to speculations that Secondus, might seek a second term at the national convention coming up in December. But some stakeholders, including Wike \u2013 Secondus\u2019 governor \u2013 were not comfortable with that.\n\nIn the long run, BoT chairman, Walid Jibrin, identified numerous problems in the PDP, which needed urgent attention.\n\nThey included lack of cohesion within and among major stakeholders that needed the intervention of the BoT as the highest advisory body of the party.\n\nJibrin urged his compatriots in the PDP to seize the moment, but this must begin with the PDP putting its house in order, by starting the right preparation for the impending elective convention to elect PDP\u2019s national leaders, that would lead the party in the 2023 general election.\n\nHe warned that the anticipated success of the PDP at the polls must not be sacrificed on the altar of personal interest and unnecessary in-house fighting, aimed at killing the objectives set by the party, noting also that PDP ruled for 16 years as against the total failure of the current government, which he claimed was characterised by incompetence and total insecurity.\n\nJibrin\u2019s line of thought aligned with other stakeholders and members of the BoT. It was a masterstroke that eventually dictated the terms of engagement at the meeting.\n\nBefore the meeting, a statement by Senator David B. Mark, Prof. Jerry Gana, Dr. Iyochia Ayu, Alhaji Sule Lamido, Senator Ahmed Makarfi, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, Senator Ayim Pius Ayim, Senator Ibrahim Mantu, Senator Adolphus Wabara, Dr. Okwesilieze Nwodo, Dr. Ibrahim H. Dankwambo, Senator Helen Esuene, Hajiya Zainab Maina, Olagunsoye Oyinlola, Hon. Austin Okpara, Senator Biodun Olujimi, Senator Zainab Kure,Senator Agboola Hosea, Senator Odion Ugbesia, Chief Mike Ogiadomhe, and Hajiya Hadiza Adodo, had appealed for calm while the crisis was being addressed.\n\nBy these interventions, the plot to move against Secondus and members of the NWC was defeated, even before the meeting commenced.\n\nIn taking that crucial step towards a resolution, the BoT members, NEC and other PDP stakeholders, erected a bridge over the troubled waters.\n\nUnfortunately, some stakeholders within the PDP had taken a hardline position already and it was only a matter of time before the boiling cauldron of repressed anger brimmed over with naked emotions.\n\nOne of the immediate steps taken by the BoT was to urgently meet with PDP governors, the NWC and other critical stakeholders.\n\nCuriously, those who wanted Secondus to stay in office till the end of his term, argued that it would leave a sour taste if Secondus was unceremoniously booted out of office. But his opponents left him with one foot of opportunity in the doorway. They wanted him to publicly renounce a second term ambition.\n\nTo enforce this position was a group led by Wike. This, sadly, underscored how much Secondus\u2019 ouster meant to the Rivers governor, hence he attended the BoT meeting for the first time.\n\nWith Jibril\u2019s agenda, which insisted that the meeting was crucial to the party\u2019s survival in 2023, it was clear that the meeting was not going to fulfil the agenda of the anti-Secondus elements.\n\nGiven the opportunity, a visibly relieved Secondus thanked the BoT for its intervention and an opportunity to live another day. He commended the party\u2019s reconciliation committee led by a former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, stating also how he tried to resolve the issue of the resigning deputies in the NWC.\n\nHe noted that the party\u2019s internal conflict resolution mechanism was quickly deployed so that the issues were not escalated to the point that the party would be greatly damaged.\n\nThe meeting ended after over four hours. The thrust of discussion was given fillip and made public by Senator David Mark, who said the meeting had resolved to set up a committee made up of the governors, members of the BoT, members of the National Assembly, all the members of the NWC, former governors, former ministers, so that they could holistically resolve the problems.\n\nA pointer to the fact that the crisis was about to be resolved was when the Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Diran Odeyemi, one of the officers that tendered their resignation, withdrew his resignation from office and vowed to work with the Secondus-led NWC to ensure a successful national convention, which would usher in new national officers.\n\nOdeyemi said in a letter dated August 4, 2021, that his decision to withdraw his resignation was taken in view of the activation of the internal method of resolving issues by leaders of the PDP across the length and breadth of Nigeria.\n\nBut Secondus\u2019 media office, while reacting to the development, has said, \u201cIf Secondus and the party are taken to court, they will defend themselves.\u201d\n\nThe office of the National Chairman of PDP was reacting to calls from media houses on a press statement sent to newsrooms by one Kelvin Ebiri, Special Assistant Media to Wike announcing that, a court had restrained Secondus from parading himself as national chairman and member of PDP.\n\nThe media office, in a statement by Ike Abonye, said, \u201cPDP and Secondus are not afraid of court. It\u2019s disheartening that the interim order of court used in removing the former Chief Justice of Nigeria, CJN, Justice Walter Onnoghen unilaterally in January, 2019 for which PDP vehemently condemned is resurrecting again from Port Harcourt.\n\nThis party is a child of history, owned by Nigerians, bigger than any individual or group including desperadoes.\u201d\n\nHowever, from all indications, it\u2019s not yet uhuru for the PDP, until after all the meetings and the coast is completely clear. Until then, the jury is still out.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Many medical doctors in Nigeria have applied for job positions with the Saudi Arabia ministry of health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe recruitment exercise was organised by the ministry in conjunction with Successlink Consult in Ikeja, Lagos state capital, on Sunday.\n\nThe job offer was for consultants and specialists in all medical fields, excluding psychiatrists.\n\nAmong those present for the interview were medical consultants and doctors in various areas of specialisation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheCable gathered that each applicant paid N10,000 as the application fee after which medical certificates, means of identification, and other documents were tendered at the point of documentation.\n\nAfter payment, the medical doctors were screened before a panel of Saudi Arabian personnel.\n\nSpeaking with TheCable, one of the applicants who specialises in hematology \u2014 a branch of medicine concerned with the study of blood, the blood-forming organs, and blood diseases \u2014 described the screening as the \u201cshortest interview of my life\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI showed them my original documents before going in and also presented the duplicates which they took to the interviewers. After making the payment, I was taken inside for the interview. The interview lasted like one minute, I think it\u2019s the shortest interview of my life,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have been hearing about such recruitments for a while but I have never applied.

We should rethink and rework that arrangement,\u201d Tambuwal said.\n\n\u201cI said that President Muhammadu Buhari should only do his programme of cattle routes or grazing reserves where the people or communities are interested.\n\n\u201cIf the government can provide infrastructure and support in locations where these practices are tolerated and understood, it can be done. Why must someone from Sokoto be pursuing his cattle to Delta State?\u201d\n\nTambuwal, who presented a paper titled: \u2018Security challenges in Nigeria and its implications for sustainable development\u2019, harped on the need for adequate security if Nigeria is to record substantial development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSecurity and development are also related in the sense that being a public good, the imperative to maintain security competes with other public goods such as education, health and infrastructure for public funds,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cExpenditures on security are therefore an essential component of the development process. For instance, the use of resources to strengthen a country\u2019s security system could have been useful in other relevant areas. Insecurity therefore, becomes a drain on state and national resources at the expense of development and peoples\u2019 wellbeing, thereby having adverse consequences on economic growth and development.\n\n\u201dThus, in the absence of any real threats to security, expenditures on security can be reduced significantly, allowing national and state governments to channel more resources to other areas of need to improve the quality of life of the people.\u201d",

          "text": "A Nigerian hacker recently tried to use disgruntled employees of an organisation to run a cyberattack scheme.\n\nAccording to cybersecurity firm Abnormal Security, on August 12, they intercepted a number of emails sent earlier in the month to some of their customers offering. The emails came with a $1 million offer, in bitcoin, to assist in a ransomware scheme.\n\nThe would-be attackers said they have ties to the DemonWare ransomware group, also known as the Black Kingdom or DEMON. This group has been around for a few years. In March, the ransomware was in the news for trying to exploit a significant Microsoft Exchange vulnerability.\n\nInitial email sent by the hacker | Image Credit: Abnormal Security\n\n\u201cIn this latest campaign, the sender tells the employee that if they\u2019re able to deploy ransomware on a company computer or Windows server, then they would be paid $1 million in bitcoin or 40% of the presumed $2.5 million ransom,\u201d Abnormal Security said.\n\nHow Ransomware works\n\nRansomware is a form of malicious software (malware) that encrypts a victim\u2019s files. It converts the information in the files into a secret code that hides the information\u2019s true meaning.\n\nHistorically, ransomware has been delivered via email attachments or, more recently, using direct network access obtained through things like unsecure VPN accounts or software vulnerabilities.\n\nOnce the malware has been deployed, the victim loses access to their files and then the attacker demands a ransom from the victim to restore access to the data upon payment.\n\nVictims of ransomware attacks are shown instructions for how to pay a fee to get the decryption key. The ransom in question can range from a few hundred dollars to millions, often paid to cybercriminals in Bitcoin.\n\nThe initial response from hacker reiterating offer on Telegram | Image Credit: Abnormal Security\n\n\n\nOver the course of five days, the team at Abnormal Security engaged with the hacker via Telegram pretending to be an employee that was willing to cooperate.\n\nThe hacker shared the file containing the malware and even reduced the ransome price upon hearing that the fake company\u2019s annual revenue was $50 million.\n\nHacker providing link to ransomware file | Image Credit: Abnormal Security\n\nHow did the hacker get the contact details of the people he contacted? He mentioned that he got their emails from LinkedIn. This, in addition to other commercial services that sell access to similar data, is a common medium scammers use to gather employees\u2019 personal data and information. He also stated that he had planned to target only senior level executives but when that plan failed, he pivoted to a ransomware scheme.\n\nHacker stating how he got the information| Image Credit: Abnormal Security\n\nLater in the conversation, he revealed that he was a Nigerian building a social networking platform.\n\nAbnormal security also ran an independent check that confirmed he was a Nigerian.\n\nHacker confirming he\u2019s a Nigeria| Image Credit: Abnormal Security\n\nInformation found on a Russian social media platform website connecting the hacker to Nigeria.\n\n| Image Credit: Abnormal Security\n\nDue to the pandemic and lockdown restrictions in the past year, the digital world has experienced a rise in cyber attacks. A number of these attacks are made possible via social engineering which relies on the oversight or negligence of people.\n\nThis story is coming at a time when the Nigerian government has allocated \u20a61.93 billion ($4.6 million) for a solution that will monitor and intercept WhatsApp messages. The solution is reportedly aimed at protecting Nigerians from cybercrime and terrorism perpetrated through such messaging platforms.\n\nHowever, media stakeholders and activists consider it as another attempt to restrict civil liberties.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "Grace Kouassi, an Ivorian construction retailer, goes through a lot of hassle when she has to pay employees their monthly salaries.\n\nHer challenges are not due to a lack of cash but stem from how best to disburse the funds. She has three options \u2013 use bank transfers, mobile money, or cash. In countries like Nigeria or South Africa, the first option, to an extent, is effective for business payments but not in Ivory Coast.\n\nCharges on real-time gross settlement (RTGS) interbank transfers can be as high as CFA17,000 ($30) and most times, the transfers take longer than expected \u2013 up to three days instead of a few hours \u2013 while also being prone to transaction issues.\n\nMany small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), like Kouassi\u2019s, grapple with costly and sluggish interbank transfers when paying employees or suppliers. They also can\u2019t use mobile money due to its limitations and are often forced to rely on inefficient and dangerous cash-based transactions.\n\nThese challenges are not limited to SMBs; they affect government institutions and even multilateral development organizations.\n\nEnter, Julaya.\n\nDigitising trade payments\n\nFounded in 2018, Julaya is a startup that provides businesses in Ivory Coast with mobile-based digital accounts to make money transfers.\n\nBefore launching Julaya, co-founders Mathias L\u00e9opoldie and Charles Talbot worked on the expansion of LemonWay \u2013 a marketplace payment solution \u2013 into Burkina Faso and Mali.\n\nIt was during their time at the France-based fintech firm they were introduced to the world of mobile money in francophone Africa and realised how businesses in Ivory Coast could reach a huge unbanked population faster via mobile phones.\n\nIn a country with around 26 million people, only 20% own bank accounts. But thanks to mobile money, millions of Ivorians can access basic financial services today.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Ivory Coast is one of the largest mobile money markets in francophone West Africa and continental Africa. Up to 75% of the adult population own a mobile money account.\n\nJulaya\u2019s platform.\n\nTackling the fragmentation problem\n\nA 2015 decision by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to allow nonbanks operate mobile money set the stage for a transformation in Ivory Coast\u2019s financial inclusion story.\n\nMobile money adoption has expanded since then, driven by all three of the country\u2019s mobile network operators (Orange, MTN, and MOOV) who share the market with two over-the-counter institutions, CelPaid and Qash Services.\n\nThere have been significant investments in digital finance products, building agent networks, and pushing for acceptance. Presently, Ivory Coast has the highest mobile money penetration rate in West Africa.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2018, mobile money transactions in the country rose from CFA4.5 trillion ($7.7 billion) to CFA6.3 trillion ($10.8 billion).\n\nBut like other markets in Sub-Saharan Africa, there is no interoperability between mobile money providers in the country. This means users can\u2019t send money to wallets from another provider.\n\nGiven the penetration of mobile money, some businesses make use of agents to initiate payments, with cash, to digital wallets. But using this method for payroll disbursements can be a hellish task.\n\nKouassi, for example, has 24 employees who have mobile money accounts from five different operators. Whenever she opts for this option, there are always accounting and reconciliation problems to deal with after.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nJulaya solves this pain point by helping businesses disburse money electronically to several mobile money and mobile banking wallets via a single platform, faster than wire transfers or cash transactions.\n\nThe startup works with telecom operators and other mobile money players, integrating their APIs into its platform and allowing businesses make easy transfers to digital wallets from different providers.\n\nBy reducing the reliance on cash, Julaya enables companies to streamline their accounting processes and improve operational efficiency.\n\n\u201cAn understanding of these payment challenges in the market was essential to developing a solution people would use,\u201d L\u00e9opoldie told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity was to translate a payments ecosystem designed for B2C payments (mobile money) into a solution that could offer a better corporate end-user experience of mobile transacting.\u201d\n\nToday, Julaya has onboarded eight mobile money services through direct connections with telcos and aggregators.\n\nThough the platform is built for business payments, it focuses on lower-value transactions. This is because the foundation of its product is designed for small payments, hence, higher-value transactions are not always feasible.\n\nStill, the startup has been able to onboard a wide range of clients, from SMBs to large corporates and government institutions \u2013 including the World Bank, Ivory Coast\u2019s Ministry of Education, and pan-African e-commerce company, Jumia.\n\nAs of July, it processed over $2 million monthly for 50 customers.\n\nThe Julaya team.\n\nJulaya\u2019s expansion plans\n\nJulaya plans to deepen its market penetration in Ivory Coast, in the face of competition from the market-dominant telecom operators, other mobile money players, and banks. There are also plans to roll out the service across the francophone West Africa region, where eight countries, including Ivory Coast, share a single currency and central bank.\n\nThe expansion will be driven by a $2 million pre-Series A secured by the startup recently and announced late July. Julaya had previously raised $250,000 in 2018 and $550,000 in 2019, both of which were from angel investors.\n\nPresently, Julaya operates out of two offices; its R&D and IT teams in Paris and a regional office in Abidjan. Across both locations, it employs 16 people.\n\nFinding the right talent to join the team is one of the major problems the startup is facing, according to L\u00e9opoldie, in addition to unreliable APIs from telecoms and a lack of trust in digitised payments, which makes customer acquisition costs high.\n\nBut Julaya\u2019s ambitions remain undeterred, with its expansion on schedule to start with an entry into Senegal this year.\n\nSome of the new investment will also be deployed into product development \u2013 specifically the addition of new digital wallets to Julaya\u2019s disbursement offering and possibly integrating the platform with its customers\u2019 enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u2026only those with proof of one dose of vaccination to access large gatherings\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Monday, flagged off the second phase coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination exercise, announcing restriction on mass gatherings across the state.\n\nObaseki, who spoke during the flag-off, at the Government House in Benin City, said those without proof of vaccination will not be allowed access to public places.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cBeginning from the second week of September 2021, large gatherings, as well as high traffic public and private places will only be accessed by persons who have proof of taking at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination. People who have not yet been vaccinated at all will depend on remote access to these gatherings.\n\n\u201cFrom the second week of September people may not be allowed to worship in churches and mosques without showing proof of their vaccination cards at the gates. Similarly, people will not be allowed to event centers, receptions or parties, without showing proof of their vaccination cards.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople will not be allowed to access banking services from the middle of September 2021, if they are not vaccinated. We have made adequate arrangements with security agencies to prevent anybody who doesn\u2019t have vaccination cards to access any of these places. We are doing this to protect our citizens and all these measures will remain until the pandemic passes away,\u201d the governor noted.\n\nObaseki said his administration will continue to strictly enforce all non-pharmaceutical measures to contain the pandemic in the state, adding that activities to mark Edo\u2019s 30th year anniversary have been scaled down significantly in compliance with COVID-19 protocols.\n\nHe said the new regulation is not to create a hardship on the people but to protect their lives and livelihood while the pandemic lasts, assuring citizens that the \u201cvaccine is available and free for all. We will not abandon you at this time of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nNoting that the pandemic is in its third wave in Nigeria, with its Delta variant having devastating effects around the world, the governor reassured the government\u2019s commitment to ensure the health and safety of Edo people.\n\nHe noted: \u201cIn Edo State, the data is very clear, as we have collected 6,306 samples, with 203 confirmed cases and four deaths in the third wave. 96 percent of all confirmed cases are those not vaccinated and 100 percent of deaths are those not vaccinated; it shows the importance of vaccination.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has come to stay as it is clear that, intermittently, other waves will occur. As such, it is wise for us all to embrace vaccination as a way of surviving this pandemic.\n\n\u201cFor us in the state, we have decided to push for vaccination, and within the next one year, we are focusing on vaccinating 60 percent of our citizens to enable us build herd immunity against this pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cToday\u2019s launch of this phase of our vaccination campaign will be driven by various stakeholders and strategic groups to increase our access to the vaccines. We have communicated with stakeholder groups because the pandemic doesn\u2019t respect persons or status.\n\n\u201cWe have 84 vaccination centers across the State; some are mobile while others are fixed as the list will be made available soon. We call on Edo citizens to support the launch and vaccination exercise kicking off today, as I encourage everyone to get vaccinated, as this is the only way we can save lives and livelihood, as well as return to our normal lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this launch today, we have two sets of vaccines being dispensed; the Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines. We are taking the vaccine seriously but we will not shut down Edo State,\u201d he noted.\n\nDelivering a lecture titled, \u201cCOVID-19 Vaccination, a Fighting Chance,\u201d the state epidemiologist, Dr. Greg Oko-Oboh said the world is experiencing the third wave of COVID 19 pandemic as the state is 8th out of the 36 State of the federation with the new infection.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has called for increased collaboration between governments at all levels and the traditional institution to tackle the problem of insecurity and other challenges confronting the country.\n\nObaseki made the call when he received the Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Adeyeye Ogunwusi, who was on a courtesy visit at the Government House Benin City, on Monday, August 23, 2021.\n\nThe governor also received in audience former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.\n\nObaseki, who identified insecurity and food challenges as some of the biggest problems facing the nation, noted that working with the traditional institution, governments at all levels \u201cwill be able to tackle these issues which will lead to the economic development of the nation.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOne of the biggest challenges that we have today is insecurity, as hoodlums terrorise our lives in various communities across the country.\n\n\u201cIf we must tackle the security challenges facing this country, Government must work very closely with the traditional authorities who are well-grounded in the grassroots and know the people well to bring to an end the security challenges facing this country. We are already doing that in Edo State and the results are there to show.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cThe economy of our country is not doing well and we all have a big role to play. Without us producing more for ourselves, we wouldn\u2019t be able to sustain our current level of imports.\n\n\u201cIt means that we will not be able to get sufficient foreign exchange to bring in what we consume. The exchange rate will begin to rise, the price of commodities will continue to go up and our people will dive more into poverty.\n\n\u201cThe traditional institution has a role to play, as we encourage our people to farm and produce more foods to feed ourselves. In the first half of this year, we have spent N1 trillion naira importing food and it\u2019s not sustainable.\n\n\u201cGovernment cannot do it alone; we encourage our young people to know that agriculture is a viable business in the country,\u201d he added.\n\nReassuring his government\u2019s commitment to sustain the partnership with the traditional institution in the state, Obaseki stated: \u201cWe embrace the traditional institution in Edo State as they have a deep sense of understanding of the challenges and problems in our local communities.\n\n\u201cEdo State is the home of culture and tradition and we don\u2019t joke with it. We hold our traditional institutions in high regard and will do all to protect, sustain and support them.\u201d\n\nThe governor further commended the Ooni for his passion and commitment to the unity and development of the country.\n\nCommending Atiku for his contributions to the advancement of the country\u2019s democracy, Obaseki said,\u201dI cannot thank you enough for the leadership that you continue to provide; the counsel you gave me during my electioneering, the private conversations, and the assistance you rendered to me when we joined the party; we had challenges, but you stepped up and threw your weight behind the resolution of the issues.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Ooni of Ife congratulated the governor on his victory in the September 19, 2020 gubernatorial election, hailing his government\u2019s developmental strides across all sectors of the state.\n\nHe assured the governor that traditional rulers will continue to work with constituted authorities to move the nation forward, and advised him not to be distracted but to remain focused and double his efforts in making life better for Edo people, particularly the youths.\n\nOn his part, Abubakar said his meeting with the governor centered on governance, current issues in the country, and how the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) could be strengthened to take over power in 2023.",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nA chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former presidential candidate in 2019, Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has said for the country to prosper, the fight against corruption must continue beyond 2023 .\n\nHe observed that a good step to win the war on graft is to ensure that corrupt people with unexplainable wealth do not get elected at any level.\n\nHe said those \u201cwho have explanation to make to anti-graft agencies and are aspiring for public offices, must be put to task about their integrity\u201d.\n\nIn a statement he entitled\n\n\u20182023: The fight against corruption must not stop!\u201d, Mr Olawepo-Hashim recalled that when he was growing up, \u201cit was the practice then, that women laid their wares by the roadside and indicated the price of the product by the numbers of stones they kept on the ground\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo one took the products without dropping the correct sums of money, and no one who passed by took the money and/or the wares away.\n\n\u201cI so much long for a return to the country of simple and honest people that Nigeria was, and that is why it was easy for me to connect with the War Against Indiscipline (WAI) message of General Buhari and Idiagbon in 1983.\n\n\u201cIn Ilorin, Kwara State where I schooled, we were the disciples of Idiagbon\u2019s campaign against corruption as President of the Dramatic Society in Cherubim and Seraphim College. I was the lead actor in a drama skit against corruption on NTA Ilorin Youth scene. Also, I busted a pattern of stealing in the college kiosk perpetrated by students appointed to supervise the kiosk, that is a story for another day, that readers would find in my coming autobiography \u2018Sunrise at Midnight\u2019 by the of Grace of God. The first volume will be released soon,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that the fight against corruption was a major plank of the Buhari administration, adding that \u201ccorruption was one of the major reasons Nigeria is backward and the underbelly of some of the security problems of the country such as banditry\u201d.\n\n\u201cNigeria loses a lot to corruption. According to Price Water Cooper (PWC), a global Consulting outfit, if not arrested by 2030, corruption will be costing Nigeria 37% of her GDP; i.e. 200 billion USD, a whooping N100 trillion (Naira), about 10 times our national budget.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will translate to 1,000 USD per capital; N500,000 by each Nigerian. The significance of this on our lives, in terms of avoidable death is staggering.\n\nCorruption in Nigeria is in various dimensions in high places caused by indisciplined lifestyles, weak regulatory regimes and institutions, eroding ethics and values and a triumphant feeling of impunity that believes there will be no consequence for wrong doing!\n\n\u201cAt the lower levels, corruption is rationalised as a result of poor earnings. \u2018Man go survive\u2019 or as that everybody is doing it, \u2018It is our way\u201d\u2019. But it is not our way.\n\n\u201cThe corruption situation is compounded by an increasingly expanding population of people with ethics and value system that have come to embrace corruption as an acceptable standard and become increasingly audacious that they attack men and women of integrity as \u2018failures\u2019, even though most of the attackers come from the ranks of the poorest, they are choristers of those \u201cnouveau-riche\u201d, who have helped themselves from the public purse.\n\n\u201cThey have a sizable presence online venerating corrupt lifestyle. The fight against corruption is a serious business, law enforcement will not be enough to win it; regulatory reforms are important but just as well as ethical reform on a mass scale; the role of technology is also central in this fight as we aim to reduce the scope of human manipulation of the system,\u201d he said.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nThe businessman and global energy executive, assured that the fight against corruption is winnable, \u201cbefore some agents of the corrupt start spreading their fatalistic slogan that no one is a saint\u201d.\n\nHe said \u201cthere are some inspiring examples in the system even right now. Professor Oloyede as head of JAMB has been returning billions of naira to Federal Government coffers in an agency that has not returned millions before. He is also fighting examination scams that have seen even parents of candidates as culprits. Oloyede is not a pastor or a Bishop. He is a patriotic Nigerian, standing for good values. As a matter of fact, most religious houses have become more or less centres of corruption, where the teachings of obedience of God\u2019s commandments and fear of God have long disappeared.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mr Olawepo-Hashim, \u201ca good footstep in winning the battle to reduce corruption if not kill it totally, is to ensure that corrupt people with unexplainable wealth do not get elected at any level. Those who have explanation to make to anti-graft agencies and are aspiring for public offices must be put to task about their integrity question. If we are ever going to birth a new Nigeria, it cannot be with the corrupt as midwives.\u201d",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nLagos based constitutional lawyer and one time governorship candidate of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) in the state, Bob Okey Okoroji, has appealed to the governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodinma to work towards restoring peace in Imo, noting that extrajudicial killing of residents of the state by security agents is not acceptable.\n\nOkoroji who made the appeal in a chat with our correspondent, regretted that Imo and the entire Eastern Nigeria is under military siege, accusing President Muhammadu Buhari of deliberately targeting the region under the guise of fighting members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nRecall that days ago, global human rights body, Amnesty International said not less than 115 persons from the Southeast have been extrajudicially killed by Nigeria and security operatives between March and June, noting Nigerian security forces in response to attacks by separatists in the region, have committed a catalogue of human rights violations and crimes under international law, including sweeping mass arrests, excessive and unlawful force, and torture and other ill-treatment.\n\nAmnesty which gave the account in a report titled ,\u2019Nigeria: At least 115 people killed by security forces in four months in country\u2019s Southeast,\u2019 also said many of the victims were deposited at government hospitals in Imo and Abia states and that several hospital sources, who spoke to AI stressed that all the victims deposited by the police had bullet injuries.\n\nThe report added that at least 21 security personnel were killed in three months in Imo State.\n\nHowever, accounts by organisations in the region have suggested that the number residents killed and stressed is much higher, and Okoroji who regretted that the practice has not ended, encouraged Uzodinma to talk to Buhari to end the military siege of the state.\n\n\u201cI want to respectfully all the the governor of Imo State, His Excellency, Hope Uzodinma to bring peace to Imo State. Imo State needs peace more than anything else. Imo people are not asking for too much; they are just asking for peace, they are asking for the redeployment of soldiers that have been deployed to the state to kill our young people,\u201d Okoroji said.\n\n\u201cImo is under military siege. That must be brought to a stop. The government of Imo State should urge Buhari and his acolytes to remove the military from Imo State. Imo is a secure state, it is a peaceful state that used to be one of the most peaceful states of the federation. It is the presence of the army and other security agencies who are busy abusing the rights of the people, abducting young men from their houses under the guise that they are IPOB and BSN without proof. They pick them up and they disappear; they are not taken to court, they are not charged for any offence.\u201d\n\nOkoroji pointed out that while random citizens are being picked and disappeared in Imo, Boko Haram terrorists who have killed thousands of Nigerians, including soldiers, are being pardoned and rehabilitated with public funds.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn a daily basis we have the same government patronizing Boko Haram and pampering herdsmen. They are paying them millions of naira in the the so-called reintegration programme. These are people we are not even sure are Nigerians. But they rehabilitate them and put some of them into Nigerian Army. Who does that?\n\n\u201cBuhari must realise that Nigeria is not his personal property. We are not even sure whether his interest is in Nigeria. His interest appears to be somewhere else maybe in Niger Republic, which he places above Nigerian interest.\n\n\u201cThe federal government should end this military siege in Eastern Nigeria. Our people should not continue to bear the brunt of Buhari\u2019s hatred. You can\u2019t rule by intimidation; you can\u2019t roll by oppression, you can\u2019t rule by threat, you can\u2019t rule by violence. Development and violence don\u2019t go together.\n\n\u201cThey are destroying lives; killing civilians. They are not even targeting the unknown gunmen committing crimes, they are just killing civilians. They kill innocent young men and tag them IPOB or ESN.\n\n\u201cThey should go after the so-called unknown gunmen. I do not even think that those people are IPOB or ESN. They are perhaps a gang of hoodlums recruited by the government themselves to find an excuse to wreak havoc on Igbo land.\n\n\u201cIt is important that this hypocrisy and this hatred for the Eastern region by the Buhari government come to an end; it is high time it came to an end. Buhari is doing the Eastern Region and in the entire Southern Nigeria a great disservice. No meaningful development, it has been crisis all the way in the past seven years. The country has known no peace. The economy has the nosedived; there is insecurity everywhere. Millions of people have been displaced in the north-east and north-west and the middle belt and there are killings in Eastern Nigeria, what end?\u201d\n\nOkoroji equally condemned attempts by President Buhari to impose grazing reserves for Fulani herdsmen on states, noting that its an expansionist agenda that has since been decoded.\n\n\u201cThe Fulani expansionist agenda has been decoded. They should understand that nobody is going to tolerate. People have become conscious. The open grazing policy should be thrown into the dustbin. It will never work. It is actually the cause of insecurity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is important that those who are into private business should be the ones financing their businesses, not government seeking to seize and acquire indigenous peoples lands four vandals from Sahel who call themselves herdsmen.\u201d",

This is barbaric and uncalled for. We would want to remind them that our youths are resilient and fearless and no form of threat will stop us.\n\n\u201cWe must use this opportunity to inform the NDDC that we the youths of this region are not deterred by their antics to emasculate and shut us up. This protest must go on as we have planned it.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are calling on the Federal Government, the Rivers State Government, the Director DSS, the Inspector-General of Police to be aware that the NDDC is on the move to ignite crisis in the region. We have avowed that we will remains peaceful in our demands, but we will not want to be pushed to wall.\n\n\u201cWe also call on youths of the region to come out en masse for this move to restore legitimacy on the NDDC. We further encourage the over 2000 youths that will be taking part in this protest to conduct yourselves peacefully.\u201d",

          "text": "Kaduna state Governor Nasir El-Rufai has said the best way out of banditry and other forms of violent criminality is to hunt and kill all of them.\n\nEl-Rufai spoke Monday while featuring on a BBC Hausa Service programme.\n\nHe said his administration\u2019s resolve is to \u201chunt the Fulani bandits down and kill them until the remaining surrender or give up banditry.\u201d\n\nThe governor said taking the offensive to the criminals would show that government has the will and might to deal with them ruthlessly.\n\nHe said: \u201cThat is the position of Kaduna State government and that of our counterpart in Niger.\n\n\u201cWe sat down in Katsina and spoke, governors of the north east, some are of the position that we should declare war on them but some wanted negotiations and offering them amnesty. That\u2019s the problem we have been having.\n\n\u201cLike I said earlier, before now, Katsina\u2019s position was negotiations and amnesty for bandits but now, they have shifted from that position and wanted total declaration of war on bandits.\n\n\u201cLike I have concluded, a Fulani herdsmen who used to make ten thousand in a month and one hundred thousand in a year after selling his cow will not stop banditry after he has made millions just on one job.\n\n\u201cAnyone who tells you a Fulani herdsman who kidnaps and makes millions will go back to the lifestyle of herding where he makes one hundred or two hundred thousand in a year is deceiving him or herself.\n\n\u201cSo our position is for the federal government to use all its security agencies, the army, the Air Force, police and all security operatives to fight and kill them to the last.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, if they realise that they are overpowered, they are the ones who would come begging for amnesty.\n\n\u201cI receive reports of 10 to 20 arrests of Fulani herdsmen daily and someone is saying they would stop, I swear they would never stop.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of compensations and amnesty for the bandits, he quipped: \u201cWhat compensation? Compensation for what reason? They that just kill people, burn down their houses, what type of compensation are they talking about?\u201d\n\nTroops rescue 15\n\nMeanwhile, troops of Operation Safe Haven have rescued 15 commuters kidnapped in two vehicles while in transit in Jagindi, Jema\u2019a local government area of Kaduna state.\n\nThe state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr Samuel Aruwan said this Monday in a statement.\n\nHe said the troops repelled the kidnappers and rescued their victims, adding that intensive search and rescue was ongoing in the area.\n\n\u201cTroops of Operation Safe Haven have reported to the Kaduna state government the rescue of 15 commuters in Jagindi, Jema\u2019a LGA,\u201d Aruwan said.\n\n\u201cAccording to the report, the 15 persons had been kidnapped from two vehicles in the area while in transit. The troops responded to a distress call and mobilized swiftly to the location. They repelled the bandits, enabling the rescue of the abducted persons.\n\n\u201cThe rescued persons are listed as follows: Maisaje Pam, Samuel Peter, Ziyau Abdul, Henry Dabo, Abduljabar Auwal, Muhammad Ali, Dama Dabo, Ramatu Aminu, Muhammad Sani, Abdullahi Muhammad, Bashar Garba, Abubakar Musa, Saad Yakubu, Maryam Ibrahim and Lami Bitrus\n\n\u201cActing Governor Dr Hadiza Balarabe noted the report with satisfaction and thanked the troops for their swift response, which resulted in the rescue of the commuters.\n\n\u201cThe troops are sustaining search and rescue operations in the area,\u201d the statement further added.\n\nZamfara fresh attack\n\nAnd from Zamfara state came the report that bandits in their numbers stormed Goran Namaye town of Maradun local government area of the state, killing four people and abducting 50 persons in a fresh attack, the state Police command has confirmed.\n\nCommand\u2019s spokesman, SP Muhammad Shehu stated this Monday in an interview with Blueprint.\n\nHe said, already, the search and rescue mission team comprising mobile police and other sister security personnel had been deployed to the scene to ensure return of peace and rescue of victims unharmed.\n\n\u201cThe Command has formally discovered that the bandits kidnapped 50 persons, killed 4 people during the attack on Goran Namaye town of Maradun local government area in Zamfara state last night and we shall strive to ensure victims are rescued unharmed as relative peace has returned to the area,\u201d Shehu stated.\n\nAlso, the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Ayuba N. Elkana urged communities to report any strange movement within their respective domains to Police for prompt response.\n\nResident narrates ordeal\n\nSpeaking to Blueprint on the telephone, a resident of the area, Sulaiman Gora, said the bandits invaded their town at around 1:30 am Monday, and indiscriminately shot into the air during which they abducted family members of the district head, Abubakar Musa and yet to be ascertained number of people during the attack.\n\n\u201cWe just woke up hearing heavy gunshots in our town around 1:30 am of today Monday in the midnight and our people, out of fear, scampered for their safety. But we cannot ascertain how many of our people were kidnapped for now as I am talking to you,\u201d Gora said.\n\nHe appealed to both the federal and state government to come to their rescue.\n\n\u201cWe want to call on relevant authorities to as a matter of urgency do the needful by deploying more security personnel to our area in order to fight these dreaded criminal elements who terrorise us day in day out,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernor Bello Mohammed Matawalle had earlier initiated the peace reconciliation process during which hundreds of weapons were surrendered by the repentant bandits.\n\nHowever, some of the bandits rejected the process and continue attacking innocent communities.\n\nFamily of fallen police officers\n\nMeanwhile, Inspector General of Police Usman Baba Alkali has presented cheques to seven persons as next-of-kin of the deceased police officers who died in the line of duty in Zamfara state under the IGP Welfare Insurance Scheme.\n\nPresenting the cheques on behalf of IGP at the command headquarters Monday, CP Elkana said the gesture was in line with the IGP\u2019s readiness to cushion the hardship faced by the deceased family.\n\nHe tasked beneficiaries to make judicious use of the money.\n\nBlueprint reports that the seven beneficiaries of the scheme include five women and two men.\n\nMasari explains position on \u2018self-help\u2019\n\nAlso, Katsina state Governor Aminu Masari has clarified his call on residents to defend themselves against criminal elements terrorising the state.\n\nIn an interview aired on Nagarta Radio, the governor said: \u201cIt\u2019s very important for the people to rise up and support the government effort. Apart from the money we are spending on security, hardly a day passes by without a person being killed or kidnapped. No single day, although the situation is not as bad as it was last year.\n\n\u201cWe thank God for that but normalcy has not yet completely returned because just a few days ago about 10 people were killed in a village, how can you as a leader be okay with this situation?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we came on board in 2015 we inherited killings and banditry in the state. In 2014 there was a single attack that claimed over 100 lives around Faskari and Sabuwa LGAs. This is the situation we met on the ground happening daily because we always received reports of animal rustling and killings attributed to bandits and local vigilantes-yan sakai-in the state.\n\n\u201cAt that time Fulani women had stopped coming to town and farmers too had stopped going to the bush. We later discovered that it was not a problem of Katsina state alone, it\u2019s a problem that affected Niger, Zamfara, Kaduna states and later Sokoto, Kebbi and Jigawa.\n\n\u201cThe military supported our steps which led to our meetings in Kaduna to find a solution. All security agencies were brought in and they all worked together for a year and recorded some successes.\n\n\u201cThen, we met with the Security Chiefs at defence headquarters but after a year it stopped. We were later asked to return home and handle the situation.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we discovered those bandits are Fulanis so we took advantage of that by ensuring that we got an official from a local government to be elected in their union and through him we reached out to those people in the forest.\n\n\u201cLater the SSG, police commissioner and DG SSS all went to the bush during that period but we discovered that the bad eggs among the Fulani that ran to the bush were to protect their animals.\n\n\u201cThis is how we entered into a dialogue with Fulani leaders and the vigilantes across the eight LGAs. We reached an agreement at Kankara in the presence of all our traditional leaders including late notorious Buharin Daji and they returned with over 300 guns,\u201d Masari said.",

Despite their position, there have been calls from some members of the party demanding the resignation of the PDP national chairman.\n\nOn August 3, seven national officers of the main opposition party resigned from their roles, alleging that they were being side-lined and treated unfairly by Secondus.\n\nThis, among several other events, forced an emergency meeting of members of the PDP Board of Trustees who sought ways to resolve the crisis in the party.\n\nHowever, the controversy has taken a new twist with the court order restraining Secondus from parading as the PDP national chairman, pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.\n\nJustice Gbasam made an order granting leave to serve by substituted means the originating summons, motion on notice, all orders made by the court, as well as all subsequent processes on Secondus by pasting them on the gate of his house in the state capital, and by publishing same in a newspaper.\n\nHe also granted the request to serve by substituted means all orders made by the court on the respondents and by publishing same in a newspaper.",

          "text": "Over 1,000 returning travellers from red-listed countries \u2013 India, South Africa, Brazil, and Turkey \u2013 have absconded from isolation in Lagos State, the government alarmed on Monday.\n\nThe state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, raised the alarm while giving an update on the COVID-19 pandemic and how the government is working to curb the spread of the disease.\n\nHe revealed that a total of 1,073 inbound passengers out of 88,847 who arrived in Lagos via the Murtala Mohammed International Airport between May 8 and August 21 \u2013 have tested positive.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu stated that as of Saturday, the state has identified 5,998 of the returning travellers and successfully isolated 4,500 people who arrived from the red-listed countries, while 1,094 have absconded.\n\nHe explained that the COVID-19 protocols on mandatory isolation were put in place by the Presidential Steering Committee to protect Nigeria from an imminent third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe governor, however, decried that Nigerians who disregard the protocols and abscond from isolation were directly putting the rest of the country at risk of unending waves of the pandemic.\n\nAs of Saturday, Lagos had recorded 70,563 cases, out of which 60,716 have recovered in-community and 4,387 are being managed actively in-community.\n\nOver the course of managing the pandemic, about 5,551 patients have been admitted into various government facilities with 506 registered fatalities.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu disclosed that of these deaths, 135 have happened in the current third wave of the pandemic.\n\nHe blamed the emergence of the third wave on non-adherence to the laid-down health protocols designed to mitigate the pandemic.\n\nThe governor, therefore, informed the residents that they have a huge responsibility of contributing to the fight against the virus.\n\nHe hinted that the state government has taken substantial steps to arrest the third wave in its tracks, especially with the increased monitoring and enforcement exercise by members of the Incident Command structure.\n\nBut Governor Sanwo-Olu warned against recalcitrance on the part of the residents which he said led to the higher infection rates that were recorded in the state.\n\nRead the full text of his briefing below:\n\nFellow Lagosians,\n\nLet me start by commiserating with all Lagos residents who have lost loved ones to the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWe share your pain and your grief. Every loss of life experienced is one too many, and the least we can do as a society and as a government is for us to redouble our efforts to defeat this devastating pandemic.\n\nMuch of the world \u2014including the African continent \u2014 are now clearly in the middle of a third wave of the pandemic. From the start, Lagos State has been the epicentre of the disease in Nigeria, and that remains the case in this third wave.\n\nThe test positivity rate, which measures how many tests are returning positive, out of every 100 tests conducted, currently stands at 12.1%; compared to 1.1% at the end of June 2021, and 7% at end of July 2021.\n\nWe have identified that the third wave emerged on account of non-adherence to the laid-down health protocols designed to mitigate this pandemic. For this reason, it is essential for me to, once again, remind all of us of the huge responsibility we have to contribute to fighting and defeating this virus.\n\nAs a State Government, we have taken substantial steps to arrest this third wave in its tracks, most notable of them is the increased monitoring and enforcement embarked upon by members of the Incident Command structure.\n\nUnfortunately, we have recorded severe recalcitrance on the part of the public, which has led to the higher infection rates that we are now recording.\n\nThe health and travel protocols and guidelines issued by the Federal and State Governments exist to protect and safeguard us all and the inconveniences that might come with them are only a small price to pay, to avert far more serious consequences.\n\nEpidemiology Update\n\nAs of the 21st of August 2021, Lagos State had recorded a total of 70,563 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Of this number, 60,716 have recovered in-community, and 4,387 are currently being managed actively in-community.\n\nOver the course of managing the COVID-19 pandemic, about 5,551 patients have been admitted into our various COVID-19 care centres in Lagos, with 506 registered fatalities. Of these deaths, 135 have sadly, happened in this current third wave.\n\nHome-Based Care\n\nOur home-based care programme, powered by the EKOTELEMED call center, has so far catered to 5,074 Covid-positive persons, out of a total of 20,716 positive persons who have been offered the programme. What this means is that 3 of every 4 Covid-positive persons offered the free Lagos State telemedicine programme have opted not to use it.\n\nOn a more positive note, I am happy to report that 94% of all the persons who have opted into the home care programme, translating to 4,787 persons, have been discharged, and no deaths have been recorded since it was launched in 2020.\n\nAs I have mentioned several times, EKOTELEMED has since become a critical part of our COVID-19 response, providing call centres services and wholesome management of positive cases that do not require hospitalisation.\n\nAll persons who opt to use the programme receive a home care pack, in addition to telemedicine access. We need more positive persons to take advantage of the programme. Please reach out to EKOTELEMED on our toll-free number 08000EKOMED (08000356633), if you have any symptoms associated with COVID-19 or have tested positive for the virus.\n\nVaccine Distribution and Access Strategy One of the major pillars of our mitigation strategy for the third wave is vaccination. We are seeing that countries that have vaccinated a large percentage of their population are recording drastic reductions, in the numbers of COVID-19 related deaths.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we have not spared any cost to ensure that the vaccines that have been provided by the Federal Government are made available to every resident that meets the requirements for the vaccination program. Lagos State received its allocation of 299,992 doses of the Moderna vaccine on the 18th of August 2021.\n\nThis allocation is for the second phase of the national vaccination campaign, which will commence in Lagos State this Wednesday, August 25, 2021. We have developed an elaborate plan to administer the vaccines in 150 centres across Lagos State.\n\nThe increase in the number of centres is to prevent the gathering of large crowds and ensure that the vaccination campaign does not itself become a super spreader event, considering that the strain fuelling this new wave of the pandemic is a very virulent one. We will ensure that the administration of this vaccine is based solely on appointment.\n\nPlease, do not visit any of the allocated facilities until you have registered online and been given an appointment date. Register and book an appointment on the Federal Government\u2019s vaccination portal, at nphcda.vaccination.gov.ng.\n\nYou can find the list of healthcare facilities at which vaccinations will be taking place on the website of the Lagos State Government. Our ultimate goal in Lagos State is to vaccinate 60% of our residents in good time. Let me remind all Lagosians that Covid19 vaccination in Nigeria is free of charge.\n\nThe Moderna vaccine is a two-dose vaccine, like the AstraZeneca vaccine that was deployed during the first phase of vaccination. When you receive your first dose you will be given a date on which to return for your second and final dose. Let me also reiterate that this Moderna vaccine that will be administered starting this week should not be mixed with the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nWhat this means is that only persons who have not been previously vaccinated at all should take the Moderna vaccine. If you have previously taken one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, please exercise patience as we await delivery of a fresh allocation from the Federal Government.\n\nTravel Protocols for in-Bound Passengers Between the 8th of May, 2021 and the 21st of August, 2021, a total of 88,847 Persons of Interest (POIs) have arrived in Lagos via the Murtala Mohammed International Airport. Of the 88,847 POIs, 1,073 have tested positive following arrival.\n\nAs dictated by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID19 (PSC), passengers from red-listed countries (India, South Africa, Brazil and Turkey) are required to observe mandatory isolation.\n\nAs of 21st of August 2021, Lagos State has identified 5,998 of these persons and successfully isolated 4,500 of them arriving from the red-listed countries, while 1,094 have absconded.\n\nThe COVID-19 protocols on mandatory isolation were put in place by the Presidential Steering Committee to protect the country from an imminent third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nigerians who disregard the protocols and abscond from isolation are directly putting the rest of the country at risk of unending waves of the pandemic.\n\nTesting and Treatment\n\nTo help us better manage the pandemic, we have invested in strengthening the capacity of the Lagos State Biobank to sequence positive cases. Sequencing allows us to identify the predominant strains of the COVID-19 virus in our environment and provides us with information on how to better respond to the pandemic.\n\nIn terms of treatment of the more severe cases, let me say a few things specifically about the use of oxygen, which is a vital requirement for the management of the most severe cases. We have indeed seen a gradual increase in the uptake of oxygen during this pandemic, from the utilisation of 75 cylinders per day at the beginning of this third wave, to over 400 cylinders per day, currently.\n\nWith our modelling suggesting that we may be requiring even more oxygen supply over the next few weeks, we are exploring several ways of increasing our oxygen capacity, including partnering with the private sector.\n\nAt the moment we have two functioning oxygen plants, at the IDH in Yaba, and in Gbagada, and are looking forward to shortly taking delivery of two additional oxygen plants being built in Lagos State by the Federal Government.\n\nOur target is an oxygen supply capacity of 1,000 cylinders per day, in Lagos State. It is important to note that oxygen supply is free at all public facilities designated for the treatment of Covid-19 in Lagos State.\n\nWe encourage members of the public to report any of our staff soliciting fees for the provision of oxygen, to the Office of The Honourable Commissioner for Health, and assure that appropriate disciplinary action will be taken.\n\nConclusion\n\nManaging a pandemic of this nature and scale is not and will never be an easy endeavour. It is costly and requires hard work and commitment from a wide range of stakeholders and partners, sacrificing their time and energy and resources on multiple fronts to slow down the virus, and eventually to tame it.\n\nIt also involves efforts in the direction of maintaining livelihoods and ensuring that the disruption to socio-economic activities is minimised. As always, I must specially thank all the members of our Emergency Operations Centre and our Incident Command System, in addition to all our health workers in the public and private sectors.\n\nSpecial thanks also to all our colleagues in the Federal institutions for their dedication and commitment to the management of this response. We are also grateful to all the Lagosians out there who have accepted the personal responsibility that lies upon us all to play our part in the efforts to tackle this virus.\n\nTo everyone else, I appeal for your cooperation. The threat of the Coronavirus is not theoretical, it is very real. We have been on the journey now for about eighteen months, and we are all witnesses to the immense disruptions we have seen on every front, not to talk of the many lives that have been lost.\n\nWe are all united in our desire to put this virus and the pandemic behind us as quickly as we can, but this will not happen if we continue to disregard health protocols. We also cannot afford to allow a sense of fatigue to set in. The consequences of this will be enormous. Avoid large gatherings as much as possible, avoid all nonessential travel, wear your mask in all public places, and maintain high levels of personal hygiene at all times.\n\nIf you\u2019re showing symptoms or suspect you may have contracted the disease, isolate yourself and contact 0800-0356633 immediately, if you\u2019re in Lagos State. We can make this third wave the final one. But we have to be deliberate about it. It will not happen by chance.\n\nGod bless Lagos State, God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nBabajide Sanwo-Olu\n\nGovernor of Lagos State\n\nAugust 23, 2021",

          "title": "Nigeria: Katsina Governor Masari Insists That Citizens Acquiring Arms to Repel Bandits Way To Go",
          "text": "Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has said a major reason the negotiations the state once had with bandits broke down was because those who entered into the amnesty programme among the Fulani were murdered in the bush and the development scared away the others.\n\nThe governor, who also explained why he asked residents of the state to bear arms and defend themselves against the increasing attacks of the bandits, said it was the only way to go if the state must reduce the level of carnage by the criminals.\n\nSpeaking in an interview aired on Nagarta Radio, Kaduna, and monitored by a national daily (not THISDAY), Masari, who lamented that bandits had continued to kill the people despite the state government\u2019s effort towards protecting them, however, established how the negotiations with the bandits failed.\n\nHis words: \u201cWhen we came on board in 2015, we inherited killings and banditry in the state. In 2014, there was a single attack that claimed over 100 lives around Faskari and Sabuwa LGAs. This is the situation we met on the ground happening daily, because we always received reports of animal rustling and killings attributed to bandits and local vigilantes yan sakai in the state.\n\n\u201cAt that time, Fulani women had stopped coming to town and farmers too had stopped going to the bush. We later discovered that it was not a problem of Katsina State alone, it\u2019s a problem that affected Niger, Zamfara, Kaduna States and later, Sokoto, Kebbi and Jigawa.\n\n\u201cThe military supported our steps, which led to our meetings in Kaduna to find a solution. All security agencies were brought in and they all worked together for a year and recorded some successes.\n\n\u201cThen, we met with the Security Chiefs at defence headquarters but after a year, it stopped. We were later asked to return home and handle the situation.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we discovered those bandits are Fulani, so we took advantage of that by ensuring that we got an official from a local government to be elected in their union and through him we reached out to those people in the forest.\n\n\u201cLater, the SSG, police commissioner and DG SSS all went to the bush during that period but we discovered that the bad eggs among the Fulani that ran to the bush were to protect their animals.\n\n\u201cThis is how we entered into a dialogue with Fulani leaders and the vigilantes across the eight LGAs. We reached an agreement at Kankara in the presence of all our traditional leaders, including the late notorious Buharin Daji and they returned with over 300 guns.\n\n\u201cLater, things gradually returned and life went back to normal before the whole thing took a different dimension, because those who entered the amnesty among the Fulani were murdered in the bush and that scared away others.\n\n\u201cThis was how the dialogue stopped especially, around villages bordering Zamfara before the 2019 election. I remembered we built 10 schools in the villages located inside the forest.Also, we built 10 Primary Health Centres in those villages but they later turned the schools as their base in the bush.\n\n\u201cAfter the 2019 election, we all knew what happened in Zamfara. The new governor vowed to continue with the dialogue and the IGP then supported the move, same with the military,which started from Zamfara and continued from where we stopped. We supported the military with logistics to have a battalion built in Katsina.\u201d\n\nOn the charge to the people to defend themselves, the governor stated categorically that citizens could no longer fold their arms and allow the bandits kill them unnecessarily since there were no adequate security personnel to guard every community.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt\u2019s very important for the people to rise up and support the government effort. Apart from the money we are spending on security, hardly a day passes by without a person being killed or kidnapped. No single day, although the situation is not as bad as it was last year.\n\n\u201cWe thank God for that but normalcy has not yet completely returned, because just a few days ago, about 10 people were killed in a village. How can you, as a leader, be okay with this situation?\u201d\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja",

          "title": "Nine Women Now Serving as Governors in US, Tying a Record",
          "text": "Taking over on short notice for a scandal-plagued predecessor in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul began her tenure Tuesday with more than enough challenges for a new administration.\n\nShe also began with a historic opportunity: Hochul is the first woman to hold one of the most prominent governorships in the U.S.\n\n\u201cNew York as a whole has been a tough place for women to break into the highest levels, because there is very much a tight set of powerful gatekeepers,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.\n\n\u201cAnd unfortunately \u2014 even in 2021 \u2014 women are still seen, in effect, as newcomers,\u201d she said.\n\nHochul, a Democrat, became the ninth woman currently serving as a governor. That ties a record that was set in 2004 and matched in 2007 and 2019, but it\u2019s still well shy of gender proportionality.\n\nA century after women gained the right to vote, 19 states still have never been led by a woman. That includes some of the most populous states, such as California, Florida, Pennsylvania and Illinois. Even if it succeeds, California\u2019s recall election of Gov. Gavin Newsom next month doesn\u2019t appear likely to elevate a woman to the state\u2019s top job.\n\nHochul had served as New York\u2019s lieutenant governor until succeeding fellow Democrat Andrew Cuomo, who resigned after a decade in office. Cuomo had faced a potential impeachment battle after an attorney general\u2019s investigation said he had sexually harassed or inappropriately touched 11 women. Among other things, Cuomo also had faced a legislative investigation into whether he misled the public last year about COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes.\n\nHochul already has announced she will seek a full four-year term in 2022.\n\nNext year could be a pivotal one for women running for governor. Democratic Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon will be the only female incumbent barred from seeking re-election by term limits. Six male governors also will be term-limited, opening a path to office for fresh candidates from both parties.\n\nIn Arizona, where Republican Gov. Doug Ducey can\u2019t run again, the field already has several candidates who are women, including Republican state Treasurer Kimberly Yee and Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs. Arizona already holds the record for the most women who have served as governor \u2014 four. Kansas has had three.\n\nIn Arkansas, which has never had a woman serve as governor, a high-profile Republican primary pits Attorney General Leslie Rutledge against Sarah Sanders, press secretary for former President Donald Trump and daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee. The incumbent, Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, will be termed out.\n\nIn 2018, women\u2019s political advocates also thought they were primed for success with a record number of candidates for governor. But they did not ultimately set a new record for victories.\n\nWomen currently hold 18% of governors\u2019 offices \u2014 significantly less than this year\u2019s new records of 27% of U.S. congressional seats and 31% of state legislative seats. In addition, Vice President Kamala Harris also became the first woman in that role this year.\n\nPart of the challenge in electing women as governors is overcoming stereotypes of men as stronger, more decisive leaders, Walsh said.\n\nAnother challenge is deepening the pool of women willing to enter politics, said Wendy Doyle, president and CEO of the Kansas City, Missouri-based nonprofit United WE.\n\nThe organization is coordinating an effort to get more women appointed to positions on state, county and city boards and commissions. It\u2019s working with local officials in California, Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania Texas and Washington. The idea is that some women appointed to positions eventually will run for elected offices.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long game,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to build the pipeline; we\u2019ve got to build the bench.\u201d",
