          "text": ".\n\nBy Ebunoluwa Sessou & Elizabeth Ushie\n\nOver 2000 residents of Okegun-Museyo in Ibeju-Lekki local government area of Lagos state on Monday send a Save Our Soul, SOS to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa calling on the duo to rescue them from land grabbers who have encroached their lands.\n\nThe residents including children, women and youths in a peaceful protest in Alausa called on Lagos State Government to intervene in the unlawful demolition of their houses by an Estate Agency, DPKay Homes and Property.\n\nThey defied the scorching sun, rather armed themselves with placards with various inscriptions appealing to the governor, Speaker, House of Assembly, Mudasiru Obasa, as well as the Senator representing Lagos East senatorial district, Tokunbo Abiru, and others to help stop the demolition and return their land to them.\n\nWith different inscriptions, the residents lamented that the company has imposed untold pain in the community since the incidence started in February 2022.\n\nThis ugly situation according to the residents has been a reoccurrence incidence where thousands of residents would be rendered homeless by land grabbers who come under the guise of government.\n\nThe property owners, who had lived for over 12 years in the community, grading roads and developing other facilities through self-help, were surprised after the land grabbers stormed the community and claimed that the land belong to them.\n\nSpeaking to some of the children and women, they lamented that, since the incidence happened, they can no longer to school while the mothers could not go about their daily business.\n\nOne of the residents, Barrister Wilfred, lamented explained that, over 2,000 people including women and children live in that area and they have been making efforts to regularize their property documents with the State government.\n\n\u201cWe legally procured the land from the government and we were told by New Town Development Agency, NTDA that our land was not allocated by the government to anybody and we were given documents to prove it. Our community is duly registered both in Lagos and as a CDA.\n\n\u201cPrior to the ban placed on community excision by former governor Akinwunmi Ambode, the residents had begun processing regularization of the land and immediately the ban was lifted by the incumbent Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the community had began processing the excision in Alausa and has been there for three years.\n\n\u201cSome people that masqueraded themselves as Alausa men came over and told us that the place belongs to Aiyetoro Scheme and it is the government\u2019s property.\n\nAs a lawyer, \u201cI know that the community does not belong to the government, we know it has not been excised yet but the process is on at Alausa where our application is being processed by the government.\n\n\u201cWe are peaceful Lagosians, if they want to displace us now, where do they want us to go? Where will our women and children go?, he lamented.\n\nThe land grabbers claimed they are Itunu Residential Estate in ties with DPKay Homes. They have encroached into our land, with claims that they are from the government but were not able to produce any legal document upon request rather they have gone ahead with demolitions.\n\nSome of the property owners were said to be hospitalised after watching the hoodlums, brought by the alleged land grabbers, demolish their structures which they erected with proceeds gotten over the years from petty businesses they engage in.\n\nAs gathered, some of the residents were widows who erected the building from the gratuity paid to their husbands after their demise, basically to prevent paying rents daily, which could have taken a large chunk of the money.\n\nAnother resident, former CDA chairman, Kolawole Ojo, who displayed documents indicating the government approvals, said that the community does not exist in isolation, saying the Lagos State government recognises that the Okegun-Museyo community is in existence.\n\nSpeaking with the residents, it was gathered that prior to the demolition, there was no presentation of a court injunction and there were claims from the DPKay agents that they legally procured the land from the government; according to them, they were told by NTDA that their land was not allocated by the government to anybody and was given a paper to prove it. They hammered on the fact that their community is duly registered both in Lagos and as a CDA.\n\nThe Community Development Association (CDA) chairman, Adedeji Adeagbo, described their situation as traumatising, disclosing a landlord has landed in the hospital after she was told that her house has been demolished.\n\nHe added that they have embarked on the process that the government indicated was necessary for property owners to wade off land grabbers from any property procured from the community.\n\n\u201cWe have done the charting and a document was received indicating that the land was not acquired by the Lagos State Government and that it has not been bought over by anyone before we all purchased it.\n\nAddressing the protesters, the Chairman, House Committee on Lands, Richard Kasumu, commended the protesters for conducting themselves in a peaceful way to achieve their aim.\n\n\u201cWe sympathise with you over the demolition of your properties by some people in the state. Going forward, we can assure you that no one in Lagos State intimidates another person. The Lagos State Government will not allow that; we can assure you of that.\n\n\u201cTo ensure justice on this issue, we will be inviting all parties attached to the issue and ensure that everyone that needs to get justice received it\u201d, the chairman added.\n\nAlso, the chairman, House Committee on Finance, Rotimi Olowo, said: \u201cAs your representative, we will ensure that no one cheats you and that is why we have decided that call all parties to stop land grabbing in Lagos\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

The meeting expressed great disappointment in the Federal Government and ASUU for their lack of empathy to the cause of Nigerian students who are the major victim of this unnecessary show of strength.\n\n\u201cNANS passes vote of no confidence on the Minister of Labour and Productivity and his counterpart in the Ministry of Education to continue to lead government negotiation team. They are either incompetent to engage productively with ASUU at the highest level or they lack the goodwill and trust to build consensus and find an amicable resolution.\n\n\u201cWe call for the immediate intervention of traditional institutions and religious institutions to prevail on the Federal Government and ASUU to reopen our universities while they continue their negotiation. We believe that every sector of the nation shall be adversely affected by our actions if this strike is not called off.\n\n\u201cAlso the underlisted past NANS leaders currently occupying political positions across the country are by this publication called upon to intervene, lobby and advise Federal Government and ASUU appropriately on what to expect if this strike is not called off,\u201d the statement read.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Mai Mala Buni.\n\nThe president said his decision was necessitated by the need to save the party from INEC\u2019s hammer.\n\nVanguard had last week reported how Gov. Buni had left Dubai for London to confer with the president and seek his intervention in the leadership crisis that has recently threatened the party to its foundation.\n\nIn a letter dated March 16 and addressed to the Chairman, Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum PGF and Kebbi state Governor, Abubakar Atiku, the president said the status quo ante be maintained.\n\nThe letter was copied by the acting CECPC Chairman, Gov. Sani Bello, Secretary to the Government of the Federation SGF, Mr Boss Mustapha, Director General State Services, Yusuf Magaji Bichi and the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba.\n\nThe letter reads; \u201cAs you are, no doubt aware, the All Progressives Congress, APC, is currently facing a litany of controversies and some level of uncertainties that may ultimately question its status and affect the status and feasibility of its proposed National Convention.\n\n\u201cIn addition, it has come to my attention that, because of recent events, the APC is faced with a multiplicity of court cases pending against it in various courts across the country.\n\nAlso Read:\n\n.Breaking: APC Crisis: Buni\u2019s allies retake National Secretariat\n\n\u201cAs a result of this, the party faces the possibility and prospect of the invalidation of all its activities and actions by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the party has demonstrated its inability to proceed with the issue of effecting change in the leadership of its Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee (CECC), in a way that is inclusive, legal and respectful of the time limit set and required for giving the INEC sufficient notice of the time and venue for holding its convention.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, these controversies and uncertainties, as enumerated above, pose a real threat to the party; and may lead to a possible nonrecognition of its activities, elections and the probable invalidation of all its other actions by INEC. This may ultimately even lead to its implosion and non-existence.\n\n\u201cThere is, therefore, an urgent need for the party too, as much as possible, avoid all controversies, litigations and all other necessary distractions and quickly get its acts together.\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing, therefore, I would like now to direct as follows:\n\n\u201cFirst, the issue of the leadership of the Caretaker Extra Ordinary Convention Committee (CECPC), should immediately return to status quo ante;\n\n\u201cSecond, all members of the Governor\u2019s Forum and their followers should desist from any behaviour or utterance that will likely lead to disunity in the ranks of the party, and ultimately jeopardise the transition to the convention;\n\n\u201cThird, the Mai Mala Buni-led CECPC should, accordingly, be allowed to proceed with all necessary preparations to hold the convention as planned\u2014 unfailingly, on 26th March 2022\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has sent a message to Nigerians, regarding the shortage of petrol and electricity in the country.\n\nBuhari, who apologized, expressed sincere regrets for the inconvenience caused to citizens of the country following a prolonged shortage of petroleum products, something that the administration has successfully averted in its seven years in office.\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the President, \u201cthe administration knows the fuel shortage has placed a strain on Nigerian citizens and businesses, but relief is on the way. I especially apologize to all sections of society for this.\n\n\u201cThe government is working round the clock to attend to this issue. An action plan agreed upon earlier this month is being implemented to address the scarcity. Working together with the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) and the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), this plan is now bearing fruit. Sufficient fuel supply has returned to a handful of states, with the queues at stations falling. In the coming days, we expect this to be the case across the rest of the country.\n\n\u201cLooking to the longer term, funds are being targeted toward keeping fuel availability affordable for the country. The international energy markets have surged drastically in recent months, the government will, however, ensure that\n\nconsumers are protected against these price spikes.\u201d\n\nThe President added that he has received information that some people are not behaving properly at the depots and among owners of petrol stations and in this regard, he has directed the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), the NNPC and the entire security apparatus of the nation to take strong action against those responsible.\n\nOn the issue of electricity blackouts being experienced across the nation, President Buhari remarked that \u201cthe blackouts seen in the national grid are also being addressed. A dip in hydroelectric generation due to seasonal pressures has coincided with technical and supply problems at thermal stations. On this, the government is also working tirelessly to resolve the issues at the latter to guarantee sufficient power flows into the national grid.\u201d\n\nAs part of emergency measures put in place following a meeting convened with key stakeholders to address the low power generation in the country, the main challenge was identified as being one of low gas power generation as a result of sabotage of gas pipelines leading to the shutdown of power plants coupled with ongoing routine maintenance on other gas power plants.\n\nTo recover over 1000MW, actions were agreed upon between the players in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) and also NNPC. The actions targeted the National Integrated Power Project (NIPP) plants, (Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) and power plants run under NNPC Joint Ventures, Agip and Shell (NAOC and SPDC) and progress on the key actions have already ensured the restoration to the grid of 375MW after the pipeline from \u201cOkpai 1\u201d was repaired.\n\nTo also ramp up the underutilised capacity of the NDPHC capacity, a USD 50 Million Gas Supply agreement is being finalized to secure the sustainability of up to 800MW of underutilized NIPP assets.\n\nThe President assures that the government\u2019s attention to these problems will bear fruits very soon.",

          "text": "President insists on March 26 convention date\n\nYobe governor back, cancels NEC meeting\n\nThe leadership impasse in the All Progressives Congress (APC) has been halted by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe President asked party members to support Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni as chairman of the ruling party by maintaining the \u201cstatus quo\u201d.\n\nHe directed Buni to ensure that the convention planned for March 26 is held \u201cunfailingly\u201d.\n\nPresident Buhari gave the direction in a letter he wrote to the governors elected on the ticket of the party after a meeting yesterday with Buni in London, United Kingdom, where he has been undergoing a medical check-up.\n\nThe President enjoined the governors to eschew behaviour and utterances that could put the party in jeopardy and attract sanctions from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nBuni cancelled the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting fixed for today by Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani Bello, who acted for him.\n\nA statement by Secretary of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) John James Akpanudoedehe, said Buni had directed that \u201cthe purported emergency NEC meeting\u201d be cancelled henceforth.\n\nThe ruling party has been enveloped in crisis.\n\nThe caretaker committee and the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum were split into two camps over the alleged sabotage of the planned convention.\n\nBuni, who was on medical vacation in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, was accused of plotting to truncate the convention by refusing to disclose the receipt of an ex-parte order, which Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai described as a \u201cnuclear weapon\u201d.\n\nHe said President Buhari approved the ouster of Buni so that Governor Sani Bello would drive the process to the convention.\n\nIn his March 16 letter addressed to Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Kebbi State Governor Atiku Bagudu, President Buhari said: \u201cAs you are, no doubt aware, the All Progressives Congress (APC) is currently facing a litany of controversies and some level of uncertainties that may ultimately question its status and affect the status and feasibility of its proposed National Convention.\n\n\u201cIn addition, it has come to my attention that, because of recent events, the APC is faced with a multiplicity of court cases pending against it in various courts across the country.\n\n\u201cAs a result of this, the party faces the possibility and prospect of the invalidation of all its activities and actions by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the party has demonstrated its inability to proceed with the issue of effecting change in the leadership of its Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee (CECC), in a way that is inclusive, legal and respectful of the time limit set and required for giving the INEC sufficient notice of the time and venue for holding its convention.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, these controversies and uncertainties, as enumerated above, pose a real threat to the party; and may lead to a possible non-recognition of its activities, elections and the probable invalidation of all its other actions by INEC. This may ultimately even lead to its implosion and non-existence.\u201d\n\nBuhari asked APC governors to salvage the party by getting their acts together.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is, therefore, an urgent need for the party to, as much as possible, avoid all controversies, litigations and all other necessary distractions and quickly get its acts together.\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing, therefore, I will like now to direct as follows:\n\n\u201cFirst, the issue of the leadership of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee (CECPC) should immediately return to status quo ante;\n\n\u201cSecond, all members of the Governors\u2019 Forum and their followers should desist from any behaviour or utterance that will likely lead to disunity in the ranks of the party, and ultimately jeopardise the transition to the convention;\n\n\u201cThird, the Mai Mala Buni-led CECPC should accordingly, be allowed to proceed with all necessary preparations to hold the convention as planned-unfailingly, on 26th March 2022. Thank you very much.\u201d\n\nAccording to a source, who spoke in confidence, Buhari had an audience with Buni in London and directed him to take over the affairs of the party immediately.\n\nThe source said: \u201cBuhari insisted that he did not order the removal of Buni. He was shocked to read about the turn of things in the party and the division among APC governors.\n\n\u201cAt the London meeting, he gave Buni a must-do list for a hitch-free national convention and how to return the party to the path of democracy.\u201d\n\nAn aide to Buni confirmed that he was airborne last night to Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cOga is already on his way to Abuja from London to take charge at the APC National Secretariat. He will do his best to hold a successful convention.\u201d",

          "text": "By Tony Akowe and Nicholas Kalu, Abuja\n\nAll Progressives Congress (APC) stalwart Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu gave an insight into what President Muhammadu Buhari told him when he informed the President about his intention to vie for the exalted office.\n\nHe said the President encouraged him to declare his aspiration and display his democratic credentials.\n\n\u201cWell, come out and let us see you run and we see how you can promote your democratic credentials,\u201d the one-time Lagos State governor quoted the President as saying when he to the President of his ambition to succeed him.\n\nHe was addressing members of the APC Caucus in the House of Representatives.\n\nTinubu said he was the most competent Nigerian in the race with a proven track record in both the public and private sector, growing Lagos from being the third dirtiest city in Africa to becoming a mega city.\n\nThe presidential aspirant said he was seeking to take over from Buhari and not to step on his toes, adding that others aspiring to lead the country cannot be trusted while describing them as rolling stones for their movement from one party to the other.\n\nHe said: \u201cDemocracy is not adversarial. It is when we have collaboration of the body, particularly the legislative body that is the pillar of democracy. In Nigeria, the strongest part of us is the legislature \u2013 government of the people, by the people and for the people. No question about it.\n\n\u201cYou have equally passed landmark legislation, such as the PIA that rationalises nearly every aspect of oil and gas production. What I want to request you to do is to support me.\n\n\u201cI have discussed that aspect of my lifelong ambition with Mr. President, that after the end of his tenure in 2023, I want to step into his shoes and not step on his toes.\n\n\u201cI have the opportunity today to come and consult with you. I am here as a Nigerian who has gone through the great tutelage of independent accounting in one of the best financial accounting of this world. I was one of those recruited graduates of my university with multiple honours and a first class degree.\n\n\u201cMost people have nothing to offer but questions and creating doubt. I am not here to be defensive. I am here to tell you that I am one of the best products that you can sell. I am the only one in the race that is most competent, most qualified to be your President come year 2023.\n\n\u201cI am the only one who has been through the tutelage of the National Assembly. I am the only one who has consistently been in one party. The others are not stable. Some of them are rolling stones.\n\n\u201cI have been through the National Assembly. I have been in the corporate world with a background in the public sector, academic, finance and development. I have inherited one of the most badly managed states in the history of this country.\n\n\u201cI can look back now today and I am proud to be standing before you representing that great state which is now a mega city with a national budget higher than three countries of West Africa, developed a N600 million a month internally generated revenue to N40 billion a month\u2026.show me that nation, that state in West Africa.\n\n\u201cTo say it all, I still want to humbly and respectfully serve the country with your collaboration. There is no crime in that. They do not have anything to say, and they say he (Tinubu) is not well. I am not applying to do a mixing for concrete and sand and building 34 skyscrapers.\n\n\u201cI am only applying to do a job with my can-do attitude, break the shackles of poverty, and remove the roadblock in our revenue.\n\n\u201cWhy are we not competing with Russia with our God given gas. What are we waiting for? Can we not create a long term fund that would be a financial institution that would finance our infrastructure decay.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t we define and remember that there is no other discovery of this humanity in the last 1000 years like electricity constantly in homes and for industrial development.\n\n\u201cWe have God given reserves, capacity, knowledge and brain. We can do it. Let us wear the can-do attitude. I did not ask for the gloves of Joshua to box for heavyweight. I ask for your collaboration today to be a bridge. We define our hopes, we define our destination and land Nigeria on a prosperous well developed country. I ask for your endorsement.\n\n\u201cYou are the ones with the votes and supporters who can make me succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. I want to be your partner to forge a future for this country. We can do it.\n\n\u201cWe are the most populous country in Africa. We have the best brains, we have the capacity; we have the resources. Let us join hands together. We can work together to make this country the Eldorado of our time.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question from the House deputy speaker on the developments in the party, Tinubu said: \u2018We are not in crisis. We will solve our problems. Anybody who understands democracy should understand the facts about conflict and conflict resolution. That is the mechanism to solve problems in democracy. Another thing is voting.\n\n\u201cThat is why there is primary, there is contests and that is why I am here. I could have been sleeping at home and enjoy myself. But I have to strive and toil. We drove all the way from Sokoto to Zamfara, held private meetings, burning the midnight oil to get results.\n\n\u201cI want to thank this House. Also the fact that when I was undergoing physiotherapy for my knee replacement surgery, a number of this House members paid me a get well visit led by the Deputy Speaker. I say thank you very much. I am well and standing on my two feet. I have been going about, no more pain.\n\n\u201cI am not going to do the Olympics. The Olympics that I know is politics and strategy to win and then we will win by the grace of God Almighty. We shall be there. There is no problem in our party. We will make this party a winning party again.\n\n\u201cPeople are complaining. How much have they achieved? If they had done well, Nigeria would not reject them some eight years ago. With your support, they are not going to return to the misery of the past years.\u201d",

          "text": "The Federal Government will soon stop paying for unused electricity, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) Chairman, Sanusi Garba, has said.\n\nGarba told reporters in Abuja that issues surrounding the N1.6 trillion debt which electricity Generating Companies(GenCos) are demanding its payment, were technical.\n\nApparently accusing GenCos of lacking the capacity to deliver, he said that \u201cit will be reckless to sign agreement for the generation plants for capacity that has not been delivered.\u201d\n\nHe queried why \u201cNigeria will be paying for the capacity that has not been useful to Nigerians\u201d when \u201cthe infrastructure\u201d that ought to be provided by the firms \u201c is not there.\u201d\n\nNERC Vice-Chairman, Musiliu Oseni, also gave insight into the national grid collapse on Monday and Tuesday. Oseni blamed the development on a conductor snap on a 330 Kilovolts (kV) transmission line along the Benin, Edo State axis. The fault was however said to have been rectified yesterday.\n\nPointing out that some of the GenCos have no effective contract on payment of unused electricity, Garba said: \u201cIf a generation company has effective Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), that provides for payment of a certain level of capacity, then there is an obligation to pay.\n\n\u201cA number of generation companies however has no effective contract that guarantees the payment of the so-called unutilised capacity.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is that we are gradually migrating to a point where the generation plants will have capacity payments being somewhere and somehow delivered along the value chain.\u201d\n\nThe power sector regulator chieftain, also explained that the government has stopped the payment of electricity subsidy, saying the decision to discontinue it (subsidy) was entirely that of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t run the electricity market on life support,\u201d he said as he recalled that \u201cin the past four or five years, the payment of subsidy has gradually been reduced to about N30 billion this year.. .\n\nHis words: \u201c I believe all of you can understand that you cannot run the electricity market on life support and say that the investors should not get their return on investment.\n\n\u201cThat policy decision was announced by the Minister of Finance. Subsidy at a point was as high as N600 billion a year. and gradually has dropped to N30 billion this year. So that policy decision is from the government and we take directive from the government.\u201d\n\nOn compensating consumers for poor service, especially as outage worsens, Garba said NERC has robust data gathering strategies and would do such. He said NERC had once compelled Jos DisCo to refund N200 million to consumers for poor service as well as Enugu DisCo.\n\nNERC Vice-Chairman Oseni, who fielded a question on the grip collapse, said\u201d The first system collapse happened due to a conductor snap on the 330 kilovolts Benin transmission line axis, it cascaded into the loss of 414 Megawatts of electricity from the Ughelli plant.\u201d\n\nHe noted that power generation dropped from the 5,300 Megawatts (MW) average in October 2021 to 4350MW in March.\n\nOseni said it was a dip by about 1000MW on the grid that denied some customers enough supply.",

This change, therefore, removes the need for unvaccinated passengers to take a pre-departure test and a day two post arrival test.\n\n\u201cThis step reflects the decisions taken by the government, as set out in the Living with COVID plan, and the success of the UK\u2019s vaccine and booster rollout, with 86 percent of the population having received a second dose and 67 percent of the population with a booster or third dose.\u201d\n\nFollowing the development, the United Kingdom Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps said: \u201cThe UK is leading the world in removing all remaining COVID-19 travel restrictions, and today\u2019s announcement is a testament to the hard work everyone in this country has put in place to roll out the vaccine and protect each other.\n\n\u201cI said we wouldn\u2019t keep travel measures in place for any longer than necessary, which we\u2019re delivering on today \u2013 providing more welcome news and greater freedom for travellers ahead of the Easter holidays.\n\n\u201cI look forward to continuing to work with the travel sector and partners around the world to keep international travel moving.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution...

Chairman, CECPC and Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Bello, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, Director General, Department of State Service , Yusuf Bichi and Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba.\n\nBuhari, in the letter, lamented that the ruling party was currently facing a litany of controversies and some level of uncertainties that might ultimately question its status and affect the status and feasibility of its proposed National Convention.\n\nHe stated: \u201cIn addition, it has come to my attention that, because of recent events, the APC is faced with a multiplicity of court cases pending against it in various courts across the country.\n\n\u201cAs a result of this, the party faces the possibility and prospect of the invalidation of all its activities and actions by the independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the party has demonstrated its inability to proceed with the issue of effecting change in the leadership of its Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee (CECC), in a way that is inclusive, legal and respectful of the time limit set and required for giving the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) sufficient notice of the time and venue for holding its convention.\u201d\n\nThe President stressed that no doubt, these controversies and uncertainties, as enumerated above, pose a real threat to the party; and might lead to a possible non-recognition of its activities, elections and the probable invalidation of all its other actions by INEC.\n\nBuhari said this might ultimately even lead to its implosion and non-existence.\n\nAgainst this background, Buhari said there was, therefore, an urgent need for the party to, as much as possible, avoid all controversies, litigations and all other necessary distractions and quickly get its acts together.\n\nThe President directed: \u201cFirst, the issue of the leadership of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Committee (CECC), should immediately return to status quo ante:\n\n\u201cSecond, ail members of the Governors\u2019 Forum and their followers should desist from any behaviour or utterance that will likely lead to disunity in the ranks of the party, and ultimately jeopardise the transition to the convention;\n\n\u201cThird, the Mai Mala Buni-led CECC should, accordingly, be allowed to proceed with all necessary preparations to hold the convention as\n\nplanned unfailingly, on 26th March, 2022.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

When I joined the Action Congress (AC) which my friend Bola (Tinubu) set up, he gave me a set of conditions for giving me the ticket, one of which was that I should make him the Vice President. I said no, \u2018I\u2019m not going to make you Vice President,\u2019 instead, I took Senator Ben Obi,\u201d Atiku said.\n\nTinubu is currently one of the presidential aspirants of the ruling APC, while Atiku is one of the major contenders for the PDP presidential ticket.\n\nAtiku added that when he got the ticket again in 2019 to run, he took another Obi coincidentally.\n\n\u201cSo, there is absolutely no reason they should say that there is a deliberate attempt to exclude the South-East in political participation or power sharing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I thought I should disabuse your mind and of course, as an enlightened political class, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any deliberate policy to exclude anybody in this country,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has apologised to Nigerians over the petrol scarcity and power outage experienced in the country.\n\nSince February, there has been petrol scarcity in the country following the importation of off-spec petrol into the country.\n\nThe scarcity, although now easing off in parts of the country, led to hike in the price of petrol as well as long queues at filling stations.\n\nMeanwhile, there are currently reports of power outages across the country, with the national grid said to have collapsed twice within the past 72 hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a statement issued on Wednesday by Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, Buhari said the federal government is taking steps to address the situation.\n\nThe president said he regrets the inconvenience experienced by Nigerians regarding petrol shortage, adding that actions would be taken against those responsible for worsening the situation at depots.\n\n\u201cThe administration knows the fuel shortage has placed a strain on Nigerian citizens and businesses, but relief is on the way. I especially apologise to all sections of society for this,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe government is working round the clock to attend to this issue. An action plan agreed upon earlier this month is being implemented to address the scarcity.\n\n\u201cWorking together with the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) and the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), this plan is now bearing fruit. Sufficient fuel supply has returned to a handful of states, with the queues at stations falling. In the coming days, we expect this to be the case across the rest of the country.\n\n\u201cLooking to the longer term, funds are being targeted toward keeping fuel availability affordable for the country. The international energy markets have surged drastically in recent months, the government will however ensure that consumers are protected against these price spikes.\u201d\n\nOn epileptic power supply, Buhari said \u201cthe blackouts seen in the national grid are also being addressed\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA dip in hydroelectric generation due to seasonal pressures has coincided with technical and supply problems at thermal stations,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cOn this, the government is also working tirelessly to resolve the issues at the latter to guarantee sufficient power flows into the national grid.\u201d",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal is set to launch a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Sokowatch, an e-commerce company offering tech-enabled supply chain solutions to Africa\u2019s informal retailers, on Wednesday said it has closed a $125 million Series B equity round at a valuation of $625 million, per TechCrunch.\n\nAlongside the new funding, the company has rebranded to Wasoko, which translates to \u201cPeople of the Market\u201d in Swahili and also launched in Abidjan (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) and Dakar (Senegal), its first locations in West Africa.\n\nInitially launched in Kenya by founder and CEO Daniel Yu in 2015, Sokowatch scaled into neighboring East African markets Tanzania, Rwanda, and Uganda in 2018. The West Africa expansion thus brings its total markets to 6.\n\nSokowatch explains in a statement its new brand reflects a \u201cshift from its origins as a backend distribution software platform in East Africa to a public brand providing free delivery of essential goods and working capital financing to informal retailers across opposite ends of the African continent\u201d.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhat Wasoko does\n\nMore than $600 billion of consumer goods are sold in Africa through informal retail channels every year, supplying the vast majority of the 1.2 billion population.\n\nDespite its importance, the informal retail sector still remains highly fragmented and inefficient with local shops facing a number of major challenges including frequent stockouts, limited access to capital, and difficulty receiving goods from suppliers.\n\nThrough Wasoko\u2019s platform, informal retailers are able to order products at any time via SMS or mobile app for free same-day delivery to their stores. And leveraging purchasing data, the platform also evaluates retailers to provide them with access to Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) financing.\n\n\u201cInformal retailers capture the vast majority of consumer spending in Africa, and they are dramatically underserved by existing distribution and financial infrastructure,\u201d Andrew Sugrue, Founding Partner at Avenir Growth Capital said on the VC firm\u2019s investment in Wasoko. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about what Wasoko is building and the efficiencies it brings to these retailers and their suppliers.\u201d\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Wasoko claims to have delivered 2.5 million orders to over 50,000 informal retailers across Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Senegal with revenue growth over the past 12 months at over 500%. It currently has more than 800 full-time employees across Africa.\n\nOn why the company is expanding into francophone West African markets instead of Nigeria, which is arguably the largest market for informal retail in Africa, Yu explains to TechCrunch that the choice reflects the strong growth that its choice countries have exhibited in the region overall.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the past 10 years, both Senegal and Cote d\u2019Ivoire have experienced solid year-on-year GDP growth,\u201d the CEO said. But Wasoko adds it is exploring expansion into Southern Africa and Nigeria nonetheless while continuing to consolidate its position across its six current countries.\n\nA mega-round for the record books\n\nLed by Tiger Global and Avenir Growth Capital, Wasoko\u2019s latest raise is the second-largest venture financing round ever secured by a non-fintech startup in Africa and the largest in the B2B retail e-commerce space, where a host of players like TradeDepot, MarketForce, Omnibiz, Alerzo, and others ply their trade.\n\nThe round comes 2 years after Wasoko closed a $14 million Series A and saw participation from VNV Global; Binny Bansal, co-founder of Flipkart; and Sujeet Kumar, co-founder of Udaan; Quona Capital; 4DX Ventures; and JAM Fund.\n\nThe new capital will enable Wasoko to drive further geographic expansion and product growth across the continent, according to the company.\n\nThe company said it is also examining opportunities to expand its product offering to verticals such as merchant point-of-sale systems, bill payments, and social commerce through both internal innovation as well as strategic investments and acquisitions of relevant companies.\n\nIn addition to the fundraising and rebranding, Wasoko has made several appointments to its senior leadership team.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "On a cool evening in the summer of 2016, a group of friends in Cameroon were having a nice time over a bottle of wine.\n\nAfter a while the conversation drifted to the topic of investments and the opportunities that abound in the country. As the conversation got more serious, Serge Nnmatak, then Director of Public Policy at Microsoft; Rebecca Enonchong, founder and Chief Executive Officer of AppsTech; and other friends talked about pooling resources together to start investing in Cameroonian startups.\n\nMembers of the group started attending startup pitches and investing informally, learning the ropes of angel investing along the way. They invested individually in the startups, or collectively invested in a startup pitched by a group member.\n\nAfter two years of doing this and welcoming new members to the group, it was time to make the investing arrangement formal by registering the group.\n\nThis was where they faced their first big challenge.\n\n\u201cWe got a very interesting challenge from the government, because people were asking us, if your organisation\u2019s name is Angel, it means you\u2019re probably a church. You should be registered as a religious group, so follow the registration process for churches,\u201d Nnmatak said over a call.\n\nAfter much back and forth over the span of 2 years, the government officials finally accepted that Cameroon Angel Network (CAN) was not a church and, in 2020, their registration was finalised.\n\nSince then the Cameroon Angel Network has continued to invest in startups and attract new members, mostly entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cWe have a few other people running their businesses or making a living from Cameroon,\u201d Nnmatak said, explaining the composition of the Cameroon Angel Network. \u201cOur members include a former executive at Microsoft, IBM and Oracle who now owns his own business. We have a former CEO of the largest company in Cameroon. We also have people in the diaspora who are investors, some in Silicon Valley, California.\u201d\n\nHe also stressed that to qualify to be a member of the Cameroon Angel Network you just have to be someone who is interested and willing to invest in Cameroonian startups. You don\u2019t need to live in Cameroon or be from Cameroon.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How\u2019s it being like recruiting people to join CAN?\n\nSerge Nnmatak: It\u2019s been mostly through word of mouth. It\u2019s as simple as just mentioning it to someone I come across that I think is a good fit. We all know people within our network.\n\nIt\u2019s important to add here that, in the beginning, we didn\u2019t want too many people. We wanted a few people who were entrepreneurs and could bring something to the table. Now we want to get more people to invest because we\u2019ve seen that there\u2019s a lot of money in circulation. However, we need to convince people to spend this money on startups or else they\u2019ll typically build bakeries, hotels, or residential properties.\n\nFor this new set of people, joining the Cameroon Angel Network is no longer just based on personal relationships but through a proper explanation of how angel investing works: how much they can invest, the risk they\u2019re exposed to, and possible returns. We\u2019re going to take a structured and professional approach.\n\nDA: That\u2019s awesome! So what\u2019s different about investing in francophone startups?\n\nSN: I\u2019d like to first point out that Cameroon has a dual culture: you have the French-speaking parts, which is the majority of the population, and the English-speaking regions. (Remember, Cameroon shares borders with Nigeria in Adamawa state.)\n\nNotably, the startup scene started in the anglophone part of Cameroon. Why? The government invested in a small training centre that grew into a full university. It became the bedrock of entrepreneurship and an area now called Silicon Mountain. This helped increase the maturity of entrepreneurs and investors in that region.\n\nOn the francophone side, however, the available body of knowledge was small; there wasn\u2019t much knowledge about how to build a startup. This is because the francophone ecosystem is a bit closed. Here people turn to France a lot, and, until recently\u20142\u20133 years ago\u2014there wasn\u2019t much you could learn from France. France was very inward-looking in terms of entrepreneurship and building startups. Although we\u2019ve made progress in the past 5 years. So the first thing to note about investing in francophone Africa is the maturity of the players in the startup ecosystem.\n\nNext is the market size and sophistication. In terms of market size, Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya are top in Africa. Whereas, while C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for instance\u2014when you look at basic economics today\u2014is the leading country when it comes to Gross Domestic Product (over $60 billion) and has a population of over 20 million people, its wealth is heavily concentrated in Abidjan, the capital. The bulk of the wealth resides in 1 or 2 spots in the country. So it\u2019s difficult to invest in that market.\n\nCameroon, for example, has a similar population size to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, but a different landscape. This is a market, for instance, where our top employers are government-owned enterprises. The top companies in Cameroon are either retail or FMCG companies in the beverage industry. Many of the companies in our economy are geared towards addressing our basic needs.\n\nIn general, however, you have to be careful about generalisation in francophone Africa. There are some common threads, but there are some differences among the countries. It\u2019s no surprise that Wave partly came out of Senegal. Senegal is in a league of its own; it\u2019s a more open country, with an enabling environment for young entrepreneurs. For instance, Senegal was one of the first countries in West and Central Africa to have internet connection\u2014I think back in 1995. It\u2019s also one of the closest African countries to the US and less than 400km away from Brazil.\n\nDA: You mentioned the top companies in Cameroon are in retail and FMCGs. What then are people building in tech?\n\nSN: In the last 5 years, from my perspective, I\u2019d say there have been 3 different startup waves in the market. First, startups were building classifieds, for instance online classifieds and e-commerce platforms, when Jumia launched in Cameroon everyone wanted to do eCommerce.\n\nNext, I saw people building more advanced products that use artificial intelligence. There were a lot of startups trying to facilitate real estate business. There was also a company that was trying to facilitate real time interaction.\n\n\n\nIn the last 2\u20133 years, it\u2019s been more of fintech. Fintech is growing. The good thing about fintech in francophone Africa is that the region is divided into 2 monetary zones. So, while Nigeria and Ghana have separate central banks, we have two central banks and almost the same currency for the 21 countries in francophone Africa.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re able to get authorisation from the central bank and you\u2019re a Cameroonian fintech, what you\u2019ve built for Cameroon is valid for Gabon, Central Africa Republic, Congo, and Equatorial Guinea.\n\nWe\u2019ve also made some progress in health tech. One of the potential success stories we\u2019ve seen is a healthtech company that started out as a platform that enables pregnant women to schedule their hospital visits and control their decision over the course of their pregnancy. Now it\u2019s going to become a fully-fledged tech company.\n\nIn the transportation sector, just like we saw in Nigeria, motorbikes play an important role and offer a big business opportunity. We\u2019ve seen a few players come into that space. Lately, we\u2019ve seen activity in the social impact space like recycling and reusing tires from the road side for other things.\n\nDA: How does the Cameroon Angel network operate now?\n\nSN: We give members the opportunity to come up with proposals and recommendations for a startup that they find fascinating. The member who comes up with the recommendation can get the startup to pitch to us separately during a single session or a pitch demo day.\n\nToday, because we\u2019re still developing the rules, that\u2019s still largely how we operate. The second approach we\u2019re looking at is partnership with local hubs. At the stage that we invest in, seed or pre-seed, we believe it\u2019s important to be very efficient, to have access to the right pipelines of startups. We also expect that these startups have the right background, passing through an incubation program. At the end of the year we want to ensure that 60\u201365% of our portfolio companies are from incubation programs.\n\nWe encourage startups to reach out despite our desire to work with innovation hubs. It helps us feel the pulse of the ecosystems and hear directly from startups.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your average ticket size?\n\nSN: We don\u2019t have a generally agreed ticket size, but usually I\u2019ve mostly seen investments of $1,500\u2013$4,000. We\u2019ve also seen investment go as high as $10,000 or $15,000. Our investment is often matched by Catalytic Africa, a programme by the African Business Angel Network (ABAN) with support from the French government agency. This helps increase the total amount we invest.\n\nEssentially, we work with ABAN to identify 1 or 2 startups that we can invest in, and they\u2019ll match the funding. It increases the size of our ticket and helps amplify the size. In addition to this, It often takes about 2\u20133 months to decide. It varies depending on the startup, sometimes we\u2019ve decided after a week or just a call.\n\nDA: What do you look out for in founders or startups before investing?\n\nSN: I\u2019d say all the investors look for the same thing in startups, they invest and want a return on their money. So we look at similar things like what\u2019s your product, addressable market, traction gained and competition. We also look at the composition of the team in terms of skills and experience. We consider the use of technology or the lack of technology, if you come up with an idea and its game changing, you have to prove that it works.\n\nThe third thing we focus on is progress made so far. There are a lot of startups that only run around, winning awards, but if you look at their track record, they\u2019re not making progress.\n\nDA: Hmm, $4,000 sounds small compared to the million people are raising, is this amount helpful to the startups?\n\nSN: Yes, it\u2019s very helpful to them. We come in at a stage where they\u2019ve just moved from an idea to having a little traction. If we bring in $4,000 and multiply it by 2 or 3 depending on Catalytic Africa\u2019s contribution, that\u2019s about $8,000\u2013$12,000. The amount is significant considering the scale at which the startup operates.\n\nOne more thing we do to ensure the money is helpful is we ask that the money needed be tied to specific projects or activities. We ask them what they need the money for, whether it\u2019s to hire a CFO or buy more tools, and how much it will cost. For example, one of the startups that Catalytic fund invested in alongside us wanted to acquire some motorbikes. This made it easy, as we knew where the money was going. We work with local law firms to do due diligence, some of our members have that background.\n\nDA: How much equity do you ask for in exchange for the amount invested?\n\nSN: There are usually two options: convertible debt or equity. The equity is usually between 0.5\u20133%, depending on the amount invested. Most times we use SAFEs, It\u2019s very rare that we\u2019ll invest in a priced round.\n\nDA: You earlier mentioned ABAN\u2019s catalytic fund support, in what other ways has ABAN supported CAN?\n\nSN: ABAN has been very helpful. An additional challenge investing in Equity/SAFE rounds raises is that we initially struggled a lot with contract law\u2014how to ensure that our investments were bounded by the law.\n\nFrancophone African countries have a common business law framework which doesn\u2019t refer to angel investors and it\u2019s very prescriptive, compared to the business law in most English speaking countries where players are free to create rules. In Francophone Africa if the law doesn\u2019t prescribe it\u2019s difficult to enact.\n\nThis is one area ABAN helped out, by translating these new forms of investing into contractual terms that are in line with our own legal framework. They also made them freely available to ease investments. They also helped in capacity building, by training members of our group on how to invest better.\n\nThe reality is that even me I got into angel investing out of interest. I love innovation, I used to work for Microsoft, I travelled to Seattle and Silicon valley but all of that didn\u2019t mean I understood how things worked.\n\nShare this article",
          "summary": "Members of the group started attending startup pitches and investing informally, learning the ropes of angel investing along the way.\nAfter much back and forth over the span of 2 years, the government officials finally accepted that Cameroon Angel Network (CAN) was not a church and, in 2020, their registration was finalised.\nSince then the Cameroon Angel Network has continued to invest in startups and attract new members, mostly entrepreneurs.\n\u201cWe have a few other people running their businesses or making a living from Cameroon,\u201d Nnmatak said, explaining the composition of the Cameroon Angel Network.\nDA: How does the Cameroon Angel network operate now?",

          "title": "Meet the Nigerian filmmaker who is taking African art to Hollywood",
          "text": "After months of struggling to sell his artworks, Okedoyin Oluwatosin, a Nigerian artist who displays his pieces at Jakande, a popular market in Lagos, wanted to quit making art. But then, ArtDey, an African online art marketplace, offered to help him sell them, for prices ranging from \u20a650,000 to \u20a6150,000. Okedoyin evolved his art while working with ArtDey, and today, some of his pieces are on display on the international online marketplace, Artsy, selling for as high as $3,000.\n\nArtDey\u2014co-founded in 2020 by Chioma Onyenwe, a 33-year-old filmmaker, and her siblings: Emeka Onyenwe and Adaobi Onyenwe\u2014is an online marketplace that connects contemporary African artists to a global audience. Onyenwe studied economics at the University of Lagos, before going on to the Imperial College in London for a master\u2019s in management. Before going into film full-time in 2013, she had worked in investment banking and consulting for firms such as Chapel Hills and Accenture, for a few years\n\nIn 2013, she got her first job in the film industry as a programme coordinator at the Africa International Film Festival (AFRIFF); she left the organisation last year after some time as its artistic director. In 2014, she benefited from Project Act Nollywood, a programme created by Nigeria\u2019s federal government to fund filmmakers for production and distribution and capacity building. With help from the programme, she produced her first short film 8 Bars and a Clef through her production company, Raconteur Productions, back in 2015. Since then, she has worked across different mediums\u2014theatre, podcasting, and documentary filmmaking.\n\nOnyenwe, who has been collecting African art since 2015, went to collect art in an art market in Kenya in March 2020 but found she could afford only 1 of the 2 paintings she liked. She decided she would return to the art market later for the second painting, but, during that weekend, Kenya recorded its first COVID cases and was set to close its airports. Onyenwe had to take the first flight on Monday back to Lagos. She never went back to the art market, and never got the piece, mostly because there wasn\u2019t a way to move the artworks across countries.\n\nFast forward to June, Onyenwe visited the art markets in places such as Jakande and Muri Okunola in Lagos, but they were empty, and the shops that opened did so on specific days. These markets were tourist attractions, but air travel restrictions, because of COVID, had shrunk their sale of art pieces.\n\nOnyenwe created ArtDey\u2019s website in June 2020 to supply art to collectors outside Nigeria. At the end of June that same year, the website went up. Apart from trying to help relieve the struggles of these artists, Onyenwe revealed that, at the time, she, too, was struggling as the pandemic had destroyed her plans for the year, and she needed to get something to work.\n\nArtDey set out to provide a platform for local and emerging African artists who are not digitally savvy enough to use the internet to connect to a global audience themselves.\n\nArtDey wants to supply art to people who want to buy art simply because they like the work\u2019s colours, or it fits their house curtains; they don\u2019t need to read deep meaning into these pieces. \u201cEverybody can own a piece of African original art.\u201d\n\nArtDey organises physical pop-ups\u2014and has done 8 of them\u2014to introduce art to people who wouldn\u2019t normally go into galleries, by going to public spaces, such as bars, and selling art pieces for prices ranging from \u20a630,000 to \u20a6200,000. This pricing, Onyenwe noted, was to help buyers make a decision on the go. The pop-ups have taken place in Abuja, Lagos, and Copenhagen.\n\nOnyenwe noted that the pop-ups and exhibitions were prompted by Nigerians\u2019 consumer behaviour which makes it difficult to sell art pieces that were sometimes above the country\u2019s minimum wage without a physical presence. Nigerians, she noticed, are not used to standard-sized measurements which are important to selecting art pieces\u2019 sizes. \u201cIf I tell a customer an art piece is 42 inches by 42 inches, for example, they wouldn\u2019t know what that looks like. They tend to ask to see if it can fit the space in their house.\u201d This is because their buyers are not your traditional collectors who probably have bigger houses and have experience in interacting with African art. So, the people we sell to tend to buy for functionality.\u201d\n\nInitially, ArtDey found it difficult to convince local artists that they weren\u2019t a swindler trying to rip them off by taking pictures of their art and replicating it. But the artists got convinced as soon as their pieces sold. ArtDey only picks up the art it displays from the artist online when it sells it. This gives the artists the opportunity to sell on their own. Today, these artists are leaving their pieces with ArtDey and even creating collections for ArtDey.\n\nOnyenwe noted that they have higher margins from the sales that come from the website compared to the pop-ups, even though they have sold more pieces from the pop-ups, exhibitions, and open houses.\n\nArtDey in Bel-Air\n\nFela by Chukwuemeka Image hanging in the background of a scene in the ongoing series, Bel-Air.\n\nIn the last quarter of 2020, ArtDey tried to target Nigerians and Africans in the diaspora, whom it suspected most likely felt an affinity to African art. It started cold emailing set designers and cinematographers, but despite interest, no production house took up their offer; lockdowns had not been completely lifted, so production had not properly opened up.\n\nNormally, filmmakers acquire a licence from artists to use a replica of their works on set, but Onyenwe wanted to get the original works to these filmmakers at a lower cost.\n\nMorgan Cooper, Bel-Air\u2019s director, expressed interest in ArtDey\u2019s artworks. So, Bel-Air, a re-imagination of the award-winning 1990s sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, bought over 10 art pieces belonging to artists on the streets of Lagos: such as Bright Osodalor, Abiola Daniel, and Bertha Onyekachi, from ArtDey.\n\nWhen ArtDey launched, it had 3 artists on board and sold 5 pieces in its first week. Today, it has been in operation for 20 months and has sold about 300 pieces.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service).

          "text": "Nigerians are once again in the dark after the national electricity grid suffered two major failures on Monday and Tuesday, cutting off the power supply to homes in the midst of scorching weather and a surge in fuel and diesel prices as a result of the Russian-Ukraine squabble.\n\nThis, in turn, is having a significant impact on businesses as it threatens their survival and has raised further concerns about the country\u2019s power sector\u2019s trajectory.\n\nNigeria has the capacity to generate 13,000 megawatts of power, compared to South Africa, which has a similar-sized economy and a quarter of the population.\n\nNigeria\u2019s aging grid provides only about 5,000MW of power to its 200 million citizens \u2014 roughly the same as the city of Edinburgh provides for its 500,000 residents.\n\nThe grid, managed by the government-owned Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), has continued to suffer system collapse over the years amid a lack of spinning reserve that is meant to forestall such occurrences.\n\nPower grid\n\nA power grid is a network of electrical transmission lines that connects several generating stations to loads spread across a large area.\n\nGenerator stations, transmission lines and towers, and individual consumer distribution lines comprise the power grid.\n\nIt is intended to operate within certain limits, known as stability limits, in accordance with voltage, current, and frequency.\n\nAs a result, whenever these limits are outside of the stability range, the grid\u2019s operation becomes unstable and may collapse.\n\nRead also: National grid collapses again\n\nConsequences of national grid collapse\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), the grid collapse is divided into two basically; which include the total grid collapse and the partial grid collapse.\n\nThe total system collapse according to NERC means a total blackout nationwide while the partial system collapse is a failure of the section of the grid.\n\nThe end product of both system failures is that it leads to erratic power supply. NERC says the power grid will remain vulnerable without adequate spinning reserves.\n\nWhat is a spinning reserve?\n\n\n\nA spinning reserve is the generation capacity that is online but unloaded and that can respond within 10 minutes to compensate for generation or transmission outages.\n\nPower stations that supply the grid ought to have a spinning reserve, when not available, collapse becomes certain. The grid also fails when there\u2019s also too much generation that it is incapable of wheeling it across the country.\n\nFrequent fluctuations and distortions are other technical issues that affect the integrity of the grid.\n\nNERC says that adequate technology and infrastructural investment including smart grids could make a difference.\n\nAccording to TCN data, the national grid has collapsed 108 times since the power sector was privatised.\n\nNigeria experienced 146 total national grid collapses and 73 partial collapses between the periods, since 2010.",

          "title": "From medical tourism to medical hubs",
          "text": "For the umpteenth time during his administration, President Muhammadu Buhari has travelled out of the country for medical reasons.\n\nAlthough, part of the rationale was for him to attend the 50th Anniversary of the United Nations Environmental Programme, which took place early this month in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. Since the period of stay for the medical check-up \u2013 two weeks, far outnumbering the two-day programme, then it is not out of place to contend that the real purpose of the overseas journey is for medical check-up.\n\nIt is instructive to appreciate here that, by the end of March 2022, President Buhari would have spent 215 days outside this country on medical tourism. After assuming office in 2015, President Buhari was in London for the first medical trip between February 5 and 10 in 2016. Between June 6 and 19, 2016, he was in London for the treatment of ear infection. He also had a 10-day vacation starting June 19, 2017, overseas.\n\nThe interesting thing in all of these is the likelihood that the Nigerian medical doctors who are denied the conducive environment and tools at home, are most likely the ones to treat the president in the United Kingdom.\n\nAccording to the reports from the International Centre for Investigative Journalism and The Punch, as of 2021, Nigerian medical personnel in the United Kingdom were well above 8,000. Particularly, between 2016 and 2018, Nigeria lost over 9,000 medical personnel to the United Kingdom, United States of America, Saudi Arabia, among others.\n\nThere are many favourable indicators that indicate that the government will record significant success in attracting private sector investments into the nation\u2019s healthcare sector provided there is the will to do so\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the problem with the Nigerian healthcare service delivery is not the absence of specialists, but adequately funding the healthcare sector for optimal service delivery, provision of tools and equipment, and remuneration that will make medical personnel have a sense of belonging to the country.\n\nMore importantly and in purely monetary terms, it is on record that Nigeria loses an average of $1 billion annually to medical tourism. With the scarcity of dollars pervasive, and the few available ones being rationed among government units and critical sectors, it is time for the Federal Government of Nigeria to come up with sector specific policy that will attract private sector investments into the country\u2019s healthcare sector.\n\nRead also: Exodus of Nigerian medical experts\n\nAvailable data suggest that Nigerians seek medical tourism in areas such as oncology, nephrology, cardiology, orthopaedics, among others. They continue to do so in places like: India, Malaysia, China, South Africa, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.\n\nOn the other hand, it is possible to put in place a home-grown solution that will stem the rather insidious tide of medical tourism, which constitutes a source of shame to this country. This solution involves the creation of healthcare hubs that can be strategically located across the country, for easy accessibility. There are many favourable indicators that indicate that the government will record significant success in attracting private sector investments into the nation\u2019s healthcare sector provided there is the will to do so.\n\nOne is the quality of manpower. Nigeria has abundant human capacity, which explains why even developed nations fall over themselves when recruiting Nigeria-trained medical personnel. The United Kingdom conducts recruitment regularly for doctors, nurses and other healthcare specialists.\n\nAnother factor is the increasing awareness about the dictum, health is wealth. An average Nigerian always wants to be hale and hearty. Consequently, families now have a budget for healthcare. Health Management Organisations (HMOs) across the country have maintained steady success in enlisting individuals into the formal healthcare service delivery.\n\nIn 2019, Nigerians spent N2.46 trillion on healthcare services, representing 14.12 percent of non-food expenditure, and 6.12 percent of the total consumption expenditure in the country as at that time.\n\nThe countries, which our political leaders visit regularly for medical tourism, did not rest on their oars. They continually innovate and improve the business environment for more private sector capital to come in. We must urgently do that for the sake of generations to come.\n\nFor almost a year that the global aviation industry was locked down due to COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Nigerian leaders were forced to use local healthcare outfits. Many people thought as a fallout from that, the federal and state governments would have taken that as a serious warning to improve the healthcare sector. Sadly enough, that was not to be. Immediately the restrictions were lifted, the nation has since gone back to default settings.\n\nThe lacklustre attitude with which Nigeria\u2019s healthcare service delivery is handled could make some government officials victims of their own negligence.\n\nCurrently, a wave of sanctions is being imposed on Russia, with no one certain about their impact across the globe. If the sanctions and counter-sanctions continue, the world might come to a standstill, and services such as medical tourism might be inaccessible to many. Therefore, it is high time Nigeria developed its own healthcare sector to meet global standards. The importance of our suggestion here cannot be over-emphasised.\n\nApart from the practical reasons for the need to develop our own healthcare system, the issue of national pride also comes into play. Thus, if the labours of our heroes and heroines are not to be in vain, as amply deposed in our national anthem, it is time for this country to rise up to the surmountable challenges of putting in place a viable healthcare system for the benefits of all Nigerian citizens.",

          "text": "As companies in Nigeria\u2019s fast-moving consumer goods (FCMG) sector are facing up to rising costs, experts have highlighted the need for operators to source inputs locally and redesign their product portfolios, among other measures, to reduce expenses.\n\nBusinessDay gathered that the continued rise in the production cost of manufacturing companies, especially those in the FMCG segment, was affecting profitability, product quality, and consumer demand.\n\nMost manufacturers have had to increase their retail prices while maintaining the same value or, in some cases, reducing the value of their products.\n\nAlfred Olajide, the managing director of Coca-Cola Nigeria Limited, while speaking at a virtual event on Thursday, lamented what he described as the \u201cexponential increase in costs and limited ability to pass it to consumers, who are also under pressure.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, this year alone, an average sugar cost has gone up by 20 percent, plastic resins have more than doubled in terms of prices, aluminium bodies, cane bodies are up by almost 100 percent. And this is in addition to all the challenges of poor infrastructure, supply chain disruptions and logistics,\u201d he said.\n\nNigerians saw the inflation rate jump to a record high of 18.17 percent in March last year as prices of goods rose amid the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA 70g of Superbite sausage roll, which was sold for N50, was reduced to 60g, but its price increased to N60; the price of a 5ocl Coca-Cola drink increased from N100 to N200, while the price of a loaf of bread increased from N250 to N500.\n\n\u201cLast month, I ordered pizza for my children at the usual price, but the pizza was smaller and it did not have the usual chicken or meat toppings, sources, and other things that make it attractive and appealing. I was disappointed because I did not get value for my money,\u201d a mother of two, who simply identified herself as Damilola, said.\n\nRead also: Nigerians feel pinch as soaring costs hit FMCG firms\n\nWithin a period of six years, the Nigerian economy slipped into a recession twice owing to the collapse of oil prices, the latest was induced by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, weakening consumers\u2019 purchasing power, causing job losses, and throwing millions into poverty.\n\nThe Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, in its MAN CEOs Confidence Index, said manufacturers\u2019 production and distribution costs increased by 21 percent in the second quarter of 2021, adding that the hike in production costs caused a 29 percent decline in the volume of production.\n\nA BusinessDay analysis of the financial statements of six FMCGs, namely Nestle Nigeria Plc, Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc, Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc, Honeywell Flour Mills Plc, Northern Nigeria Flour Mills Plc, and NASC Allied Industries showed that their combined cost of sales rose by 44 percent for the nine months the period ended September 2021 to N1.17 trillion from N820 billion in the same period of 2020.\n\nThe cost increased by 82 percent when compared with the N648 billion spent in the same period of 2019, which was before the pandemic.\n\nIn 2021, the firms reported a combined profit after tax of N68 billion, which was a 10 percent decline from the N76 billion achieved in 2020.\n\nCadbury Nigeria Plc, Unilever Nigeria Plc, and Nigerian Breweries Plc, recorded a collective production cost of N363 billion for full-year 2021, a 22 percent increase from the N297 billion expended in 2020, and a 30 percent increase from N278 billion in 2019.\n\nBefore the pandemic, high inflationary pressures, low incomes, and weak purchasing power prompted some companies to repack their products into smaller sachets at affordable prices.\n\nPascal Odibo, group country director at Jeff & O\u2019Brien Knowledge, Africa, highlighted the need for FMCG companies to find innovative ways to attract more customers.\n\nHe said, \u201cFor example, taking the products to the customer directly, cutting off middlemen, which sometimes represent a cut in the income of large institutions, or develop new products that will serve the need of their present challenges.\n\n\u201cWhat happens most times is that those people that are supposed to think out new and strategic ways of improving the business don\u2019t enter the mode of superior thinking but cost-cutting.\u201d\n\nUchenna Uzo, faculty director at Lagos Business School, said, \u201cIf prices need to go up and organisations are not matching the prices with an increase in value, at the end, it will be a ticking clock for them.\n\n\u201cWhat that means is that sooner or later, they will notice that people are shifting to other brands that are nurturing their value needs.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, FMCG companies can either offer the small value in smaller quantities or offer the same value but add freebies.\n\n\u201cThis will make customers appreciate that you have taken a step forward to show that you care for them. Also, how the price increase is communicated is also\n\nimportant. There are different ways you can communicate an increase that will not make people feel that it is an increase at the end of the day,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Jide Babatope, a Lagos-based analyst, one way FMCG companies can cut the rising costs is to intensify efforts on local input sourcing, which seems to be more cost-effective than importing raw materials.\n\nHe said, \u201cFMCGs product portfolios are elastic in nature, meaning the kinds of products they manufacture have many substitutes; hence, these companies can redesign their product portfolios into cheaper and more affordable brands while being intentional about quality.\n\n\u201cBig FMCG players can afford to raise the prices of their products while still maintaining market share because of their brand reputation and a sizeable chunk of their customer base are value brands, but smaller businesses are more disadvantaged.\u201d\n\nIbrahim Tajudeen, head of research at Chapel Hill Denham, stressed the need for FMCG companies to maintain quality and ensure that consumers get good value for money.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, they will run to alternatives. Consumer taste is very important in my view. But in trying to cater to consumer taste, manufacturers should come up with strategies that will make sure that people are able to get something for the size of their pocket.\u201d\n\nAyorinde Akinloye, an analyst at United Capital Plc, said most FMCG companies were stuck between maintaining product quality and increasing the prices of their products.\n\nHe said, \u201cAt the moment, they are doing the best possible they can in terms of bringing the balance between quality and cost.\n\n\u201cSo, the only thing they need to improve on is to see how they can manage the number of materials they can put in these products so that they can still improve the quality or they increase the quality of the products and let their margins suffer a bit.\u201d",

Aviation is life and there is no way the Senate and government generally, will allow such to happen.\n\n\u201cYour complaints are genuine and will surely be looked into. The senate would intervene to ensure that the airline operators carry out their activities with minimal pains.\n\n\u201cThe senate president and all senators are very worried by the threat from the operators and the Senate would not keep quiet over the matter.\n\n\u201cWe would ensure that the executive do the needful to release bail out to the airline operators it pays all of us to make the aviation fuel very robust.\n\n\u201cPlease give us some time for the Senate to see what we can achieve. So we want you to extend your ultimatum to down tool. We would ensure that you get the required palliative so that there won\u2019t be crisis,\u201d he pleaded.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlso at the meeting were representative of the director general of Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority ( NCAA), Captain Chris Najomo and secretary, Airline Operators, Mr Zamani Solomon.",

This is not to absolve developing economies of the responsibility for their energy transition, but to ensure that the global drive is just and equitable,\u201d she stated.\n\nGray noted that energy companies were coming into a greater consciousness of their role in the energy transition journey and were taking active steps to match their words with action.\n\nAccording to her, Sahara Group\u2019s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) had led to the development of the \u201cextrapreneurship\u201d concept, which refers to the group\u2019s unique strategy for creating enabling environments for entrepreneurs.\n\nShe said the \u201cextrapreneurship\u201d model is propagated through projects centered on two key impact areas of energy and the environment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThese projects, according to Gray, seek to drive awareness and affirmative action in support of resource efficiency, sustainability, and economic development through socially and environmentally sustainable ventures.\n\nWith vast operations across and beyond Africa, she explained that the path towards energy transition impacts every sector of Sahara\u2019s operations, adding that gas had been recognized as a transition fuel in the global energy transition journey.\n\nGray stated, \u201cSahara Group continues to invest in infrastructure and technology that will enhance access to gas as an option of clean fuel across Africa. Our Liquefied Petroleum Gas vessels are transforming the LPG market, facilitating seamless supply, while our existing and targeted infrastructure will drive efficient storage and distribution of LPG across markets.\u201d\n\n\u201cSahara Group is also taking a foremost position in advocacy, development of a gas utilization strategy to be balanced with investments in renewable energy projects and carbon storage projects.

I am the only one in the race and most competent and most qualified to be your president come year 2023.\n\n\u2018I am the only one who has been through the tutelage. I am the only one among them who has been consistent in one party. They are not stable,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he started his political career as a senator, adding; \u201cI am very proud of myself as a democrat because the essence of democracy is the assemblage of wise and prudent people.\u2019\n\nTinubu commended members of the National Assembly for their commitment, adding that the legislators represented the crux of the people while commending them for doing well by advancing democracy.\n\nHe said he was at the assembly to request the support of the lawmakers.\n\n\u201d This is my lifelong ambition, which I discussed with President Muhammadu Buhari . I told the President that I want to step in his shoes and not step on his toes.\u201d\n\nTinubu said the President responded, thus; \u201ccome out, let\u2019s see you and how you can promote your democratic credential,\u201d adding that he has multiple honours, a first-class degree in accounting.\n\nAccording to him, I am not here to be defensive; I am here with humility that I am one of the best products that you can sell as a presidential candidate.\n\nSpeaking on his rumoured ill health, Tinubu said: \u201cThey don\u2019t have anything to say; they say I am not well, they are not my doctor. I am only here to do a great job, break the shackle of poverty.\n\nHe queried why Nigeria would not be competing with Russia with all the resources at its disposal, saying; \u201cwe have God-given resources, capacity, knowledge, and the brain.\n\n\u201cWe can do it. You can make me succeed with your support. I want us to forge a future for this country, we are the most populous, and we have the best brain and resources.\n\nFemi Gbajabiamila, Speaker of the house, said that Tinubu was the man, who put APC together and had declared his intention to preside over the affairs of the country.\n\nHe said that as the election was approaching, it was imperative to hear the message from those who wanted to govern the country, saying, \u201cwe have been hearing how many people are running for the presidency of Nigeria in 2023\u201d.\n\nThe speaker, however, said that it would not speak well of the country when it boasted to be the largest in Africa and seven weeks before the primaries, only one person had been seen, one person running up and down consulting.\n\n(Watch the video:\n\n[/video\n\nHe said that Tinubu had been traveling the length and breadth of Nigeria, marketing his trade and delivering his message.\n\n\u201cI feel it\u2019s wrong for a country like Nigeria that we are only hearing names but nobody is campaigning, It is unfair to every citizen of Nigeria. We cannot take Nigeria for granted,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, leader of the party, however, urged members to support the candidacy of Tinubu, adding that he had done a lot in contributing to Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nHe said that his emergence would bring about a truly democratic leader that would pilot the affairs of the country.\n\nDoguwa, however, put the aspiration of Tinubu into a voice vote where members unanimously gave an overwhelming endorsement to his bid to become the president in 2023. Shouts of Jagaban hit fever pitch in the hall.\n\nAt the meeting with the APC Senate Caucus at the Senate President\u2019s Conference Room, Tinubu reiterated his message.\n\nHe said he was at the Senate for counsel, partnership and support.\n\n\u201cNigerians have come to that stage where we need a change of baton. President Muhammadu Buhari is about to serve his second term in full.\n\n\u201cElection is coming up in February. I can\u2019t do it by myself and I can\u2019t do it by sitting at home expecting that many friends I have here will do it for me.\n\n\u201cI believe jointly we can do it. You can back me successfully for the nomination of my lifetime ambition to become the president.\n\n\u201cMy ambition is not blind to the extent I will step on the toes of the President. I just want to step into his shoe and not on his toe,\u201d Tinubu said.\n\nHe said that if the counsel of wise men was anything to go by, \u201cI\u2019m asking for that teamsmanship here today to get me over the hump of the nomination process.\n\n\u201cAnd from that hump, to get me to the presidency of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cLook at my capacity. I am an unusual candidate. Perhaps the only one who had been in the Senate, who had been a governor and aspiring to become president\u201d.\n\nHe said that Nigeria will remain united if he was elected president and \u201cwe will use that unity, the symbol of our party to cleanse Nigeria of unrealisable potential.\u201d\n\nThe national leader also commended the Senate for the passage of the Constitution Alteration Bill.\n\n\u201cI Thank you for sustaining our democracy. I ran into a little ambush of women protesters because I went to the other gate.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, you have been very careful on affirmative action, and you are been very careful not to jeopardise the Constitution.\n\n\u201cYes the interests of women are necessary but for APC, we are doing our best and we will continue to do our best to accommodate the interest of our women,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident of the Senate Ahmad Lawan said that the APC Senate Caucus was a fundamental pillar of the party.\n\n\u201cThis caucus has remained committed to the party, shown resolve to our manifesto to work within us and the Executive. We have achieved so much because of the APC caucus.\n\n\u201cFrom 2019 that this caucus showed loyalty, commitment, and purposeful orientation to ensure that our victory from 2015 and 2019 as a political party is fully utilised for the benefits of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThis party needs the kind of commitment that APC members have shown in the country.APC must continue to be progressive in our actions. 2023 is going to be a year for APC again.\n\n\u201cBy Feb. 25 when the Presidential Election will take place, by the grace of God, APC will have the victory that is required,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nLawan added:\u201dRecently we had some difficulties because of misunderstanding between some of our members and the party was thrown into temporary confusion.\n\n\u201cI thank God it is over now. It is very clear that our party is back on track, that in the next two weeks, our national convention will hold and a new set of leaders will emerge.\u201d",

As a result of this, the party faces the possibility and prospect of the invalidation of all its activities and actions by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC),\u201d the letter reads.\n\n\u201cThe party has demonstrated its inability to proceed with the issue of effecting change in the leadership of its Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee (CECC), in a way that is inclusive, legal and respectful of the time limit set and required for giving the INEC Sufficient notice of the time and venue for holding its convention.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, these controversies and uncertainties, as enumerated above, pose a real threat to the party; and may lead to a possible nonrecognition of its activities, elections and the probable invalidation of all its other actions by INEC. This may ultimately even lead [to] its implosion and non-existence.\n\n\u201cFirst, the issue of the leadership of the Caretaker Extra Ordinary Convention Committee (CECC), should immediately return to status quo ante.\n\n\u201cSecond, all members of the governors\u2019 forum and their followers should desist from any behaviour or utterance that will likely lead to disunity in the ranks of the party, and ultimately jeopardise the transition to the convention.\n\n\u201cThird, the Mai Mala Buni-led CECC should, accordingly, be allowed to proceed with all necessary preparations to hold the convention as planned-unfailingly, on 26th March, 2022.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday apologised to Nigerians for the inconvenience caused by the prolonged shortage of petroleum products.\n\nIn a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, he said his administration had successfully averted such a problem in its seven years in office.\n\n\u201cThe administration knows the fuel shortage has placed a strain on Nigerian citizens and businesses, but relief is on the way. I specially apologise to all sections of the society for this,\u201d said the President.\n\n\u201cThe government is working round the clock to attend to this issue. An action plan agreed earlier this month is being implemented to address the scarcity. Working together with the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) and the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), this plan is now bearing fruit.\n\n\u201cSufficient fuel supply has returned to a handful of states, with the queues at stations falling. In the coming days, we expect this to be the case across the rest of the country. Looking to the longer term, funds are being targeted toward keeping fuel availability affordable for the country.\n\n\u201cThe international energy markets have surged drastically in recent months, the government will however ensure that consumers are protected against these price spikes.\u201d\n\nThe President revealed that he has received information that some people were not behaving properly at the depots, and among owners of petrol stations.\n\nIn this regard, he directed the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), and the entire security apparatus of the nation to take strong action against those responsible.\n\nImproved Power\n\nPresident Buhari also spoke about the issue of power outages witnessed recently in various parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThe blackouts seen in the national grid are also being addressed,\u201d he assured Nigerians. \u201cA dip in hydroelectric generation due to seasonal pressures has coincided with technical and supply problems at thermal stations.\n\n\u201cOn this, the government is also working tirelessly to resolve the issues at the latter to guarantee sufficient power flows into the national grid.\u201d\n\nAs part of emergency measures put in place following a meeting convened with key stakeholders to address the low power generation in the country, the President said the main challenge was identified as being one of low gas power generation, as a result of sabotage of gas pipelines leading to the shutdown of power plants coupled with routine maintenance on other gas power plants.\n\nTo recover over 1000MW, he said actions were agreed upon between the players in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) and NNPC.\n\nAccording to President Buhari, the actions targeted the National Integrated Power Project (NIPP) plants, Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), and power plants run under NNPC Joint Ventures, Agip and Shell (NAOC and SPDC).\n\nHe explained that progress on the key actions has already ensured the restoration of 375MW to the grid after the pipeline from \u201cOkpai 1\u201d was repaired.\n\nTo also ramp up the underutilised capacity of the NDPHC capacity, he said a $50 million gas supply agreement was being finalised to secure the sustainability of up to 800MW of underutilised NIPP assets.\n\nThe President assured Nigerians that the government\u2019s attention to these problems would bear fruits very soon.",

If there are any issues, we have different organs of the party to resolve party differences \u2026 because such distraction must not be allowed to continue.\u201d\n\nAyu\u2019s plea to the party faithful comes against the backdrop of the rift between Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State and Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State.\n\nGovernor Obaseki recently took a swipe at Governor Wike over his reaction to comments by Edo State Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, that PDP members who defected from the APC in Edo were not happy and do not feel accepted into the new party.\n\nHe had also said Nigeria needed strong democratic institutions and not strong men, stressing the need for the PDP to position itself to reclaim power at the centre in 2023.\n\nRestore Nigeria\u2019s Glory\n\nGovernor Wike, in his reaction, described the comments by his Edo counterpart as a rant, saying governance was about feeling and touching, and not a memorandum of understanding.\n\nHe also described Governor Obaseki as a \u2018serial betrayer\u2019 and apologised to a former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, whom he said had initially warned the PDP against accepting his Edo counterpart into its fold.\n\nFor the PDP chairman, it is important for party leaders and members to settle their differences using in-house mechanisms and to position the party in a position to reclaim power at the centre in 2023.\n\n\u201cThe (National Working Committee) NWC under my leadership is calling on all our leaders and members of the party, not just in Ekiti and Osun States, but all over the country to join us in fighting for those elections because they are winnable if we put aside our differences and make sure we work as a team,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is very important that we unify the party. By unifying the party, we will win elections in the state chapters. By winning elections in the state chapters, collectively we will be able to put those votes together and we will definitely win the next presidential election.\n\n\u201cNigerians believe that only this party will come to power and restore the glory of Nigeria and it is on this note that I am calling on every single member of the PDP family to put their differences aside. We are not out to fight against ourselves; our goal is to unite the party, go out as we used to do, win elections as we used to do.\u201d",

          "text": "Kogi state government has berated a former Director-General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, Salihu Moh. Lukman, over his outbursts against the state governor and the Governor Mai Mala Buni APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\nMr Lukman had accused the party leadership of extorting aspirants ahead of the March 26 National Convention and also asked that Bello be prevented from getting the presidential ticket of the party.\n\nThe former PGF DG also alleged that Bello had yet to commence payment of N30,000 minimum wage as announced and that workers were earning 25 per cent of their salaries.\n\nBut reacting in a statement issued on Tuesday and signed by the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Kingsley Fanwo, the state government said Lukman\u2019s allegations were baseless, adding that he should not \u201callow the frustration of his unceremonious and embarrassing exit as the Director-General of PGF take possession of his reasoning to the extent of disparaging party leaders.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress in Kogi State, Comrade Onu Edoka, has confirmed that the state government has embarked on the payment of N30,000 minimum wage to workers in the state, saying the Governor Yahaya Bello administration has not been owing salaries or paying 25 per cent of salaries, contrary to Lukman and other naysayers\u2019 claims.\n\nRead full statement below:\n\nBello: Your unceremonious exit as PGF DG has affected your reasoning, Kogi lambasts Lukman\n\n\u2026 as NLC debunks ousted PGF DG\u2019s claims\n\nKOGI State Government has tongue-lashed a former Director-General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, Salihu Moh. Lukman, over his outbursts against the state governor and the Governor Mai Mala Buni APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\nLukman had accused the party leadership of extorting aspirants ahead of the March 26 National Convention and also asked that Bello be prevented from getting the presidential ticket of the party. The former PGF DG also alleged that Bello had yet to commence payment of N30,000 minimum wage as announced and that workers were earning 25 per cent of their salaries.\n\nReacting in a statement issued on Tuesday and signed by the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Kingsley Fanwo, the state government said Lukman\u2019s allegations were baseless, adding that he should not \u201callow the frustration of his unceremonious and embarrassing exit as the Director-General of PGF take possession of his reasoning to the extent of disparaging party leaders.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress in Kogi State, Comrade Onu Edoka, has confirmed that the state government has embarked on the payment of N30,000 minimum wage to workers in the state, saying the Governor Yahaya Bello administration has not been owing salaries or paying 25 per cent of salaries, contrary to Lukman and other naysayers\u2019 claims.\n\nEdoka, in an interview with the media on Tuesday, said the minimum wage was only approved for the state\u2019s civil servants on level 1 to 6, adding that \u201cit is not true that workers earn 25 per cent of their salaries.\u201d\n\nFanwo, in his statement, said, \u201cThe attention of the Kogi State Government has been drawn to the disparaging statements credited to a former employee of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Salihu Moh. Lukman concerning the popular presidential ambition of Governor Yahaya Bello.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that Lukman could allow the frustration of his unceremonious and embarrassing exit as the Director-General of PGF take possession of his reasoning to the extent of accusing His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni\u2019s APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of extorting aspirants ahead of the March 26 National Convention.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more saddening that Lukman decided to expose his main fear when he unwittingly revealed that the candidate to beat in the 2023 APC primary was my principal, His Excellency, Alhaji Yahaya Bello. To the amateur politician, the unfounded allegations against the administration of Governor Yahaya Bello should sway the minds of Nigerians or party leaders.\n\n\u201cBut asking the party to prevent Yahaya Bello, a leading presidential hopeful, from getting the party\u2019s ticket, already stamps the fact that all eyes are on him to take the party to victory in the 2023 General elections, which everyone knows will be keenly contested.\n\n\u201cFor the records, Lukman\u2019s anti-party escapades while at the secretariat of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum did not only cost him his job, but also cast more ridicule on his already battered image.\n\n\u201cWe are, therefore, not surprised at his recent disgraceful outburst against key party leaders. He has proved himself to be a mole in APC with a mission to undermine it and ultimately hand advantage to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe, however, want to assure him that no one has the monopoly of caustic statements. Governor Yahaya Bello has only refrained from dignifying detractors with response, venom for venom, because of his sound upbringing. But if Lukman should allow frustration to take a total grip of his senses, then, he should be ready to face the consequences of his actions as we will not leave any stone unturned to seek redress legally. We will not watch him continue to rubbish the image of our dear party in the manner he has been doing.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Governor Yahaya Bello remains a key figure holding the party together and he has the support and endorsement of overwhelming majority of party faithful to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. Lukman should wake up to the fact that his campaign of calumny will not wane the love APC and Nigerians have for Governor Bello.\n\n\u201cWe find it needful to inform the public that the historic and audacious staff verification exercise undertaken by the Yahaya Bello Administration at inception did not only paint the payroll in the colours of integrity and transparency, but also ensured efficiency in the service.\n\n\u201cMany unintended beneficiaries were removed and the State immediately ensured that 100% salaries were paid to the civil servants.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to note that the staff verification exercise was carried out with the full cooperation and deep involvement of labour unions who have always cooperated with the state government in its bid to reposition and strengthen the service.\n\n\u201cNigerians are adequately informed of the meagre allocation shared during the last FAAC meeting. Many states have yet to pay their February salary.\n\n\u201cInternally generated revenue wasn\u2019t at the standard our administration had set as a result of economic downturn, owing to the energy crisis that hit the nation in February.\n\nBut as an administration that is committed to the welfare of the civil servants, the Kogi State Government sat with labour leaders and agreed to pay 75%.\n\n\u201cIt has since been paid with the full implementation of the minimum wage. This is against the lies peddled by Lukman that Kogi workers received 25 percentage of their old salaries.\n\n\u201cOnly civil servants on grade level 7 and above received 75%. Civil servants on Grade Level 1 to 6 received 100% salary with the 30,000 minimum wage. The Governor and all political office holders also received 75% in solidarity with our workforce. To us, this is responsible and responsive leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to reiterate the commitment of the administration of Governor Yahaya Bello\u2019s administration towards the welfare of the workforce and that no amount of lies sponsored by Lukman will prevent Governor Bello from answering the popular call by the Nigerian masses to serve the nation in the presidential capacity,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appealed to Congress for help directly Wednesday, telling US lawmakers \u201cwe need you right now\u201d as he invoked tragedies in American history like the attack on Pearl Harbor and the September 11 terrorist attack.\n\nZelensky addressed President Joe Biden directly in the historic speech, \u201cYou are the leader of your grand nation. I wish you to be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace,\u201d he said at the conclusion of his remarks, which were met with a standing ovation from lawmakers.\n\nThe speech, which was given as a virtual address, came as the United States is under pressure from Ukraine to supply more military assistance to the embattled country as it fights back against Russia\u2019s deadly attack.\n\n\u201cFriends, Americans, in your great history, you have pages that would allow you to understand Ukrainians, understand us now, when we need you right now,\u201d he said through a translator at the start of his speech, though at the end of his remarks, he spoke in English.\n\n\u201cRemember Pearl Harbor, terrible morning of December 7, 1941, when your sky was black from the planes attacking you,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cJust remember it, remember, September the 11th, a terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn US cities into battlefields, when innocent people were attacked from air, just like nobody else expected it and you could not stop it. Our country experiences the same, every day, right now at this moment.\u201d\n\nWhile there is widespread bipartisan support for aid to Ukraine, many US lawmakers also believe the US should be careful not to be drawn into any kind of direct, armed conflict with Russia.\n\nDuring the speech, Zelensky reiterated calls for the US to help enforce a no-fly zone in Ukraine \u2014 to protect civilians \u2014 and provide fighter aircraft that the Ukrainians can use to defend themselves, requests that have so far been met with resistance.\n\n\u201cRussia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people,\u201d Zelensky said as he described the use of missiles, bombs and drones by Russian troops to inflict brutal and deadly attacks on his country. \u201cWe are asking for a reply to this terror from the whole world.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people, is this too much to ask?\u201d he said. Zelensky went on to say, \u201cYou know how much depends on the battlefield, on the ability to use aircraft, powerful strong aviation to protect our people, our freedom, our land, aircraft that can help Ukraine, help Europe. You know they exist and you have them, but they are on Earth not in the Ukrainian sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need to protect our sky,\u201d he said.\n\nBut these two controversial options divide lawmakers, with Republicans more hawkish about giving Ukraine jets, but some Democrats \u2014 and the White House \u2014 concerned Russia could consider such a move an escalation and potentially draw America into war.\n\nLawmakers of both parties say they are wary of a no-fly zone at this time because they think it could pit the US directly against Russia in the skies over Ukraine.\n\nPresident Joe Biden plans to detail US assistance to Ukraine in a speech of his own later in the day Wednesday.\n\nThe US and its allies have taken a wide range of actions in recent weeks intended to punish Moscow for its invasion, including the rollout of harsh sanctions and export controls and a $350 million security assistance package. In addition, Congress recently passed a $13.6 billion emergency package to supply defensive, humanitarian and economic aid to Ukraine, and the Biden administration announced a $200 million assistance package this past weekend.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced the virtual address in a letter to lawmakers earlier this week. The speech was broadcast live and livestreamed.\n\n\u201cI hope he will acknowledge what we have done, but then call upon us to do that which he thinks is necessary to ultimately have the Ukrainians prevail,\u201d Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, told reporters ahead of the speech when asked what he expected from the virtual address.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the President of his country, he\u2019s going to make the maximalist ask on behalf of his people, that\u2019s to be understood, but that always has to be reconciled with what\u2019s in the national interest and security of the United States,\u201d Menendez said when asked about requests from Zelensky such as a no-fly zone.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s important for Ukraine to prevail in the national interest of the United States, I just don\u2019t think a no-fly zone or direct confrontation is what\u2019s necessary to do that,\u201d Menendez said.\n\nThere is a push by some lawmakers in Congress to add provisions for providing Ukraine with fighter jets to legislation targeting Russia\u2019s energy imports and trade status, but it is not yet clear what the fate of that effort will be.\n\nSenate Republican Whip John Thune of South Dakota said Monday that there is broad bipartisan support for legislation that targets Russia\u2019s energy imports and trade status to punish the country for invading Ukraine. But, he said, members might want to add other provisions, such as approving the deployment of fighter jets to Ukraine from NATO countries, like Poland, a dynamic that could complicate quick passage of the legislation.\n\nThe Biden administration recently rejected a proposal from Poland to transfer fighter jets to Ukraine through the United States, arguing it risked an escalation as the US and NATO seek to avoid an outright conflict between the alliance and Russia.\n\n\u201cI know the administration has its position on that, but there would be a lot of bipartisan support for jets,\u201d Thune told reporters in the Capitol.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to hear from Zelensky again tomorrow and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll make an ask to ratchet up the level of assistance we\u2019re providing, to include the MiGs,\u201d Thune said on Tuesday, a reference to MiG fighter jets. \u201cIt should be an all-hands-on-the-deck effort to give them everything they need to fight their own battles. There are things I think they haven\u2019t received yet that they could that would help, lethal aid that would help them at least try and further fight and block the Russians from gaining access to a lot of their major cities,\u201d he said.\n\nRussia bombs residential area of Kharkiv and intensifies Kyiv assault as talks with Ukraine end\n\n\u201cThe speech tomorrow should continue to elevate the issue in a way that I think will bring additional pressure on not only the administration, but both political parties in Congress to do everything possible to help the Ukrainians,\u201d Thune added.\n\nBut White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Tuesday that, despite requests from Zelensky, the White House does not support instituting a no-fly zone over Ukraine or supplying the Ukrainian Air Force with new fighter aircraft.\n\n\u201cI would note that [the Pentagon] said that adding aircrafts to the Ukrainian inventory is not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Air Force, relative to Russian capabilities,\u201d Psaki said during Tuesday\u2019s news briefing. \u201cAnd the assessment was that the transfer of these planes may be mistaken as escalatory, as we said, and could result in a significant Russian reaction, but that is the risk assessment that was done. That risk assessment hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d\n\nOn a no-fly zone, Psaki said Biden \u201chas to look at decisions that are made through the prism of what is in our national security interests and global security interests, and he continues to believe that a no-fly zone would be escalatory, could prompt a war with Russia.\u201d\n\nCNN",
          "summary": "Zelensky addressed President Joe Biden directly in the historic speech, \u201cYou are the leader of your grand nation.\n\u201cRemember Pearl Harbor, terrible morning of December 7, 1941, when your sky was black from the planes attacking you,\u201d Zelensky said.\n\u201cWe are asking for a reply to this terror from the whole world.\u201d\u201cTo create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people, is this too much to ask?\u201d he said.\nZelensky went on to say, \u201cYou know how much depends on the battlefield, on the ability to use aircraft, powerful strong aviation to protect our people, our freedom, our land, aircraft that can help Ukraine, help Europe.\nThat risk assessment hasn\u2019t changed.\u201dOn a no-fly zone, Psaki said Biden \u201chas to look at decisions that are made through the prism of what is in our national security interests and global security interests, and he continues to believe that a no-fly zone would be escalatory, could prompt a war with Russia.\u201dCNN",

          "text": "162 Nigerian migrants returned safely from Libya on the fourth charter flight for this year organised by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).\n\nIn 2022, more than 500 stranded Nigerian migrants have returned to Nigeria with support from the European Union (EU) through its Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted migrant workers like Yousef Al Hadji who migrated from Nigeria to Libya in 2016. When his work hours as a gas attendant decreased dramatically, Yousef began working as a cleaner at a garbage facility to continue sending money home to his family in Nigeria.\n\nMany other migrants were stranded in Libya due to COVID-19 and the challenging security situation in the country.\n\nOnce voluntary humanitarian return flights from Libya resumed in October 2021 after months of suspension due to border closures and restrictions, Yousef immediately elected to return to his country of origin.\n\n\u201cIt has been six years since I first came to Libya, and I haven\u2019t seen my big family,\u201d he said when he visited an IOM facility for a medical assessment prior to his travel.\n\nWhile it was difficult to be away for so long, he now looked forward to reuniting with his family in Nigeria. Today\u2019s humanitarian flight departed from the capital of Libya, Tripoli, at noon and landed safely at Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos at 6pm. Out of the 162 migrants, 110 are men and 52 were women including 14 individuals under the age of 18 and 11 infants.\n\n\u201cThese migrants have been waiting patiently for months to get a flight back home and allow them to reunite with their families and friends\u201d, said Stephen Rogers, IOM Nigeria Head of Sub-office in Lagos. \u201cIOM\u2019s role is not over yet. We need to ensure their needs are accommodated under the best conditions and initiate their reintegration support back in the communities of origin.\u201d\n\nPrior to departure, the returnees underwent health checks and got tested for COVID-19 and received hygiene kits containing face masks and other protective gear. IOM also provided them with pre-departure counselling services, protection screening and transportation assistance. IOM also offers targeted assistance to migrants with specific situations of vulnerability such as pregnant women, unaccompanied migrant children, victims of trafficking and migrants with medical conditions.\n\nUpon arrival, the returnees are given food, refreshments and a mobile device to assist them with contacting their families and to remain in touch with IOM as they receive reintegration support. Vulnerable cases are provided with non-food items such as clothes, shoes and other essential items. Returnees undergo a mandatory seven-day quarantine period for unvaccinated beneficiaries and undergo on the second day another PCR test for COVID-19. Returnees subsequently receive financial support for transportation to their communities of origin. IOM will provide mental health and psychosocial support and business skills training to help them to kickstart income-generating activities as part of their reintegration assistance.\n\n\u201cThe EU-IOM Joint Initiative has been instrumental in safely returning and reintegrating Nigerian nationals since April 2017 and we are happy to know that operations have resumed. We are welcoming the flight from Tripoli and we aim at successful reintegration for all returnees,\u201d said Samuela Isopi Ambassador of the European Union to Nigeria and ECOWAS Nigeria & ECOWAS.\n\nLibya has long been an important transit and destination country for migrants arriving from different parts of Africa. IOM\u2019s latest DTM report indicates that Nigerian migrants make up 6 per cent of migrants in Libya, the country\u2019s fifth largest migrant population. According to IOM data, Libya followed by Niger and Mali are the primary transit countries for Nigerian migrants.\n\nIOM works closely with the Federal Government of Nigeria and specifically with the National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and IDPs (NCFRMI), National Immigration Service (NIS), National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to facilitate the humane, orderly and dignified movement of returning migrants.\n\nThis is the 94th chartered flight from various locations since April 2017 when the Joint Initiative commenced. Between April 2017 and February 2022, 19,452 stranded Nigerians have been assisted to return voluntarily from 22 countries in Europe, the Middle East and other parts of the world with support from the European Union.",
