          "text": "A United States medical team said on Thursday that they had reconstructed a human ear using the patient\u2019s own tissue to create a 3D bioimplant, a pioneering procedure they hope can be used to treat people with a rare birth defect.\n\nThe surgery was performed as part of an early-stage clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the implant for people with microtia, in which the external ear is small and not formed properly.\n\nAuriNovo, as the implant is called, was developed by the company 3DBio Therapeutics while the surgery was led by Arturo Bonilla, founder and director of the Microtia-Congenital Ear Deformity Institute in San Antonio, Texas.\n\n\u201cAs a physician who has treated thousands of children with microtia from across the country and around the world, I am inspired by what this technology may mean for microtia patients and their families,\u201d Bonilla said in a statement.\n\nHe said he hoped the implant would one day replace the current treatment for microtia, which involves either grafting cartilage from a patient\u2019s ribs or using synthetic materials, porous polyethylene (PPE), to reconstruct outer ears.\n\nThe procedure involves 3D scanning the patient\u2019s opposite ear to create a blueprint, then collecting a sample of their ear cartilage cells and growing them to a sufficient quantity.\n\nThese are then used to create a 3D-bioprinted, full-sized outer ear.\n\nThe clinical trial expects to enroll 11 patients and is being conducted in California.\n\nBonilla said: \u201cThe AuriNovo implant requires a less invasive surgical procedure than the use of rib cartilage for reconstruction. We also expect it to result in a more flexible ear than reconstruction with a PPE implant.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, microtia occurs in about 1 of every 2,000-10,000 babies. Factors that can increase risk include diabetic mothers and a maternal diet that is lower in carbohydrates and folic acid.\n\nAbsent other conditions, children with microtia can develop normally and lead healthy lives \u2013 though they may have self-esteem issues.\n\n(AFP)",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Oladesu, Deputy Editor; Osagie Otabor, Akure; Jide Orintunsin, Abuja, Ernest Nwokolo, Abeokuta\n\nTinubu visits Oyo, Ogun, gets delegates\u2019 backing\n\nIt\u2019s time to reward me, says ex-governor\n\nOndo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu gave tips yesterday to the All Progressives Congress (APC) on how it can hold on to the Presidency after next year\u2019s general election.\n\nIn a post on his Facebook page, he said: \u201cAPC must work to retain power. We must rotate power to retain power. Rotate to the South. Shikena (a Hausa word for final)\u201d.\n\nThe governor, who was named the chairman of the party\u2019s Convention Security and Compliance sub-committee, has consistently advocated a power shift.\n\nGovernors of Southern states at three meetings insisted that power should shift to the South after President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tenure.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cross River State Governor Ben Ayade, while hosting frontline APC presidential aspirant Asiwaju Bola Tinubu in Calabar, said: \u201cZoning is a provision of our constitution to ensure balancing. It should not be about ethnic or regional domination but balancing. It\u2019s the turn of Southern Nigeria in 2023.\u201d\n\nAyade is also a presidential aspirant in the APC.\n\nYesterday, Tinubu visited Oyo and Ogun states to canvass support from delegates.\n\nIn Abeokuta, Tinubu told Ogun delegates to vote for him at the convention as a reward for backing people for political offices in the last 26 years.\n\nHe said it was not out of place to declare that the time had come for him to reap the benefits of supporting others.\n\nThe former Lagos State governor advised the delegates against jettisoning sound judgment and track records at the convention by turning it into a \u201cfamily affair\u201d.\n\nIn attendance were: Governor Dapo Abiodun, former governor Segun Osoba, Senator Olamilekan Solomon Adeola, State Chairman Yemi Sanusi and Deputy Governor Noimot Salako-Oyedele.\n\nTinubu was accompanied by governors Abdulahi Ganduje (Kano), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Lagos State House of Assembly Speaker Mudashiru Obasa, Senator Kashim Shetima, Senator Dayo Adeyeye and former Minister of Communications Adebayo Shittu.\n\nHe said his erstwhile political platform \u2013 the Action Congress (AC) was yielded to former Vice President Atiku Abubakar to contest the 2007 presidential election when he was hounded by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nAtiku had been in and out of the PDP since 2007.\n\nTaking all down the memory lane, Tinubu said he never regretted sacrificing the opportunity offered him to serve as running mate to President Muahmmadu Buhari in the build-up to the 2015 presidential election.\n\nAccording to him, he declined the offer to enable him to stabilise the APC, particularly towards ensuring that the newcomers from the PDP were fully accommodated.\n\nHe said in Yoruba: \u201cIt is now over 25 years that I have been helping people into political offices.\n\n\u201cIf Governor Dapo Abiodun \u2013 seated here \u2013 will be faithful to his God, I want to emphatically state that he couldn\u2019t have become the governor without me.\n\n\u201cI am here to solicit your votes. Don\u2019t make it a family affair.\n\n\u201cSince the time we started with the AC, Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) and now the APC, this is the first time l want to contest for President.\n\n\u201cThis is me telling you between my life and God Almighty, Buhari called me to be his Vice President. He said because the first time he contested, he picked Okadigbo, a flamboyant, catholic, but Nigerians didn\u2019t vote for him.\n\n\u201cThe second time, he picked another Igbo, Chief Edwin Ume Ezeoke, Nigerians didn\u2019t vote for him; that if he goes to bring the Pope to run as his vice, Nigerians won\u2019t vote for him, but you Bola Tinubu, you have six governors, you have never lost an election before, come and be my vice.\n\n\u201cHe knew all the calculations then favoured us; that was why he wanted me as his Vice, but I told him to let us build the party first.\n\n\u201cWhen we finished building the party, after we brought in people from the PDP, Saraki (Sen. Bukola) then saw that those from the PDP would not get anything if Buhari, a Muslim became the President and me, also a Muslim, became his Vice. That was how they started the campaign of calumny against me.\n\n\u201cI told them that I have a candidate that is a Christan that I could nominate so that the party would not break. That was how I nominated Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. I surrendered my right to him (Osinbajo).\n\n\u201cI was asked to submit three names. l submitted the names of Yemi Cardoso, Wale Edun and Yemi Osinbajo.\u201d\n\nHe said that was how Osinbajo was picked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m educated, I\u2019m experienced. I have been serving you for a long time. Help me win the presidency,\u201d he told his hosts.\n\nFolarin: we will support our leader\n\nIn Ibadan, Tinubu met with stakeholders, led by former Senate Leader Teslim Folarin, who is the governorship candidate. They pledged their support for the actualisation of his ambition.\n\nThe aspirant and his entourage were warmly received at the Civic Centre in the heart of the city by supporters.\n\nThanking them for the warm reception, Tinubu spoke on his plans for the country, saying that a better future is assured.\n\nHe said he was working with other national leaders of the party, many of whom accompanied him to the ancient city, to emerge as the most popular and acceptable candidate.\n\nApparently acknowledging the temporary division in the chapter over the recent governorship and parliamentary primaries, Tinubu said APC can only win in Oyo in an atmosphere of unity.\n\nHe urged stakeholders to rally around Folarin and other candidates to win the elections.\n\nHe emphasised that APC cannot win if the party is factionalised, urging the leaders to close ranks and work together in unity.\n\nTinubu, who spoke in Yoruba, stressed: \u201cI know there is internal wrangling among you. I want to appeal to all of you and all leaders here that you must all work together.\n\n\u201cThis visit is to meet you today, I will still come back when we will have a private meeting. If you really want to win the coming elections, there is no way you won\u2019t work together. Otherwise, you will lose votes.\n\n\u201cI want you all to work with Teslim Folarin. He has serious work to do before he can win. He will beg, traverse the state. We will vote and we will win.\u201d\n\nTinubu also pleaded with the stakeholders to support the children of deceased stalwarts and governors of the state, who are running for elective offices.\n\nHe said he had a commitment to their fathers, which he must not betray.\n\nHe raised the hands of Dapo Lam Adesina, who is running for the House of Representatives, Olamiju Akala and Idris Ajimobi, who are both running for Oyo House of Assembly seats.\n\nFolarin spoke on the favour Tinubu did for him in 2003 when he was governor of Lagos State, despite the fact that they belonged to different political parties.\n\nHe said Tinubu allocated a plot of land to him in Lekki and sent the allocation papers to him in Abuja through Senator Musiliu Obanikoro.\n\nFolarin added: \u201cWe must never forget our benefactors and we must never betray them. Oyo State delegates are for Asiwaju, our leader. I want to assure you that you have our total support sir. Oyo State is for you.\u201d\n\nTinubu also visited his friend and colleague in the Third Republic Senate, Chief Rashidi Ladoja, former governor of the state, at his residence.\n\nThe former governor also assured Tinubu of his maximum support and that of the people of Oyo State.",

          "text": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) has predicted a 94 per cent decrease in COVID-19 deaths in Africa compared to 2021.\n\nIt is expected to be down from a \u201ccatastrophically high\u201d average of 970 fatalities each day in 2021 to around 60 a day by the end of 2022.\n\n\u201cThe low number of deaths expected this year is a huge achievement for the region and a testament to the efforts of countries and partners,\u201d WHO Regional Director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti told reporters at a virtual news conference.\n\nDespite the new WHO modelling projection compared with 2021 \u2013 the pandemic\u2019s most lethal \u2013 actual cases are estimated to drop by a little over a quarter in 2022.\n\n\u201cHowever, the job is not yet done. Every time we sit back and relax, COVID-19 flares up again,\u201d Moeti cautioned.\n\nThe analysis, which was published this week in the Lancet Global Health scientific journal, finds that while the region reported 113,102 deaths through official channels in 2021, about one in three were missed, driving the actual number of deaths up to a projected 350,000.\n\nThe modelling suggests that if current variants and transmission dynamics remain constant, around 23,000 people are expected to die by the end of 2022.\n\nHowever, a variant that is 200 per cent more lethal, would cause an increase in deaths to more than 70,000.\n\n\u201cThe threat of new variants remains real, and we need to be ready to cope with this ever-present danger,\u201d she warned.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings infer that only one in 71 COVID-19 cases in Africa have been recorded and projects 166.2 million infections in 2022 compared to the estimated 227.5 million that occurred in 2021.\n\nThe decline in cases and deaths in 2022 is due to increasing vaccinations, improved pandemic responses and natural immunity from previous infections that, while not preventing re-infections, stop severe forms of the disease leading to death.\n\nThe analysis estimates that COVID-19 was the seventh major cause of death in Africa in 2021, just below malaria.\n\n\u201cThe significant increase in 2021 was due to the more infectious and severe Delta variant. We have learnt many lessons on how to stay a step ahead of the virus,\u201d Moeti said.\n\nAs the pandemic persists, WHO maintained that it is crucial to ramp up comprehensive healthcare services, including preventive measures, treatment and vaccination for vulnerable populations.\n\nTargeted surveillance will also be critical to monitor hospitalisation, the burden of comorbidities and the emergence of new variants.\n\n\u201cNow is the time to refine our response and identify populations most at-risk of COVID-19,\u201d the WHO official said.\n\n\u201cCountries must intensify efforts to conduct a targeted response that provides the most vulnerable people with the health services they need, including COVID-19 vaccines and effective treatment.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Okays $968,818 for emergency restoration of Lagos power line\n\n\u2022Moves to address rising food prices\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\n\n\nThe federal government has explained why the $3.1 billion contract for complete automation of the Nigeria Custom Service (NCS) approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) in 2020 was reversed.\n\nIt said disagreement among partners that formed consortium for the project delayed its take off despite efforts by the government through the office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice to mediate.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, who spoke to newsmen yesterday, after the weekly virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo at the State House, Abuja, explained the rationale behind a new e-Customs concession agreement between the NCS, Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) and China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Limited.\n\nAccording to the minister: \u201cThe e-Customs project was approved by Council. And there were some challenges that had to do with disagreements among the concession partners.\n\n\u201cRemember that government was not a partner of the concession, it was a group of different investing parties that came together and formed the consortium.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney General and Minister of Justice has intervened. There were several number of meetings to try to iron out the difference. So it has to do with shareholders, who has what responsibility. And at the end of the day, I think one of the partners in the concession did not agree with the arrangements.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cSo the partner that signed was already in the initial concession. So that one party did not agree with the terms that are signed. And there is a new agreement that had been signed and that partner was reported to have opted out of the concession.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen the report yet but it was reported to have opted out of being in the concession. So there is a new concession agreement that has been committed. And on the part of the ministry and I know Custom, what it means is that the implementation of e-Customs project can now start with this resolution.\u201d\n\nThe NCS Comptroller-General, Col. Hameed Ali (rtd) who signed the new contract in Abuja, Monday, had explained that the NCS would generate a whopping revenue of $176 billion over the next 20 years through the implementation of e-customs project.\n\nAli reportedly said the e-Customs concession project would ease the cost of doing business, boost revenue, enhance productivity and stop every arbitrariness in the service.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe $3.2 billion e-Customs project to be financed by the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) and managed by Huawei Technologies Limited under a 20-year concession window, when fully implemented, would quadruple Customs\u2019 current N210 billion monthly revenue collection.\u201d\n\nThe project which was approved by FEC on September 2, 2020, and awarded to Messrs E. Customs HC Project Limited, was expected to last for 36 months, to enhance the agency\u2019s mode of operation using the application of information and technology in all aspects of its administration.\n\n\u201cThe main objective of this project is to completely automate every aspect of the customs business and to institutionalise the use of smart and emerging technologies that will enhanced the statutory function of the Nigerian Customs Service in the areas of revenue generation as well as trade facilitation and enhancement of security,\u201d the Minister of Finance and Budget Planning, Zainab Ahmed, had told State House Correspondents shortly after the meeting in 2020.\n\nAlso, Ahmed disclosed plan by the federal government to address rising cost food prices across the country as it plans to convene a meeting of the National Food Security Council shortly.\n\nShe also disclosed that that FEC gave approval for the National Food Security Council to meet, \u201cvery quickly to address the issue of food inflation, and also provide a plan and some methods in which we can reduce the cost of food to support improved food prices for the citizenry.\u201d\n\nShe further said the Council was briefed about the rising inflation rate and the need to manage the cost of inflation in the country.\n\nAhmed added that FEC considered a report from the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning for the first quarter of 2022 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report which showed that the Nigerian economy grew by 3.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2022, as against a growth of 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of last year.\n\nHer words: \u201cThis growth shows a gradual economic stability from the recession that we witnessed in 2020. And also it shows the six quarter of positive growth that the Nigerian economy has presented.\n\n\u201cSo of the 46 economic activities, the bulk sector performance show that services sector grew strongly by 4.7 per cent, agriculture also grew by 3.61 per cent, Industry on the other hand contracted by minus 6.81 per cent and there was also a significant contraction in the crude oil, petroleum and natural gas sector of 26.04 per cent.\n\n\u201cCoal mining sector also declined, oil refinery the biggest contraction of 44.26 per cent, electricity sector, textile outcome. Therefore, even though there has been growth in some sectors, there are significant contraction than others but the net effect is positive growth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very mindful of the fact that unless we have most of the sectors growing especially the growth in the jobs impacted sectors, that this growth that is positive will not be directly felt by the people.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWe also reported to Council that inflation has started going upward to the extent that the monetary authorities of the Central Bank of Nigeria have had to adjust the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) to 13 per cent at the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting and that\u2019s an attempt to manage the cost of inflation.\n\n\u201cSo, Council has decided to set up a special effort to look at the sectors that are not growing and also to look at how we can grow the other sectors better.\u201d\n\nAlso briefing newsmen after the FEC meeting, Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, said the Council approved the contract, \u201cto supply and install emergency restoration system or 330 kV and 132KV transmission line for ongoing rehabilitation works in Lagos at the sum of $968,818 as the offshore component, the onshore component is N7,393 million and the contractor is Rab Power Industries Limited.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the update on the federal government electricity deal with Siemen of Germany, he explained that he recently toured their facilities in Germany to ascertain the level of work in the production of the equipment and was satisfied with the spate of work so far.\n\nAccording to him, despite the impact of the ongoing Russia/Ukraine war which slowed down the process of their production, he had been able to get Siemen committed to supply 10 mobile transformers to be installed in the country by September this year.\n\nHe disclosed that works are ongoing in the country as contractors are already working on the sites to prepare grounds for the installation of the equipment immediately they arrive in the country.\n\nOn his part, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, disclosed that the Council approved the memo for the NNPC Limited to execute a Memorandum of Understanding with ECOWAS for the construction of the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline to take gas to 15 West African countries and through Morocco to Spain and Europe.\n\nGiving a breakdown of contracts approved for his ministry, he said N3.8 billion was approved for the construction of a switchgear room, an installation of power distribution cables and equipment for the Nigeria Oil and Gas Park in Ogbehia, Bayelsa state.\n\nThis, he said, was to support local manufacturing of components for the oil and gas industry.\n\nSylva added that, \u201cCouncil also approved various contracts for the construction of an access road with bridges to the brass petroleum product depot in Nibomoyekiri in brass local government in the sum of N11 billion plus 7.5 per cent VAT.\u201d\n\nThe Council also okayed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the purchase of 82 Toyota brand of vehicles, branded raincoats and sundry other accoutrements for the use of the Nigerian Police at the total cost of N8,315,209,825.\n\nThis came following approval for the Nigerian Police Trust Fund to award contracts for the supply of sundry accoutrements for the efficient operation of the Police.\n\nMinister of Police Affairs, Maigari Dingyadi, who disclosed this while also briefing newsmen after the FEC meeting, said the approval included the supply of customised raincoat for distribution to police formations across the country at the cost of N1.9 billion.\n\nDingyadi who said the memo which received the nod of the cabinet, included customised Police boots at the cost of N576 million.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWe also got approval for the supply of micro first aid kits for the police at the cost of N1 billion as well as customised instructional materials for the police colleges and schools at the cost of N664 million.\n\n\u201cThere is also the supply of drugs and medical equipment for police hospitals across the country at the cost of N2 billion. When you add all these projects, they will come up to 8,315,209,825 billion.\u201d\n\nThe Minister said the NPTL was set up as a special intervention fund to facilitate the improvement of the operations of Nigerian police force in the areas of equipment, training and welfare, adding, \u201cwhat we\u2019re having now have been assembled from the output of the end user, that is the Nigerian police force.\u201d\n\nHe noted that, \u201cby the time these items are on ground, they will go a long way in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Nigerian police in the maintenance of peace and security in the country.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Some govs want to go south; Adamu, others prefer north\n\n\u2022Party may reopen sale of forms to broaden choices for candidates\n\n\u2022Moves to encourage El-Rufai, Zulum to join race\n\nOlawale Olaleye\n\n\n\nFour days to the rescheduled presidential primaries of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), billed to hold Monday, June 6, in Abuja, the leadership of the party, has remained divided on the zoning of its ticket, even as it continues to ponder the options opened to it to match the presidential candidate of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.\n\nThe current state of play in the APC, has been further compounded by the differing positions of its stakeholders on the zoning palaver, a development, which has seen some governors insisting on going south for balancing, while the National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, in cahoots with a few others, would rather go north, for political expediency.\n\nInterestingly, the development, has pushed the party leadership to consider the reopening of sales of Expression of Interest and Nomination forms to more members by way of broadening its choices for a suitable presidential candidate, that would secure the confidence of the people and lead the party to victory.\n\nAlready, two persons being targeted to encourage to join the race, are the Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai and his Borno State counterpart, Professor Babagana Zulum, even though the later had since dismissed the idea of looking at other possibilities in 2023, except returning to Borno to finish off what he had started.\n\nThe APC was first thrown into confusion, when Atiku emerged candidate of the PDP at a keenly contested presidential primaries in Abuja, a situation, which completely unsettled the thinking and extrapolations in the ruling party.\n\nUnfortunately, the confusion was further accentuated on Monday, when President Muhammadu Buhari, at a meeting with the 22 governors of the party and Adamu, pleaded with the stakeholders to let him choose his successor as a sign of reciprocity.\n\nBuhari, in a two-page speech, reminded the governors that, while those governors, who just served their first terms, had a field day securing their tickets to return to office, the outgoing ones, after serving out their constitutional two terms of eight years, also had the privileges to choose their successors.\n\nHe, therefore, enjoined them all to let him too enjoy same privileges through \u201creciprocity\u201d of similar action, to choose his successor at the proposed June 6 presidential primaries.\n\nBy implications, the president had ruled out the possibility of an elective convention but a consensus option that would allow him choose his proffered candidate, who would be affirmed on Monday, at the Eagle Square, in Abuja.\n\nBut since this new thinking was thrown into the mix by the president, the leadership of the party, including the governors, as major stakeholders, had started pondering the options opened to them and particularly, lead them to victory.\n\nThus, while some of the governors insisted that it would remain indefensible to go north, since Buhari, a northerner, would be serving out eight years in 2023, others, including the national chairman of the party, believed going north was the surest path to victory, if they must match Atiku in all the boxes critical to their victory in next year\u2019s elections.\n\nTo this end, the party leadership, has resolved to consider reopening the sales of forms to some members of the party by way of broadening the options and further opening up the turf to more candidates for a competitive approach to the ticket, even when the president had said without equivocation that, there would be no election.\n\nIn their consideration as they came up with this idea, THISDAY gathered, were El-Rufai and Zulum, a move believed would help them push some of their best from the north into the race and put the party on a sure-footing ahead of the elections.\n\nIt is not certain yet if El-Rufai would buy into the idea, having said time and time again that, he was not interested in the presidency and that he believed in the need for power to shift to the south after Buhari\u2019s eight years, because it was the right thing to do.\n\nZulum, on his part, had been touted earlier as a possible option for running mate to whoever emerged the candidate of the party, but had openly come out to turn down the idea, saying also that, while it was a good thing to consider him for the office, especially, given the privileges attached to it, he preferred to return to Borno to consolidate the work he had started.\n\nThis, nonetheless, the governors had maintained the position, that despite Buhari\u2019s appeal for reciprocity in the choice of his successor, they too had a responsibility as stakeholders to advise and guide him on the suitability of his choice candidate for the party.\n\nIndeed, many of the governors, who were insistent on going south, held the view that there was no need to panic over the emergence of Atiku in the PDP, because with a strong southern candidate, which they claimed to have in good numbers, the party would still comfortably defeat Atiku in 2023.\n\nAside not seeing anything wrong in pandering to Buhari\u2019s request for reciprocity, many of the governors still believed that an acceptable choice of successor was key, not just to their victory at the general election, but to help prevail on other contenders, who would be persuaded to stand down for the sake of the president.\n\nAgainst this background, while waiting for Buhari to return from his trip to Madrid, Spain, and present his candidate to the party ahead of the convention, a majority of the governors still stood strong against going north, notwithstanding the fears of other stakeholders, including Adamu.\n\nShare this:

          "text": "\u2022Ayu: The convention was family affair, declares \u2018no victor no vanquished\u2019\n\n\u2022Wike visits former vice president at his Asokoro residence\n\nChuks Okocha\n\nFormer vice president, Atiku Abubakar yesterday received his certificate of return as the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 general elections, urging the party to bear in mind that there was much work to be done before victory.\n\nHe spoke as the National Chairman of PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu called for a united party, describing the outcome of the special national presidential convention as a family affair where there was no victor and no vanquished.\n\nAccording to Atiku who spoke on his victory at the convention, \u201cwe should not take that or their defeat for granted. We must unite and work extremely hard for every single vote in this country. There is so much to do. And there is very little time to waste. So let\u2019s get to work.\u201d\n\nAtiku who called for unity in the PDP further said, \u201cLet us all remember that what just happened is a contest within a family to decide how to put our best foot forward. The main contest is the one to win the presidency of our country for our party.\n\n\u201cIt will require the entire PDP family and other supporters and sympathisers. We must pull everyone together. Nobody should be excluded; I beg of you\u201d.\n\nThe former vice president said he had already visited some of those who contested against him, \u201cas a way to lead in that effort to unify the party so that we can face our real opponents, defeat them in the elections and begin the process of rescuing and rebuilding this country from the calours and dangerous All Progressives Congress (APC) misrule over the past seven years which is there for everyone to see.\u201d\n\nHe further said, \u201cI am honored and humbled to receive this Certificate of Return having emerged as our party\u2019s candidate in our just concluded special convention. This victory is a victory for all of us, for our party, and for the vast majority of Nigerians suffering under the misrule of the APC. It was a collective effort, and I\u2019m very grateful for everybody\u2019s contributions.\u201d\n\nExpressing his gratitude, Atiku said, \u201cI am particularly grateful that you kept your word and gave us contestants fair treatment, despite what might have been a difficult situation.\n\n\u201cYour integrity and even handedness must be commended. I commend our party\u2019s National Executive Committee for putting our party and our country first in its deliberations and decision-making process.\n\n\u201cI thank all those who assisted my campaign in a variety of ways to enable me to crisscross this vast country and make my case for our delegates and other party elders and members.\n\n\u201cTo all those who volunteer their time to help with organising the convention, as well as the security personnel and agencies who ensured that the event was successful, I say thank you very much indeed.\n\n\u201cI also thank my family, for putting up with my demands and the disruption this quest to serve obviously brought about.\u201d\n\nHe also commended the NWC for transforming the party secretariat.\n\n\u201cSo let me commend the National Working Committee for transforming this place into a decent and beautiful place. This is a clear evidence that, if we have a new PDP government, we will transform this country,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his speech, the PDP chairman said that the event was not a celebration of victory.\n\n\u201cRather within the PDP family, we had a minor contest, a small contest within the family. There were no victors, there were no vanquishes, the party won. It is the party that won. Atiku Abubakar is not yet victorious. He has only been produced as our candidate, the candidate of the whole party.\n\n\u201cAs we marched forward, we need all of you because each one of you had a supporter and all of you plus all your supporters, we want you all to fuse together into one happy political family. It is this family that will face the battle ahead.\n\n\u201cWe have only started a journey. We shall end this journey sometime next year. By the first of June next year, we should take over power from colourless and clueless government that has totally destroyed this country.\n\n\u201cAll of you are aware of what has happened to our country in the last seven years. I don\u2019t need to repeat issues of insecurity, total destruction of the economy, total disunity of the country. We have never been as divided as we are today as a country. Families are divided, communities are divided against each other.\n\n\u201cThere is no trust among ourselves. The president that is coming in is tested and trusted. He will lead us to reunite the country. He will lead us to rebuild the economy. He will lead us to get rid of bandits and terrorists. He will re-enforce the armed forces.\n\n\u201cHe will give us respect in the international community. Today we are a pariah state but in the next 12 months, the whole world will begin to respect Nigeria all over again.\n\n\u201cI urge all of you to come together. It doesn\u2019t matter which candidate you supported, come together and support the party, support our efforts, support our candidates, the next president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and I want to assure you that we in the National Working Committee will continue to work tirelessly because you didn\u2019t elect to us to organise a successful convention, you elected us to win the presidency for you.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cYou elected us to give you more governors, you elected us to take control of the two houses of the National Assembly. You elected us to win all the Houses of Assembly across the states and we will continue to do just that by working with you, by calling on many of you to come and help us execute these objectives because we can\u2019t do it alone. \u201c\n\nHe said that the occasion is to appreciate members of the party for a job well done\n\nPresent at the occasion were Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State; Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State; former Delta State Governor, James Ibori;\n\nDarius Ishaku of Taraba State and some of the presidential aspirants , including, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, Bukola Saraki, Sam Ohuabunwa and the only female presidential aspirant, Olivia Terila Diana among others\n\nMeanwhile, Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike yesterday visited the PDP presidential candidate at his Asokoro residence. The visit was barely 24 hours that Atiku visited Wike in company of some PDP officials.\n\nAtiku who confirmed Wike\u2019s visit in his verified tweeter handle wrote: \u201cIt was a pleasure to receive His Excellency Nyesom Wike in the company of notable leaders and officials of our great party, the PDP at my residence today.\n\n\u201cI am proud of the promises that this spirit of camaraderie holds for our party as a united front that guarantees victory in the next election to rescue the country.\u201d\n\nWike was absent at the PDP secretariat when the Certificate of return was handed over to Atiku by the Ayu-led NWC.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "According to Atiku who spoke on his victory at the convention, \u201cwe should not take that or their defeat for granted.\nThe main contest is the one to win the presidency of our country for our party.\n\u201cIt will require the entire PDP family and other supporters and sympathisers.\n\u201cRather within the PDP family, we had a minor contest, a small contest within the family.\nThe visit was barely 24 hours that Atiku visited Wike in company of some PDP officials.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Appetito, an on-demand grocery retail business that delivers groceries to users from a small network of dark stores in Cairo, announced on Tuesday the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup which operates in Rabat, and the Greater Tunis area of Morocco and Tunisia respectively.\n\nPer a press release shared with TechCabal by Appetito co-founder Shehab Mokhtar, the deal is expected to close by the third quarter of 2022, but the two companies have reached an agreement to operate under Appetito as a single entity. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to welcome unparalleled talent and like-minded entrepreneurs to our family. We\u2019re 12 months ahead of our plan to expand in Africa,\u201d Mokhtar said in the statement.\n\nBoth companies have already begun to train staff together, Lamma co-founder and CEO Yassir El Ismaili El Idrissi told TechCabal on a call.\n\nCiting sources close to the matter, Techcrunch reported that the deal is valued between $10 million and $15 million, prompting concerns about how Appetito funded it since it only announced a $2 million pre-series round and raised $2.5 million since it began operations in March 2020. But Mokhtar told Techcrunch that his company expects to soon close an 8-figure round to support the expansion.\n\nAppetito co-founders and Lamma co-founder, Yassir El Ismaili El Idrissi. Photo: Appetito\n\nLamma began as a ridesharing app in 2020, but after participating in the Flat6Labs Tunis accelerator program last June, the startup shifted its focus to the quick commerce logistics business. It also raised $72,500 from Flat6Labs Tunis and Orange Ventures in April and October last year, according to Crunchbase data.\n\nThe firm has since embarked on an ambitious expansion program that took it into neighbouring Morocco early this year and has now seen it merge with Egypt\u2019s Appetito.\n\nIn April, when TechCabal called Appetito\u2019s strong focus on the dark store model \u201ca test for multi-node last-mile distribution in Africa,\u201d the company said they planned to add 50 dark stores every year until 2024 as part of its plans to cover Cairo, Giza, and Alexandria. With the addition of Rabat and the Greater Tunis area, it appears that the new Appetito already has its hands full.\n\nEl Idrissi, the Lamma co-founder who will be joining Appetito to lead its growth and expansion, says the firm will focus on consolidating in the markets it is already operating in. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy growth in the long term,\u201d he told TechCabal, \u201cso the first focus of our work is to make sure that our current operations, which are in three countries, are solid. And we have a lot to do in Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia.\u201d The firm, he explained, would only continue international expansion when it was appropriate.\n\nIt makes sense to consolidate and grow locally. On one hand, Appetito\u2019s Egyptian rivals Breadfast and Rabbit (which also operates in Saudi Arabia) are eyeing the same customers as Appetito. And globally, quick-commerce grocery startups have struggled since the second quarter of the year with Getir, Gorillas, and GoPuff announcing layoffs.\n\nShare this article",

The company in question, Patricia Technologies\u2014or just Patricia\u2014was originally registered in Nigeria as a gift card exchange after Fejiro fell into the hands of fraudsters.\n\nHe\u2019d received a gift card worth \u20a630,000 (~$73), in 2015, from his uncle in the US, in lieu of a monthly allowance. Needing to exchange the gift card for cash, he went online to transact with a gift card exchange, only to fall victim to a scam. Gift card scams are commonplace: users are asked to disclose the card\u2019s number, unwittingly granting the scammer access to its funds. After his experience, Fejiro figured that if he was getting scammed, others were too; building an exchange where people could safely exchange their gift cards for cash was an obvious opportunity. And he seized it.\n\nFor the next 2 years, from 2017 through 2018, Patricia would operate as a gift card exchange. But not for long.\n\nIn 2019, Fejiro transitioned Patricia from gift card exchanging to a line that he found to be blossoming in popularity and demand: crypto trading. Nigeria was on the cusp of being identified, within the next 2 years\u20142020 and 2021\u2014as a leading crypto economy. The stats thrown around about this development functioned as both news headlines and high praise for the country\u2019s crypto adoption rate. The highest number of Google searches for \u201cbitcoin\u201d came from Nigeria. Twenty-three-point-seven percent of Nigerians online owned some form of cryptocurrency. Businesses were adding crypto plugins to their payment options. Trading volumes were surpassing $1 million per day on Binance.\n\nIf an economy could be a crypto heaven, Nigeria was looking like it. But the country\u2019s government did not share the enthusiasm. Soon, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) would descend its regulatory hammer on crypto trading, and Fejiro would have to think fast to save his young business.\n\nThinking fast, moving faster\n\nFejiro is speaking to me from Dubai. It has taken me and his team 5 weeks to schedule this interview; there\u2019d been a scheduling conflict in February and a long silence after that, until April, when he gets on a call with me, 6 minutes late, battling a cold that sometimes fogs up his voice. And yet, the story he tells me over the course of an hour, about himself and Patricia, is clear and does not stumble. It\u2019s a story he\u2019s told so many times he knows it backwards\u2014which comes as no surprise; he will write his memoir someday, he assures me, and is already shooting footage of his life for a future documentary.\n\nAs an undergraduate at the University of Port Harcourt, studying mathematics and statistics, he\u2019d done everything he could to make some extra change. He sold noodles, then popcorn, then started a clothing company, and had even attempted to start a taxi business. The list of start-and-stop businesses to his credit would eventually stretch from 5 to 13\u2014all before his hit venture: Patricia.\n\nI wonder at his going bullish on several entrepreneurial ventures while still in school. I ask as delicately as I can manage: was he poor? He says no. He\u2019d lost his dad when he was 8 and his mum when he was 16, just before university, but he hadn\u2019t lacked anything; his extended family took good care of him. He just had always been entrepreneurial, he says. When he was in primary school, growing up in Warri, south-south Nigeria, he distributed candy to 4 primary schools in his neighbourhood, earning enough profit to pay his family\u2019s rent for 2 years.\n\nFejiro has an uncomplicated relationship with executing his ideas; he does not overthink them. In his world, if it sounds like a plan, it probably is. He\u2019d christened his company by its curious name on a whim: his mother\u2019s name was Patience, but his grandfather preferred to call her Patricia, to annoy her, and start an argument\u2014every time. Many years later, when Patricia popped into Fejiro\u2019s head as a suggestion for his company\u2019s name, he didn\u2019t think about it twice.\n\n\u201cYou may spend so much time thinking and not acting fast enough,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd the market is actually moving. You need to be able to move as fast as the market. When you spend too much time thinking, you end up losing everything.\u201d\n\nAnd so, when the CBN suddenly banned commercial banks from facilitating crypto transactions, Fejiro knew he had to think\u2014and act\u2014 quickly.\n\nNews of the ban had dropped on February 5, 2021, a Friday afternoon. Reactions to it on social media were riotous, angry, and pained. The apex bank had not only proscribed banks from servicing crypto transactions, it had ordered them to close all accounts found to be used for crypto trading. Worse, the following week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) banned crypto use altogether.\n\nWhen it became clear that the country\u2019s regulations had a hostile attitude towards crypto use, Fejiro relocated Patricia\u2019s headquarters to Estonia, a country in northeastern Europe, famous\u2014at the time\u2014for its liberal crypto regime. This was 5 months after the ban in Nigeria.\n\nThe Estonian business environment is famously progressive. The country has an e-residency programme\u2014the first country in the world to introduce this; a young entrepreneur can easily incorporate their startup there, in a process that takes less than an hour and costs less than \u20ac5,000\u2014all based on a residency permit that is entirely digital. The country had even considered introducing its own national cryptocurrency, the estcoin, in 2017.\n\nBut the Estonian crypto party would not last long. Three months after Patricia\u2019s relocation, the Estonian government opened discussions to tighten its crypto regulations; in March this year, the tightening became law, a move directed at combating rising fraud and money laundering issues associated with its earlier liberal crypto regulations.\n\nAlthough Fejiro supports the tightened regulations, it would seem that he is cautious about camping his business too close to regulatory quick fire. He moved Patricia\u2019s headquarters to Lithuania.\n\n\u201cWe moved out of Estonia when the law became too stringent for us to operate,\u201d he says.\n\nWay bigger than him now\n\nFejiro rises at 7:30 AM, every day. Three times a week his day begins with him receiving management updates from a team he had gradually built from 2 to over 350 employees spread across Ghana, Lithuania, the UK, Nigeria, and China. The management meetings set the tone of his day. Although he describes himself as a risk taker, building a thriving business may have given that trait an altruistic edge. When he started Patricia, he\u2019d invested all his personal money in the venture, but he tells me now that that kind of risk taking is well behind him. \u201cWhen you start a company, you really have nothing to lose except your life savings\u2014and that\u2019s just my life savings. I will take risks, though,\u201d he cautions, lest I get it twisted, \u201cbut at the scale we\u2019re at now, I wouldn\u2019t take a bet-the-company risk, because Patricia is way bigger than me now.\u201d\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you ready to part with all your money? Are you prepared to lose everything? This is what an expert crypto trader who identifies simply as Ademi asks anyone who wants to make money from crypto. Even after losing $10,000, she still sticks to crypto trading as a career.\n\nAdemi decided to forge a career out of trading crypto and NFTs when she realised how efficient cryptocurrencies are for cross-border transactions.\n\nMy dealings with expert crypto traders have revealed that most of them began trading because they believed strongly in the technology, which made researching the best ways to make money easier.\n\nTheir journeys seldom started with a desire to make money; they often gave in to their curiosity and desire to understand what made them efficient, their shortcomings, how they worked, and their technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdemi got interested five years ago, in 2017, when a friend suggested crypto has a payment option, that are instant, and cross borders quickly. She marvelled at the possibilities and became curious about cryptocurrencies. And that was the beginning of the journey.\n\nWhile crypto traders might flaunt their wealth on social media, the journey to becoming an expert is long and unpleasant. But nothing would deter Ademi as she set out to make some money with crypto and turn it into a career.\n\nStarting with the 2017 bull market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by CardMapr.nl on Unsplash\n\nA crypto bull market is a time when the value of crypto assets keeps rising. It is a time when crypto investors and traders are almost always in the green, and the media goes agog with news of all-time highs and mind-boggling market caps.\n\nIt\u2019s when most people decide to invest in crypto to get a piece of the action. However, a bear market \u2014 what comes at the end of a bull market \u2014 is what separates the newbies from the experts.\n\nThe 2017 bull run was huge. For context, Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, went from $900 to almost $20,000 between May and December. However, just as Bitcoin reached the $20,000 limelight, it was followed by a 30% drop that bloodied the entire crypto market.\n\nBy 2018, Bitcoin had dropped 80% below its initial all-time high in 2017, going as low as $3,500. While it might seem overly dramatic to describe it as a catastrophe, it is a mild way to put it in the eyes of investors who had to watch their investments bleed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@nampoh?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Maxim Hopman</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/crypto-fall?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a>\n\nLike most newbies, Ademi found the 2017 bull run attractive and saw a chance to cash out, not knowing one of the worst bear markets of all time was just around the corner.\n\nShe lost money to the unforgiving bear market but had already learnt how to trade futures, a way to make money even when crypto charts are as crimson red.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFutures trading isn\u2019t a hack to make money when the market is on a downtrend; it is considerably more difficult than regular trading.\n\nIt is a way to invest in assets by betting on what their price will be in the future. It\u2019s a lot more complicated than it sounds, but that\u2019s the idea. Ademi was a fast learner, and while the 2018 crypto meltdown did a number on her for some time, futures trading helped her leverage the meltdown.\n\nDetour to crypto influencing\n\nAdemi isn\u2019t just making money speculating what direction crypto assets will take; she also makes money influencing people\u2019s choices on what exchange they use and even which assets they invest in.\n\nShe got in early and spent a lot of time understanding the space, which has helped her build a following over time. As an undergraduate in 2017, Ademi was already learning the crypto ropes, and as soon as she graduated, she landed a job with the crypto exchange, Quidax.\n\n\u201cI mostly organised training for people on how to trade crypto. And I eventually got employed by Quidax.\u201d\n\nWhen you can learn all there is to know about crypto trading as fast as Ademi, a nine-to-five doesn\u2019t seem like an exciting option. After a few months, she left Quidax to be a full-time crypto trader.\n\n\u201cI decided to be on my own after a little while just trading, and it seemed to be working for me. It actually did; 2019 was a good year. I also got to work with people that I met on Twitter.\u201d\n\nFrom talking crypto and sharing trading tips on Twitter, Ademi was gradually becoming an influencer, and she was about to start reaping fruits.\n\nShe had always done most of her trading on BitMex, but it wasn\u2019t optimal enough, making her and some other users lose money. Either price changes didn\u2019t reflect early enough or the platform suffered from system overload.\n\nIt was time for a change, and Ademi was introduced to Bybit. Like BitMex, Bybit offered futures trading, a feature not many exchanges had at the time. Seeing how good Bybit was, Ademi recommended it to her community, and that was where she started reaping influencer profits.\n\n\u201cBecause I was early, I got many people to sign up using my referral link. In addition to profits from trading crypto, I was also able to get income from referrals that I actually didn\u2019t expect, to be honest.\u201d\n\nBy the end of 2019, Bitcoin was trading at about $7,200, and Ademi earned two Bitcoins from all her referrals. Considering profits from trading, 2019 was indeed a good year.\n\nThe NFT holy grail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrypto trading and influencing were going well for Ademi, but the crypto space constantly evolves and keeping up with the trends could fetch a lot of money.\n\nNFTs were the new trends, and Ademi was not going to be left out. As usual, she didn\u2019t jump in right away; she observed, learnt, and decided to take a dip into the NFT pool last year, and that was when things got interesting.\n\nTrading NFTs started beautifully, with her first NFT coming from the Cool Cats collection. A collection of anthropomorphised 2D cats now has a floor price of 3.4 Eth, which is ~ $12,000.\n\nAdemi got in early, and she made a 100% gain on her investment in the Cool Cats, a very cool start to NFT trading.\n\nIn the crypto game, you quickly learn that things will not always be rosy, regardless of whether you are trading NFTs or trading futures.\n\nAdemi was about to find this out the hard way; asides from the Cool Cats, she had bought into another project that brought her more good fortunes, and NFTs seemed to be the next best thing.\n\nShe decided to go big on NFTs and bought into a collection for $10,000. The collection had good hype, the kind that could result in very high percentage gains, but even in crypto, as with most things, not all that glitters is gold.\n\nAdemi watched as her $10,000 plummeted to almost $0.\n\nWhile $10,000 is a lot of money, she was unfazed by the loss. Some people might decide to call it quits with all things crypto at this point, but to Ademi, it was just another day in the crypto sphere.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever gotten to that point. Because at the end of the day, crypto brought me here. I started with literally nothing, actually, and crypto brought me here. So I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever come to the point where I\u2019ll be like, \u2018no more crypto for me.\u2019\u201d\n\nCrypto as a full-time job\n\nAfter Ademi\u2019s brief stint at Quidax, she never took another job because crypto paid the bills despite $10,000 losses. She had already found something she was good at, and chasing a nine-to-five was unnecessary.\n\nImportantly, Ademi\u2019s crypto career transcended just trading, technical analysis, and staring at charts.\n\nIn addition to teaching and being an influencer, Ademi has a knack for running and managing crypto projects. She is familiar with marketing tactics, what projects are doing wrong, and which projects are likely to succeed or fail.\n\nCrypto trading has been touted as the biggest, if not the only, opportunity that came with the advent of cryptocurrencies, but, according to Ademi, there are many ways to make life-changing money with crypto.\n\nTo her, the crypto space has morphed into an industry of its own creating brand new opportunities for people in different fields such as design, web development, engineering, marketing, and content creation.\n\nThis is why Ademi remains a firm believer in the crypto space, and even when the market decides to bleed for months on end, crypto brought her here, and crypto will keep her here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

I mean, as a reader, this should matter to you.\n\nYesterday, June 1, 2022, Google announced the integration of two of its video-calling apps, Duo and Meet, into a single platform.\n\nThis means that there will only be Google Meet, and Google expects that it will be the only calling app users need.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, Slack is introducing new features like the ability to add name pronunciation guides either by recording audio or adding phonetic spelling to promote team collaboration and connection.\n\nLastly, Instagram has incorporated Amber Alerts, a tool that helps locate kidnapped children, into users\u2019 feeds. While the feature was only launched in the United States yesterday, the company plans to expand it to 25 countries in the coming days.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nHow Victoria Fabunmi helps founders get capital\n\nTalk360\u2019s $4 million seed\n\nAppetito\u2019s acquisition\n\nHow Victoria Fabunmi helps founders get capital\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria Fabunmi. Source: LinkedIn\n\nI mentioned yesterday that the editorial team is cooking. These meals are ready for consumption. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve started to enjoy them.\n\nStill unclear? I\u2019ll help you out. The editorial team \u2014 Nifemi, Emmanuel, Chimgozirim, Bolu, and Ogheneruemu \u2014 have got new and \u201cretouched\u201d series. And if you noticed, we also brought back How I Work, handled by Samuel our content guru.\n\nWhether you\u2019re interested in blockchain, AI, IoT, how tech helps everyday people, experts\u2019 journeys in tech, East Africa coverage, or venture capital and startups, we\u2019ve got you covered!\n\nOn today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, the editorial team discussed their series and why you should care. While you know Nifemi\u2019s The Experts, I\u2019d like to discuss Chimgozirim\u2019s series, Equity Merchants, today.\n\nIf you\u2019re a regular, you\u2019re probably familiar with Chimgozirim as the guy who covers VCs and startups in Africa. Well, his new series is not far from this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019ll talk to angel investors, venture capitalists, private equity merchants, and founders. If you want to understand how the Venture Capital market works, look for his story every Wednesday at 12 p.m. WAT!\n\nHe\u2019s also adding a podcast and a newsletter. While the articles will be available on the website every Wednesday at 12 p.m. WAT, the podcast can be found anywhere you get your podcasts, and the newsletter will be sent directly to your inbox. Isn\u2019t this fantabulous?\n\nIn his words, this week\u2019s story is the \u201cmost interesting conversation he has ever had in a long time.\u201d Chimgozirim had a chat with Victoria Fabunmi, CcHUB\u2019s Head of Investment.\n\nInterestingly, Fabunmi, like many Nigerian students, was unsure of her career path despite studying accounting at the University of Lagos in Nigeria.\n\nYou can probably relate if you are or were a Nigerian student. But how did you decide on a career path? You can share with me. I mean, I don\u2019t bite. \ud83d\ude01\n\nFor Fabunmi, she was determined to make a difference. And one way she could do that was to venture into investment banking to help businesses bridge the financing gap.\n\nClearly, her undergraduate degree had an impact on her career choice.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019re wondering how to get started in venture capital; wonder no more! Irrespective of your background, you can get started. And Fabunmi gave some pointers on this.\n\nCheck them out here: How Victoria Fabunmi helps startup founders get capital to drive growth\n\nTalk360\u2019s $4 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk360, South Africa\u2019s international calling platform, had announced a $4 million seed round.\n\nHAVA\u00cdC led the round. 4Di Capital and some angel investors like Gaston Aussems, Robert Kraal, Gabriel de Montessuss, and Marnix van der Ploeg participated.\n\nIn 2016, Dean Hiine, Hans Osnabrugge, and Jorne Schamp launched the startup as a travelling app to avoid roaming fees. However, after social media apps like WhatsApp introduced Internet calls, the co-founders were forced to reconsider their model.\n\nNow, Talk360 is an African Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) provider that allows users to make international calls for a fee through its app.\n\nIt\u2019s quite different from a voice call on WhatsApp or Telegram, for instance. Only the person initiating the call requires the Talk360 app and an Internet-enabled smartphone.\n\nIn other words, the recipient doesn\u2019t need a smartphone or Internet access. Essentially, you can use it to reach your cousin who lives in a village where Internet penetration is low.\n\nTalk360 claims that it connected 2 million people in 2021. Besides, the startup relies on integrations with older payment service providers, which are severely limited by region.\n\nThe company wants to use some of its funding to build its own payment platform to make payment and checkout easier for its African users. According to Hiins, the platform will bring all of Africa\u2019s \u201cscattered payment methods\u201d onto a single platform.\n\nFurther, he believes that the product will provide businesses with access to Africa\u2019s largest pool of localised payment options.\n\nWhile the app is primarily used in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, the startup is looking to expand its international calling operations across Africa and build a hub in Kenya.\n\nAppetito acquires Lamma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppetito, Egypt\u2019s on-demand delivery startup, has acquired Lamma, a similar startup with operations in Tunisia and Morocco\u2019s Maghreb regions.\n\nLaunched by Shehab Mokhtar, Appetito delivers groceries and household products to customers from 11 dark stores across three cities in the North African country.\n\nIn 2020, Lamma was founded by Yassir El Ismaili El Idrissi, Hamza Guesmi, and Koussi Aymen as a carpooling service in Tunisia.\n\nSoon after that, the startup shifted to a quick commerce platform that delivers groceries, personal care, and fashion items to users in Tunisia and Morocco \u2014 which launched this year.\n\nWhat does this acquisition mean? The Lamma team, its three dark stores, and a distribution centre will be integrated into Appetito as the two companies \u201cexplore many synergies.\u201d Also, El Idrissi will join Appetito as CEO.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Appetito intends to become the leading on-demand delivery player in frontier and emerging markets.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nBinance has open roles in Communication, Business Development, Customer Support, Engineering, Marketing, Product, Customer support, and other departments.

We\u2019re making changes on our editorial team, revamping some existing series and starting new ones in some cases. We discussed this in addition to Ayoken\u2019s pre-seed funding and Swvl\u2019s employee layoffs.\n\nFor the series, Monday will see you reading How I Work from Samuel Okike, The Experts by Oluwanifemi Kolawole on Tuesday, while Emmanuel Paul and Chimgozirim Nwokoma bring you East Africa Weekly and Equity Merchants on Wednesday.\n\nBolu Abiodun will be writing People in Emerging Tech and you\u2019ll round up the week with Ogheneruemu Oneyibo\u2019s Everyday People.\n\nMoving on from this, we explored Ayoken\u2019s $1.4 million pre-seed. Ayoken is an NFT marketplace for creatives to increase their earnings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile transactions in other marketplaces are done with crypto, Ayoken is bringing mobile money to NFTs, but we spoke to NFT specialists, and they raised some interesting questions.\n\nHenry-Coco Bassey feels such a product is great for creatives as they could make more money from their art. Prodigeezy, who helps BNXN manage his NFT collection, shares the same opinion but points out that it is not yet mainstream, potentially impacting income for creatives.\n\nThe second story centred around Swvl\u2019s announcement that it was laying off 32% of its workforce. This is coming less than three months after the company went public through a SPAC.\n\nWhile the jury is still out on whether Swvl qualifies as an African company, this is the first layoff announced by an African company since the global downturn began. I pointed out that startups in Africa do not seem to be affected by the global downturn, but it may be too early to draw conclusions.\n\nWith Swvl pointing out that some of the roles they were laying off had been automated, it raises questions about how technology could contribute to rising unemployment in Africa.\n\nFor more on these stories, tune in to the Techpoint Africa Podcast on Spotify, Google Podcast, Apple Podcast, and any podcast platform you use.\n\nYou can also send feedback and questions to podcast@techpoint.africa or tweet using the hashtag #TechpointAfricaPodcast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain-based company, Vault Hill, has launched its NFT marketplace with the public sale of land in its human-centric metaverse, Vault Hill City (VHC). The ongoing sale is being held auction style using its native token, $VHC.\n\nAs part of the land sale, a free HTC VIVE Flow VR glasses will be given per parcel of land bought. However, to ensure scarcity and value, a limited number of virtual land (VLAND) parcels have been made available for purchase due to the high number already sold during the private sale round.\n\nLand parcels are currently being sold in the Vitality and Play districts of the metaverse, and using Vault Hill\u2019s interactive map, prospective land buyers and those who already participated in the private land sale can view which districts still have available VLAND. The map can also be used to explore the brands and creators that have already purchased land in the metaverse.\n\nThe VHC land parcels are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) built on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC-721) which are unique and distinct. The land has been grouped into four categories\u2013 standard, premium, deluxe and exclusive \u2013 each with their own unique offering.\n\nThe exclusive land type for instance can be merged to form a cluster of up to 8 land parcels, and it also has a courtyard in its center. Not only will Exclusive landowners benefit from a prime location, but owners of all 8 parcels that form a cluster have a unique advantage of monetising the courtyard to the limits of their imagination. Owners could erect a billboard in the courtyard, or even stadiums, conference centers, art installation, etc.\n\nOne of the many benefits of being a virtual land owner in VHC is that VHC is the first virtual world that combines all aspects of users\u2019 reality leveraging seven basic human instincts to enhance experiences in the metaverse. It is also the first virtual world with urban planning and development benefits to ensure users build on their virtual land respectfully.\n\nAdditionally, land owners will be given a \u2018NO CODE\u2019 builder tool which gives them total creative freedom to build their desired edifice without having to learn a single line of code. These edifices could range from cinemas, fitness studios, museums, libraries, event centers, etc. There are limitless opportunities for land owners in VHC be it individual investors or brands seeking to establish their presence in web3.\n\nVisit Vault Hill\u2019s marketplace now for your chance to own a piece of the world\u2019s first human-centric metaverse. Further information regarding the land sale can be found here and the metaverse development timeline can be viewed in the whitepaper. Updates can be gotten in real-time via the social pages \u2013 Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, Discord\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdaverse, a Cardano ecosystem accelerator established to foster the growth of crypto-native projects in Africa, today announced its investment into a seed funding round for Cassava Network, a blockchain infrastructure that empowers African content creators, developers, and end-users through mutually aligned tasks and incentives. Over 40 investors, including Dragonfly, CMT Digital, YGG, Mirana, etc., participated in the recently closed investment round to implement the next phase of Cassava platform development.\n\nAdaverse was launched in September 2021 as a joint venture partnership between EMURGO Africa and Everest Ventures, to identify and provide valuable support resources to promising African founders building the next wave of Web3 dApps in DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and metaverse tools on Cardano\u2019s third-generation and environmentally-sustainable blockchain.\n\nWhat is Cassava Network?\n\nCassava is a blockchain infrastructure that connects developers and users to the Web3 ecosystem. Through its native token CSV, Cassava transforms any web application into a crypto-enabled app suitable to reward contributors and end-users for their dedication. Their product offering consists of token rewards networks, digital identification systems, user-controlled data profiles, and a crypto and NFT wallet specifically designed to empower content creators.\n\nAs such, Cassava is a new incentives platform for Africans and the regional market, as CSV will enable projects, content creators including NFT artists, video creators, and content consumers to earn rewards in innovative ways through play-to-earn, create-to-earn, and engage-to-earn models. Additionally, it will offer CSV holders a portfolio of incentives, including lending, staking, AMM, and voting rights for platform governance.\n\nWhy Cassava Network?\n\nCassava offers a unique opportunity for African creatives to build digital economies, protect their intellectual properties and connect with the global market at large, through an easy-to-use multifunctional wallet that can be integrated with apps for user incentivization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cassava Network\u2019s PR Director, Kelin said \u201cCassava Network will use the investment capital to expand and improve its technological capabilities in order to leverage the Web3 economy to drive crypto mass adoption across Africa and beyond. The next phase of Cassava development will include a multi-chain wallet that incentivizes users, an African-focused NFT Marketplace, and a rewards system that pays users for transacting and using apps in Cassava\u2019s ecosystem. \u201d\n\nThe market opportunity in the African creative space is enormous. Africa has one of the youngest and fastest-growing populations, as well as the highest proportion of entrepreneurs among its working-class adults. Cassava is designed for the innovative youth seeking pan-African connectivity, and a global reach that will translate into sustainable, income-generating opportunities.\n\nWith regards to the global blockchain market, Africa alone is expected to possess a 30% market share and grow from a $1.1 billion market in 2020 to a $134.9 billion market by 2028.\n\n\u201cEMURGO Africa is excited to support the development of Cassava Network\u2019s innovative content rewards ecosystem. We firmly believe Africa is a huge market full of bright potential that can lead the way to spur large user growth and demonstrate the real benefits of a flourishing Web3 economy,\u201d said Shogo Ishida, Executive Director for the Middle East & Africa at EMURGO Africa.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited about this partnership, which will help fund the revolutionary DeFi tool, which enables mobile applications to migrate to web 3.0 functionality that rewards content creation and user engagement. We are inspired and driven by projects with a strong use case, a resilient founder, and a long term vision to bring change to socio-economic challenges in Africa\u201d said Vincent Li Founding Partner at Adaverse.\n\nAbout Adaverse\n\nAdaverse is a Cardano-focused joint accelerator initiative \u2014 set up with the collaboration of EMURGO Africa, a subsidiary of EMURGO, the official commercial arm of the Cardano protocol, and Everest Ventures Group, a leading blockchain industry accelerator \u2014 looking to build the infrastructure of the projected $139.4 billion African blockchain market by 2028. Since its inception in 2021, Adaverse has invested in strategic partnerships with six (6) result-driven, fast-rising startups across Africa and seeks to onboard more into the accelerator program.\n\nEMURGO Africa\u2019s mission is to promote Cardano as the technical platform standard in Africa by fostering the growth of 300 socially impactful African startups through seed funding and incubation.\n\nFor more information on Cassava Network, please visit www.cassava.network.\n\nTo apply for funding at Adaverse, visit www.adaverse.co\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

Ikomi and others made appearances for the Prosecution.\n\nAt the resumption of proceedings, Ikomi told the court that he had another application to be allowed to take evidence by oath to make for faster proceedings.\n\nThis application was vehemently opposed by the defence counsel, Chief Otomewo arguing that there was no provision for the use of Statement on Oath at the Magistrate\u2019s Court.\n\nCounsel to Prosecution informed court that the provisions of Section 255 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law, Delta State as well as the Evidence Act to which it refers allow it.\n\nAccording to the Prosecution counsel, the prosecution witness was on a security assignment and so could not appear in court and the matter was consequently adjourned for rulings as shown in the records of the court.\n\nFollowing the prosecution\u2019s submission, Otomewo said that, there were some lawyers whose names were not in the Fiat stressing that they always come to court because they had no job to do.\n\nAngered by Otomewo\u2019s comment, Chief Robinson Ariyo who is a Chief at the Palace of the Olu of Warri with traditional title of the \u201cEgogo (Mouthpiece) of Warri Kingdom warned Chief Otomewo never to make such insinuating remarks about him or he would receive an insult.\n\nIn a swift response, the Magistrate asked if Chief Ariyo had any case in the court and if not he should leave insisting that she would not recognize Ariyo as a Chief.\n\nResponding, Chief Ariyo informed the Court that he was one of the nominal complainants in the matter\n\nbeing a Chief in the Palace and the Council of Chiefs being the body that wrote the Petition.\n\nIt will be recall that ever since the matter commenced, the Magistrate had continued to target Chief Ariyo refusing to either call him a Chief or record him with the suffix Chief.\n\nIt is also on record that the Magistrate had never recorded Chief Ariyo as a Chief even though Chief Ariyo announces himself as such.\n\nAccording to the prosecution counsel, the refusal of Magistrate Diejomaoh to recognise Ariyo as a Chief while according Otomewo as a Chief was an indication that she was playing ethnic politics having served as a Lawyer under Chief Otomewo.\n\nThe Prosecution counsels, however, said that they had tried to distinguish between an objection arising from the lack of neutrality of a court and other forms of objection.\n\nAccording to them, this goes to the root of lack of fair haring arising from the developments and decisions in the case.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Justice Joe Acha represented by Justice Geraldine Ono Imadegbelo said violence against women, girls and children should be treated under the violence against persons prohibition (VAPP) Law. He called on all facets of the justice system to look into and correct the rationale for giving a life imprisonment to a single perpetrator of rape but handing over a twenty year imprisonment for those involved in gang rape which was a more grievous offence.\n\nThe DPP, Kingsley Odabi Esq while reeling out data at its resource stated that there was a geometric rise in the pattern of offense with cases of parents violating female children; adults and grandfathers violating children 3years old and less prevalent in society hence the recommendation to stop GBV through his call for a gender management system to be put in place; Liaising with legislature to enact laws passed; empowerment of women in all the Ministries, Department, and Agencies (MDA\u2019s); Getting Judges to buy into the FIDA campaigns and endorse such; Development on the education curriculum to focus on raised lapses to effect corrections.\n\nEarlier in her welcome address to stakeholders, legal luminaries and representatives of organizations, CSO\u2019s, NGO\u2019s and the media at the FIDA occasion, Chairperson Edo FIDA, Mrs. Violet Oghogho Olumese stated that apart from counselling and rendering Pro bono services to indigents, FIDA was poised to change the narrative in incidents of GBV through reliance on the VAPP Law as domesticated in Edo State in 2021. She urged stakeholders to ventilate and come up with solutions which could help at curbing the Hydra headed monster ravaging society,\n\nIn her keynote address,\u201d Changing the narrative of gender based violence, multimedia approach, \u201d former FIDA Chairperson and Permanent Secretary (PS) Ministry of Art and Culture, Iryn Omorogiuwa quoting world statistics on GBV stated that every minute one out of three women gets abused. She said this was accompanied by other forms of dehumanization and a lack of respect for the women folks especially on issues relating to traditional practices and human trafficking in which women are the main culprits who violate the rights of other women.\n\nApart from cyber bullying which she frowned at for its ability to tilt victims over the edge leading to suicide, she also mentioned family laws governing inheritance which she observed sent wrong signals which engendered violence and harassment hence the call to participants to look beyond the justice sector by making personal efforts to change perception through restoring, reintegrating victims of GBV in society and creating a zero violence state.\n\nShe therefore called for the regulation and control of money in circulation, empowerment of youths and prescription of maximum punishment for perpetrators of GBV, also, blowing the cover of perpetrators from the point of arrest to conviction to serve as deterrent to others.\n\nProfessor Evelyn Uwa Edosomwan presented the paper on, \u201cResolving the concept of feminism and gender equality in contemporary Nigeria while Professor Job Okhioma Odion presented the paper, \u201d An assessment of the legal framework for engendering women participation in politics in Nigeria which was closely followed by discussion segments and a robust question and answer session.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Sarabia slid the ball across to give Morata a simple finish.\n\nCarlos Soler should have made it two before half-time after a clever pass down the line sent Gavi clear and his pull-back found the arriving Soler, whose first shot was saved by Diogo Costa while his second flew over the bar.\n\nPortugal\u2019s best chance came early in the second half as Andre Silva did well to free Rafael Leao on the left side of the penalty area but Unai Simon denied the striker with his legs.\n\nSpain were in sight of victory until Cancelo made amends for his earlier error in the 82nd minute, exchanging a neat one-two with Goncalo Guedes down the right before firing a cross into Horta, who was all alone and made no mistake.",

If Governor Dapo Abiodun seated here will be faithful to his God, I want to emphatically state that he couldn\u2019t have become the governor without me. Even President Buhari wouldn\u2019t have won that presidential election in 2015 after three unsuccessful attempts without my support\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince President Buhari assumed office, I have not accepted any ministerial or Ambassadorial position. But now, it is my turn. My protection for these political sons and daughters is enough. I don\u2019t want to be part of a sad political history in Nigeria. I am here to solicit for your votes. May God not turn you from being delegates to delicates. Don\u2019t make it a family affairs o,\u201d Tinubu admonished the delegates.",

Customs HC Project Limited was expected to last for 36 months, to enhance the agency\u2019s mode of operation using the application of information and technology in all aspects of its administration.\n\n\u201cThe main objective of this project is to completely automate every aspect of the customs business and to institutionalize the use of smart and emerging technologies that will enhanced the statutory function of the Nigerian Customs Service in the areas of revenue generation as well as trade facilitation and enhancement of security,\u201d the Minister of Finance and Budget Planning, Zainab Ahmed, had told State House Correspondents shortly after the meeting in 2020.\n\nAhmed had explained that was to be financed by sponsors \u201cwho will in return look over the investment in the concessionary period of 20 years\u201d while it has the potential to generate up to $176 billion for the country.\n\n\u201cSo this investment of $3.1 billion is broken down into capital investment of $1.2 million which will be done in three phases over 36 months by these investors and $1.1 million is our projection of the operational cost over the 20-year period of the implementation of this project.\n\n\u201cThis project has the potential to yield up to $176 billion of revenue for the project and the consortia that are providing this investment are going to be paid over time according to the schedule that is negotiated for their investments including their profits and cost,\u201d she had said.\n\nAsked to explain the rationale behind a new e-Customs concession agreement between the NCS, Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) and China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Limited, Ahmed said: \u201cThe E-customs project was approved by Council. And there were some challenges that had to do with disagreements between the concession partners. Remember that the government was not a partner of the concession; it was a group of different investing parties that came together and formed the consortium.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney General and Minister of Justice have intervened. There were several meetings to try to iron out the difference. So it has to do with shareholders, who has what responsibility.

Our Human Resource Manager is Nigerian; our Office Manager is a Nigerian and our Shift Leader also is a Nigerian.\n\n\u201cThese are top management positions. We train Nigerians to run the company; we are transferring technology to those who are brilliant. Today you may see some Chinese but next time you come you won\u2019t see Chinese, you will only see Nigerians here.\n\n\u201cWe want to share. Not like other foreign companies where all the top management staff are foreigners and Nigerians left to do the labour work. We have moved beyond that.\n\n\u201cWe have to treat Nigerians who have the desire to work with our company well and encourage them to build a career. We have administrators, we have technicians, we have general labour, we have managers and we have shift leaders.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning, later we will give them more platforms, maybe one day when we have branches in Kano, ECOWAS countries like Cameroun; we can send Nigerians there to be Directors. This is what we do. We grow together for a shared future. Right now, we have up to 150 staff but less than 20 are Chinese, the others are Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSo for this factory, we are not only like a factory or company, we are also like a university. We sum it as a work chance or skill platform for local persons. We can train people. In a year, we can train a number of people that would contribute to the building of this great country.\n\n\u201cWe can increase our company\u2019s presence in Nigeria because we can source all our raw materials in Nigeria. And also we can make analysis for Nigeria building material markets. So, this product is new material but it has more advantages and so we have confidence. At the end of this year I am sure we will see good results.\n\n\u201cLet me add that the first person to come to Nigeria from our company didn\u2019t know what Fiber Cement Board was, but now we all know and we all love the product. I have confidence in Nigeria. As Eric, the Deputy Managing Director said, we want to work with universities to do some research about our product. We can share the platform for people to learn more in Universities and Polytechnics; we can share knowledge\u201d, Mr. Jackie added.\n\nOn Corporate Social Responsibility, he said the company has built roads for the host communities, built boreholes to help them have access to clean water; and rehabilitated some schools and roofing sheets for some of their buildings.",

          "text": "Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) remains determined to rescue Nigeria from the throes of bad leadership.\n\nMakinde, who stated that the party has demonstrated its readiness to make the right decisions for its Operation Rescue Nigeria mandate by going ahead with its National Convention despite the decision by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to extend a process that had already begun, added that the PDP showed readiness to lead by organising a rancour-free convention.\n\nA statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Taiwo Adisa, indicated that the governor stated these in his weekly newsletter.\n\nHe congratulated the winner of the PDP presidential primaries, former Vice-President Abubakar Atiku, on his victory at the primaries, noting that the result of the primaries was \u201cthe will of the majority, which is what democracy is all about.\u201d\n\nMakinde, who supported Atiku\u2019s closest challenger in the presidential primaries, Rivers State Governor, Barr. Nyesom Wike, said \u201cwe will play our part to ensure that the PDP\u2019s Operation Rescue Nigeria is a resounding success.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cAs you already know, we had the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) primaries in which we again demonstrated two things to Nigerians:\n\n\u201cOne, that the PDP is serious about ensuring that we make the right decisions for Operation Rescue Nigeria. For the PDP to have gone ahead to conduct its primaries even though the umpire, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), decided to change the rules in the middle of the game shows that we are a truly formidable force to reckon with. The weaker party had to wait for the results of the PDP convention before they made their move.\n\n\u201cTwo, that the PDP stands head and shoulders above the rest in coordinating primaries at the state and national levels. Almost all results are in, and we had rancour-free deliberations. \u201cSo, those who tell you that the PDP and the All Progressives Congress (APC) are the same are not being honest.\n\n\u201cWe all saw and watched the primaries play out, and a winner emerged. The result was the will of the majority, which is what democracy is all about.\n\n\u201cLet me then take this opportunity to once again congratulate our party\u2019s flagbearer, HE Atiku Abubakar, for his victory in the primaries. We will play our part to ensure that the PDP\u2019s Operation Rescue Nigeria is a resounding success.\u201d\n\nGovernor Makinde, who on Wednesday, embarked on a tour of the ongoing Ibadan Circular Road and the 500,000 Litres Aviation Fuel depot at the Ibadan Airport, said his administration is determined to deliver the two projects to Oyo State residents.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn a governance note, we visited the Ibadan Circular Road project yesterday and assessed the impact it would have on the ongoing Ajoda New Town Estate. From our assessment, a few of the constructed houses will be affected, and we are having conversations with the contractors about how to navigate the disruption.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to deliver the Ibadan Circular Road project to our people, and Craneburg Construction Company has already started work on the bridges and interchanges.\n\n\u201cLet me end this newsletter by saying that if you want to come into politics and make a change in the system, the time to do that is now. \u201cJoin a political party and be part of the process of building the structure. 2027 is not as far away as you may think,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "The U.S. and Germany pledged Wednesday to equip Ukraine with some of the advanced weapons it has long desired for shooting down aircraft and knocking out artillery, as Russian forces closed in on capturing a key city in the east.\n\nGermany said it will supply Ukraine with up-to-date anti-aircraft missiles and radar systems, while the U.S. announced it will provide four sophisticated, medium-range rocket systems and ammunition.\n\nThe U.S. is trying to help Ukraine fend off the Russians without triggering a wider war in Europe. The Pentagon said it received assurances that Ukraine will not fire the new rockets into Russian territory.\n\nThe Kremlin accused the U.S. of \u201cpouring fuel on the fire.\u201d\n\nWestern arms have been critical to Ukraine\u2019s success in stymieing Russia\u2019s much larger and better-equipped military, thwarting its effort to storm the capital and forcing Moscow to shift its focus to the industrial Donbas region in the east.\n\nBut as Russia bombards towns in its inching advance in the east, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly pleaded for more and better weapons and accused the West of moving too slowly.\n\nAndriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president\u2019s office, hailed the new Western weapons.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that if we receive all the necessary weapons and strengthen the efficient sanctions regime we will win,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new arms could help Ukraine set up and hold new lines of defense in the east by hitting back at Russian artillery pieces that have been battering towns and cities and by limiting Russian airstrikes, said retired French Gen. Dominique Trinquand, a former head of France\u2019s military mission at the United Nations.\n\n\u201cThe NATO countries \u2014 the European nations and the Americans \u2014 have progressively escalated the means that they are putting at Ukraine\u2019s disposal, and this escalation, in my opinion, has had the aim of testing Russian limits,\u201d he said. \u201cEach time, they measure the Russian reaction, and since there is no reaction, they keep supplying increasingly effective and sophisticated weaponry.\u201d\n\nMilitary analysts say Russia is hoping to overrun the Donbas before any weapons that might turn the tide arrive. It will take at least three weeks to get the precision U.S. weapons and trained troops onto the battlefield, the Pentagon said. But Defense Undersecretary Colin Kahl said he believes they will arrive in time to make a difference in the fight.\n\nThe rocket systems are part of a new $700 million package of security assistance for Ukraine from the U.S. that also includes helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, radars, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more.\n\nThe rockets have a range of about 50 miles (80 kilometers) and are highly mobile. Ukraine had pushed unsuccessfully for rockets with a range of up to 186 miles (300 kilometers).\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow does not trust assurances that Ukraine will not fire on Russian territory. \u201cWe believe that the U.S. is deliberately and diligently pouring fuel on the fire,\u201d he said.\n\nCol. Gen. Mikhail Mizintzev later went further, directly accusing Ukraine of planning to fire U.S.-provided missiles from the northeastern Sumy region at border areas in Russia. The claim, which he said was based on radio intercepts, couldn\u2019t be independently confirmed.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Ukraine\u2019s push for more weapons is a \u201cdirect provocation intended to draw the West into the fighting.\u201d He warned that the multiple rocket launchers would raise the risk of an expanded conflict.\n\n\u201cSane Western politicians understand those risks well,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the new weapons shipments were announced, a Russian missile hit rail lines in the western Lviv region, a key conduit for supplies of Western weapons and other supplies, officials said. Regional Gov. Maksym Kozytskyy said five people were wounded in Wednesday\u2019s strike, and the head of Ukrainian railways said the damage was still being assessed.\n\nGermany\u2019s promise of IRIS-T air defense systems would mark the first delivery of long-range air defense weapons to Ukraine since the start of the war. Earlier deliveries of portable, shoulder-fired air defense missiles have bolstered the Ukrainian military\u2019s ability to take down helicopters and other low-flying aircraft but didn\u2019t give it enough range to challenge Russia\u2019s air superiority.\n\nGermany has come under particular criticism, both at home and from allies abroad, that it isn\u2019t doing enough. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told lawmakers that the IRIS-T\u2019s surface-to-air missiles are the most modern air defense system the country has.\n\n\u201cWith this, we will enable Ukraine to defend an entire city from Russian air attacks,\u201d he said. The radar systems will also help Ukraine locate enemy artillery.\n\nA regional governor said Russian forces now control 80% of Sievierodonetsk, a city that is key to Moscow\u2019s efforts to complete its capture of the Donbas, where Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists have fought for years and where the separatists held swaths of territory even before the invasion.\n\nLuhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said Russian troops were advancing in the city during fierce street battles with Ukrainian forces, though he noted that in some districts the Ukrainian troops managed to push them back.\n\nThe only other city in Luhansk that the Russians have not yet captured, Lysychansk, is still fully under Ukrainian control, he said, but is likely to be the next target. The two cities are separated by a river.\n\n\u201cIf the Russians manage to take full control over Sievierodonetsk within two to three days, they will start installing artillery and mortars and will shell Lysychansk more intensively,\u201d Haidai said.\n\nZelenskyy, meanwhile, said the country is losing between 60 and 100 soldiers a day in the fighting.\n\nHe turned the focus to children in his nightly video address, saying 243 of them have been killed in the war, 446 have been wounded and 139 are missing. The real numbers could be higher, he added, as his government doesn\u2019t have a full picture of areas under Russian occupation.\n\nZelenskyy also said 200,000 children are among the Ukrainians who have been forcefully taken to Russia and dispersed across that vast country: \u201cThe purpose of this criminal policy is not just to steal people but to make those who are deported forget about Ukraine and unable to return.\u201d\n\nIn southern Ukraine, a regional governor sounded a more positive note, saying Russian troops were retreating and blowing up bridges behind them.\n\n\u201cThey are afraid of a counterattack by the Ukrainian army,\u201d Vitaliy Kim, governor of the Mykolayiv region, said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nAP",

          "text": "Argentina marked the revival of the Cup of Champions in style as they outclassed Italy 3-0 in a heavyweight clash billed as the \u201cFinalissima\u201d at a raucous Wembley Stadium on Wednesday.\n\nFirst-half goals by Lautaro Martinez and Angel Di Maria put the south American champions in complete control against an Italy side who were back at Wembley 11 months after beating England to win the delayed Euro 2020.\n\nWith thousands of their supporters in the 87,000 crowd determined to turn northwest London into Buenos Aires for the night, an Argentina side including Lionel Messi was simply too quick and slick for the lumbering Azzurri.\n\n\u201cIt was a beautiful final, full of Argentinians. What we\u2019ve experienced here was beautiful. We knew it was going to be an attractive game and a nice setting to be champion,\u201d Messi said after the match. \u201cWe can compete against anyone. Today it was a good test because Italy is a great team.\u201d\n\nMartinez tapped home from close range in the 28th minute from Messi\u2019s low cross to reward Argentina\u2019s early dominance.\n\n\u201cThis is priceless. We are extremely happy for how things are going, for our play and for what this group is,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThere are still several months to go before the World Cup and we know we need to correct certain things.\u201d\n\nInter Milan\u2019s Martinez then slid a pass through for Di Maria to double the lead with a dinked finish on the stroke of half-time to send the South American fans into raptures.\n\nArgentina could have scored plenty more after the break with Messi pulling the strings and Italy keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma sparing his side a drubbing.\n\nSubstitute Paulo Dybala underlined Argentina\u2019s superiority with a drilled low finish in stoppage time.\n\nIt was a disappointing end to Italy stalwart defender Giorgio Chiellini\u2019s international career as the 37-year-old was substituted at half-time on his 117th and final appearance.\n\nThe Finalissima is the revival of the CONMEBOL-UEFA Cup of Champions that has been played only twice before, in 1985 and 1993.\n\nMessi, who lit up the evening with a series of trademark dribbles, was hoisted into the air by his team mates who danced jigs of joy on the lush Wembley turf.\n\nArgentina, who ended a 28-year wait for a trophy by beating Brazil to win the 2021 Copa America, produced a display that augurs well for their hopes at the Qatar World Cup this year, extending their unbeaten run to 32 games.\n\n\u201cEverything changed since we won the Copa America,\u201d Di Maria said. \u201cWe got rid of that weight and now we are enjoying playing, having a good time and things are much easier for us. We are enthusiastic, but we must always keep our feet on the ground.\u201d\n\nFor Italy, it was a sobering reminder of just how quickly fortunes can change in football.\n\nLast July, Roberto Mancini\u2019s team were euphoric after a penalty shootout win over England to win the European Championship, but have since suffered the humiliation of failing to qualify for the World Cup for the second successive tournament after losing in a playoff to North Macedonia.\n\nIn the build-up Mancini described game as the \u201cend of a cycle\u201d and the defeat left him in no doubt as to how much work is required to revive Italy\u2019s fortunes.\n\n\u201cThey were better than us. We were in the game in the first half but didn\u2019t do enough to turn it around after the break,\u201d Mancini said.\n\nESPN",

          "text": "A man armed with a rifle and a handgun killed four people inside a medical building in Tulsa, Oklahoma on Wednesday before fatally shooting himself, police said, in the latest of a series of mass shootings to rattle the United States.\n\nEyewitness video of first responders arriving at the St. Francis Hospital campus showed a police officer immediately pulling a high powered rifle from the boot of his car. Armed police then ran towards the medical centre.\n\nPolice arrived at the medical center three minutes after receiving a call about the shooting on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nPolice then followed the sound of gunfire up to the Natalie Building\u2019s second floor, Tulsa deputy police chief Eric Dalgleish told reporters.\n\nThe officers made contact with the victims and the suspect five minutes later, Dalgleish said.\n\nPolice responses have come under increased scrutiny after a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers in a Texas school classroom last week while officers waited outside for nearly an hour.\n\nAsked by reporters whether police had refreshed training or thinking about active shooters after the Uvalde, Texas school shooting, Dalgleish said: \u201cI think that\u2019s probably fresh on everyone\u2019s minds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will say Tulsa revisits that topic regularly. I was very happy with what we know so far regarding the response of our officers,\u201d Dalgleish said.\n\nWednesday\u2019s incident in Tulsa came on the heels of mass shootings that have re-ignited debates about gun control. Two weeks before the Uvalde shooting, a white gunman killed 10 people at a supermarket in a Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York.\n\nPolice in Tulsa said they were trying to determine the suspect\u2019s identity, who they estimated was aged between 35 and 40, and had no details yet on his motive.\n\nThe Natalie Building contains doctors\u2019 offices including an orthopedic center, Dalgleish said, adding he believed the victims included employees and patients.\n\nThe White House said President Joe Biden had been briefed on the shooting and offered support to state and local officials in Tulsa, a city of some 411,000 people that sits around 100 miles (160 km) northeast of the capital Oklahoma City.\n\nReuters",
