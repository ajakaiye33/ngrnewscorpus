          "text": "The Federal Government is to accelerate action on the construction of a royal palace museum where the Benin bronze artefacts that were repatriated from Germany would be kept.\n\nThe Director-General, National Commission for Museums and Monuments, Prof. Abba Tijani, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Tuesday in Ibadan.\n\nArtefacts worth \u00a32.5 million have been handed over to the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, by President Muhammadu Buhari, 125 years after they were looted by British troops during the invasion of Benin Kingdom.\n\nThe returned artefacts, comprising of a cockerel (okpa) and an Oba head (Uhunwun Elao), were repatriated from Cambridge University, Jesus College, and University of Aberdeen, Scotland, respectively.\n\nThey were handed over to the traditional ruler by the Nigerian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Tunji Ishola, on behalf of the President.\n\nTijani said, \u201cWe need the cooperation and involvement of all stakeholders in promoting the return of more artefacts.\n\n\u201cWe need to build a solid structure on ground, especially in Abuja and Benin City for the artefacts to survive when they are brought in.\n\n\u201cEveryone especially the youths should be encouraged to visit museums to see our past and understand our culture which also determines who we really are.\n\n\u201cMany social vices going on now are due to lack of understanding of our culture and history,\u201d he said.\n\nTijjani said the country took possession of the artefacts in 2021 but could not bring it home then due to lack of export permits.\n\nHe added that since then, arrangements were made with Benin on ways to get export permits to return the artefacts to the country.\n\n\u201cIt is a great achievement for the country and the Benin Kingdom to regain the stolen artefacts after 125 years.\n\n\u201cAlso, at some point in time, the artefacts which are of cultural importance will be displayed for all Nigerians and foreigners to see them in their rightful places.\n\n\u201cThis will attract more tourists to the country and definitely boost tourism,\u201d he said.\n\nThe federal government has been making arrangements on ways to return thousands of other artefacts looted from the country.\n\n\u201cWe have no fewer than 5,000 Benin Bronzes scattered all over the world.\n\n\u201cWe are able to negotiate with the German government and agreed to repatriate no fewer than 1,000 artefacts from Germany.\n\n\u201cAlso plans are on to return many other artefacts from Washington, Cambridge, Oxford University and other countries, we are going to sign the agreement within one month or two, so that we can start getting the artefacts back,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged individuals, relevant tourism agencies and private sectors to cooperate with the commission and federal government to make this goal of returning all artefacts a reality.\n\nPresident Buhari on Monday commended the NCMM for collaborative works that led to the repatriation of these artefacts.\n\nThe President said it is noteworthy that several others are currently in the process of being returned while discussions are ongoing to repatriate many more.\n\nPresident Buhari recounted that the artefacts now returned to the Oba of Benin were taken away by British soldiers in 1897 when they attacked the ancient Benin Kingdom and took thousands of artefacts away.\n\n\u201dThese artefacts are part of the records of the history of the Benin people.\n\n\u201dMy directive to return these artefacts to the Oba of Benin marks the beginning of another aspect in the highly valued relationship between the Federal Government of Nigeria and our traditional institutions who are indeed the true custodians of our history, customs and traditions.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "\u2022Says 1,130 Benin bronzes due back from Germany this year\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has appealed to countries, institutions, and bodies, both private and public, to return Nigeria\u2019s artefacts in their possession. Buhari also disclosed that 1,130 Benin bronzes would be returned to Nigeria by the German government before the end of this year.\n\nReacting to the recent return of two important Nigerian artefacts from Britain, the president, in a statement yesterday by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, welcomed the official handover, on Saturday, of the Okwukor and the Head of an Oba of Benin Bronzes, to the Oba of Benin, His Royal Highness, Oba Ewuare II. The artefacts were repatriated from the University of Cambridge and University of Aberdeen, respectively, in the United Kingdom, after 125 years of their leaving the territory of present day Nigeria.\n\nIn a passionate plea for return of the objects, which form a significant part of the country\u2019s rich cultural heritage, Buhari recalled that the artefacts, now returned to the Oba of Benin, were taken away by British soldiers in 1897, when they attacked the ancient Benin Kingdom and took thousands of items away.\n\nAccording to the president, \u201cThese artefacts are part of the records of the history of the Benin people. My directive to return these artefacts to the Oba of Benin marks the beginning of another aspect in the highly valued relationship between the federal government of Nigeria and our traditional institutions who are, indeed, the true custodians of our history, customs, and traditions.\n\n\u201cThis directive is also significant because it will introduce a working relationship between the federal government, as represented by the NCMM, and the traditional institutions whereby this commission negotiates the release of antiquities from foreign museums and institutions on behalf of Nigeria and the traditional institutions that lost the antiquities and jointly they all take steps to ensure the valourisation of Nigerian and Nigerian people through these great arts and cultural emblems.\u201d\n\nWhile urging other countries to take a cue from the institutions, the president vowed that the federal government would pursue the repatriation of Nigerian artefacts vigorously. He pledged that government would ensure that they were put to good and proper use on their return in museums and other facilities in conjunction with the royal families and kingdoms that lost these artefacts.\n\nThe president noted that in line with international law and practice, export, import, and control over antiquities were matters within the purview of national governments, to be exercised on behalf of sub-national authorities, institutions and bodies. He thanked the government of the United Kingdom that facilitated the return of the artefacts by issuing the prerequisite Export Permits to Nigeria at no cost, as well as the University of Cambridge and the University of Aberdeen who agreed to return these artefacts to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThese are unprecedented moves worth emulating by others,\u201d he said, adding that the federal government hopes to work hand in hand with the British authorities in the future to encourage the return of more Nigerian artefacts from the United Kingdom.\n\nBuhari also appreciated the Federal Republic of Germany, which was planning the process of repatriating 1,130 Benin bronzes to Nigeria this year from many of Germany\u2019s public museums.\n\nHe also commended the High Commissioner of Nigeria to the United Kingdom, Sarafa Ishola, and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) for their collaborative works that led to the repatriation of the artefacts. According to him, it is noteworthy that several others are currently in the process of being returned while discussions are on-going to repatriate many more.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

This was contained in a leaked letter to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), referenced APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/22/21, which the ruling party said superseded its earlier national convention notice.\n\nThe latest notice also replaced an earlier letter to INEC informing it of APC\u2019s decision to hold its zonal congresses on March 26.\n\nBut the party was silent on the zoning of offices, a major concern for stakeholders, which was believed to have contributed to the seeming dithering over the convention.\n\nA former Director General of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukman, alleged that the chairman of APC\u2019s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni; his Kogi State counterpart, Yahaya Bello; Governor of Imo State Hope Uzodinma; and Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State were the ones frustrating the national convention plan.\n\nAPC had in an earlier letter, with reference number APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/22/14, notified INEC of its decision to hold its national convention on February 26. But the party said its latest notice followed an evaluation of its constitution.\n\nIt stated in the leaked letter, \u201cIn furtherance to Article 85 of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended) and compliance with Section 12:6 of our party constitution, we hereby write to notify the commission that our great party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), has scheduled to hold its zonal congresses on Saturday, 26th March, 2022.\n\n\u201cKindly arrange for your officials to monitor the exercise accordingly. While hoping to receive your cooperation, please accept the assurances of our highest esteem.\u201d\n\nNational Secretary of APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, told journalists yesterday at the national secretariat of the party in Abuja that the publication of national convention sub-committees would take on Monday, February 28.\n\nAkpanudoedehe, who spoke at the end of a four-hour meeting of the caretaker committee, said, \u201cWe have agreed and approved that activities for the party\u2019s national convention will commence from February 24 and terminate on March 26 at Eagle Square with the national convention. In between the convention, we have agreed to have zonal congresses, and all the activities are hereby given as approved by the CECPC.\u201d\n\nThe schedule of activities released by the party showed that the sale of forms would take place between March 9 and 11, while the screening of aspirants would happen between March 15 and 17. The screening appeal would hold on March 19, while the adoption of the appeal report would be held on Monday, March 21, according to the schedule.\n\nThe party said accreditation for the national convention would be held between March 24 and 25, while the convention would be on Saturday, March 26, and convention appeal would take place on Tuesday, March 29.\n\nThe adoption of appeal report would take place on Wednesday, March 30, while the inauguration of the party executive would hold on Thursday, March 31.\n\nAccording to the schedule of activities for the zonal congresses, the publication of zonal committees would take place on February 24, while a meeting of zonal stakeholders is scheduled for February 26.\n\nThe party added that the sale of forms for zonal positions would commence on February 28 and end on March 3. It scheduled the screening of zonal aspirants for March 5, and screening appeal for March 6.\n\nThe adoption of the screening report is slated for March 8, while zonal congresses would be held on Saturday, March 12, and the zonal congresses appeal would take place on March 14.\n\nThe adoption of appeal report is scheduled for March 16.\n\nHowever, Lukman, in a statement yesterday, titled, \u201cAPC Convention: Mutiny by Yahoo Yahoo Politicians,\u201d alleged that the party was held captive by a small group of dishonest politicians whose only interest was to impose themselves as either presidential or vice-presidential candidates for the 2023 elections.\n\nThe former APC governors\u2019 forum director-general said the caretaker committee saddled mainly with the responsibility of organising the national convention to elect new leaders of the party had reduced the majority of its members to mere observers. He said even PGF was being disrespected, as the decisions and leadership of the governor\u2019s body were being snubbed.\n\nLukman said in the statement, \u201cHis Excellency Mai Mala Buni, in flagrant disregard to every known procedure of managing affairs of the party, relate only with His Excellency, Yahaya Bello of Kogi State; His Excellency, Hope Uzodinma of Imo State; and His Excellency, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, based on the plot to retain His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni as Chairman of the party up to the time of conducting the primary that will produce candidates for 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cThe other person, who is also active in this political ponzi scheme, is the CECPC Secretary, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, who is also aspiring to emerge as the Akwa Ibom governorship candidate of the APC for 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nLukman alleged that Abiodun, Buni, Bello, and Uzodinma were all aspiring to become either presidential or vice-presidential candidates.\n\nHe added, \u201cAlthough His Excellency Mai Mala Buni is not open about his ambition, some of the speculation promoted by people very close to him is that once he is the one to organise the primary to produce candidates for 2023 elections, he stands a good chance to emerge as the vice-presidential candidate, or even the presidential candidate, if the North is to produce the presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Uzodinma, Lukman claimed the governor was alleged to be aspiring to emerge as vice-presidential candidate to a northern candidate, saying Bello has declared his aspiration to emerge as the 2023 presidential candidate of the party.\n\nHe explained that Abiodun was being guaranteed a second term ticket to emerge the Ogun State governorship candidate for the 2023 election, which was to block any potential contestant, given the strong opposition he faced from former Governor Ibikunle Amosun in 2019.\n\nLukman stressed that beyond guaranteeing Abiodun second term ticket, Buni had attempted to make similar offers to all first term governors of APC, adding that some of the stories flying around are true scripts being acted by Buni and his associates.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt is clear that Mai Mala Buni is opposed to organising the APC national convention on February 26, 2022 or any time soon. Consequently, he is working with other dishonest leaders, notably, Yahaya Bello, Hope Uzodinma, Dapo Abiodun, and a few others.\n\n\u201cIt is a mutiny against the authority of the party and all its designated leaders, especially, President Buhari, being carried by very dishonest people, who can best be described as Yahoo Yahoo politicians. They are busy recruiting more dishonest and questionable leaders, such as Uzor Kalu, and they are moving to recruit some state party leaders into their fold.\n\n\u201cAs a party, APC is now in a state of emergency. Any slip will destroy the party. This is not the period to allow dishonest political leaders gamble with the survival of the party and by extension weaken the nation\u2019s democracy. Everything must be done to restore some minimum standards of conducts by leaders at all levels.\n\n\u201cEverything must be done to rescue APC from the hands of these Yahoo Yahoo politicians represented by Mai Mala Buni, Yahaya Bello, Hope Uzodinma, Dapo Abiodun, Uzor Kalu, and their associates.\u201d\n\nReacting to the developments, a chairmanship aspirant of the party, Mr. Sunny Monidafe, said he had no choice but to accept the decision of the party. Monidafe said, \u201cSo long as the party leadership carries all the critical stakeholders along, I don\u2019t have any objections.\u201d\n\nBut a group in the party, APC Rebirth group, faulted the decision to conduct the zonal congresses, saying it is alien to the party\u2019s constitution. The group, led Aliyu Audu, said the decision was part of a calculated attempt by the Buni-led caretaker committee to elongate its tenure in office, adding, \u201cIt is a clear case of abuse of power and blatant reign of impunity. Buni will stop at nothing until he ruins the party.\u201d\n\nConvention: We\u2019re Not Talking Till After Meeting With Buhari, Say APC Governors\n\nThe Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), has said that it would not comment on the timetable for the national convention and zonal congresses released by the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) until it had met with President Muhammadu Buhari today.\n\nChairman of the Forum and the Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, stated this while addressing journalists yesterday in Abuja.\n\n\u201cUntil we finish with Mr. President, we would rather not comment on any time table or any logistics,\u201d said Bagudu, when asked about the time-table for the convention and zonal congresses.\n\nAccording to him, the Forum met to discuss developments in the states and review the election that took place in the FCT, Osun primary, the court judgment that dissolved the Kano Congress and the preparation for the national convention, where it received briefing from the Caretaker Chairman, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nspeaking on the allegation that the APC governors were the ones frustrating the convention from holding, the Kebbi governor said, \u201cWe appreciate that Nigerians are interested in what the APC is doing, because Nigerians gave us their mandate by electing us into offices and holding us to a high standard and we are very conscious of that.\n\nHis words: \u201cAll the APC governors have met and as always, appreciated the need to work together with other stakeholders. We have always been humble to acknowledge that we are not only stakeholders of the party. To work with other stakeholders and to ensure we deliver transparent, honest national executives that will have the confidence of all party members.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Returns \u00a3210,000 illegal payment\n\nMichael Olugbode\n\n\n\nThe United Kingdom has injected \u00a310 million into Nigeria\u2019s low carbon energy project. The concessional aid is aimed at reducing the risks, for pension and insurance funds\u2019 to invest in energy access projects, and support Nigeria\u2019s COP26 commitments.\n\nUK also signed an agreement with the Nigerian government that would enable a compensation of \u00a3210,610 to the country following a successful investigation by the British Serious Fraud Office on the use of corrupt agents in the oil and gas sector.\n\nThe governments of Nigeria, United Kingdom of Great Britain, and Northern Ireland, yesterday, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in a joint commitment to continue the fight against corruption.\n\nThe MoU was signed between UK\u2019s Minister for Africa, Vicky Ford, and the Attorney General of the Federal and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, who was represented by Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Justice, Mohammed Umar. It sets out the terms and understanding between the governments of the United Kingdom and Nigeria to make the compensation payment.\n\nDuring the signing of the MoU, Ford said, \u201cThe Security and Defence Dialogue held in February 2022 between our two countries reaffirmed both the UK and Nigeria\u2019s commitment to work together to tackle illicit financial flows, bribery, and corruption.\n\n\u201cThe UK has a zero tolerance policy to corruption and we hope that today\u2019s signing sends a clear statement about our commitment to this.\u201d\n\nShe noted that in a global economy where international trade was vital, it was more important than ever that companies operate with integrity and transparency.\n\nIllicit financial flows, bribery, and corruption have been identified as major hindrances to economic growth, trade, stable governance, and the security of both countries.\n\nThe compensation payment from the UK to Nigeria was secured after a four-year corruption investigation led by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in the UK. The money was obtained through a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA), which meant the prosecutor agreed to defer prosecution in exchange for the defendant agreeing to fulfil certain requirements, such as accepting criminal liability for offences and paying the appropriate compensation.\n\nIn this case, the DPA was agreed with Amec Foster Wheeler (AFWEL), in relation to the use of corrupt agents in the oil and gas sector.\n\nThe compensation payment demonstrated that when such crimes were identified, the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) would investigate the companies and, where evidence was found, ensure that they faced appropriate sanctions.\n\nIn March 2021, the UK government returned \u00a34.2 million to Nigeria from funds recovered from associates of former Delta State Governor James Ibori.\n\nHowever, in this case, \u201cThe Government of the United Kingdom will transfer the compensation amount in the sum of \u00a3210,610 (118.4 million Naira) within twenty-eight (28) days from the date of signing this MOU.\n\n\u201cIn both instances, the MoU\u2019s confirm that the Nigerian government has pledged to use the returned funds for projects that will benefit and improve the country.\n\n\u201cThe UK will remain committed to returning all illegal assets, no matter the amount, as per the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC).\u201d\n\nUK\u2019s Director of the Serious Fraud Office, Lisa Osofsky said, \u201cWe have a zero tolerance approach to companies who think they can bribe their way to financial success. Bribery and corruption not only stifle real economic growth and free trade, they also damage democracy and, therefore, risk the security of all our countries.\n\n\u201cI am, of course, delighted that the tenacity of my SFO colleagues has resulted in the people of Nigeria being compensated in a way that will truly benefit them.\u201d\n\nMalami, while thanking the UK for the gesture, promised that the repatriated fund would be expended on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Abuja to Kano road, and the Second Niger Bridge.\n\nOn UK\u2019s injection of \u00a310 million of concessional financing alongside InfraCredit to mobilise pension and insurance investments, the statement noted that it would help to reduce the risk for pension and insurance funds to invest in energy access projects, and support Nigeria\u2019s COP26 commitments.\n\nThe financing would also help Nigerian investors focus on low carbon energy, and support off-grid, low-carbon energy projects. Additionally, the \u00a310 million would be blended to de-risk transactions and, therefore, mobilise domestic institutional investment from local pension funds, insurance firms and other local institutional investors. This would help scale up domestic financing for eligible off-grid clean energy infrastructure, such as solar mini-grid and home systems, clean cooking infrastructure and SME cold storage infrastructure in Nigeria.\n\nUK Minister for Africa, Vicky Ford, speaking on the investment, said, \u201cThe UK is committed to increasing both renewable energy and energy access in Nigeria, driving clean, sustainable and resilient growth.\n\n\u201cAs the world looks to transition to clean growth, we are witnessing an era-defining opportunity for the private sector. This transaction is particularly exciting as it brings together UK government support with the institutional capital, which is essential to grow the sector at scale.\n\n\u201cThis innovative blended finance initiative will provide affordable long-term financing from local investors for the low carbon energy sector to support scaling up of off-grid low carbon energy projects in unserved and underserved communities.\n\n\u201cThis initiative will support the implementation of Nigeria\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions plan, which Nigeria submitted to the UNFCCC before COP26, its Energy Transition Plan, which was presented by the Nigerian government at COP26, and Nigeria\u2019s plans to increase energy access, including the Solar Naija programme.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the MD/CEO, Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), and Chairman of InfraCredit, Uche Orji said:\n\n\u201cInfraCredit is pleased to be working with FCDO to mobilise private investment from domestic pension funds and other institutional investors into such an important developmental area as low carbon energy access.\n\n\u201cThis programme is aligned with NSIA\u2019s other clean energy initiatives which aims to deliver up to 250-500MW of renewable energy capacity in Nigeria that will reduce annual CO2 emissions, alleviate poverty, create jobs and support local economic growth.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the announcement, the Minister of State for Power, Mr. Godwin Jedy-Agba, said with the support from the UK Government\u2019s Energy Transition Council showed the pathway to an energised economy and carbon neutrality by 2060. The assistance also highlighted the need for additional investments of $410 billion above business as usual over the next 40 years.\n\nJedy-Agba stated, \u201cWhereas all efforts have been geared towards unlocking private sector activity in the clean energy transition, one major challenge continues to be private sector access to local currency financing. This is where local institutions such as pension and insurance funds have a key role to play, as only these institutions possess the scale of local currency liquidity required to accelerate the transition.\u201d\n\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, at a meeting with Ford said the federal government looked forward to cooperate with the United Kingdom (UK) in the security of the West African sub-region.\n\nOnyeama received, in audience, the United Kingdom Minister for Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. He expressed gratitude to the government of the United Kingdom for its extensive and significant support in diverse areas, stating that the West African sub-region is facing huge security challenges, including governance challenges.\n\nHe noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had a big hit on the economies of the world and also expressed gratitude to the United Kingdom for support during the period, particularly with vaccines and other support in the area of health.\n\nOnyeama added that the United Kingdom had been involved in the security of the West African sub-region, saying a lot is going on in the sub-region, particularly in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso with the support of the United Nations.\n\nThe minister said, \u201cSo, we look forward to continue to cooperate with you in this area because we feel that it is not something that we can do alone in the sub-region.\n\n\u201cWe need the United Nations\u2019 support and also the support of European countries. We have been engaged and in the framework of the G5 Sahel and other initiatives.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further on the specific assistance the United Kingdom planned to render Nigeria, Ford said the UK would be discussing with the Nigerian government how to help in community policing, training and improving the police.\n\nFord, however, emphasised that the move was a partnership and not the United Kingdom telling Nigeria what to do.\n\nShe added, \u201cThis was us listening, sharing experiences, especially from the national security areas which we may have seen and experienced both in our country, but also, from what we are seeing across the world and bringing our experiences together.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A petition to the Independent Corrupt Practice and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has called for a probe into over N104 million which is missing from the office of the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami.\n\nThe petition, started by the Integrity and Transparency Watch (ITW), a Nigerian non-profit organisation and society watchdog, urged the ICPC to investigate and prosecute the director of finance and account in the Ministry of Justice, Joshua Luka Kadmi who is in Grade Level 17 and one Abuh Danjuma who also works in the AGF's office.\n\nAbubakar Malami\n\nThe petition, dated February 15, 2022, was addressed to the ICPC Chairman, Bolaji Owasanoye by Shaibu Sodangi, the National Coordinator and Head of ITW's Investigation Department.\n\nAccording to the petition obtained by SaharaReporters, the duo, within two months (November to December 2021), allegedly embezzled N104 million through the private account of Danjuma (UBA Account No: 2064800888 and Access Bank No: 0050341092).\n\nAfterwards, the junior officer, Danjuma reportedly withdrew the money from his bank account and handed it over to Kadmi in a bag.\n\nThe ITW noted that the actions of the officers are in breach of the General Regulation Act, stressing that they expended government resources without due process and violated stimulated rules, particularly with reference to sections 12&19 of the corrupt practices and other related offences act, 2000 and punishable under relevance section of the same act.\n\nThe group further stated that both Kadmi and Abuh should be made to step aside to allow for a thorough investigation into the issue.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cEstablished in 2013, The Integrity and Transparency Watch (ITW) is a Nigerian nonprofit with a mission to promote transparency and accountability in the public and private sectors in supporting the effort in developing a Transparency Integrity Index for Federal Ministries, Departments, and Agencies in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs an independent Civil Society Group and lead researchers, we had unravelled the scam following months of the group\u2019s diligent research team investigation of the issue which became a national embarrassment, to ensure justice is done to the society which norms have been violated by the reckless and corruption driven habit of the director of finance and account in the ministry of Justice Mr Joshua Luka Kadmi of GL 17 and one Abuh Danjuma at GL 9.\n\n\u201cThe integrity watch, an Economic and administration Watchdog for the society, we work to promote good governance and quality leadership at the strata of public service.\n\n\u201cWe wish to express our displeasure over constant breach of General Regulation Act by leads of a government agency, reckless and fraudulent expending of our\n\ncommon patrimony for personal enrichment.\n\n\u201cIt is highly pitiable and equally worrisome to note that Director of Finance and Account Federal Ministry of Justice Mr. Joshua Kadmi and in connivance with Mr. Abuh Danjuma continues to expend government resources without due process and total disregard to financial law laid down by the government to guide her financial operations which actions continue to cast doubt on the current administration on whether the government is really ready to fight corruption in Nigeria if the Ministry that is supposed to uphold the law 100% are now seen breaching financial Regulation Act.

          "text": "A federal high court in Abuja has dismissed a suit by the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) seeking to invalidate some provisions in the Nigeria Police Force Regulations (NPFR) which forbid unmarried female police officers from getting pregnant.\n\nThe Nigerian Bar Association had approached the court to challenge the legality of regulation 127 of the NPFR, arguing that the said provision contradicts the 1999 constitution and is discriminatory to unmarried female police officers.\n\nThe regulation, provides that \u201can unmarried woman police officer, who becomes pregnant, shall be discharged from the Force and shall not be re-enlisted except with the approval of the inspector-general of police\u201d.\n\nCiting the instance of Omolola Olajide, a female police officer who was fired on January 26, 2021, in Ekiti state for becoming pregnant while unmarried, NBA said such discriminatory regulations have made many female officers childless for fear of being fired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe male police officers and married female police officers in the Nigeria Police Force are not subjected to similar discrimination, sanction, opprobrium and indignity,\u201d the association said.\n\n\u201cThere are many unmarried female police officers in the NPF who, because of this discriminatory practice, cannot have or be allowed to have children because of fear of dismissal from the Police Force.\n\n\u201cMarried female police officers are allowed to be pregnant and have children while still serving in the Police Force; they also enjoy maternity benefits.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe attorney-general of the federation, the Police Service Commission and the Nigeria Police Force were the defendants in the suit.\n\nIn a counter-affidavit, the AGF asked the court to dismiss the suit.\n\nThe AGF said the plaintiff (NBA) ought to approach the national assembly for an amendment if it was not comfortable with the provision.\n\n\u201cFundamental human rights, as guaranteed under the 1999 Constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria (as amended), are not absolute,\u201d the AGF submitted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Police Act and Regulations are special creations of law. The Nigeria Police Act and Regulations provide the framework for the police force in maintaining peace, combating crime, protecting liberties, life and property and other related matters.\n\n\u201cLawful discrimination permits an action undertaken based on the irreversible needs of a person or the society at large. The work of law enforcement and policing is one that demands emotional stability and physical agility.\n\n\u201cEffective law enforcement requires the performance of essential functions which are strongly contingent upon a high level of physical fitness. Environmental conditions of policing and law enforcement can create potential conflicts between police duties and pregnancy.\u201d\n\nDelivering judgment on Monday, Inyang Ekwo, the judge, agreed with the AGF\u2019s submission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the suit lacked merit, holding that such unmarried female police officers were aware of the regulation before they joined the force.\n\n\u201cWhere a law or regulation of an establishment identifies gender attributes or faults and seeks to regulate the vulnerabilities capable of negatively affecting the progress of such gender, such law or regulation is a warning aforehand and cannot be said to be discriminatory,\u201d Ekwo held.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, the essence of this suit is to use the provision of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, to lower the morale and professional standard of the NPF and this court will not give its imprimatur to such venture.\n\n\u201cIt is my finding that in all that the plaintiff has posited, it has not pointed to any aspect of the regulation complained of, which violates the interest of public order or public morality, which will make it reasonably justifiable to invalidate Regulation 127 of the NPFR and I so hold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI find that there was no basis for this action in the first place. An unmarried woman who intends to get pregnant is not compelled to join the police.\n\n\u201cWhere such a woman becomes a police officer, she is bound by the regulation on pregnancy while being unmarried.\n\n\u201cI am unable to see any of the fundamental human rights provided in Chapter IV of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, expressly or latently meant to shield an unmarried woman police officer who becomes pregnant from being discharged from the force.\n\n\u201cI find that the regulation in issue, in this case, is about conduct and nothing more. I find no compelling reason for this court to disrupt the discipline of the force or interfere in the regulation of the conduct of officers of the NPF, whether male or female.\n\n\u201cAny person who joins the force must abide by the regulation of the force or not join the force as there is no compulsion about its membership.\n\n\u201cIt is my opinion that Regulation 127 of the NPFR is to be seen as a code of conduct for an unmarried woman police officer and to forewarn such officer on the consequence of becoming pregnant while being unmarried in the force.\n\n\u201cHowever, the regulation provides for a remedy after such officer has been discharged from the force, by stating that such officer can be relisted with the approval of the IGP.\n\n\u201cThe argument that this provision is discriminatory because it does not apply to male officers, in my opinion, goes beyond the bounds of reasonableness and tilts seriously towards the absurd.\u201d",

          "text": "The air changes the moment you step into AfricanWorks\u2019 compound in Victoria Island, one of the highbrow areas in Lagos, Nigeria. The first thing you see are the greeneries all over the compound, the atmosphere is calm and quiet. It feels like you\u2019ve just escaped the hustle and bustle of Lagos.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, the outdoor experience is a hint of what goes on in the interior.\n\nThe main door is see-through so you can tell of the comfort that awaits inside. After a minute in the lobby, Gregoire Schwebig, founder and CEO of AfricaWorks came out to meet me. He\u2019s of average height and moderately built. His energy, however, didn\u2019t feel like that of a man who had just completed a trip from Paris to Lagos that morning. As we exchanged pleasantries, one question lingered; why is this French man building a home-grown business in Africa?\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSchwebig was born and grew up in Paris with a close tie to Francophone Africa. His mother was born in Senegal, so he visited Senegal, Ivory Coast, Mali and Togo while growing up. After graduating from ESSEC Business School, one of the best business schools in Europe, he went on to work at Lehman Brothers in London as a financial analyst. After Lehman Brothers liquidated, he joined Societe Generale in Hong Kong.\n\nIn 2011, Schwebig joined Fanasi Capital, a venture capital fund focused on high-growth startups in East Africa, as a senior associate, and then moved to Kenya and remained there for 8 years. He was elected as a consular adviser to the French government on the affairs of 7 countries in East and South Africa. In 2016, he became the president of the Kenya chapter of the French Chamber of Commerce, a dedicated body that helps French companies and entrepreneurs set up in Kenya.\n\nSchwebig wore many hats during his time in Kenya; in 2014, he started Haussmann Africa, a corporate real estate company that built and designed custom offices for companies. The company, which he still runs till date, has designed offices for Uber, L\u2019oreal and Total.\n\nAfter designing offices for a while, he realised there were gaps he wanted to fill, so in 2019, he started AfricaWorks.\n\nAfricaWorks in Abidjan\n\nBuilding AfricaWorks\n\nThe way people work had already started shifting before the pandemic hit in 2020. The pandemic only expedited the shift and forced businesses to restructure work to fit the new normal which is hybrid.\n\nWhile there was already full-blown support for the future of work in the West, there was little or no solution in Africa to support the growing business ecosystem\u2014there was no real pan-African flexible workplace solution that could power the future of work across the continent. And here is where AfricanWorks, a pan-African flexible workspace provider chain, plugs itself.\n\nThe idea was simple: build a world-class workspace that brings together the best businesses under one roof in one city. Then scale and replicate the process in another. AfricaWorks launched its first space in Abidjan, the capital city of Ivory Coast, and now operates in 9 cities and counting\u2014Abidjan, Accra, Cairo, Cape Town, Dakar, Dar Es Salaam, Jo\u2019burg, Lagos, and Nairobi\u2014across 8 countries.\n\nAfricaWorks in Cape Town\n\nThe company lists top multinationals like Glovo, Universal Music, L\u2019oreal, Total and more as part of companies working out of its spaces.\n\n\u201cWe currently have over 150 businesses and over 2,000 individuals working from our spaces. We are also opening more spaces in the coming months,\u201d Schwebig told TechCabal.\n\nMore than just a coworking space\n\nFor AfricaWorks, as the African tech and business ecosystem grows, it will continue to grow to support them across the continent. Beyond being a pan-African coworking space, it now wants to do more as it slowly transitions into a tech company. It has started building a business-to-business (B2B) product that will provide full-on operation support for its clients.\n\n\u201cOur B2B service marketplace will be called AfricaWorks Services, which will help us connect our clients to partnered services providers like recruiting, marketing, finance, expansion, and everything else they need to grow their businesses,\u201d said Schwebig, who also co-founded French-African Foundation, an organisation that contributes to the emergence of a Franco-African succession.\n\nSchwebig with the Afriworks Lagos team\n\nThe play here is to reduce third party friction and be the only direct partner their members need. AfricaWorks Services will partner with talent companies like OfferZen and Andela to bring qualified talent to its member companies; partner with marketing and financial firms to bring quality marketing and financial services to its community; and African tradetech like Norebase to help in expansion and manage trade across Africa.\n\nSchwebig believes that Africa will play a pivotal role in the future of work and they [AfricanWorks] are positioning to be a crucial part of that movement. He believes this is becoming evident in the way the African tech ecosystem is booming and the surge in talent exodus. AfricaWorks wants to play in the talent services but first for its members and then\u2014maybe in the future\u2014expanding the services to the public.\n\nAfricaWorks operates in 9 cities and counting and these countries, though they may have similar problems, have a peculiar business landscape that requires a bespoke solution. Schwebig confirmed that, while Ivory Coast remains AfricaWorks\u2019 biggest market in terms of patronage and revenue, it has invested more in Nigeria due to the size of the market and the prospect of the tech ecosystem, especially.\n\nAfricaWorks in Nairobi\n\nAmong other places, the company is also planning to open new space at the Kotoka international airport in Accra, Ghana.\n\nAccording to Goldie Iyamu, the marketing head at AfricaWorks, by the time all the pending projects are completed, the company should push into 500 businesses and over 3,000 people working across their spaces.\n\nAfter 2 years and 6 months, AfricaWorks has experienced astronomical growth and now it\u2019s positioning itself as the partner for businesses with pan-African growth ambitions.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The destruction of patronage networks and the subsequent isolation of African art and artists during colonialism and early independence are things of the past for a group of artists who have leapfrogged their way into living rooms and boardrooms across the world.\n\nThis article was contributed to TechCabal by Patrick Nelle of bird Story Agency\n\nHuddled in a tiny office, young workers are neatly wrapping up canvases, ready for shipment. The silence in the room is loud \u2014 only interrupted by an occasional sigh, heavy breathing, or a cough. At the far end of the room, a young man is multitasking\u2014 his fingers hammering at the buttons of a laptop, while he chats on a smartphone. An air of urgency hangs in the room and he, like the rest of the team, seems pressed for time.\n\nIn an age that welcomes and pays for digitally-signed images of all types, and in which vast volumes of clothing chosen from digital catalogues traverse the world, it is perhaps not surprising that digital manifestations of art are giving artists ready markets all over the world. What might surprise many is that this system of digitally marketed, paid-for, and delivered artworks is flourishing here in Kinshasa.\n\nWelcome to the engine room of Bandombe Galerie, a virtual art gallery that is the brainchild of Sisqo Ndombe. Bandombe showcases and connects contemporary African artists with potential clients, globally.\n\n\u201cA majority of African artists do not manage to make a living from their creations because there are not enough channels dedicated to their promotion,\u201d Ndombe explained.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThat\u2019s where Bandombe comes in, attracting potential buyers, connecting them with artists, and then providing the platform for negotiation, payment, and delivery of the creative works.\n\n\u201cAs an artist, if you don\u2019t have a place where you can show your work to an audience, you shall never succeed,\u201d Ndombe added.\n\nWhere traditional art galleries prefer working with acclaimed artists and often shun aspiring and unknown creators \u2013 often simply because a gallery only has so much space \u2013 Ndombe felt he could solve this problem on a digital level. As the idea began to crystallise, his \u201ceureka\u201d moment struck\u2026 he could leverage the internet to not only showcase unknown talent \u2013 including his own \u2013 but also to market and sell top African art, globally.\n\n\u201cI remember the time when I had to reach out to galleries, walking long distances carrying my canvases, trying to find some buyers. I couldn\u2019t afford to do things that way anymore,\u201d he says as he recalls his journey as an artist.\n\nThe power of the internet has been a game-changer not just for him, but many more artists, who have signed up to his network across Africa.\n\nWith limited finances, the start was going to be a struggle. However, from his wages as a graphic designer in a local company, he managed to save some money and through constant sacrifice, his dream began to unfold.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, Bandombe Galerie, website: bandombe.com, went up online,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the idea to sell more than just his own art evolved, he onboarded other artists. Some were reluctant but Ndombe is nothing if not persuasive and he managed to convince enough of his fellow artists to sign on with the platform. Where there was reluctance at home, artists from other African countries jumped at the opportunity.\n\n\u201cI thought my fellow Congolese would be the first to jump in, but that didn\u2019t happen. However, when they saw that artists from other countries were packing the platform, they started to join in,\u201d he said.\n\nAt first, it was not easy to get buyers to trust the concept or the platform, but Ndombe\u2019s never-say-die spirit kept the project focused on his goal \u2014 to attract buyers with unique artworks.\n\n\u201cWhat is instrumental to attract art lovers and buyers on our platform is to have a good selection of displayed works,\u201d he explained.\n\nIt took the team eight months of anxiety, patience, and sacrifice before selling their first piece.\n\n\u201cOur first client was a European woman. She had been working in Congo for a couple of years, and now she was leaving the country. She wanted to take some art piece from Congo with her as a souvenir,\u201d Ndombe recalled.\n\nIn the four years since, the Kinshasa-based virtual gallery Bandombe Galerie has grown in leaps and bounds across Africa making it one of, if not, the, most popular virtual galleries for patrons of African art launched on the continent. Currently, it has 800 registered artists from 30 African countries and more than 3,000 artworks in its catalogue.\n\nLooking back at its journey of the gallery, Ndombe said that what started as a small idea to address his dilemma is now helping some aspiring artists to emerge and gain visibility among art collectors far beyond the borders of their countries and continent.\n\n\u201cIt has given access to many African artists and their works to a wider audience and market,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of those who bought up into Ndombe\u2019s virtual gallery initiative is Rwanda-based painter, Izere Antoine.\n\n\u201cBandombe is very supportive of the up-and-coming talents and African art in general,\u201d said Izere.\n\nIzere said through the virtual gallery, he has found buyers for three of his paintings. And above all, beyond the visitations and inquiries, Bandombe has transformed his life and equipped him with tech skills to digitally market his works and brand himself.\n\n\u201cMostly it also encouraged me to be more in online marketing like websites and more,\u201d he said.\n\nNigerian artist Onofua Dennis, who has also signed on with Bandombe talks glowingly of the virtual gallery.\n\n\u201cTheir marketing competency, their capacity in dispensing durable relationships between artists, collectors, and as well as the gallery team through communication, packaging, and delivery of artworks are great,\u201d he said.\n\nParticularly, Onofua praises Bandombe\u2019s payments policy and logistics management which he says have been key in building that durable relationship between all artists and clients.\n\n\u201cPercentage of payment due to the artist is being attended to within a short period of time. More so, I have seen fantastic reports of buyers \u2013 delivered publicly \u2013 about the receiving of their package,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen asked if Bandombe has been helpful in helping him obtain more artistic recognition, he quickly cuts in: \u201cWell, yes\u201d, adding that; \u201cTo date, we have sold more than 214 pieces\u2026 and that is remarkable\u201d.\n\nFor Ndombe, the growth and future success of Bandombe Galerie mean more work and a commitment to growing his client base.\n\nHe is also determined to end the current trend in which the global emergence of contemporary African art is being driven mainly by non-African buyers, instead of by a local market.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to sensitise our people to consume more art. We envisage the opening of a showroom and the organisation of art fairs across the continent.\n\n\u201cThe potential is huge for Africa arts, and a bright future is beckoning those with the courage to embrace the infinite opportunities offered by technology to shine on the global stage,\u201d he concluded, signing off on another deal with a remote patron.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Pan-African fintech firm Flutterwave on Friday announced a rebrand of its logo and dashboard as well as the addition of small business lending, fintech-as-a-service (FaaS), and more to its suite of offerings.\n\nThe announcement comes 2 days after Flutterwave confirmed it had raised $250 million in a Series D round that tripled the company\u2019s valuation to over $3 billion. Led by founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, the company facilitates cross-border payments transactions of small-to-large businesses in Africa via one API.\n\nIn a virtual event themed \u201cFlutterwave 3.0\u201d, Africa\u2019s most valuable startup and payments giant rolled out a series of products and services including FaaS services for embedded finance, SME loans for its users, card issuance for a wide array of clients while announcing the addition of Apple Pay and Google Pay to its payment options.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFlutterwave Capital, the new SME loans product, is offered in partnership with the company\u2019s lending partners\u2014CashConnect Microfinance Bank, MoneyWise Microfinance Bank, Wema Bank, Zenith Bank, Stanbic IBTC Bank, and Sterling Bank.\n\nThe new product will enable businesses \u201ceasily access loans without collateral, cumbersome documentation, and other stringent terms and conditions,\u201d a blog post on Flutterwave\u2019s website reads, adding that eligible applicants can access the funds they need in less than 2 business days.\n\n\u201cWith Flutterwave Capital, we\u2019re making it easier for business owners to access the funds they require to grow their businesses. Business owners can expand, increase inventory, hire more labour, pay bills, run marketing campaigns, and ultimately grow revenue with these funds,\u201d the company said.\n\nCurrently, only Flutterwave businesses in Nigeria can access loans but the company says it is working to make it available to its businesses in South Africa, Kenya, and other markets where it operates.\n\nAs regards the fintech-as-a-service solution, Flutterwave is opening up its infrastructure to allow other companies to use its APIs to embed financial capabilities into their existing applications, products, and services.\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s FaaS service provides a unified tech stack that includes KYC, account opening, debit card issuance, payments, and real-time transfers through a single endpoint, account servicing, and compliance.\n\nThe solution helps companies bypass the often gruelling work of building the infrastructure, integrating multiple, disparate financial systems, licensing, and compliance required in building and offering consumers digital financial services.\n\nFlutterwave also helps businesses outside Africa expand their operations on the continent with an international clientele that includes Booking.com, Flywire, and Uber.\n\nThe new set of offerings and features is in line with Flutterwave\u2019s ambitious product expansion drive. Last year, the company launched Flutterwave Market for merchants to sell their goods via an online marketplace and, most recently, Send, a remittance service that empowers customers to seamlessly send money to recipients to and from Africa.\n\nIn March 2021, the San Francisco-headquartered and Lagos-based startup raised $170 million in a Series C round at a valuation of $1 billion. The latest financing thus brings its total investments secured since launched in 2016 to $475 million (plus a $35 million Series B in 2020 and a $20 million Series A in 2018).\n\nThe $3 billion valuation sees Flutterwave surpass the $2 billion mark set by SoftBank-backed fintech OPay and FTX-backed cross-border payments platform Chipper Cash last year.\n\nCurrently, Flutterwave has an infrastructure reach across 34 countries on the continent and processes 200 million transactions worth more than $16 billion. More than 900,000 businesses globally use its solution to process payments in 150 currencies and across different payment modes: local and international cards, mobile wallets, bank transfers, and its consumer product Barter, which now allows for multicurrency wallets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Crypto crime grows to $14 billion as crypto popularity increases",
          "text": "In 2021, crypto criminals made a killing, as illicit crypto transactions hit $14 billion, a 79% jump from the $7.8 billion recorded in 2020, according to a report by US-based blockchain analytics company, Chainalysis.\n\nThe growth in illicit crypto transactions is attributed to a 567% jump in overall transaction volume in 2021. Given that overall crypto transactions grew to $15.8 trillion in 2021, it is not surprising that cybercriminals are increasingly using crypto. Despite the increase in the total volume of illicit transactions, illicit transactions represented just 0.15% of the total cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2021\u2014its lowest ever. What this means is that legitimate crypto transactions far outstrip illegal transactions.\n\nScams and theft ranked as the highest source of crypto crime and decentralised finance (DeFi) contributed most part of the funds stolen, the report shows. Scamming revenue jumped 82% to $7.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen from victims. Over $2.8 billion of this total were stolen through a new type of scam called \u201crug pull\u201d. A rug pull is a type of scam where developers disappear with the money invested in crypto projects or exchanges that appear legitimate.\n\nCryptocurrency theft also jumped 516% to roughly $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen in 2021. With 72% or 2.2 billion of those funds stolen from DeFi protocols.\n\nDeFi is a term for a financial ecosystem of tools and applications running on any blockchain that allows an individual to pay, lend, borrow, or store funds without intermediaries such as traditional financial banks.\n\nDeFi saw the biggest year-on-year growth\u20141,964%\u2014for laundering activities, while mining comes second place at less than 500% growth. The Chainalysis report attributed this growth to the hype around the DeFi space: incredible returns on decentralised tokens like Shiba Inu, which encourages people to speculate on DeFi tokens, and the ease of creating DeFi tokens\u2014all of which caused its transaction volume to grow by 912% in 2021.\n\nWhile Chainalysis acknowledges the huge opportunities DeFi presents to crypto users and entrepreneurs, it believes widespread theft and scamming will not allow it to realise its full potential. It suggested that the public and private sectors should engage in communication to teach investors how to avoid dubious projects. Although it noted that, as a long term strategy, the industry may need to prevent \u201ctokens associated with potentially fraudulent or unsafe projects from being listed on major exchanges\u201d.\n\nApart from crypto-based transactions or revenue, the Chainalysis report also shows that the volume of cryptocurrency owned by addresses on the blockchain that it has traced to criminal actors has increased from $3 to $11 billion. This data is important, Chainalysis noted, because it represents how much can be theoretically retrieved by law enforcement agencies. Stolen funds accounted for 93% of such criminal balances, at $9.8 billion; followed by Darknet market funds at $448 million; scams at $192 million; fraud shops at $66 million; and ransomware at $30 million.\n\nIn a separate analysis by Chainalysis, in the same report, 4,068 criminal whales hold over $25 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Chainalysis describes a criminal crypto whale as any private wallet holding $1 million or more worth of cryptocurrency that has received more than 10% of its funds from illicit addresses. It is important to note that the above figure of criminal whale balance won\u2019t align with the overall criminal balance because it calculates all the holdings in the private wallet (both legal and illegal) while the overall criminal balance calculates only holdings of addresses tagged as illicit. Criminal whales represent just 3.7% of all cryptocurrency whales\u2014private wallets holding over $1 million worth of cryptocurrency.\n\nDespite the massive increase in crypto crime, a positive development is the growing ability of law enforcement agencies to seize illicit cryptocurrency from criminals. For example, America\u2019s Internal Revenue Service criminal investigation (IRS-CI) seized, over the course of 2021, over $3.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Also in the US, the Department of Justice (DOJ) also seized $2.3 million worth of cryptocurrency from the operators of DarkSide ransomware, responsible for the attack on Colonial Pipeline. London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) seized \u00a3180 million worth of cryptocurrency from a suspected money launderer.\n\nEarlier this month, the United States arrested and charged a couple, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, for allegedly conspiring to launder stolen cryptocurrency worth 119,754 bitcoin, which is now worth an estimated $4.5 billion. The couple had allegedly laundered the bitcoin stolen in the 2016 hack of cryptocurrency exchange, Bitfinex, but the stolen bitcoin were worth $74 million at the time, a tiny fraction of their current value. The US Justice Department was able to recover more than $3.6 billion of the laundered $4.5 billion worth of bitcoin, despite the couple\u2019s sophisticated laundering technique that saw them shuffle the funds using crypto tools and techniques like unhosted wallets, a darknet marketplace, chain hooping, peel chain, and privacy coin. The agency has labelled the operation its largest financial seizure ever.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

A school of thought has it that Tuesdays are the most productive days of the week. Do you plan to make it so?\n\nBut again, why should I tell you what to do with your day? For me, while I work, I\u2019ll probably think about legal ways to have fun on my birthday (tomorrow) without leaving the house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore then, these are what I\u2019m discussing today:\n\nCredit facility for African women entrepreneurs\n\n716,000 African developers and counting\n\nWhat\u2019s up with the new features on your favourite apps?\n\nA quick one. In the late hours of yesterday, a Bloomberg article headlined, \u201cNigerian fintech company Tingo is seeking $500 million to expand across Africa\u201d threw the Nigerian tech Twitter into an uproar. Some concerns were raised concerning the numbers claimed by the company.\n\nThere\u2019s the question of how a Nigerian-founded fintech company with millions of users, founded over two decades ago, recorded $594 million in revenue plus $212 million EBITDA in 2020, and valued at $6.3 billion barely made the news? Well, the company got a feature on Techpoint in 2019. Still, trust us to do some more digging.\n\nUK\u2019s CDC X FirstBank for women entrepreneurs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA couple of African startups and venture capital firms are in the United Kingdom\u2019s development finance arm, CDC Group\u2019s portfolio. Recall Ghana\u2019s mPharma and TLcom\u2019s raises. A few months back, the institution also committed $50.9 million to support Africa\u2019s digital infrastructure. There\u2019s a new development.\n\nYesterday, it announced backing Nigeria\u2019s first commercial bank, First Bank of Nigeria Ltd, with a $100 million credit facility to support women entrepreneurs and SMEs in the country. Of this amount, a minimum of $30 million will go into credit lines for women-owned and led businesses.\n\nThe Group\u2019s intention with this deal is to empower women in business, promote social and financial inclusion, and alleviate poverty. The credit facility will be disbursed through the bank\u2019s over 700 branches and 150,000 agents across the country.\n\nLearn more about this here\n\nHow will FirstBank leverage this deal? Ordinarily, SMEs are less likely to get bank loans like large firms, but there\u2019s been a paradigm shift with the onset of digital banks and lending platforms. Traditional banks are also not left behind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile FirstBank is yet to issue an official comment on how to disburse the funds, there\u2019s a possibility of it going into existing SME-focused product financing options accessible to FirstSME account holders and other users. Want to be a part of this? Maybe this could help.\n\n716,000 African developers and counting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the second consecutive year, Google has published the Africa Developer Ecosystem Report 2021, based on a study conducted across 16 sub-Saharan African markets \u2014 including Nigeria, Rwanda, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda \u2014 surveying software developers and local tech experts.\n\nThe findings show an all-time increase in demand for African developers globally and over 2.5x growth in VC funding, all of which happened despite the challenge that came with the pandemic.\n\nThe report also highlighted the role of Nigeria in this growth, evidenced by how Nigeria\u2019s developer ecosystem alone added about 5,000 new professional developers to its pool in 2021.\n\nIn the coming days, look out for informed articles drawn from these findings and more on Techpoint Africa.\n\nHow kindly do you take to these features?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2021, Twitter introduced Tip Jar to the app to allow people to get paid for tweeting through third-party payment services. The feature was rolled out to more users in September. Given the feature\u2019s initial use case, we were quite optimistic about how it could encourage everyday bitcoin transactions.\n\nTwitter\u2019s new tipping feature could make spending Bitcoin attractive\n\nSubsequently, the microblogging platform allowed users to add their Ethereum wallets to receive tips. For now, Tips can be in the form of money, Bitcoin, and ETH.\n\nAnd in the past week, it announced that the payment feature now supports African payments platforms, Flutterwave, Chipper Cash, and Paga, making this service easier to use by users in African countries where the Tips feature is available, like Nigeria and Ghana. By the way, the function has always supported PayPal and other payments platforms like Bandcamp and Patreon, commonly used by creatives.\n\nBottom line: when next you\u2019re happy with your favourite creator\u2019s tweet or \u2018hot takes\u2019 on Twitter Spaces, don\u2019t forget to tip them a \u2018little something\u2019. You no longer have to be discouraged by the hassles of sending via PayPal.\n\nMoving on\u2026\n\nIn July 2021, the global streaming company, Netflix, intended to foray into video games. And it did! By November, every subscriber had access. There are currently a dozen games on the platform, but it started with five games, some of which are interactive games based on popular shows.\n\nIt\u2019s probably too early to know if Netflix\u2019s bet is worth it. But, I\u2019m curious about the feature\u2019s prospect in driving subscriptions so far.\n\nA good time to revisit this: Why Netflix needs more than cheap plans to drive massive growth in Africa\n\nLet\u2019s know if these features interest you?\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nWinter Olympics 2022 is still underway in Beijing.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nIn the last few weeks, on every social media platform I use \u2014 mainly Twitter and WhatsApp \u2014 one of the first things I see is \u201cWordle 2/6\u201d or \u201cWordle 1/6\u201d, followed by some green, yellow, and white squares.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong; I\u2019m not hating or anything, but I\u2019m not a huge fan of Wordle or the other variants springing up like quordle, octordle, and semantle.\n\nAnd with new ownership comes some changes. In January 2022, The New York Times acquired Wordle from the creator, Josh Wardle, for an undisclosed sum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far, there\u2019s been screening of \u201coffensive words\u201d and what appears to be significantly more ad-tracking. At least the game is still free, though.\n\nMeanwhile, on Friday, February 18, 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the first six countries to receive the technology needed to produce mRNA vaccines in Africa. Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, and Tunisia are the chosen ones.\n\nOn to today\u2019s Digest; we\u2019ll be discussing the WHO\u2019s announcement and:\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s wave of announcements\n\nGoogle\u2019s Privacy Sandbox getting extended to Android\n\nAn ambitious wave of products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing its $250 million Series D announcement on Wednesday, February 16, 2022, African fintech startup Flutterwave has revealed several new products and features.\n\nOn Friday, February 18, 2022, it revealed this at its virtual event, Flutterwave 3.0. It also announced a rebrand of its logo and dashboard.\n\nOne of the products is its Fintech as a Service (FaaS) \u2014 enabling businesses to automatically embed financial services into their product. It also introduced Flutterwave Capital which would provide loans for its merchants.\n\nOther products and services include card issuance \u2014 physical for Nigerian residents and virtual for others \u2014 and Flutterwave Grow to help businesses incorporate across Africa.\n\nFlutterwave-acquired Disha was not left out, with creatives now able to receive payments via their links.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis seems quite ambitious, but it does spell some exciting times in the African fintech ecosystem.\n\nBalancing privacy and profit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Visual Content Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nLast year, in April, Apple introduced its App Tracking Transparency (ATT) privacy policy which meant app developers had to explicitly seek the consent of users to use the company\u2019s Identifiers for Advertisers (IDFA). In other words, users permission must be sought before their data can be tracked.\n\nThere were mixed reactions to this. According to the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s Mobile ecosystems market study interim report published in December 2021, Apple said organisations like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and makers of Firefox, a free and open-source browser, Mozilla supported this decision.\n\nOther parties projected that it would cause a fall in revenue for companies reliant on IDFA to measure and attribute for iOS mobile advertising campaigns. Basically, companies like Meta (formerly Facebook), Google, Snapchat, and Twitter that need advertising revenue were more likely to be affected.\n\nThere was also a likelihood that small businesses that rely on these platforms for advertising would be affected as well.\n\nIn February 2021, Meta took out full-page ads in the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal, claiming it was protesting for \u201csmall businesses everywhere.\u201d Financial Times revealed that Meta, Snapchat, Twitter, and YouTube lost $10 billion in revenue once Twitter implemented the ATT more than seven months later.\n\nOn Wednesday, February 16, 2022, Google announced that it would be toeing Apple\u2019s line and introducing privacy limitations to cover apps on its Android smartphones, extending its previous decision to do the same on its Chrome browser.\n\nIn its blog post, Google said, \u201cToday, we\u2019re announcing a multi-year initiative to build the Privacy Sandbox on Android, with the goal of introducing new, more private advertising solutions. Specifically, these solutions will limit sharing of user data with third parties and operate without cross-app identifiers, including advertising ID.\u201d\n\nWhile there is no clear-cut explanation of how this would work yet, the company said it would be working closely with the industry and regulators to \u201cimprove user privacy without putting access to free content and services at risk.\u201d\n\nIt would be interesting to see how this works considering the competing interests of privacy and profit-making.

But the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has broadened our knowledge. Currently, two of the world\u2019s most effective COVID-19 vaccines are messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo, but an mRNA is a single-stranded RNA molecule that is complementary to one of the DNA strands of a gene. mRNA vaccines use mRNA created in a laboratory to teach our cells how to make a protein \u2014 or even just a piece of a protein \u2014 that triggers an immune response inside our bodies.\n\nOn Friday, February 18, 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the first six countries to receive the technology needed to produce mRNA vaccines in Africa. They are Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, and Tunisia.\n\nThis comes after the work being done by the WHO to establish a global technology transfer hub in South Africa to serve low and middle-income countries. Africa suffers from a shortage of biotech facilities, and while health tech is slowly gaining momentum, much of the focus still remains on access to primary healthcare and insurance.\n\nWhat you might have missed last week\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nThis weekend, listening to early Linkin Park reminded me why heavy metal is not particularly my scene.

          "title": "Vaccine production seen helping Nigeria beyond COVID",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s bid to establish its own COVID-19 vaccine production plant could serve as a catalyst to research and produce vaccines for other endemic diseases beyond the current needs of the pandemic, analysts have said.\n\nIt could become re-purposed to fight other life-threatening infectious diseases that require immunisation, such as poliomyelitis, tuberculosis, measles, cholera, hepatitis B and yellow fever, among others.\n\n\u201cThere are some diseases we have in Africa which nobody is interested in because it doesn\u2019t affect them overseas. This will be a great opportunity to research into those ones and create vaccines that are specific for our own environment,\u201d Oyewale Tomori, the chairman of Biovaccines Nigeria Limited (BNL), a company at the helm of current plans to establish the plant in Ota, Ogun State, tells BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cTo me, that\u2019s even the more interesting thing about that because it then opens the opportunity for us to look at older vaccines and improve on them, and also generate new ones,\u201d he says.\n\nNigeria finally got a foot in the door in its long journey to local production for the first time since talks about getting Africa to its vaccine needs began.\n\nIt made the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) list of first six countries in Africa to receive the technology needed to produce mRNA-based vaccines, after failing to qualify for some major partnership deals that saw countries like South Africa and Egypt top destinations of choice for the production of COVID-19 vaccine and pills.\n\nBut the demand for COVID-19 vaccine in the country might have thinned out or become inconsequential by the time the vaccine plant comes on stream or gets ripe enough to adopt this technology. The project, to cost $51 million, is estimated to span between five and seven years.\n\nWith dwindling infection rates in the country and rising relaxation of restrictions in some worst-hit countries, there are speculations that the COVID-19 pandemic could be nearing an end or inching towards an endemic status.\n\nThe government last year announced it was in talks with the International Finance Corporation and other lenders to raise about N12.3 billion ($30m) to help finance a vaccine plant, and it seems to be walking that talk.\n\nTomori says the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) provided the information and linkage to WHO\u2019s plan to set up a COVID-19 mRNA technology hub in Africa.\n\nBNL provided the technical details, completed and submitted the application while officials of the Ministry of Health led by Osagie Ehanire, the health minister, handled the diplomatic visits and shuttles required. And of many applications, Nigeria was chosen.\n\n\u201cIt is a step forward in the efforts to produce vaccines locally, based on current mRNA technology. It also means when we decide to collaborate and contribute at the level and within the space of our competence, we will succeed,\u201d Tomori, a retired professor of virology, states.\n\nThe disappointment in failing to invest in a responsive structure for vaccine production grew worse as the pandemic went on with Nigeria queuing behind the priorities of foreign producers for vaccines.\n\nWhen Pfizer and Merck, both US multinational pharmaceutical firms, were looking to partner to localise production in Africa, for instance, Nigeria couldn\u2019t compete due to a dearth of capacity, regulatory compliance, and the ability to meet international standards for quality-assured medicines.\n\nExperts see part of that changing with this new development, despite the uncertainty of when it will materialise.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari in a statement last Friday urged the European Union (EU) to support the World Trade Organisation (WTO) towards the conclusion of negotiations on intellectual property rights\u2019 waiver to ensure that the manufacturing of vaccines can start early in Africa.\n\nRead also: AfDB to invest $3bn in vaccines manufacturing in Africa\n\nAccording to Buhari, his government will prioritise the manufacturing of vaccines as well as the sharing and transfer of technology, speaking during the 6th Europe-Africa Summit.\n\nHow mRNA works\n\nThe messenger RNA is a sequence of genetic code that tells cells what proteins to build so that they can function.\n\nTo produce, scientists develop a synthetic version of some of the virus, inject it into the human body cells to read it as an instruction to start building the proteins, including COVID-19\u2019s distinctive \u2018spike\u2019 protein.\n\nThe body then mounts an immune response by producing antibodies to fight the virus proteins made by our cells. This prepares the immune system to fight the real virus when encountered later on.\n\nIt is different from the way some other vaccines work, where a small part of the virus itself, or the whole virus (weakened or dead), is injected into the body to trigger an immune response.\n\nWHO established the global mRNA technology transfer hub last year to support manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines, ensuring that they have all the necessary operating procedures and know-how to manufacture mRNA vaccines at scale and according to international standards.\n\nPrimarily set up to address the COVID-19 emergency, the hub has the potential to expand manufacturing capacity for other products as well.\n\nDepending on the infrastructure, workforce and clinical research and regulatory capacity in place, WHO and partners will work with the beneficiary countries to develop a roadmap and put in place the necessary training and support so that they can start producing vaccines as soon as possible.",

Average yields across short-term, medium-term, and long-term maturities remained unchanged at 3.39 percent, 4.24 percent, and 4.93 percent, respectively, a report from FSDH stated.\n\nIn the Open Market Operation (OMO) bills market, the average yield across the curve decreased by 2bps to close at 5.28 percent as against the last close of 5.30 percent. Average yield across the long-term maturities declined by 4bps.\n\nHowever, the average yield across the short-term maturities remained unchanged at 5.41 percent.\n\nRead also: What CBN\u2019s non-oil FX plans mean for Nigeria\n\nOMO with 16-August-22 (-7bps) maturity bill witnessed mild buying interest. The CBN held an OMO auction on February 17, selling bills worth N60.00 billion across the 96-day (N10bn), 187-day (N10bn), and 362-day (N40bn) tenors with the stop rates remaining unchanged at 7 percent, 8.50 percent, and 10.10 percent, respectively.\n\nThe auction was oversubscribed, indicating a subscription level of 644 percent (N386.69bn). Demand was skewed towards long tenor maturity bills with bid-to-cover ratios settling at 3.63x (96-day), 5.67x (187-day), and 7.34x (362-day).\n\nA report by Parthian Partners, Africa\u2019s premier inter-dealer broker, indicated that the treasury bills market saw slight demand across the mid to long end with a couple of trades passing through, especially on the longer end. Demand for Special bill papers was notable with a handful of trades done as offers were scarce.\n\nBuy interests across the curve closed the week in the bond market, activity was mostly on the short to mid-end as players went bargain hunting. Few trades were consummated on the day with most activity recorded on the 26s and 34s.\n\nOla Oladele, vice president, global market, Parthian Partners, explained that the drastic movement in interbank rates this week was driven by liquidity events.\n\nEarlier in the week, the interbank market was awash with liquidity due to OMO maturity of about N136 billion, CBN intervention for some states salaries (estimated at N80-N100bn) and retail SMIS auction refund of about N250 billion, but on Friday overnight rates spiked due to bond auction debit of N305 billion, CRR debit of about N100 billion and an undisclosed amount provided banks as provision for retail FX sales by the CBN.",

U.S. assistance also focuses on getting vaccines into arms so that no vaccines expire unnecessarily when millions of people need them. \u201cNo one is safe from the pandemic until everyone is safe, and the only way to do that is through safe and effective vaccines,\u201d she added.\n\nAmbassador Leonard used the opportunity to recognize the efforts of the U.S. -CDC, USAID, and the U.S. Department of Defense Walter Reed Army Program for their support to Nigeria\u2019s vaccine rollout.\n\nIn addition, she thanked U.S. CDC\u2019s implementing partner, the Catholic Caritas Foundation of Nigeria (CCFN), for their pivotal role in ramping up vaccine access and uptake in Imo and other states.\n\nShe commended Governor Uzodinma for his efforts to make the vaccines available. She encouraged all those eligible to come out and get vaccinated to secure the health and wellbeing of the Imo people.\n\nShe called on community leaders and other gatekeepers to join hands with the government to safeguard the people\u2019s health in the State. \u201cWe need your support to champion the vaccination of the people of Imo and protect them from COVID-19. The U.S. Mission in Nigeria stands with you.\u201d\n\nImo State is currently one of the states in Nigeria with the lowest vaccine uptake. Recent data ranks Imo as 35 out of 36 states (and the FCT) with only 2.3 percent coverage for COVID 19 vaccinations.\n\nThe flag-off mass vaccination campaign event serves to accelerate and expand COVID-19 vaccination access and uptake. U.S. \u2013 CDC, through PEPFAR American Rescue Plan Act funding and its implementing partner, Catholic Caritas Foundation of Nigeria, are at the forefront of providing that support to all the citizens of Imo State.\n\nThrough PEPFAR, US CDC supports over 83% of the estimated people living with HIV in Imo state with comprehensive treatment services.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Young Professionals Forum (NYPF), has lauded the enviable strides of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, towards supporting the development of human capacity, especially among young people in the Niger Delta region.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the 2nd Niger Delta MSME Summit held in Asaba, Delta State over the weekend, chairman of the NYPF and convener of the Summit, Mr Moses Siloko Siasia, appreciated the support to ensure the success of the Summit by Emefiele, stressing that the CBN Governor who is from Delta State, has been relentless in promoting human capacity building and creating purposeful opportunities for young people in the Niger Delta and Nigeria at large.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele is one of the most diligent and determined public servants in Nigeria whose track record in human capacity building and creating purposeful opportunities for young people is unparalleled.\n\n2023: CSOs Debunk Fake News Against Emefiele\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cNotable among numerous interventions initiated by the CBN under Emefiele\u2019s leadership to productively engage youths and promote the spirit of entrepreneurship is the National Youth Investment Fund (NYIF) which saw the apex bank released N3.0 billion to 7,057 beneficiaries, of which 4,411 were individuals and 2,646 SMEs.\n\n\u201cEmefiele\u2019s presence is also felt in Nigeria\u2019s youth-dominant creative industry where N3.22 billion was disbursed to 356 beneficiaries across movie production, movie distribution, software development, fashion, and IT verticals, under the Creative Industry Financing Initiative (CIFI).\n\n\u201cIt also worthy to note that the Emefiele-led CBN in collaboration with Heritage Bank, inaugurated the Youth Entrepreneurship Development Programme (YEDP) in March 2016 and has through the programme developed the entrepreneurial capacity of the youths as well as provided them with funds up to N3m each.\n\n\u201cCharity as they say, begins at home. It is for that reason Mr Emefiele has thrown his weight towards redirecting the kidnapping, militancy and destructive tendencies of youths in the Niger Delta region by supporting thousands several MSME programmes including the the 2022 Niger Delta MSME Summit.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe young professionals also commended the Nigerian Content and Development Board (NCDMB) led by Engr. Simbi Wabote, as well as the Heritage Bank led Ifie Sekibo, both of whom are from the Niger Delta.\n\nSo far, millions of business owners around the country have benefitted from the CBN Covid-19 Intervention Fund since the outbreak of the pandemic, to mitigate the impact on households and their businesses.\n\nHigh point of the event was the sharing of heart-touching stories by some successful business owners in the Niger Delta. They appreciated stakeholders for the platform, stressing that they have grown successful businesses with youths under their employment, thereby creating jobs.\n\nFive young entrepreneurs with standout businesses, got a grant of N500,000 each to expand their businesses. Also, an engineering firm, BlueCamel Energy Limited, owned by Mr Suleiman Yusuf, set aside another N25m to support five start-up engineers. Another N10m was set aside by the NYPF to support prospective businesses.\n\nThe Saturday\u2019s event saw the convergence of over one thousand participants from the nine Niger Delta states who gathered to build on the success of the inaugural Summit held last year, where over 300 Niger Deltans benefited from the NIRSAL intervention loan for small business owners in the area of Agriculture.\n\nThe 2022 Niger Delta MSME Summit which is the 48th event to be organised by the NYPF, was jointly organised by the Niger Delta Young Professionals (NYDP). The third edition of the Niger Delta MSME Summit is slated for Akwa Ibom State in 2023.",

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said that the inability of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to conduct a routine national convention as planned further explained why all sectors of national life in Nigeria have been in shambolic state under the APC administration.\n\nThe opposition party said APC\u2019s postponement of its national convention yet again validates its stance that the APC is not a political party but a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) of strange bed fellows, \u201cpolitical buccaneers\u201d and ferocious power mongers on a mission to wreck the nation.\n\nThe PDP in a statement by its national publicity secretary, Hon Debo Ologunagba, on Tuesday, said the APC which cannot conduct its own internal affairs could not be expected to successfully manage the affairs of a nation like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe APC is a perfect example of failure both as a party and government unable to conduct a simple National Convention in two years. It has become a Russian Roulette with unending request for extension of time to undertake a routine statutory political activity.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOur Party is not surprised that the APC, a party of backstabbers, again postponed its National Convention already scheduled for February 26, 2022. It is rather saddening how a set of confused, greedy, deceitful, hard-heartened and self-centered individuals who cannot run a creditable organization foisted themselves in power and plunged our nation into the economic, security and social mess that we face today.\n\n\u201cAs a vacuous political contraption without a soul, peopled by \u201cpolitical warlords\u201d without conscience and operating without rules, the APC is a bunch of inchoate sailors clobbered together for remote personal gain; operating without a Board of Trustees (BoT) and a National Working Committee (NWC); exists in violation of rules while constituting itself to a threat to our national unity and corporate existence as a nation.\n\n\u201cAPC\u2019s postponement of its National Conventions had always been a fallout of the horrible infighting, backbiting and gang war by \u201cpolitical bandits\u201d who are desperate for power and access to our national treasury. That explains why their congresses and other activities are always marred by violence, bloodletting and killings.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the APC is not capable of holding a National Convention having become defunct since December 8, 2020 when it dissolved all its states, zonal and national party structures and set up an illegal contrivance called the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee led by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State,\u201d it said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPDP added that activities of the Mai Mala Buni-led Committee remain invalid and unconstitutional by virtue of Section 183 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) which bars a sitting governor from holding \u201cany other executive office\u201d in any capacity whatsoever while serving as a state governor.\n\nThe party stressed that the failure of the APC to hold a National Convention is, therefore, a clear warning to those aspiring for various positions in the 2023 elections on its platform to note that with the APC, they are on a journey to nowhere.\n\n\u201cThe only way the APC can legitimately participate in the 2023 general is to re-apply to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for fresh registration as a political party.\n\n\u201cIn any case, Nigerians are hopeful for a better future because the PDP is back and repositioned to Rescue and Rebuild our nation from the stranglehold of the APC in 2023.\n\n\u201cNigerians are yearning for the return of good governance with the PDP so that they can again be secure, enjoy economic prosperity, infrastructural development, employment, food security and national cohesion which they experienced in the 16 years of the PDP in power,\u201d the opposition party added.",

          "text": "Those who claim that all of this occurred before Mr Mohammed Bello-Koko became a government employee are stretching the truth. They\u2019re also oblivious to the point.\n\nThe first charge leveled against Mr Bello-Koko is that he failed to declare his interest in four London properties acquired through offshore companies/accounts to the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) prior to his appointment as executive director (Finance and Administration) of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA).\n\nThe second charge leveled against Mr Bello-Koko is that after being hired as the executive director of Finance and Administration, he purchased a fifth London home.\n\nThird, has Mr Bello-involvement Koko\u2019s in offshore companies/accounts ceased since he became a public servant, which is the important point of his being referenced in the Pandora Papers?\n\nThe fourth charge leveled against Mr Bello-Koko is that he was involved in offshore deals prior to joining the government.\n\nThe following are the questions we must address:\n\n(1) Why appoint a man who is experienced in secret offshore companies/accounts as a public servant in the first place?\n\n(2) Why retain him as a public servant after it came to light that he acquired at least one foreign property and maintained foreign bank accounts after becoming a public servant, and had not himself declared his interest in the foreign assets?\n\nMr Bello-Koko became and remained acting managing director of NPA with these allegations on his head, and has now been confirmed as managing director/CEO of that critical maritime-economy agency. Mr Bello-Koko, was an unknown maritime person before his appointment as ED F&A. And our suspicion is somewhat confirmed by the way and manner that he has now become confirmed as substantive MD/CEO of NPA.\n\nMr Bello-Koko was made acting MD with the suspension of erstwhile MD/CEO, Mrs Hadiza Bala-Usman, over allegation of NPA failing to remit its operating surplus, remember, with Mr Bello-Koko as ED F&A. An administrative panel was set up to look into the allegation against Mrs Bala-Usman. After months of their investigation, the panel cleared Mrs Bala-Usman of the allegation against her. Almost immediately after she was cleared, instead of returning her to the office she had been suspended from pending the outcome of investigation into the allegation against her, Mr Bello-Koko was confirmed as MD/CEO, meaning the sacking of Mrs Bala-Usman. That is highly curious.\n\nWe feel that it is highly odd to confirm Mr Bello-Koko as MD/CEO of NPA after an administrative panel had cleared Mrs Bala-Usman of the only allegation against her, that is, not remitting the agency\u2019s operating surplus to the federation account; not even that she had diverted or stolen any money belonging to NPA.\n\nAlso, confirming Mr Bello-Koko as MD/CEO immediately after clearing Mrs Bala-Usman leads us to believe that Mrs Bala-Usman had been suspended not because of that allegation but on a witch-hunt.\n\nHaving been cleared by the administrative panel, Mrs Bala-Usman should have returned to the office as MD/CEO of NPA while Mr Bello-Koko, on account of the allegations against him, released to return to his offshore business as a private person, and clearing his own name at CCT and other anti-corruption agencies.\n\nMaking Mr Bello-Koko MD/CEO of NPA in such controversial circumstances amounts to an indictment on President Buhari\u2019s anti-corruption crusade.\n\nWe think that if President Buhari had any unstated and unclear reason(s) to sack Mrs Bala-Usman other than the allegation over which she was investigated and cleared (and it is Mr President\u2019s prerogative to hire and fire his aides), Mr Bello-Koko should not be the one to step into her shoes.\n\nMr Bello-Koko clearly lacks the requisite credibility and integrity for that exalted and sensitive office to the Nigerian economy.",

We are all out to deal with any person or group of people undermining the peaceful atmosphere our area,\u201d Kuryas said.\n\nIn yet another interview, chairman of Shiroro local government council, Mallam Suleiman Chukuba, said the attack was launched by Boko Haram, going by the sophistication of the weapons they were seen carrying, including explosive devices.\n\n\u201cThese are Boko Haram not bandits because they were heavily equipped with sophisticated weapons including explosive devices. This morning, Civil Defense vehicle ran into one of the explosive devices, their vehicle destroyed and many of them were killed,\u201d he said.\n\nThe local government council boss e said the NSDC personnel were on their way to the community to ascertain the level of destruction by the gunmen.\n\n\u201cOnly two out of the number of NSCDC in the vehicle survived the explosion and are in critical condition, receiving treatment at a government facility in Minna, the state capital.\n\n\u201cAs I speak to you now, several buildings in the community are affected, everything was set ablaze and the entire community is deserted,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cright now we cannot ascertain the total number of people that have being killed, the situation is quite serious.\u201d\n\nNSCDC confirms\n\nMeanwhile, the NSCDC has identified the personnel killed in the attack as Mohammed Ibrahim, an Assistant Superintendent of Corps 1, Cheche Ahmed, an Assistant Superintendent of Corps 11, Yunusa Mahmam, an Inspector of Corps, and Bala Abdullahi, a Corps Assistant 1.\n\nThe driver of the vehicle was also identified as Inspector Bala Adamu.\n\nA statement released Monday in Abuja by the Corps spokesman, DCC Odumosu Olusola, said the injured driver had been rushed to the hospital for medical attention.\n\nOlusola said: \u201cThe explosion occurred along Galadiman Kogo axis in Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State at the early hours of Monday morning involving some officers and men of NSCDC Niger Command attached to Shiroro Hydro Power Station, Shiroro, Niger State on a routine patrol in the early hours of Monday morning when their patrol vehicle stepped on a buried land mine which exploded immediately killing all occupants except the driver who is currently in a very critical condition.\n\n\u201cThe Commandant General, NSCDC, Ahmed Abubakar Audi, PhD, mni has commiserated with families of the deceased officers and men who paid the supreme price in service to the Nation and reassured residents of Niger of the Corp\u2019s resolve and commitment to the security of lives and property of Nigerians without deterrence.\u201d\n\nWe won\u2019t relent -NGSG\n\nIn a related development, Niger state Governor Abubakar Sani Bello expressed sadness over the attack coming barely three weeks after similar attacks during which many lives and properties were lost and several residents displaced.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the governor regretted that the attack was occurring at the time his administration was actively supporting the federal government-led efforts to overcome the menace of terrorism.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs Government, we are determined not to hands up to these dare-devil terrorists. Niger State is actively supporting the federal government led efforts to overcome the menace of these heartless terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe governor lamented that his people had come under several attacks for no fault of theirs, adding that their lifestyle had been forced to change.\n\n\u201cI feel and share in their pains. I will not rest until their lifestyle returns to normal,\u201d he assured.\n\nWhile commiserating with the entire people of Shiroro local government area, particularly the affected communities, the governor re-iterated his commitment to taking every necessary steps to assuage the sufferings of the affected people by providing humanitarian interventions.\n\nHe also condoled with the security agencies over the loss of some of their personnel, sympathised with their family members, stressing that their sacrifices would not go in vain.\n\nWhile reiterating the state government\u2019s commitment to winning the war within the limited resources at its disposal, he prayed God to grant quick recovery to those injured and repose of the souls of those killed.\n\nKebbi\n\nSimilarly, there were fears in Kebbi state as bandits continued to kill and maim innocent citizens, forcing them to leave their places of abode in Zuru Emirate.\n\nThe bandits, according report, had gradually advanced to Koko/Besse local government area following a recent attack on the major trunk \u2018A\u2019 road linking the state with the south-western part of the country.\n\nIt was gathered that about 20 towns and villages were sacked in Zuru emirate of Sakaba and Danko/Wasagu local government areas.\n\nThe inhabitants were forced to take shelter at the Internally Displaced Camps(IDPs)\u2019 camps in schools and other government buildings where security agents were also drafted to keep watch over them.\n\nThe villages recently attacked by the bandits in the emirate include, Shagero, Agale, Madi, Unguwar Chika, Tikawa, Mazarko, Sakaba, Makuku, Sanganga, Jan Birni, Doka, Leke, kwaganu, Daura, Kango, Giriza, Unguwar Zaure, Gareji and Doka Bera. In these towns and villages, an undisclosed number of people were killed while different species of animals like cows, sheep and goats were rustled.\n\nBarely three days ago, the bandits reportedly crossed over to Yauri and Koko/Besse local government areas where they attacked motorists plying the highway connecting south-western part of the country en route to Lagos.\n\nBagudu cautions\n\nSpeaking during his visit to the IDPs\u2019 camps, Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu warned the people against extra-judicial killings of innocent persons or labelling a particular tribe as solely guilty of banditry.\n\nThe IDPs were forced out of their towns and villages as a result of attacks by bandits, which led to the death of five persons in recent attack at Makuku Sargagi and Unguwar Zaure.\n\nDuring the visit, Governor Bagudu rejoiced with Sakina Sanusi Maman Yan Biyu who gave birth to twins in the course of running away from bandits.\n\nHe assured the IDPs that efforts were on to resettle them in their various places while additional security personnel would be deployed to reinforce security.",

Some of them went further to test the legality of a serving governor to act as the national chairman of a political party.\n\nLast year, APC Governors proposed that the national convention be conducted in February to elect a new set of NWC members.\n\nThe proposal of the governors was later approved by the President, which led to the emergence of the initial February 26 date.\n\nBarely a week to the scheduled date, the caretaker committee informed INEC that it had fixed March 26 to conduct its zonal congresses, but kept mum on the national convention.\n\nAmid reports over the uncertainty of conducting the national convention on Saturday, the party affirmed that it had postponed the exercise by one month.",

          "text": "The United States and its European allies are set to announce fresh sanctions against Russia on Tuesday after President Vladimir Putin recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, deepening Western fears of a new war in Europe.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said two soldiers were killed and 12 wounded in shelling by pro-Russian separatists in the east in the past 24 hours, the most casualties this year, as ceasefire violations increased.\n\nPutin\u2019s announcement on Monday, and his signing of a decree on the deployment of Russian troops to the two breakaway regions, drew international condemnation and immediate U.S. sanctions, with President Joe Biden signing an executive order to halt U.S. business activity in the breakaway regions.\n\nRising fears of war pushed oil prices to a seven-year high on Tuesday, while safe-havens currencies including the yen rallied and global stocks tumbled.\n\n\u201cThe United States will impose sanctions on Russia for this clear violation of international law and Ukraine sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d Linda Thomas-Greenfield, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters after an emergency meeting of the Security Council late on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe can, will, and must stand united in our calls for Russia to withdraw its forces, return to the diplomatic table and work toward peace.\u201d read more\n\nBut a senior U.S. official said the deployment of Russian troops to the breakaway regions did not merit the harshest sanctions the United States and its allies had prepared in the event of a full-scale invasion, as Russia already had troops there.\n\nA senior British government minister said it was clear Putin had chosen confrontation over dialogue and Britain would respond with sanctions.\n\n\u201cYou can conclude that the invasion of Ukraine has begun,\u201d Health Secretary Sajid Javid said.\n\nHe said the situation was as grave as the 1962 Cuban missile crisis when a confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.\n\nRussia has denied planning to attack its neighbour but it has massed troops on Ukraine\u2019s borders and threatened \u201cmilitary-technical\u201d action unless it receives sweeping security guarantees, including that Ukraine will never join NATO.\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the recognition of the two regions did not affect Russia\u2019s readiness for talks with the United States, the Tass news agency reported.\n\nAn EU diplomat said separately the meeting would consider how to act on a statement made by EU leaders on Monday that the bloc would \u201creact with sanctions against those involved in this illegal act\u201d.\n\nChina said it was concerned about the worsening situation and called for all parties to exercise restraint while Japan said it was ready to join international sanctions on Moscow in the event of a full-scale invasion.\n\nVassily Nebenzia, Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, warned Western powers to \u201cthink twice\u201d and not worsen the situation.\n\nA Reuters witness saw tanks and other military hardware moving through the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk. No insignia were visible on the vehicles.\n\nWEST CONSIDERS HOW TO ACT\n\nBritain said it had drawn up sanctions to target those complicit in the violation of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, and those measures would come into force on Tuesday.\n\nEuropean Union member states\u2019 ambassadors will meet to discuss possible sanctions with limited sanctions a possible option, an EU official said. read moreAn EU diplomat said separately the meeting would consider how to act on a statement made by EU leaders on Monday that the bloc would \u201creact with sanctions against those involved in this illegal act\u201d.\n\nChina said it was concerned about the worsening situation and called for all parties to exercise restraint while Japan said it was ready to join international sanctions on Moscow in the event of a full-scale invasion.\n\nVassily Nebenzia, Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, warned Western powers to \u201cthink twice\u201d and not worsen the situation.\n\nA Reuters witness saw tanks and other military hardware moving through the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk. No insignia were visible on the vehicles.\n\nRussia needed to ratify its friendship treaties with the regions before it could discuss matters like the exact borders of the territories, RIA news agency reported, citing the foreign ministry. Russia\u2019s parliament is expected to review friendship treaties on Tuesday.\n\nIn a lengthy televised address on Monday packed with grievances against the West, a visibly angry Putin said eastern Ukraine was ancient Russian land.\n\nPutin delved into history as far back as the Ottoman empire and expressed frustration that Russia\u2019s demands for a rewriting of Europe\u2019s security arrangements had been repeatedly rebuffed.\n\n\u201cI deem it necessary to make a decision that should have been made a long time ago \u2013 to immediately recognise the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic and the Lugansk People\u2019s Republic,\u201d Putin said.\n\nPutin has for years worked to restore Russia\u2019s influence over nations that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union, with Ukraine holding an important place in his ambitions. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, and Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia.\n\nThe rouble extended its losses as Putin spoke, at one point sliding beyond 80 per dollar.\n\nA French presidential official said the speech \u201cmixed various considerations of a rigid and paranoid nature\u201d.",

          "title": "Dubai Airport Busiest for Global Travel as Virus Persists",
          "text": "Dubai\u2019s main airport said Tuesday it has retained its top place as the world\u2019s busiest for international travel with around 29 million passengers shuttling through the global gateway last year.\n\nThe 2021 passenger figures are encouraging for the tourism-driven economy of Dubai, regarded as a critical link between East and West. The numbers are sign that international travel has picked up somewhat since the coronavirus pandemic spawned unprecedented global lockdowns and border closures in 2020. Last year\u2019s figure represents a 12% increase in traffic at Dubai International Airport compared to 2020, which had recorded nearly 26 million travelers.\n\nStill, even with 29.1 million passengers crisscrossing last year through Dubai International Airport, or DXB, the figure is nowhere near the pre-pandemic milestone of 86.4 million in annual traffic logged by the airport in 2019.\n\nDubai is currently hosting the six-month-long World\u2019s Fair, which was delayed by a year due to the pandemic. Expo 2020, which opened in October and runs until the end of March, has attracted millions of visitors as well as heads of state, royalty and celebrities, helping to further cement Dubai\u2019s reputation as a global destination. It\u2019s unclear, though, what the overall contribution of the Expo has been to Dubai\u2019s economic recovery.\n\nJust over 70% of Dubai\u2019s airport traveler figures last year represent arrivals, with much of that likely residents traveling to and from the emirate. Prior to the pandemic, around half of all passenger figures were transiting through Dubai.\n\nCEO of Dubai Airports, Paul Griffiths, said DXB forecasts 57 million travelers to come through the airport this year, and a full recovery to pre-pandemic figures by 2024.\n\n\u201cDubai has done such a good job in reassuring travelers. It\u2019s a safe city to visit and to come and holiday and do business. So I think the the actual trends to recovery are very encouraging, indeed,\u201d Griffiths said.\n\nIt marks the eighth consecutive year that Dubai International Airport clinches the mantle of the world\u2019s busiest for international travel, surpassing London\u2019s Heathrow and Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson for global travelers, although the latter is among the busiest in terms of overall passenger traffic.\n\nThe largest share of traffic to Dubai came from India, with 4.2 million travelers, followed by Pakistan, with 1.8 million travelers last year. A key growth market for travel to and from Dubai is neighboring Saudi Arabia, which is actively working to attract business and tourism in direct competition with Dubai and the wider United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe UAE is home to more than 100,000 British citizens. Dubai\u2019s main airport logged 1.2 million passengers from the U.K. last year, including 77,000 in December alone.\n\nDubai, under orders from the United Arab Emirates aviation authority, was forced to ground all passenger flights and close its airports for eight weeks in spring of 2020. Unlike the UAE\u2019s capital of Abu Dhabi, though, Dubai quickly reopened its doors to travelers. Dubai has not required proof of COVID-19 vaccination to enter and does not require a negative virus test to enter most places. This approach has not come without a cost. The UAE was red-listed as a \u201cdo not travel\u201d country by the U.K., U.S. and other nations for much of last year.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re now trying to do is campaign globally for the relaxation of travel restrictions and testing,\u201d Griffiths said. \u201cBut we now see the requirement for that is receding. We just need to get governments to recognize that fact and act quickly to remove the remaining travel restrictions.\u201d\n\nOverall, coronavirus infection figures remain relatively low across the UAE. The country has been aggressive in inoculating its population of more than 9 million people against COVID-19, most of whom are foreign residents and all of whom have been able to receive the vaccine free of charge.\n\nWhile masks in public spaces are still required in Dubai, life in the city-state can otherwise feel unhindered by the pandemic. Just this week, Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic stepped onto the tennis court to compete in the Dubai Duty Free Tennis championship, his first tournament since being ejected from Australia and missing the year\u2019s first Grand Slam event over his refusal to be vaccinated against COVID-19.",
