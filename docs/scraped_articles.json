A situation report (SITREP) by one of the intelligence services sighted by PRNigeria said that the notorious terrorist leader must have been killed during the struggle for power between the Boko Haram and the ISWAP groups. The reports stated that \u201con May 19, 2021, about 1829hours, ISWAP top fighter, Baana Duguri-on this selector \u2013 geolocated around Sambisa forest, Pulka Gwoza LGA BRS, informed ISWAP logistics commander, Modu Sulum- geolocated opposite General Hospital Konduga LGA Borno state, that they killed Abubakar Shekau over all BH leader in Sambisa Forest date.\n\n\u201cDuguri disclosed that the ISWAP fighters\u2019 team surrounded the BH leader with his team and shooting ensued between the two factions. Duguri further added that Shekau detonated a bomb and killed himself when he observed that the ISWAP fighters wanted to capture him alive.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, Duguri informed Sulum that the two sides also lost some fighters during the shooting. He averred that even yesterday, ISWAP was pursuing Abubakar Shekau and he discarded his cap and ran, but, today, the pursuit continued and he was finally killed. Duguri asked Modu Sulum if the other BH members who fled are returning to their houses?\n\n\u201cIn his response, Sulum rejoiced over the death of Abubakar Shekau and glorified God over the success. He also said few BH members are returning to their houses.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerian military has placed all Borno State Commands of the Nigerian Army and Air Force on alert. The troops have lately been carrying out discreet bombardments around the Sambisa axis and Lake Chad axis, which may have triggered the current crisis and strife between the two, hitherto, collaborators.\n\nFindings revealed that ISWAP has been in pursuit of Shekau, which led to him discarding his camp and running off until he was rounded up yesterday, which led to his death.

          "title": "Southern Govs, Others Rebuke Malami for Opposing Open Grazing Ban",
          "text": "\u2022Say cattle restriction would be vigorously enforced\n\n\u2022Afenifere, Senate spokesman demand minister\u2019s removal\n\nDeji Elumoye, Olawale Ajimotokan, Alex Enumah, Udora Orizu in Abuja, James Sowole in Akure and Hammed Shittu in Ilorin\n\nThe Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), yesterday came under fire for criticising the open grazing ban by the 17 Southern governors at their recent meeting in Asaba, Delta State.\n\nMalami, while fielding questions on a live TV programme on Wednesday had kicked against the open grazing ban.\n\nThe AGF compared the Southern governors\u2019 decision to Northern governors banning spare parts trading in the North, considering the fact that the majority of spare parts traders in the North are from the South.\n\nHe had said: \u201cIt is about constitutionality. Within the context of the freedoms enshrined in our constitution, can you deny a right of a Nigerian? It is as good as saying maybe the Northern governors coming together to say that they prohibit spare parts trading in the North. Does it hold water? Does it hold water for a Northern governor to come and state expressly that he now prohibits spare parts trading in the North?\u201d\n\nReacting to Malami\u2019s comments, the Southern governors dared him to challenge their decision in the court, saying that there is no going back on the open grazing ban.\n\nSome senior lawyers and the Founder of Stanbic IBTC and Anap Foundation, Mr. Atedo Peterside, also criticised the minister over his comments.\n\nHowever, the pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, and the spokesman of the Senate, Senator Ajibola Bashir, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to remove the minister for opposing the ban.\n\nThe South-east Governors\u2019 Forum stated that those who oppose the ban want the killings by herdsmen to continue.\n\nThe Chairman of the Southern Governors Forum and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, described Malami\u2019s opposition to the open grazing ban as \u201cwicked and arrogant.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu, in a statement titled \u2018Our decision is irreversible and will be enforced,\u2019 asked the AGF to challenge the governor\u2019s position on open grazing in court.\n\nHe added that Malami\u2019s comparison of open grazing with the selling of spare parts is annoying.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe AGF is quoted to have said that this reasoned decision, among others, is akin to banning all spare parts dealers in the Northern parts of the country and is unconstitutional\n\n\u201cIt is most unfortunate that the AGF is unable to distil issues as expected of a Senior Advocate. Nothing can be more disconcerting. This outburst should, ordinarily, not elicit a response from reasonable people who know the distinction between a legitimate business that is not in any way injurious and a certain predilection for anarchy.\n\n\u201cClinging to an anachronistic model of animal husbandry, which is evidently injurious to the harmonious relationship between the herders and the farmers as well as the local populace, is wicked and arrogant.\n\n\u201cComparing this anachronism, which has led to the loss of lives, farmlands, and property, and engendered untold hardship on the host communities, with buying and selling of auto parts is not only strange. It, annoyingly, betrays a terrible mindset.\n\n\u201cMr. Malami is advised to approach the court to challenge the legality of the laws of the respective states banning open grazing and decision of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum taken in the interest of their people. We shall be most willing to meet him in court.\n\n\u201cThe decision to ban open grazing stays. It will be enforced with vigour.\u201d\n\nAfenifere, Senate Spokesman Demand Minister\u2019s Removal\n\nAlso reacting, Afenifere said the comment of Malami on the ban of open grazing by Southern governors, has exposed him as the most unfit for the office of the attorney-general and minister of justice.\n\nThe organisation, in a statement yesterday by the Secretary-General, Chief Olusola Ebiseni, said the comment of Malami did not come as a surprise to a discerning mind in view of his positions on certain national issues.\n\nIt said Malami\u2019s comments only pitiably exposed him as being most unfit for the office of attorney-general, having always allowed his sectarian disposition to becloud his eminent qualifications.\n\nIt said: \u201cMalami does not want serious-minded people to accord him and his high office each time he accepts to play the roles of errand boy and spokesperson of the Miyetti Allah and their herder-members.\n\n\u201cEach time Malami perceives a threat to the interests of Fulani herdsmen, he is quick to latch on to constitutional provisions, which are not relevant to the object of discourse.\n\n\u201cHe was readily on hand to vehemently denounce the Amotekun, South-west regional security initiative, as being targeted against Fulani herdsmen and so declared it unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cWhen challenged to approach the court, he had since developed cold feet.\u201d\n\nAfenifere stated that it is animal that is being prohibited from grazing openly and being moved by foot and urged Malami not to extend the inalienable human rights in the constitution to animals in the defence of a culture, which gives more care to cattle than human beings.\n\n\u201cIt is the same primitive mindset of which the Buhari administration has threatened the Governor of Benue State that he would have no place except he allowed a free reign of animals,\u201d the group said.\n\nIn his reaction, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Senator Ajibola Basiru, criticised Malami over his \u201cless than dignifying\u201d argument of equating open grazing with Southerners selling spare parts in the North.\n\nHe called on Buhari to, without further delay, remove Malami from office.\n\nThe senator representing Osun Central Senatorial District of Osun State, who spoke in his personal capacity yesterday, said equating the activities of archaic nomadic herdsmen destroying people\u2019s means of livelihood with others legitimately carrying on businesses by selling spare parts in their shops stood logic on its head.\n\nHe stated that the AGF might have forgotten that Nigeria is a federal system with the state governments empowered to make and implement laws for the peace, order and good government of or any part of their respective state.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis power is derived from the constitution, which with the Land Use Act vested on the governors the management of all land within the territory of the state.\n\nThe lawmaker challenged the AGF to cite relevant sections of the constitution, which allow the herders to trespass on other people\u2019s land and destroy the crops in the guise of freedom of movement, adding that AGF\u2019s comment is less than patriotic.\n\nFalana, Other SANs, Peterside knock Malami\n\nSome senior lawyers have also berated Malami over his comments.\n\nMr. John Baiyeshea (SAN) described Malami\u2019s statement as demeaning, divisive and unfortunate.\n\nHe said: \u201cHe is not the Attorney-General for the Northern region for God\u2019s sake. His statement is so sectional and abusive. There is no iota of law in what he said.\n\n\u201cOpen grazing has been a bone of contention all over the country for so many years. Cows are (mis)led into people\u2019s farms by herders and they eat up the products in the farms. The farm owners cannot or should not even complain at all. The Fulani herdsmen will kill anyone who complains.\n\n\u201cSo, many valuable lives have been lost through such murderous acts of unrepentant savages. They are always so quick to kill, and nothing happens to them. They are never brought to justice. They seem to be the only tribe that has the license to kill, steal and destroy like the devil.\n\n\u201cFreedom of movement in the constitution, which the AGF and others in his camp are using to justify the evil being perpetrated by the Fulani is for human beings and not animals like cows.\n\n\u201cAnd such movements by human beings based on the freedom guaranteed by the constitution must be for lawful purposes. So, the spare parts sellers \u2013 of which our Igbo brothers are famous and successful entrepreneurs as geniuses \u2013 are doing legitimate businesses.\n\n\u201cIf they engage in other illegal acts, they will run afoul of the law and will surely be checked. They do not use that for land grabbing or expansionist activities to annex other people\u2019s territories.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Dayo Akinlaja (SAN) said the position taken by Malami was not supported by the constitution.\n\n\u201cTo start with, the right to freedom of movement alluded to by him is accorded by Section 41 of the Constitution to Nigerian Citizens as different from Nigerian cows or cattle. This simply translates to the fact that while it is beyond a debate that every citizen is at liberty to move freely and reside anywhere in Nigeria, it does not follow that cows and cattle enjoy the same measure of latitude under the constitution.\n\n\u201cThe right given to citizens cannot be extrapolated to cows and cattle, simply put. Granted that it is a legitimate business to rear cows and herd cattle, the point is that if by doing any business, in any particular manner, the defence, public safety, public order, public morality or public health of Nigeria and Nigerians are being jeopardised, the constitution allows for the business to be prevented by law from being done in that manner. This is by virtue of Section 45 of the selfsame constitution that allows for the exercise of fundamental rights by the Citizens of Nigeria,\u201d he stated.\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), also faulted Malami\u2019s position.\n\nFalana said it was funny that Malami was ignorant of the fact that Northern governors had banned open grazing since January.\n\nAccording to him, comparing spare parts trading with open grazing is nonsensical.\n\nFalana stated that spare parts traders pay rents and have been known to be peaceful in their conduct.\n\nHe said the AGF\u2019s comparison was not applicable as the sellers of motor spare parts have not been accused of killing fellow citizens and destroying their property.\n\n\u201cBesides, those who sell spare parts outside their states of origin either acquire properties or pay rent for their lawful business,\u201d Falana stated.\n\nHe added that contrary to Malami\u2019s claim, only humans are guaranteed freedom of movement by the constitution and not animals.\n\nAnother human rights lawyer, Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN), also tackled Malami.\n\nAdegboruwa said the AGF lacked the powers to make proclamations for the country.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe proponents of open grazing support it with the right to freedom of movement granted under section 41 of the constitution. This section cannot be interpreted to violate other constitutional provisions, especially section 43 that grants the right to private or public property.\n\n\u201cYou cannot deploy the right to movement of person and cattle to violate the right of another citizen to own property, such as land or farmland, or else you become a trespasser. It is in this regard that I disagree with the honourable Attorney-General of the Federation when he said that the ban on open grazing is unconstitutional. That cannot represent a proper interpretation of the constitution, with all due respect.\u201d\n\nHe urged state Houses of Assembly that have proscribed open grazing to make laws to support their declarations.\n\nOn his part, Peterside warned that linking the resolution to ban open grazing in the South with right to free movement of persons is \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d\n\nReacting to the minister\u2019s comments, Peterside tweeted yesterday that freedom of movement of persons does not extend to cattle.\n\n\u201cIt is disingenuous to link a ban on open grazing to the constitutional right to the free movement of persons.\n\n\u201cThe latter does not extend to the free movement of cattle, goats, sheep etc through farms with the attendant destruction of somebody\u2019s harvest,\u201d he said.\n\nUmahi: Ban Opponents Want Killings to Continue\n\nIn a related development, the Chairman of South-east Governors\u2019 Forum and Ebonyi State Governor, Mr. David Umahi, has said that those kicking against the ban on open grazing as canvassed by Southern governors want killings to continue.\n\nAsked to respond to the claim by Malami that banning open grazing in the South is like banning the sale of spare parts in the North, Umahi told State House reporters in Abuja that those who hold that view misunderstood the situation.\n\nThe governor added that the South has no grazing routes, and allowing cows to move freely would mean trespassing on people\u2019s property.\n\nAccording to him, herder-farmer conflict gave rise to crises and killings, including the setting up of the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the South-east, we don\u2019t have grazing routes but in the North, we have cattle routes. Nobody is going to say ban open grazing in some areas in the North where there are cattle routes, where they move constitutionally from one point to the other. But in the South, there is no cattle route and for you to move from one point to the other, you have to move through farms, through population-dense areas. And this is what the Southern governors, South-east, in particular, are saying.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back to our traditional method of relationship, we will no longer allow you to take your cattle from one local government to the other. And the implication is that these foreign herders also come as mobile herders with AK-47, and so that is the source of conflicts.\n\n\u201cSo, anyone that is saying that there should be no ban is, on the other hand, saying that these killings should continue and that is what has birthed to ESN. \u201cWhether we support it as governors or we don\u2019t, the people tend to support it because the foreign herders pretending that they are rearing cattle are killing people.\n\nWase Shuts down Motion to Call Malami to Order Over His Comment\n\nMeanwhile, the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Idris Wase, at the plenary yesterday, shut down a motion by Hon. Solomon Bob (PDP, Rivers), seeking to call Malami to order over his comment on the ban on open grazing.\n\nBob, while raising a point of order (Order 6 of House Rules Book), accused the minister of making inciting comments.\n\nThe lawmaker described Malami\u2019s comments as disingenuous, irresponsible and loaded with incendiary trope and ethnic slur, praying that he should be called to order.\n\nHowever, the lawmaker was stopped midway through his point of order by Wase who was presiding the session.\n\nWase asked the lawmaker to take a seat, saying that the order was wrongly cited.\n\nHe said: \u201dThe order in which you are bringing this matter is wrong. It\u2019s either you bring it as a full motion but coming under matters of privilege is wrong so take your seat.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nWorld Trade Organisation (WTO) Director-General, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has said that intellectual property waiver alone will not be enough to narrow the huge COVID-19 vaccine supply gap between rich and poor countries.\n\nShe told the European Parliament that it was clear that discussions around vaccine patents alone would not suffice, saying that global leaders should do more to ensure that there is equitable production and distribution of the jabs.\n\nOkonjo-Iweala said developing countries had complained that the licensing process was cumbersome and should be improved upon.\n\nShe added that while it makes sense to protect research and innovation, it is also important to expand access to the vaccines.\n\nAccording to her, manufacturers should work to expand production, pointing to idle capacity in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand, Senegal, and South Africa among other developing nations.\n\nShe said: \u201cI am convinced that we can agree on a text that gives developing countries that kind of access and flexibility, whilst protecting research and innovation.\n\n\u201cTo have solved the unacceptable problem of inequity of access to vaccines, we have to be holistic. It\u2019s not one or the other.\u201d\n\nOkonjo-Iweala stressed the importance of diversifying vaccine manufacturing and to have more production taking place in Africa and Latin America to contain the pandemic.\n\nShe told the EU legislators that normal market forces for exports and imports couldn\u2019t apply when it comes to the life-or-death issue of COVID-19 vaccines, as many of the world\u2019s wealthiest nations are hoarding the shots for their own population when the crisis hits their home turf.\n\nShe said although the world could manufacture some five billion vaccine doses overall, it now requires twice or three times that capacity due to the spread of the contagion.\n\n\u201cOne of the main challenges is diversifying vaccine production, which is now 80 per cent concentrated in 10 European, North American and South Asian nations, Okonjo-Iweala said, calling the situation a problem that \u201chas come home to roost.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not normal that Africa, with 1.3 billion people, has 0.17 per cent of the manufacturing capacity of the world. So this has to change.\u201d\n\nEU nations have criticised a call by the United States to waive COVID-19 vaccine patents as a way to increase supplies, saying that the move would yield no short-term or intermediate improvement and could even have a negative impact.\n\nHowever, Okonjo-Iweala sought to remain neutral on the issue, saying that WTO members could find the flexibility to make sure more vaccines are produced in developing nations.\n\nSouth Africa and India have urged fellow WTO members to waive intellectual property rights on vaccines to boost production.\n\nPoorer countries that make up half the world\u2019s population have received just 17 per cent of doses, a situation the World Health Organisation (WHO) has labelled \u201cvaccine apartheid\u201d.\n\nThe EU outlined a plan on Wednesday it sees as a more effective way of boosting output, using existing WTO rules, rather than a waiver, noting that countries can grant licences to manufacturers to produce with or without the patent holder\u2019s consent.\n\nIn March, Nigeria received nearly four million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), from Mumbai through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX), a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to the vaccines.\n\nThe doses have now been largely exhausted even as India, a major contributor to the COVAX facility, battles to curb the growing number of infections and deaths in the Asian country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja, Bassey Inyang in Calabar and Sylvester Idowu in Warri\n\nAll Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday hit home a rebound with the defection of Cross River State Governor, Prof. Ben Ayade, from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nAyade, who lost out at the recent state congress of the PDP, helped the APC to regain a foothold in the South-south, which had come under the full control of the main opposition party with the defection and reelection of Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, last year.\n\nUntil yesterday, the PDP controlled the six South-south states of Akwa-Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Edo, Delta and Rivers.\n\nAPC leaders had made efforts to make inroads into the oil-rich region in the 2019 election with the defection of the PDP Senate Minority Leader, Senator Godswill Akpabio, who led the ruling party\u2019s charge but was roundly defeated.\n\nNext, it made an audacious move for Bayelsa State in the off-season governorship election, winning a pyrrhic victory, which was overturned by the Supreme Court due to the ineligibility of its deputy governorship candidate.\n\nBut the PDP downplayed its loss, urging its members in the state to remain steadfast in spite of the governor\u2019s defection.\n\n\u201cOur party calls on all critical stakeholders and teeming members of our party in Cross Rivers State to immediately pull together and ensure that all structure of our party in the state remains intact,\u201d it said in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan.\n\nThe party said it wished Ayade well in his new political sojourn as well as in his future endeavours.\n\nThe APC, however, congratulated Ayade for what it described as his wise and timely decision to leave a \u2018dead\u2019 PDP for \u201ca living and thriving party APC.\u201d\n\nThe National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, in a statement yesterday, said the total lack of internal democracy, which turned the PDP into a one-man show had caused frustration and alienated PDP governors and legislators from the party.\n\nAkpanudoedehe commended Ayade\u2019s decision to join forces with Buhari to build a better Nigeria as a member of the APC.\n\nThe Cross River State governor had after months of frustrations in the PDP elected to jump ship yesterday telling the APC governors who received him that he moved to put the state at the centre of national politics.\n\nAyade, who fell out with the PDP leadership after he lost control of the party structure to National Assembly members from the state attributed his decision to join APC to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s commitment to developing the country, and the need to join hands with the president to build a better Nigeria.\n\nThe Chairman of the APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, led a delegation of party bigwigs, including governors to Calabar to receive Ayade to the party.\n\nAyade announced his defection while hosting seven APC governors.\n\nBesides Bunu, other governors were: Dr. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State; Senator Hope Uzodimma of Imo State; Hon. Simon Lalong of Plateau State; Senator Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State; and Mr. Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State.\n\nAlso present was the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva.\n\nBefore formally defecting to the APC, he had held a two-hour meeting with the APC delegation.\n\nOthers at the meeting were the state Deputy Governor, Prof. Ivara Esu; Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Hon. Eteng Jones; and members of the state House of Assembly, some National Assembly members, members of the Cross River State Executive Council, local government chairmen, councillors and some stakeholders, including Senator Florence Ita-Giwa.\n\nAyade said with his defection, Cross River State had become an APC state and urged all its supporters and followers to go to their respective wards and register with his new party.\n\nHe added that he caved in to pressure to join APC because of Buhari and the realisation that Cross River, which has been emasculated economically following the ceding of its oil wells to Akwa Ibom State, needed to be in sync with the party at the centre.\n\nHe said: \u201cHaving seen and known the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and his commitment to this country, his nationalistic disposition and all the efforts he has made to bring Nigeria to where we are today, it is obvious that at this point, we needed to join hands with him to build a Nigeria that we can be proud of.\n\n\u201cWe need all governors to recognise that it is not the party that matters. It is character, it is honour, it is commitment to the vision of this great nation. We all need to work as a team ahead of the president by working towards building a prosperous country that the succession worries of 2023 will come without the fears and the worries the international community has for us.\n\n\u201cI believe that if every one of us as governor joins hands with Mr. President, I think we can sit on the same dining table and fashion out a way to govern this country.\u201d\n\nBuni expressed joy at Ayade\u2019s defection.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am here on behalf of the APC family to welcome His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Cross River State, formally to the APC. As from today, he is the leader of the party in the state.\u201d\n\nA chieftain of the APC from the state and former Senate Leader, Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba, also welcomed Ayade to the party.\n\nNdoma-Egba, in a statement yesterday, described Ayade\u2019s entry into the APC as a good development for the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs you join us in the progressives fold, my expectation is that your coming will enrich our internal democracy and I enjoin you to be consultative, inclusive, democratic, transparent and accountable because these are the hallmarks of the All Progressives Congress family.\n\n\u201cI also expect that your presence in the APC will further strengthen the party and improve our electoral fortunes in Cross River State.\u201d\n\nThe Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, described the defection of Ayade as liberation from the forces of retrogression.\n\nOmo-Agege, who is also the leader of APC in the South-south geo-political zone, hailed Ayade for seeing the need to improve his people\u2019s fortunes and further help cement national unity by bringing his state into the APC.\n\nHe said the governor had displayed uncommon courage in order to take Cross River State and the South-south out of the periphery to mainstream politics of the nation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Over 300 fighters loyal to the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) trained in Libya and other countries joined their colleagues in a long battle that led to the final fall of Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to a report by Daily Trust, a fierce battle that lasted several days between the two factions led to the death of dozens of vicious commanders and hundreds of foot soldiers from both sides, with multiple sources saying Shekau has killed himself or fatally injured himself to the extent that he might not survive.\n\nIt was gathered that most of the fighters that fought for the defeat of Shekau on Wednesday were aged between 12 and 30.\n\n\u201cThey are actually children of some ISWAP members killed over time,\u201d a security source said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOthers are youths sourced during raids on multiple islands around the Lake Chad. The ISWAP carefully selected the youths. It was therefore much easier for recruitment as some of the youths willingly joined the group and others were forcefully conscripted.\n\n\u201cSome of them were born during the wartime and others were very young when their parents joined the group around 2002. After their parents died because of illness or confrontation with Nigerian troops, the children naturally took over and when the group split into two in 2016, those that moved on their own or forcefully taken to the shores of Lake Chad under the umbrella of ISWAP had an upper hand in terms of training because they were taken to Libya for training in guerrilla warfare and other purposes.\n\n\u201cOthers were sent to Syria and Somalia\u2026 They were taken to many countries abroad for training. However, those that came back especially between March and April this year took an active part in confronting Shekau in the last few days. They launched a serious offensive alongside other top commanders and fighters already on ground and they succeeded in taking over,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother credible source said some of the 300 youths were trained as \u201cmedical doctors, paramedics, engineers, IT specialists, bomb specialists and mechanics.\u201d\n\nHe added that among them were women \u201cwho serve as nurses or cooks while others have gun-handling skills, meaning they can partake in combat operations.\u201d\n\nHe said after their return from abroad, they were camped at a village called Shuwaram in Kukawa Local Government Area of Borno State.\n\nIt had been reported that ISWAP fighters, armed with sophisticated weapons had penetrated the infamous Sambisa Forest from different fronts and surrounded the place Shekau used as a safe sanctuary for years.\n\nThey reportedly killed many of his fighters and forced him to surrender.\n\nA signal from security sources indicated that when Shekau discovered that it was the end of the road for him, and ISWAP fighters had directed him to relinquish his position as the grand amir and successor to the founder of the group Mohammed Yusuf, he opted for suicide by detonating the explosives he strapped to his body.\n\nHowever, the AFP news agency reported that when Shekau reached the point of no return as he was surrounded by ISWAP fighters, he shot himself in the chest, fell on the ground while bleeding profusely but was whisked away to an unknown destination by some of his surviving loyal fighters.\n\nAnother source said ahead of the invasion of Sambisa by the factional group, one of the top commanders of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and his lieutenants had visited the shores of the Lake Chad in the company with ISWAP leader Goni Mustafa.\n\n\u201cThe entourage were seen on two boats with ISIS flag. Some of those in the entourage were light-skinned people possibly from Libya or Syria. It was only Mustafa that was black. They first visited Marte before they proceeded to Sabon Tumbu.\n\n\u201cThey also visited Kirta, Kusuma and Kwallaram where they held meetings with commanders and other fighters,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe source said after the strategy meeting, the visiting terrorists left and from that time, the ISWAP fighters started mobilising ahead of launching attacks on Sambisa Forest.\n\n\u201cSome of them gathered at Kurnuwa, Kayuwa and Tumbin Jaki before they launched the offensive. They had RPGs, GPMGs and AA guns on some vehicles,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the attackers also moved their \u201cvulnerable women and children\u201d from the Marte area to some locations around Kukawa.\n\nAnother source said before they aimed at Sambisa Forest, the ISWAP fighters were responsible for the recent attacks in Damasak, Marte, Mainok, Dikwa and Maiduguri towns in Borno as well as in Geidam in Yobe State.\n\n\u201cThey did not target civilians in most of their attacks; rather, they launched attacks against constituted authorities including security forces. The group handpicked and killed people perceived as enemies such as members of a volunteer security group, CJTF.\n\n\u201cOn the other side, Shekau and his followers operated from the southern parts of Borno State, mostly around the Mandara Mountains, Sambisa National Park and the Alagarno forest. The group had carried out several deadly attacks on its targets including civilians. Shekau was strict on his followers and did not tolerate rebellious behaviour\u2026He had killed several of his renegade commanders and that was why many of those alive ditched him,\u201d he said.\n\nDaily Trust also reported that before the ISWAP fighters moved en masse to Sambisa, military operatives had launched several attacks on their hideouts in the northern parts of Borno State while air raids continued unabated.\n\n\u201cThe military had sustained onslaught against the group which has its hideouts in the semi-arid landscape with sparse vegetation. Their enclaves are being decimated and with time they will have no hiding place,\u201d he said.\n\nA source said the group allegedly resolved to dislodge Shekau with the intent of relocating to Sambisa and the mountainous areas to evade air attacks by the military jets.\n\n\u201cIt was not difficult for the group to locate and launch an attack on the Shekau-led base in Sambisa. There was fierce confrontation before Shekau succumbed and agreed to negotiate with ISWAP commanders. It was during the meeting that an explosion occurred and it was not clear whether or not Shekau was among those killed in the scene,\u201d the source said. He said it was likely that Shekau had survived the offensive and fled to another hideout.\n\n\u201cHe had survived several attacks in which he was proclaimed dead,\u201d he said.\n\nThe source said some of the followers of Shekau who were forced to flee the violent confrontation had sought refuge in different locations in the forest and were ready to pay \u201cdeep allegiance\u201d to anybody declared as overall leader.\n\nA security situation report trending on social media said Shekau must have been killed during the struggle.\n\nThe reports stated that: \u201cOn 19th May 2021, about 1829hours, ISWAP top fighter Baana Duguri-on this selector \u2013 geolocated around Sambisa Forest, Pulka, Gwoza LGA, BRS, informed ISWAP logistics commander Modu-Sulum- geolocated opposite General Hospital Konduga LGA Borno State that they killed Abubakar Shekau, overall BH leader in Sambisa Forest.\n\n\u201cDuguri disclosed that the ISWAP fighters\u2019 team surrounded the BH leader with his team and shooting ensued between the 2 factions.

          "text": "A nameless Fulani group said to be a faction of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria in the Oke-Ogun area of Oyo state on Thursday alleged of planned terror attacks in the state.\n\nThe group, through its Chairman, Umar Dogo and Secretary, Joni Yayi, alleged that the sons of the embattled Seriki Fulani of Igangan, Seriki Salihu Abdulkadir, who fled the state following an ultimatum given by Sunday Igboho in January, were behind the planned terror attacks.\n\nThe group also alleged that the sons of the embattled Seriki Fulani have been training bandits in the state.\n\nThe group called the attention of the Oyo State Government, security agents, Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III, and community leaders in the state to the security threat.\n\nDogo and Yayi said the youths are strategising, harbouring criminals, and recruiting bandits, kidnappers, and robbers to carry out all kinds of criminal activities in the state.\n\nAccording to a statement signed by the duo, criminals are being recruited to terrorise the people in the state.\n\nThe group said out of the eight people fingered in the sinister plot, three of them are biological sons of the embattled Seriki Fulani.\n\nAbdulkadir left the state recently after his house and cars were burnt by youths in Igangan over his alleged involvement in kidnapping and banditry.\n\nThe statement identified the following people as part of the plot: Maman Saliu, Ibrahim Saliu, and Aliu Saliu (who are presently in Ilorin, Kwara State). The three are said to be the sons of the embattled Seriki Fulani.\n\nOthers include Mamudu Abagu (from Iganna); Alhaji Mumini, immediate past Chairman of Meyetti Allah (Abeokuta branch); Hajia Aminat (from Oyo) and Alhaji Lawal Galadima, also from Oyo.\n\nThe statement reads in part, \"The aforementioned people, our feeler from the Fulani community in Oke-Ogun and Ibarapa hinted that they were dissatisfied over the plan to remove the embattled Serkin Fulani Alhaji Abdulkadir Saliu by some Fulanis in Oyo state.\n\n\"Therefore their plans, if successful, may lead to ethnic conflicts that can lead to civil unrest and breakdown of law and order. The source therefore called on the Oyo state government to beam its searchlight henceforth on Ibarapa, Oke-Ogun in particular and Oyo state in general as well as place aforementioned names on their watchlist.\"",

          "text": "A nameless Fulani group said to be a faction of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria in the Oke-Ogun area of Oyo state on Thursday alleged of planned terror attacks in the state.\n\nThe group, through its Chairman, Umar Dogo and Secretary, Joni Yayi, alleged that the sons of the embattled Seriki Fulani of Igangan, Seriki Salihu Abdulkadir, who fled the state following an ultimatum given by Sunday Igboho in January, were behind the planned terror attacks.\n\nThe group also alleged that the sons of the embattled Seriki Fulani have been training bandits in the state.\n\nThe group called the attention of the Oyo State Government, security agents, Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III, and community leaders in the state to the security threat.\n\nDogo and Yayi said the youths are strategising, harbouring criminals, and recruiting bandits, kidnappers, and robbers to carry out all kinds of criminal activities in the state.\n\nAccording to a statement signed by the duo, criminals are being recruited to terrorise the people in the state.\n\nThe group said out of the eight people fingered in the sinister plot, three of them are biological sons of the embattled Seriki Fulani.\n\nAbdulkadir left the state recently after his house and cars were burnt by youths in Igangan over his alleged involvement in kidnapping and banditry.\n\nThe statement identified the following people as part of the plot: Maman Saliu, Ibrahim Saliu, and Aliu Saliu (who are presently in Ilorin, Kwara State). The three are said to be the sons of the embattled Seriki Fulani.\n\nOthers include Mamudu Abagu (from Iganna); Alhaji Mumini, immediate past Chairman of Meyetti Allah (Abeokuta branch); Hajia Aminat (from Oyo) and Alhaji Lawal Galadima, also from Oyo.\n\nThe statement reads in part, \"The aforementioned people, our feeler from the Fulani community in Oke-Ogun and Ibarapa hinted that they were dissatisfied over the plan to remove the embattled Serkin Fulani Alhaji Abdulkadir Saliu by some Fulanis in Oyo state.\n\n\"Therefore their plans, if successful, may lead to ethnic conflicts that can lead to civil unrest and breakdown of law and order. The source therefore called on the Oyo state government to beam its searchlight henceforth on Ibarapa, Oke-Ogun in particular and Oyo state in general as well as place aforementioned names on their watchlist.\"",

          "text": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, says he abused alcohol and took drugs to numb the pain of the death of Princess Diana, his mum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 36-year-old, who had previously likened his \u201cunbelievably tough\u201d split from the royal family to the experience of his late mother, brought the latest revelation to light during his new Apple TV+ show.\n\nThe AppleTV+ docuseries titled \u2018The Me You Can\u2019t See\u2019 is co-created by Harry and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nDiana died in August 1997, in a car crash in the Pont de l\u2019Alma tunnel in Paris while the driver was fleeing the paparazzi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was willing to drink, I was willing to take drugs, I was willing to try and do the things that made me feel less like I was feeling,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut I slowly became aware that, OK, I wasn\u2019t drinking Monday to Friday, but I would probably drink a week\u2019s worth in one day on a Friday or a Saturday night.\n\n\u201cAnd I would find myself drinking, not because I was enjoying it but because I was trying to mask something.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarry, while opening up on his mental health, revealed that he has been in therapy for four years to heal himself from his past.\n\nThe duke also claimed his family didn\u2019t speak on Diana\u2019s death, leaving him to face the mental distress of press attention.\n\n\u201cMy father used to say to me when I was younger, he used to say to both William and I: \u2018Well it was like that for me so it\u2019s going to be like that for you\u2019. That doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cBecause you suffered doesn\u2019t mean that your kids have to suffer, in fact, quite the opposite. If you suffered, do everything you can to make sure whatever negative experiences you had, that you can make it right for your kids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe clicking of cameras and the flashing of cameras makes my blood boil. It makes me angry and takes me back to what happened to my mum and my experience as a kid.\u201d\n\nThe duke described the time when he was 28 to 32 as a \u201cnightmare\u201d marked for its panic attacks and severe anxiety. He added that he was often \u201cfreaking out\u201d every time he got in a car or saw a camera.\n\nHarry said he began therapy four years ago and was encouraged to seek help by Meghan Markle, his wife, after they had an argument.\n\n\u201cI knew that if I didn\u2019t do the therapy and fix myself, that I was going to lose this woman who I could see spending the rest of my life with. There was a lot of learning right at the beginning of our relationship,\u201d he noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn moving to the US, the duke added: \u201cI\u2019m now more comfortable in my own skin. I don\u2019t get panic attacks. I\u2019ve learned more about myself in the past four years than in the 32 years before it.\u201d\n\nThe spotlight had beamed on Harry and Meghan in March following their explosive interview with Oprah wherein they bared lurid details of their struggles with the British royal family.\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nMost people who started using mobile phones in the 2000s became familiar with USSD through loading and checking airtime balance. With time, mobile banking became a major use case; again for airtime transactions, but also for buying internet data, sending money and paying bills.\n\nUnlike mobile apps that need to be downloaded and installed, USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, if you insist) is lightweight and straightforward to use.\n\nDial the code for the desired service, follow the instructions e.g. \u201cpress 1 to Check Balance\u201d on each page and, provided there isn\u2019t some \u201cconnection failure\u201d or \u201centry error\u201d, your wishes will come true.\n\nA misconception is that USSD is for people who use basic phones but the feature has become mainstream even among smartphone users in Africa. A study of smartphone users in Bangladesh, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa showed that 87% of all financial-related transactions were conducted via USSD, with only 13% via mobile app.\n\nSo, USSD works well. But it still has its fair share of frustrating glitches that you normally wouldn\u2019t encounter on an app. For one, you need to memorise the code for each service you want to access. You could minimise an app to get information from, say, your notes app. But you mostly can\u2019t minimise a USSD session once it\u2019s started.\n\nUSSD\u2019s original design did not foresee \u201chow the introduction of smartphones would bridge the worlds of computing and telecommunications to form an entirely new industry,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi explains.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say we should throw it away. On the contrary, some companies recognise that USSD is here to stay in Africa. As such, they are merging the best of both worlds: stacking the visual appeal and interactivity of smartphones on top of USSD\u2019s simple and efficient backend.\n\nOne such company is Hover, a US-based company, and their solution is called Stax.\n\nMaking USSD smart\n\nStax is a mobile app currently available only to Android users in 10 countries, including Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. It has three use cases: buy airtime, send money, and request money. All without ever dialling any USSD code.\n\nStax\u2019s main promise is that users never have to dial a code again\u2026 while enjoying USSD.\n\nIt\u2019s not a digital wallet or account, so it doesn\u2019t ask for an email address or phone number. But \u2013 and this is an important but \u2013 Stax needs certain phone permissions.\n\nWhat permissions? Three precisely: to make and manage phone calls; send and view messages; and access your contacts.\n\nWith those enabled, you can input how much airtime you want to buy, choose the bank or fintech-powered account you want to debit and input the phone number to credit or select from your phonebook.\n\nIt would be great if this is where it ends but \u2013 somewhat unfortunately \u2013 Stax asks for two other permissions to complete this task of buying airtime. Permission to display on top of other apps on your phone and another to connect with mobile money and telecom services on your behalf.\n\nThis gave me pause and maybe it is because of the copy: \u201cAllow Stax to have full control of your device?\u201d\n\nThree paragraphs beneath that question describe why the permission is needed. But all the bad news I have absorbed about privacy risks over the past four years flashed before my eyes, discouraging me from clicking \u201cAllow.\u201d\n\nJess Shorland, co-founder of Hover, agrees that some work needs to be done to make users more comfortable with the permissions. But she has an explanation for why they are necessary:\n\n\u201cIt allows us to automate the USSD session on behalf of the user. We\u2019ve basically built a different interface for USSD. The user interacts with that interface in a way that is a lot more screen-reader friendly.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one big permission request\n\nIn other words, the accessibility permission is what enables Stax to do these things on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\nWhen a user gives Stax access, the app activates a screen reading functionality and acts as a web browser. USSD is still happening in the background but instead of presenting those USSD screens, Stax\u2019s SDK reads the USSD dialog, runs the functions and shows the user a familiar app interface.\n\nBut what are the risks? Because there is no way to convince a user that giving up control doesn\u2019t somehow make them a little vulnerable. Shorland says Stax only takes the information needed to enable the user complete their transaction.\n\n\u201cEverything happens client side, not on our servers. It\u2019s also what enables us to be offline,\u201d she says, emphasizing that the app is open-source as a sign of transparency.\n\nWho in Africa needs Stax?\n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of cool that Stax, a fintech app, works offline like regular USSD. But with the internet being more central to the digital and financial services space today, why should we cheer for Stax?\n\nHover CEO and co-founder Ben Lyon says they are \u201cbuilding for the world as it is today so that we can bridge it to where it ought to go.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, there were 159 million monthly active mobile money accounts in Africa, according to the GSM Association. Africa represents more than half of the global mobile money usage.\n\nLyon thinks such numbers and smartphone usage \u2013 expected to double to 678 million by the end of 2025 \u2013 will make USSD even more mainstream. \u201cIt is a standard view of the tech industry that USSD is a bygone thing. It is actually just categorically wrong.\u201d\n\nIf that view is wrong as he insists and if USSD\u2019s user experience needs to be modernised for the smartphone age, then solutions like Stax would seem right on time.\n\nStax wants the app to be under 10MB so that it will work easily on every (Android) phone. Average transaction time is supposed to be 12 seconds.\n\nMy airtime purchase this morning took a bit longer. It showed a transaction failure message at the end and my bank debited me two seconds later. But I got the airtime.\n\nStax is\u2026 a work in progress\n\nAs of today, Stax currently supports transactions for eight banks (Access, First, Guaranty, Keystone, Sterling, UBA, Wema, Zenith), OPay and Paga.\n\nBeing in the USSD business in Nigeria means getting into the CBN (banks) vs NCC (telcos) scuffle around who pays for USSD services. What does Hover think about this debate?\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that USSD is about accessibility and inclusion, I believe strongly that consumers should not pay to access the channel,\u201d Lyon says.\n\n\u201cI hope NCC and other players come around to this view that consumers should not pay.\u201d\n\nOutside of that and other potential headaches, Stax\u2019s focus will be on convincing individuals and businesses that the app is reliable for all seasons and geographies, regardless of internet connection, says Peace Itimi, who leads growth for the product.\n\n\u201cWe are not monetizing Stax yet and it\u2019s not on the near term roadmap to monetize it,\u201d Lyon says. \u201cThere is a WhatsApp sized opportunity here and our first priority is to make sure we can seize the opportunity at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBen also name-drops WeChat as a possible inspiration for monetization. With a large user base, Stax could begin enabling discovery and access to third party services, in what could make Stax a super app of sorts.\n\n\u201cWhen people understand what the product can do, they will fall in love with it,\u201d Itimi says.\n\nThat depends: on how they fix those curious accessibility permissions, and if people really feel the need to switch from basic USSD \u2013 which works okay \u2013 to a shinier, app-enabled life.",

          "title": "Many people have one concern: NITDA warns Nigerians against digital colonialism as Whatsapp\u2019s new privacy policy takes effect",
          "text": "Whatsapp has been more subtle about telling users to sign new terms of service but NITDA says some dangers remain\n\nIn January 2021, users of the popular instant messaging app Whatsapp got notifications about new terms of service and an updated privacy policy. The notification came with the warning that if users did not accept the new terms by February 8, they would lose access to the app.\n\nWhen you\u2019re one of the world\u2019s most popular apps and owned by Facebook, a company many people distrust, that sort of announcement will hog headlines. There\u2019s also the fact that many tech users are becoming concerned about privacy and the kind of data apps collect about them.\n\nSo for a few weeks, we saw articles suggesting that people should switch to apps like Telegram and Signal, which do not collect as much information on their users. As a result, Signal saw a rush of downloads.\n\nAlthough the pushback was intense, Whatsapp did not budge on its terms and privacy policy; instead, it decided to soft-pedal on the new terms of use and be more subtle about getting users to sign it.\n\nWhatsapp still wants you to agree to new terms\n\nIn the weeks leading up to a new deadline of May 15, Whatsapp began sending reminders to users as an in-app notification. While it will no longer block users from using the app if they don\u2019t agree to the new terms, it will restrict some functionalities.\n\nThe company said in a blog post in May, \u201cfor the last several weeks, we\u2019ve displayed a notification in WhatsApp providing more information about the update. After giving everyone time to review, we\u2019re continuing to remind those who haven\u2019t had the chance to do so to review and accept. After several weeks, the reminder people receive will eventually become persistent.\u201d\n\nWhatsapp is swapping its forceful method and wants to send reminders until users agree. Yet, countries are still concerned, and in Nigeria, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NIDTA) issued a statement Tuesday about Whatsapp.\n\n\u201cWhatsApp users are at liberty to decide on giving consent to the processing of their data based on the new privacy policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) recognises; we have consent (a clear, unambiguous expression of privacy terms communicated by the controller and accepted by the Data Subject) as one of the lawful basis for data processing. Acceptance of the new privacy policy and terms of use implies that users\u2019 data would now be shared with Facebook and other third parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsers will now be subject to the terms and policies of Facebook and other receiving entities with or without being direct subscribers to such services.\u201d\n\nNITDA is wary of new policy\n\nAt the heart of the new terms, Whatsapp wants to become a place where businesses directly sell to customers. Small businesses will have virtual storefronts, while bigger businesses will be able to integrate Whatsapp into their existing technology stack.\n\nIn a statement, NITDA published some portions of Whatsapp\u2019s new policy\n\nOne concern many people have is whether Facebook will have access to their Whatsapp chats, but the company insists that messages on the IM platform are encrypted end-to-end. Yet, NITDA says users should \u201climit the sharing of sensitive personal information on private messaging and social media platforms as the initial promise of privacy is being overridden on the basis of business exigencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cNITDA is exploring all options to ensure Nigerians do not become victims of digital colonialism,\u201d the agency added in its statement.\n\nIt is not clear what these options are. For now, the choice ultimately lies with users who will determine how to guard their privacy as WhatsApp\u2019s new rules go into effect.",

          "title": "Nigerians mourn a painful dip day for crypto, but the rallying cry is \u201cHODL!\u201d",
          "text": "Moses Francis has had a heart-breaking Wednesday. Looking at his Binance app, every graph is red. He holds four coins \u2013 Tron, Doge, Litecoin and Ripple. They have been bleeding value all day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been holding for over a year now. I\u2019ve come across a lot of dips. But I haven\u2019t encountered one as bad as this,\u201d he says to TechCabal.\n\nFrancis is not alone. In Nigeria, thousands of users have felt burned on a day of massive slumps in value of virtually every notable cryptocurrency traded across the globe. \u2018Bitcoin\u2019, \u2018Binance\u2019, \u2018Elon Musk\u2019 and \u2018Crypto\u2019 are among top trends on Twitter.\n\nBitcoin is the hardest hit \u2013 the value has crashed as low as $32,000 from a previous high of $65,000 in mid April. But the wave has shaken BNB, Binance\u2019s cryptocurrency, as well as Ethereum, the currency of the NFT world.\n\n\u201cI am feeling down. Anytime I open Binance, I feel as though I want to purge,\u201d says Ogechukwu (he gave just his first name) who has held Bitcoin and Ethereum since 2017.\n\nMany reacted to the crash by choosing to see the funny side.\n\nBitnob, a Lagos-based cryptocurrency exchange, had a request for Risevest, a stock and real estate investment startup.\n\nHi @Risevest are you hiring?\n\n\n\nWe dey find work \u2014 Bitnob (@Bitnob_official) May 19, 2021\n\nSomeone imagined the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s governor must be feeling good about his crypto warnings earlier in the year. (\u2018Ponzi\u2019 also became a top trend in Nigeria).\n\nEmefiele looking at all these crypto tears pic.twitter.com/mN3ve6CVGL \u2014 Editi Effi\u00f2ng (@EditiEffiong) May 19, 2021\n\nBut the jokes do not mask the pain of the dip\u2019s strokes. Victor Asemota, a Nigerian businessman and startup investor, lamented in a tweet.\n\n\u201cI take it back. Crypto is now worse than equities. I have lost all my gains this year and the last in a few hours.\u201d\n\nIndeed Bitcoin has now lost all of the gains made since February 8, the day Tesla announced it would accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for its highly-demanded cars. In the three months since, BTC rose steadily.\n\nThat rising tide drove up the value of other currencies. The biggest beneficiary of the Elon Musk-fueled bull market was Dogecoin, whose value rose an incredible 12,000% between January and the first week of May. $1,000 (\u20a6380,000) worth of Doge in January was worth $121,000 (\u20a646 million) just a few weeks ago.\n\nBut Musk has caused a different kind of turbulence, 49 days after that boom announcement.\n\nAt 11 pm on May 12, Musk tweeted ominously that Tesla will not be accepting Bitcoin for car payments. The reason given was that because Bitcoin takes a lot of energy to mine, it would be unfitting for a company that sells electric cars to directly encourage activities that potentially harm the environment.\n\nAnd just like that, the Cryptoverse has been in a tailspin.\n\nFrancis, a 21-year-old medical student, says more than half the value of his coins have vanished with Wednesday\u2019s dip. He is taking it cheerfully, mustering some laughter on our call. He suspects some foul play has fueled the dip.\n\n\u201cThis dip is because crypto whales have sold off en masse. After this dip, they will re-buy and make gains. I think this thing is planned.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence at the moment of a coordinated sell-off by BTC holders. Observers and long-time holders believe the cryptocurrency market is merely experiencing a correction, a tendency familiar with veteran stock market traders.\n\n\u201cThe case for Bitcoin hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Eloho Omame, co-founder of FirstCheck Africa, a Nigerian startup investment firm, told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cCrypto markets were always volatile. So honestly it\u2019s not fun, but it\u2019s not unexpected. Long term, I\u2019m bullish. So it doesn\u2019t really matter what happens today.\u201d\n\nThat feeling \u2013 that this dip is not abnormal or catastrophic \u2013 has helped keep heads cool even as crypto exchange apps continue to look bloody. Despite the crash in value, holders only lose when they sell off their assets at the current prices.\n\nThe second part of the Asemota tweet mentioned above projected strength: \u201cStill buying the dip on margin though. Worst case, I lose everything. Best case, I can afford another condo.\u201d (He explained his risk calculus in a follow-up tweet).\n\nOther bruised holders like Francis are confident of a rebound. \u201cThe only thing I can do [is] HODL,\u201d an acronym popular among crypto enthusiasts that could be interpreted as Hold On for Dear Life.\n\nOgechukwu is also holding on, saying he is in the game for the long haul. \u201cI won\u2019t be selling. I know I will still grow but looking at the value still makes my stomach churn.\u201d\n\nWhile it is mainly a consumer affair, Dip Day affects crypto companies who facilitate trades. Binance experienced network congestion on Wednesday (I tried to sign up, unsuccessfully). ETH and ERC20 withdrawals were temporarily disabled for about an hour.\n\nTomiwa Lasebikan, co-founder of Buycoins, a Nigerian crypto exchange, is looking beyond the moment.\n\n\u201cWhat matters is my long term thesis and aggressively improving the tech so it\u2019s tangibly accessible to as many people as possible around the world,\u201d he told TechCabal.\n\nWhat does Musk, the unanimous hero and villain of this story so far, think of all this?\n\nTesla has \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 19, 2021\n\nWhich, in the crypto world, is another code for \u201cHODL!\u201d",

          "text": "It\u2019s not news that Nigerians have now become more aware of their need for seamless, transparent, and inclusive banking services that are not only accessible but also guarantee some financial freedom for their lives and livelihood. While much of the older population are still battling with financial literacy as well as apathy towards banking services, a large percentage of the younger populace are aggressively moving towards providers that cleverly harness the power of technology \u2013 which is believed to be the new frontier for successful banking. This has led to the birth of many new fintechs springing up on a daily basis. However, the real problems seem to still be at large. Nigerians still mistrust and express their lack of confidence in the financial system.\n\nBut amidst these challenging realities, one of Nigeria\u2019s elite challenger banks, Mint Digital Bank is reassuring Nigerians of its commitment to making banking services easy and accessible to everyone.\n\nAs stated by the bank\u2019s founders \u2013 Eze Amuchie, Nnazilim Egbuonu, and Obinna Ogbodo, Mint Digital Bank is currently the most accessible digital banking platform for Individuals MSMEs and Corporates, and our mission is \u201cto simplify financial services for our customers and help them build financial independence\u201d.\n\nWhile most banks are focused on profiting from their customers, Mint\u2019s goal is to provide simplified financial services to everyday customers, both underserved and unbanked.

Egbuonu who admitted to having a passion for start-up businesses said he looks forward to investing world-changing ideas into the fast-rising digital bank and redefining the digital banking system in Nigeria.\n\nEgbuonu, a renowned business strategist, is also the co-founder of Travel Beta, one of Nigeria\u2019s most successful travel agencies.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Minister for Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami, has approved new regulations for the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST).\n\nThis comes after a stakeholders meeting chaired by Pantami to discuss NIPOST\u2019s new rulemaking process and regulations held on Thursday, March 11, 2021, as disclosed by Femi Adeluyi, Technical Assistant to the minister, in a press release dated Tuesday, May 18, 2021.\n\nThese new regulations, Pantami claims, will position NIPOST as a key player in the digital economy, in line with the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy for a digital Nigeria.\n\nFull details of these regulations are not yet known. What we do have are the names of these regulations, one of which is Courier and Logistics Services (Operations) Regulation, which may seem familiar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecall that in July 2020, there was a huge outcry in the Nigerian logistics community against a NIPOST regulation with the same name.\n\nThe regulation proposed a hike in licensing fees for every company in the Nigerian logistics space, and a compulsory remittance of a sum equal to 2% of their annual revenue.\n\nIt also introduced an SME licence for municipal operators within a state with less than five bikes. In an article by our reporter, Emmanuel Paul, we highlighted several other interesting provisions in the regulation.\n\nSeveral protests were held, and a hashtag \u2013#SayNoToNipostFee\u2013 trended on social media. Eventually, Pantami suspended the implementation of the regulation regarding the hike in licensing fees.\n\nNIPOST\u2019s position as regulator and player, a seemingly counterintuitive role, makes these new directives more interesting. Perhaps, this might be the reason for the second regulation, the Rulemaking Process Regulation of NIPOST.\n\nAs stated in the press release, this regulation aims to create an inclusive, stakeholder-led process, taking advantage of Nigeria\u2019s diversity to make efficient and value-adding decisions that engender sustainable growth in the sector.\n\nWhat does this mean for the Nigerian logistics community? Will there be adequate representation of all necessary parties in this rule-making process? How much transparency can we expect?\n\nThe government\u2019s actions would indeed be telling answers to these questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepealing the NIPOST Act\n\nPresently, there are plans before the National Assembly (NASS) to unbundle NIPOST via a bill sponsored by Senator Oluremi Tinubu.\n\nThe bill is titled \u201ca Bill for an Act to repeal the Nigerian Postal Service Act CAPN 127 LFN 2004 and establish the Nigeria Postal Commission to make comprehensive provisions for the development and regulation of postal services and other related matters.\u201d\n\nApart from repealing the NIPOST Act and establishing the Nigerian Postal Commission, the bill, if enacted, will implement the National Postal Policy and establish a regulatory framework for the Nigerian postal industry.\n\nThis will supposedly create an effective, impartial and independent regulatory authority and promote the provision of a modern universal, efficient, reliable, affordable and easily accessible postal service with the widest range and coverage throughout Nigeria, Leadership reports\n\nWhile this seems achievable and might likely answer questions related to NIPOST\u2019s impartiality, we do not know the date of the bill\u2019s enactment.\n\nWhat we are left with are two recently approved regulations and little information. One bearing the name of a previously suspended regulation and the other appearing to be an attempt at inclusiveness.\n\nOur earlier questions remain unanswered.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

How much transparency can we expect?\n\nThe government\u2019s actions would indeed be telling answers to these questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepealing the NIPOST Act\n\nPresently, there are plans before the National Assembly (NASS) to unbundle NIPOST via a bill sponsored by Senator Oluremi Tinubu.\n\nThe bill is titled \u201ca Bill for an Act to repeal the Nigerian Postal Service Act CAPN 127 LFN 2004 and establish the Nigeria Postal Commission to make comprehensive provisions for the development and regulation of postal services and other related matters.\u201d\n\nApart from repealing the NIPOST Act and establishing the Nigerian Postal Commission, the bill, if enacted, will implement the National Postal Policy and establish a regulatory framework for the Nigerian postal industry.\n\nThis will supposedly create an effective, impartial and independent regulatory authority and promote the provision of a modern universal, efficient, reliable, affordable and easily accessible postal service with the widest range and coverage throughout Nigeria, Leadership reports\n\nWhile this seems achievable and might likely answer questions related to NIPOST\u2019s impartiality, we do not know the date of the bill\u2019s enactment.\n\nWhat we are left with are two recently approved regulations and little information. One bearing the name of a previously suspended regulation and the other appearing to be an attempt at inclusiveness.\n\nOur earlier questions remain unanswered.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "The need to reduce capital flight, save cost and create job opportunities locally is driving Nigerian airlines to set up Maintenance and Repair Overhaul (MRO) facilities, and there are lessons local carriers can learn from African countries that have succeeded in running MROs.\n\nFor instance, AirPeace and United Airlines have concluded plans to set up MROs in Anambra and Enugu, respectively, with other airlines expected to pool into this as a way of getting the local industry to thrive.\n\nAirPeace is partnering the Anambra State government to get Embraer of Brazil, the world\u2019s fourth-largest civilian aircraft manufacturer, to locate a MRO service centre for Africa in the state.\n\nEven as stakeholders in the sector have commended moves by domestic airlines to set up home-grown maintenance facilities, they also advise carriers to learn from African countries like Egypt, Ethiopia, Morocco and Kenya that have successfully managed their maintenance facilities.\n\nEthiopian Airlines has its Ethiopian Airlines MRO; South Africa runs its MRO Division, South African Airways Technical (SAAT) Airways; Egypt Air has its commercial Maintenance & Engineering MRO. Kenya Airways operates KQ Technical, its technical and engineering wing providing maintenance services for aircrafts, and Morocco operates its Snecma Morocco Engine Services (SMES), where it carries out expanded maintenance, repair and overhaul.\n\nRead Also: Egypt\u2019s 3yr economic plan holds lessons for Nigeria\n\nExperts say these countries and their carriers have built sustainable MROs by managing key components, which include the airlines, service providers and training.\n\nAdo Sanusi, former managing director/CEO of Aero Contractors, says these components have been able to align to the business strategy and the policy of the countries establishing the MROs.\n\nChecks by BusinessDay show that these carriers have sustained the MRO facilities in their countries by making it commercial to other local and international airlines, developing a plan or pathway for long-term equipment acquisition, retooling, expansion and commercialisation.\n\nThese carriers have also entered strategic partnerships with their respective governments for support and avoiding politicking.\n\nFor instance, Ethiopian MRO caters for carriers within Africa and some European airlines. South African Airways Technical (SAAT) Airways MRO also caters for carriers within South Africa and beyond. These aggregates of aircraft from across various countries help these carriers realise reasonable return on investment to sustain the MRO facilities.\n\nSeyi Adewale, CEO, Mainstream Cargo Limited, says the MRO facilities in these countries have been sustained by building supporting training schools to develop new and young professionals starting from post-secondary school level training in areas such as tooling and fabrication skills. They then proceed to graduate level, empowering them accordingly and at professional level, helping to impact culture, philosophy and continuous programmed development.\n\nNigerian airlines currently carry out major checks and maintenance of their aircraft in Europe, America and Ethiopia Airlines hangar in Addis-Ababa, Ethiopia, depending on the degree of maintenance required.\n\nThe initiative to set up MRO is coming at a time Nigerian airlines are struggling with high foreign exchange rate, making it increasingly difficult to pay for spare parts, repair and maintain their aircraft as at when due.\n\nChecks further show there are about 100 aircraft owned by Nigerian airlines, servicing domestic, regional and international routes.\n\nAero Contractors in the last three years maintained about eight Boeing aircraft at its maintenance facilities, implying about 92 aircraft are still being maintained outside the country as a result of absence of aircraft maintenance facilities.\n\nThe cost of a C-check on an average aircraft, which is conducted within 12 to 18 months, cost between $800,000 (N384m) and $1 million (N480m) at an exchange rate of N480 to a dollar. This amount does not include the cost of ferrying the aircraft abroad and other charges.\n\nThis implies that within 12 to 18 months, Nigerian airlines would spend between N35.3 billion and N44.16 billion on maintenance of about 92 aircraft.\n\nAdewale, who commended the initiative of local carriers to build MROs, says the facilities are needed at this time for country\u2019s self-sustainability, to reduce Nigeria\u2019s trade deficit and huge FX outflows due to aircraft maintenance checks, train airline professionals and in turn creating jobs, while also increasing the profitability of domestic airlines.\n\nJohn Ojikutu, member of aviation industry think tank group, Aviation Round Table (ART)/chief executive of Centurion Securities, notes that one of the major problems of the Nigerian airlines is initial poor business plans.\n\nAccording to Ojikutu, major questions airlines would need to ask before setting up MRO would include: \u201cWhat would be the main types of aircraft and market sources of their materials and clients \u2013 locally and regionally? Where would the manpower or skills for the maintenance come from? Who are their proxy competitors locally and/or regionally?\u201d\n\nNigeria for over 30 years tried to establish an MRO facility, which was initially named national hanger, he states. \u201cI advise AirPeace and its partners to research into why the previous efforts failed even when in the past there were few types of aircraft operating in the country, within the region and continentally, (Boeing series mainly),\u201d he says. Now that there are more variants of aircraft, the technical and manpower requirements will be broader, he says.",

          "text": "The immediate past chairman of Afikpo North Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, Ogbonnia Enyim, has urged the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to investigate the financial transactions of local governments in the state.\n\nMr Enyim, who was appointed the Caretaker Committee Chairman of the local government area in 2015, was later elected as the executive chairman in the same year and bowed out of office in 2020.\n\nAfter his tenure at the council, he was appointed Special Assistant to the Governor on School Monitoring, but later relinquished the office.\n\nAccording to the copies of a petition he sent to the EFCC and obtained by this newspaper, Mr Enyim, on Wednesday, alleged that while serving as the local government chairman, Governor David Umahi, \u201cforcefully took\u201d N20 million monthly from federal allocation to each of the 13 local government areas.\n\nHe said these monies were transferred into an account tagged \u201cEBONYI STATE GOVERNMENT LGA JOINT PROJECTS FUND ACCOUNT\u201d, domiciled with United Bank for Africa(UBA), with account number 1014900274.\n\n\u201cIt is further our client\u2019s instructions that for over 7 years and counting now, the total sum of Twenty One Billion, Eight Hundred and Forty Million, Naira (N21,840,000,000.00), have so far been collected by David Umahi, through the said Ebonyi State Government LGA Joint Projects Fund Account, for which no single joint project has been executed in conjunction with any of the 13 Local Government Areas of Ebonyi State,\u201d the petition read.\n\n\u201cThese monies were directly transferred to the said project joint account upon the receipt of monthly allocations, by each of the 13 Local Government Areas in Ebonyi State. The Twenty Million Naira (N20,000,000.00) collected from Afikpo North Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, by David Umahi, was transferred on monthly basis, from the following accounts of the Local Government; UBA-1003272681, Eco Bank- 5393071559, Zenith Bank-1011618769,\u201d\n\nAlso attached to the petition is a copy of the Zenith Bank account statement of Afikpo North Local Government, showing the monthly transfer of these monies from the account of the local government, to the joint account.\n\nHe further alleged that the governor directed the local governments to award a one kilometre road project to a company traced to his brother, Austin Umahi.\n\n\u201cIt is further our client\u2019s instructions, that the said David Umahi, in a bid to further impoverish Afiko North Local Government of Ebonyi State, and indeed the entire 13 Local Government Areas of Ebonyi State, and fraudulently enrich himself and members of his family, also directed that contracts for the construction of 1km Road be awarded to Austin Umahi, his brother, using a company called CHRZL CONSULT LTD, at an over-bloated contract sum of Two Hundred Million Naira(N200,000,000.00).\n\n\u201cIt is also our client\u2019s instructions that David Umahi, forced the Afikpo North Local Government of Ebonyi State, to pay the full contract sum of Two Hundred Million Naira(N200,000,000.00) to Austine Umahi, using CHRZL CONSULT LTD, even when the road construction is not up to 50% complete.\u201d\n\nMr Enyim then appealed to the chairman of the anti-corruption agency to ensure a thorough investigation into the allegations.\n\nReaction\n\nBut in his reaction, the Special Assistant to the Governor on media and publicity, Francis Nwaze, said the petition is an attempt to tarnish the image of the governor.\n\n\u201cThey became so desperate by seeing how they can tarnish the governor,\u201d he told PREMIUM TIMES on Friday.\n\nSpeaking on the allegations of impropriety, he said the governor has nothing to do with the joint local government accounts.\n\n\u201cIf they have a joint account, what is the connection with the governor?\u201d Mr Nwaze asked, dismissing the ex-council chairman\u2019s claim.\n\nHe further said the governor was not worried about the probe, stating that the burden of proof lies on Mr Enyim and others.\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

          "text": "The Nigeria Communication Commissions (NCC) has disclosed that network providers will be required to cross-check all phones International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) and status on a proposed Centralized Equipment Identity Register (CEIR) otherwise known as Device Management System (DMS) before allowing a device to become active on their network.\n\nThis is contained in the Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration published by the Commission, Vanguard reported.\n\nThe directive claimed the move was to curtail the counterfeit mobile phone market, discourage mobile, phone theft, enhance National Security, protect consumer interest, increase revenue generation for the government, reduce rate of kidnapping, mitigate the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitate blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices.\n\n\u201cTo achieve this, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) would be responsible for the implementation and management of the DMS to achieve the policy objectives\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe implementation of a Centralized Equipment Identity Register (CEIR) otherwise known as Device Management System (DMS) will serve as a repository for keeping records of all registered mobile phones\u2019 International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) and owners of such devices.\n\n\u201cIMEIs that have been reported as either stolen or illegal will be shared through the DMS to all the operators and service providers. The purpose is to ensure that such devices do not work even if different SIM Cards are inserted in those devices\u201d.\n\nThe Revised Policy publication also noted that the President, Muhammadu Buhari has directed \u201cthat the Device Management System should be implemented within three months.\n\nThis means any Nigerian who failed to comply will be unable to make calls, send text messages, or use the internet except through WiFi.\n\n\u201cDMS will also provide access to all operators to cross-check the IMEIs and their status before allowing a device to become active on their network.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, registered mobile phone technicians will also be provided with an interface to check IMEIs and ensure it has not been reported as stolen or illegal before they render their technical services\u201d.\n\nThe International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number is an international identity number used to uniquely identify a mobile phone. The 15-digit IMEI number is an electronic fingerprint transmitted every time a phone is used, which reveals the identity of the mobile handset.\n\nHow can I find out my IMEI number?\n\nIMEI numbers are independent of the phone number and are usually written underneath the battery or on the back of the handset. Mobile phone users can also check their 15 digit IMEI number by dialing *#06# on their mobile handset.\n\nShould Nigerians be worried?\n\nYes! Although the IMEI can be used to reduce the cases of phone theft, the 15-digit number offers more power. It can give detailed information about a phone and its history. This is a concern. Not even in this era of rising data privacy concern across the globe. Such information in the hands of any governmental agency can be abused.\n\nHowever, some smartphone manufacturers such as Apple\u2019s Find My and Samsung\u2019s Find My Device already have features to track lost phones.\n\nWhich country has a similar policy?\n\nIndonesia currently operates a similar policy. The Indonesia Cell Phone Association (APSI) reported that almost 20% of all active phones in the country come from black market, costing the government annually, about $190.4 million in mixed tax revenues.\n\nThe IMEI control regulation in the country was scheduled to commence on April 18, 2020.\n\nBody of this report is credit to Vanguard",

          "text": "CardinalStone Partners Limited took to the platform of Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited to commemorate the listing of its N5Billion bond with a digital Closing Gong Ceremony on Thursday, 20 May 2021. The debut listing was the CardinalStone Financing SPV Plc\u2019s \u20a65bn, 5-Year Series 1 bonds under the company\u2019s \u20a610 Billion debt issuance programme.\n\nSpeaking at the ceremony, the Divisional Head, Listings Business, NGX Limited, Mr. Olumide Bolumole stated, \u201cAt NGX Limited, we continue to provide issuers with a platform that allows them meet their strategic business objectives and it is our delight to see issuers take full advantage of our products and services to support their growth story. We are, therefore, excited about the successful listing of the CardinalStone Financing SPV Plc\u2019s \u20a65bn Series I Bond on the NGX Platform as it creates an avenue for price discovery and liquidity for existing and new investors. The full subscription of the listing recorded demonstrates investors\u2019 confidence in CardinalStone which now better positions the company to sustain its impressive growth in the coming years.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Group Managing Director, CardinalStone Partners Limited, Mr. Michael Nzewi noted that, \u201cToday is particularly exciting for us at CardinalStone because it represents the attainment of our aspiration to list some of the securities in our capital structure on The Exchange. We are thankful to NGX for giving us the opportunity to list on its platform; without their support, we would not be here today. We would like to assure NGX that we are committed to finding ways to leverage its products and services and drive participation in the capital market from other institutions. Of course, we appeal to our colleagues in the industry to take advantage of the opportunity to raise capital on NGX just like we have.\u201d\n\nThe Managing Director, CardinalStone Asset Management. Mr. Mohammed Garuba also gave his remarks stating, \u201cI thank NGX for the opportunity to be here today and must give kudos to NGX for facilitating seamless remote trading over the past year; the impact is clearly seen in capital raising activities on the bourse. I must also congratulate NGX on the recent launch of its campaign, The Stock Africa Is Made Of. It is indeed an exciting initiative as it has helped to re-engage key players within the capital market value chain. While a lot of focus has been on equities in the past, listing a bond is another way to not only raise capital but also improve governance within an organisation, which was our experience. We have learnt from this process, and are willing to support counterparts and clients who wish to embark on this journey.\u201d\n\nPrior to the sounding of the Closing Gong, the Managing Director, ChapelHill Denham Advisory Limited (Lead Financial Adviser/Issuing House), Mrs. Kemi Awodein, expressed appreciation to capital market players saying, \u201cI must thank the team at CardinalStone for giving us ChapelHill Denham the opportunity to have led the issuance of their bond listing. When we opened the book in 2020, we could not have envisaged that we would have a book in excess of N6Bn but that was the strength of acceptance of CardinalStone on the buy side and for that, we must thank all our investors. I must also thank the Securities and Exchange Commission for their support through the process; NGX for the opportunity to commemorate this listing; and all professional parties to this transaction \u2013 FBNQuest Merchant Bank Limited; FCMB Capital Markets Limited; FSDH Capital Limited, to name a few.\u201d\n\nThis Closing Gong Ceremony marks the first after the official launch of NGX Group\u2019s campaign, The Stock Africa Is Made Of which highlighted the new positioning of the Group and its subsidiaries as amplify its new positioning and commitment to the African financial markets as a leading capital market infrastructure provider, connecting Nigeria, Africa, and the world.",

          "text": "The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has said that it will act on the outcome of the ongoing investigation of revenue remittances by Ministries, Departments and Agencies of the federal government (MDAs) being carried out by the Senate.\n\nEFCC chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, made the disclosure on Thursday when he appeared before the Senate Committee on Finance during the ongoing investigative hearing on revenue remittances by over 700 MDAs.\n\nBawa also commended the legislative panel for its investigations into the internally generated revenues of MDAs and the payment of 1% Stamp Duty by contractors on all contracts awarded by MDAs between 2014 to 2020.\n\n\u201cAfter observing the proceedings and the process of investigation of the Committee, I am happy with what is happening here. It is a good development that the committee is working towards blocking revenue leakages. At this point in the nation\u2019s history, it is not much about generating revenue as much as blocking leakages of revenue generated and still being generated by all these agencies of government,\u201d he stated.\n\nBawa said he would have been happy to go away with one of the heads of the agencies immediately from the revelations that the committee unearthed in the course of observing the documents presented by the agency, stressing that he would be ready to partner with the committee as the process goes on and hopefully get the report of the committee for further action.\n\nAs part of setting example for blockage of leakages, the EFCC boss stated that since his assumption of office, he has created four new departments in EFCC, two of which, namely the Procurement Department and the Internal Audit, are to ensure that due process is followed and there are no audit queries.\n\nHe added that other MDAs can copy the template of EFCC in order to do same.\n\nSpeaking earlier, the committee\u2019s chairman Senator Solomon Adeola (APC, Lagos West), had enunciated that the focus of the investigation was informed by the need to curb recurrent federal budget deficits and the resort to borrowing while agencies of government earn and often frivolously spend generated revenues of government.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAdeola added that, so far the committee had made progress with many agencies paying back unremitted revenues in the tens of millions with treasury receipts to show as evidence.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that we can no longer continue to run government as business as usual with some agencies not audited for over years, agencies collecting funds for expenditures during budget process without declaring revenue they are bringing to the table. The practice is for them to spend generated government revenues illegally while still collecting funds from the government that had to resorts to borrowing to fund them,\u201d Senator Adeola stated.\n\nMeanwhile, in the course of the investigative hearing, the Federal College of Education, Okene in Kogi State was ordered to pay back to the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) of the Federation the total sum of N242million it generated and spent contrary to the 1999 Constitution and the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007 within five months.\n\nAlso, following the formation of a tripartite committee of the Accountant General Office, the Fiscal Responsibility Commision (FRC) and the Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) by the Committee, the account of NERC was reconciled with N888million outstanding to be paid to CRF by the commission.\n\nOther agencies that appeared before the Senate panel on include Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), Federal Medical Centre, Yenegoa, Nigeria Film Corporation, Federal Neuro Psychiatric Hospital, Calabar and the NNPC, among others with some of the MDAs have been cleared while others were requested to provide additional documents.",

As a patrotic citizen, I will always support any steps that governments at all levels take with the view to ridding our country off all manners of criminalities, including the crime of kidnapping that is sadly gaining more currency/popularity in our country these days.\n\n\u201cHowever, I feel the bill that is proposing a 15-year jail term for payers of ransom to kidnappers is a misplaced priority, unpopular and needless at this precious time because governments at all levels have failed in their responsibility to protect the lives and property of Nigerian citizens due mainly to the poor security architecture in the entire country,\u201d the first-class Oba said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Chief Mike Ozekhome: Freedom of movement is for human beings, not cattle and sheep\n\nAccording to the open letter, which the monach made available on Friday, \u201cIf families of kidnapped persons cannot pay ransom due to the proposed bill and government too does not have an effective security architecture to rescue the victims, it then means that the victims of kidnapping will be in the kidnappers\u2019 dens till eternity. Lives of some of them may even be in danger in the hands of their abductors. Will that not amount to a double jeopardy for the victims\u2019 families?\u201d\n\nWhile saying he was sure that the children of the proponents of the bill are not in this \u201cunsecure country\u201d, Oba Akinyemi opined that the first thing to do is to develop a security strategy that will strength the police and others to be able to confront kidnappers.\n\n\u201cTo me, the first thing we should do is to develop a security strategy that will make the Nigeria Police Force and other Security Forces possess the competence and capacity to aggressively confront the crime of kidnapping in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf we want the bill to be popular, the Federal Government should first rescue Leah Sharibu and other hundreds of innocent Nigerians who are still being held in kidnappers\u2019 dens in all the nooks and crannies of our country, Nigeria,\u201d the Eselu stated.\n\nBefore sponsoring such a bill, the traditional ruler advised that government ought to first \u201cput in place an effective Nigeria Police Rescue Team; boost the morale of the men of the Nigeria Police Force and other Security agencies in the country to enable them put in all their best; insure the lives of the men of the Nigeria Police Force so as to give confidence to them and their families and provide all the necessary facilities/amenities to make all the security personnel in Nigeria function well.\u201d",

          "text": "Kaduna state Governor Nasir El-Rufai has accused his counterparts of not giving him the support he deserved in his face-off with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC).\n\nLabour union had crippled economic activities in Kaduna over what they described as anti-people policies of El-Rufai.\n\nIn the warning strike called off on day three, protesters trooped to the streets, calling on the governor to reverse the sack of 4,000 workers.\n\nThe Progressives Governors Forum advised El-Rufai and labour leaders to return to the negotiation table and stop flexing muscles.\n\n\u201cThis is not the time for muscle flexing. Nigerians are already overstretched with many challenges. At this critical point of our democratic journey, there cannot be limits to engagement between all governments and citizens. Every step must be therefore taken to resolve the current face-off between Kaduna state government and NLC. We appeal to both the State Government and NLC to return to the negotiating table,\u201d Kebbi state Governor and PGF Chairman Atiku Bagudu had said.\n\nBut at a virtual meeting of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), El-Rufai criticised the NGF, saying the press release was not helpful.\n\n\u201cThat press release with the greatest respect was unhelpful. It was unhelpful, it said nothing, it was trying to play both sides. I am a governor, I am one of you, the least I expect from the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum is unequivocal and unqualified support. I didn\u2019t see that in that statement. I am being very blunt; I could pretend and be political and just smile and say it was alright but it is not. But I am used to fighting my own battles.\n\n\u201cWe are not running a unitary system, we are a federation. We are elected to govern different states, we owe our people accountability not the NLC, we should take a common stand,\u201d he said.\n\nEl-Rufai also insinuated that there was a conspiracy against the Kaduna state government.\n\n\u201cIf it is about rights of workers Kaduna is not the only state that has retrenched workers, Kaduna is not a state owing salaries, Kaduna is not a state failing to pay minimum wage, Kaduna is not a state owing years of pension arrears. Why didn\u2019t they go there? Kaduna was targeted for political reasons, and they are being financed by certain political interests.\n\n\u201cBut we will fight them, we will defeat them but as the governor of Bayelsa said, and since he has brought that subject, I have a responsibility to put it through, unless we collectively address this monster, it will consume all of us.\n\n\u201cAfter this, they will never come back to Kaduna, they will never come back, you will see. They will go to other states, it\u2019s up to the forum to decide on what to do, but we are here, we are ready, we will end this by the grace of God,\u201d he said.\n\nFG sets up c\u2019ttee\n\nMeanwhile, the meeting at the instance of Minister of Labour and Employment Dr Chris Ngige to resolve the industrial disputes between labour and the Kaduna state government have agreed to set up a 10-member committee.\n\nThe committee, according to a Memorandum of Understanding , resolved that membership include Head of Civil Service of Kaduna State as Chairman and five other representatives from the state government and three representative of the NLC.\n\n\u201cThe meeting agreed that all the listed issues fall within the ambit of redundancy therefore, it was resolved that the principle of redundancy as stated in section 20 of Labour Act, Cap L 1 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria (LFN) should apply.\n\n\u201cThe meeting also recognized that the current impasse was caused by communication gap between the State Government and NLC occasioned by both the local chapter and even the Kaduna State Government Officials.\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing, the meeting resolved to constitute a ten (10) man Bi-partite Committee comprising six (6) representatives of State Government and three (3) officials of the NLC to engage further with the objective of reverting with a work plan on how to integrate the provision of section 20 of the Labour Act CAP L1 LFN 2004 to resolve the impasse between the State Government and the NLC.\n\n\u201cThe meeting also resolved that the Committee should have as Chairman, the Head of Service of the Kaduna State Government and assisted by a Deputy National President of the NLC.\n\n\u201cThe Committee is expected to revert with the work plan for peaceful resolution of all issues in contention to the Honourable Minister of Labour and Employment by Tuesday, 25th May, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe work plan is to itemize the structure and sub-structure in the State and Local Government of their activities, time of commencement and envisaged final tenure of the Committee or make recommendations if in its wisdom it thinks the Committee should be a Permanent Standing Committee.\n\n\u201d In conclusion, it was agreed that there shall be no further industrial action on these issues and no worker shall be victimised on account of his or her participation in the industrial action,\u201d the MoU stated.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

Tanko Sununu said there is need for amendment of the existing National Health Insurance Scheme Act for actualisation of the Universal Health Coverage and by extension, health security.",

The party stood by me all through the way,\u201d the governor said during his appearance on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIn any other legal issue that I have had, PDP had stood with me. PDP gave me the opportunity to be a senator; PDP gave me the opportunity to be governor. I would never have any time to pull down PDP. I have integrity, character, and honour.

That is the first step toward justice and truth,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYet what deeply concerns me is that practices like these-and even worse-are still widespread today.\u201d\n\nThe independent inquiry \u2013 by retired judge Lord Dyson \u2013 found that interviewer Martin Bashir acted in a \u201cdeceitful\u201d way and faked documents to obtain his interview.\n\nThe BBC\u2019s 1996 probe led by then-head of News and Current Affairs Lord Hall into initial complaints about what happened was \u201cwoefully ineffective\u201d, it added.\n\nThe BBC has written to apologise to Princes William and Harry, as well as the Prince of Wales and Diana\u2019s brother Earl Spencer.\n\nMatt Wiessler, the graphic designer who first raised concerns about the fake documents used to secure the interview and who was later denied work by the BBC, told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that an apology sent to him at 22:00 BST on Thursday was \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d.\n\nHe criticised Lord Hall, who led an internal investigation at the time, and then BBC director-general Lord Birt for not apologising to him in person.",
