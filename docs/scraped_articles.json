          "text": "Many down with severe illness without medical attention\n\nWe\u2019re unaware of situation in camp \u2013 Nasarawa official\n\nBy David Odama\n\nTHESE are indeed tough times for internally-displaced persons in Nasarawa State following reports of several severe challenges confronting them.\n\nApart from not having a comfortable place of abode, the unfortunate persons numbering over 12,000 in the state, now have to contend with hunger and starvation.\n\nThe problem is being blamed on the drastic reduction in the quantity of food being supplied to them, a situation that has spawned serious health challenges. Arewa Voice was able to confirm this during a visit to one of the camps in Keana Local Government Area of the state. It was indeed quite evident that food shortage and absence of basic medical facilities represent the major problems confronting the internally displaced persons.\n\n\n\nNarrating their ordeals, John Tavershima, who acts as the \u2018Secretary\u2019 for the IDPs, told Arewa Voice that the IDPs were facing hard times due to shortage of food, relief materials and medical facilities. He stated that although the state government had sent some supplies to the camp, the palliatives were grossly inadequate to cater for the over 12,000 IDPs in the camp.\n\n\n\nTavershima even pointed to a critically-ill patient in the camp, whose name he gave as Thomas Iowundu, who, he said, needs urgent medical attention to save his life but has not received any help from any quarter over the months, a reason why his predicament continues to linger.\n\n\n\nREAD ALSO: NEMA boss flags off food distribution in Borno IDPs camp\n\nSummoning up courage and strength, Thomas managed to speak about his desperate condition and pleaded for help to rescue him from possible. \u201cI\u2019ve been very ill, coughing and vomiting blood unceasingly, with my chest pumping as if it is going to break out of me, especially at night,\u201d Iowundu said.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy mother and I were forced to relocate to the camp during the recent crisis that affected many Tiv communities this year in Doma, Keana and Obi local government areas of the state. My mother has been trying her best to see me recover from the illness, but there has been no money to go to the hospital for proper medical check and there is no proper medical attention here in the camp. I do not want to die in the IDP camp and that is why I am appealing to the Nasarawa State Government and other well-meaning Nigerians and organisations to come to my assistance because I am in severe pain at the moment,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nOn her part, the mother of Thomas, Mrs. Justina Iowundu, said she had ten children with Thomas as her fourth child, adding that as a widow, she has been overstretching herself to put food on the table for the family. That has been the case since the recent farmers/herders crisis struck and forced them to relocate from the community in Angwan Yara in Keana LGA to take refuge in the IDP camp. The widow, who said her son\u2019s illness had rendered her financially handicapped, appealed for support to save the life of her son and others facing hardship in the camp.\n\n\n\nIn a swift reaction, the Executive Secretary of Nasarawa State Emergency Management Agency, Zakari Allumaga said the state government was not aware of the challenges in the IDPs and Thomas\u2019 situation. He assured, however, that government would look into the issues raised by the management of the camp, adding that the state ministry of health would be adequately informed about the condition of Thomas for necessary medical attention.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Their colourful traditional attires also matched with the mood of the festivity.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to Arewa Voice on the sideline of the event, the Chairman of Bali LGA, Musa Mahmud, explained that the Jibu people who are part of the Jukun have been celebrating the festivity for over 200 years.\n\n\n\nMahmud said: \u201cThis event is celebrated yearly and we are happy it coincided with this year\u2019s Eid-el-Kabir celebration. As you have observed, it brought together adherents of various religions who are sons and daughters of Jibu from within and outside the country. We also had in attendance other ethnic nationalities in the state, who came here to felicitate with us.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe use this forum to discuss different issues concerning us and to cement our relationship with other ethnic groups. We don\u2019t intend to stop this but hope to improve on it so that the state\u2019s economy can benefit from this. The name \u2018Taraba\u2019 as we all know emanated from Bali LGA and we are seeing this annual celebration as a means to draw tourists from within and outside the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe paramount ruler of Jibu Chiefdom (Kuru Jibu), His Royal Highness Abubakar Mahmud, appreciated those who attended the cultural event and expressed joy that the festival drew a massive crowd to the area. \u201cWe are a peaceful people and the significance of this event is to further cement our relationship with other tribes. We are also grateful to Governor Darius Ishaku who has been a custodian of peaceful coexistence across the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is evident that the atmosphere of peace is what we are enjoying in Bali LGA and we want this to continue,\u201d the royal father said\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

We are disappointed by such a statement coming from a supposed elder statesman like Edwin Clark.\n\n\u201cThough he betrayed Biafra during the war of 1967 1970 against his brothers and sisters in and today where is Edwin Clerk in the scheme of things in Nigeria, only the monthly salary Fulani slave masters placed him for betraying his people then. Biafra will come Edwin Clerk will fail in his betrayal salary getting from the enemy and on blood of his people but he must know that he cannot stop Biafra with his inconsequential utterances cannot stop because he was paid to do so. We know his job and DNA is betrayal and sabotage even though he sabotaged his brother former President Goodluck Ebele Johnathan as president of Nigeria. He always takes sabotage and betrayal as norms. It is unbelievable and unfortunate he continues doing this until younger generations know that it is his hubby.\n\n\u201cThe likes of Edwin Clark are the reason Biafra is being treated as slaves in their own domain today. A man at the age of Edwin Clark is supposed not to be economical with the truth or deceive the young generation because of parochial interest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too appalling that Edwin Clerk doesn\u2019t know that those who own Biafra are those he referred to as South South or Niger Delta as the Case may be. How suddenly Edwin Clark has forgotten that it was an Izon man who brought the name \u2018Biafra\u2019 to the table for approval which Ojukwu and his Eastern Consultative Assembly approved without hesitation or debate!\u201d\n\nLawan, Gbaja, lawmakers, North dislike Niger Delta \u2013 Edwin Clark on PIB",

The individuals designated today are:\n\n\u201cAlex Nain Saab Mor\u00e1n and Alvaro Enrique Pulido Vargas for exploiting two of Venezuela\u2019s public programmes which were set up to supply poor Venezuelans with affordable foodstuffs and housing.

This included the purchase of a $100m mansion in Paris and a $38 million private jet\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cKudakwashe Regimond Tagwirei for profiting from misappropriation of property when his company, Sakunda Holdings, redeemed Government of Zimbabwe Treasury Bills at up to ten times their official value. His actions accelerated the devaluation of Zimbabwe\u2019s currency, increasing the price of essentials, such as food, for Zimbabwean citizens\n\n\u201cNawfal Hammadi Al-Sultan has been involved in serious corruption in his role as Governor of Nineveh province, Iraq, where he misappropriated public funds intended for reconstruction efforts and to provide support for civilians, and improperly awarded contracts and other state property. Al-Sultan is currently serving a combined five-year prison sentence in Iraq for corruption offences, including wasting five billion Iraqi dinars (approximately \u00a32.5 million) through fictitious public works\u201d\n\nThe foreign secretary added that the UK is committed to fighting corruption and holding those responsible for its corrosive effect to account.\n\n\u201cThese measures follow the first tranche of UK sanctions under the Global Anti-Corruption sanctions regime in April, which targeted 22 individuals involved in serious corruption cases in Russia, South Africa, South Sudan and Latin America,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe financial restrictions will also apply to any entities owned or controlled by the persons designated.",

          "title": "CBN regulations holding back mobile money revolution in Nigeria",
          "text": "In Ghana, it would be an \u201canomaly\u201d for a supermarket, small store, or business merchant to not use a mobile money service for transactions. Daniel, a colleague at TechCabal, who visited Ghana two weeks ago said the same during a recent meeting.\n\nMobile money was first introduced in Ghana in 2009. However, it took some time for it to gain traction due to a restrictive Branchless Banking policy of the Bank of Ghana.\n\nNew agent and electronic money guidelines were released in 2014, allowing network operators to run mobile money services, with supervision from the banking regulator.\n\nEver since, players such as MTN have invested heavily in mobile money operations with great success. The telco giant launched its MoMo service in January 2017. By January 2019, over 100,000 merchants were using the service.\n\nUptake in mobile money services and financial inclusion have equally increased across the country. A March 2020 Summary of Economic and Financial Data published by the Bank of Ghana showed that the country had 14.7 million active mobile money accounts and 235,000 active agents.\n\nOn the other end of the cardinal point is M-Pesa\u2019s success in East African countries, particularly Kenya. The mobile money service, owned and operated by telco Safaricom, has significantly contributed to improving the financial inclusion rate in Nairobi.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the government is banking on a mobile money service run by the state-owned network operator, Ethio Telecom, to increase financial inclusion among low-income groups. The service soared to more than 1 million registered users in one week, 4 million in a month, and 6 million in two months.\n\nDespite being home to Africa\u2019s largest unbanked population, Nigeria has not witnessed the same exponential growth in mobile money adoption and lags behind its regional peers when it comes to penetration.\n\nChasing financial inclusion\n\nFinancial inclusion for 200 million Nigerians has been a much-touted priority of Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration and the central bank under governor Godwin Emefiele\u2019s leadership. Still, it\u2019s a goal that has been elusive.\n\nNigeria has a significantly large population without access to financial services. In 2017, it was home to 3.4% of the world\u2019s unbanked people despite contributing 2.6% to the global population.\n\nSome progress has been made over the past decade to bring more Nigerians under the formal financial system, according to a report by EFinA, but the figures remain disturbing.\n\nAt the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked as the central bank missed out on its 80% national financial inclusion target. In addition, just over 40 million out of an estimated 105.5 million Nigerian adults have bank verification numbers (BVN), an important metric for gauging how many people have access to financial services.\n\nThe CBN has adopted several measures \u2013 such as the creation of special Payment Services Banks (PSBs) in 2018 \u2013 to drive financial inclusion.\n\nHowever, the apex bank has shown reluctance towards adopting a framework that has proved to be very effective in improving financial inclusion in many African countries: telecoms-driven mobile money services.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nPayment service banks, not mobile money operators\n\nIn 2018, CBN announced a new regime that would allow non-financial companies to apply for mobile banking licences \u2013 either as PSBs or Mobile Money Operators (MMOs).\n\nUnder the guidelines, mobile network operators are allowed to provide financial services to millions of unbanked Nigerians. However, they can do so only as payment service banks and through a subsidiary separate from their core operations.\n\nPayment service banks are like small-scale banks. While they\u2019re similar to typical banks, the scope of their license is strictly to deepen financial inclusion and the regulator forbids them from engaging in credit risk and foreign exchange operations.\n\nMore than two years after the CBN\u2019s announcement, just three companies (including mobile operators 9mobile and Globacom) have been granted PSB licences. The two other network companies in the country, MTN and Airtel, are yet to get a regulatory nod to launch their Payment Service Banks. Although the former launched an agent network for money transfers in 2019.\n\nThe lack of progress on licences \u2013 particularly for two telcos that have significant mobile money experience in other markets in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 calls into question how dedicated the central bank is to really broaden access to financial services in the country.\n\nSome industry stakeholders blame the issue on lobbying by traditional financial institutions said to be wary of telco-led mobile money services. Banks perceive that network operators would claim their territory if allowed to offer standalone financial services.\n\nAccording to one telecom industry expert who asked not to be named, the \u201cbig banks are fighting back behind the scenes to ensure telcos don\u2019t come to have their lunch.\u201d\n\nWill telcos ever lead?\n\nIn Nigeria, the mobile money landscape is dominated by banks, technology, and financial services companies. Contrary to what is seen in Kenya and Ghana, telecoms operators are not allowed to apply directly for mobile money licences and are instead restricted to the provision of network infrastructure for the use of mobile money operators.\n\nThe regulatory framework is one of the core reasons why mobile money uptake has been relatively slow in Nigeria. As of 2019, there were just over 15 million mobile money accounts in the country, compared to nearly 60 million in Kenya, which is home to fewer than 55 million people.\n\nFintech companies have recorded significant strides towards advancing financial inclusion in Nigeria. Companies such as Paga and Teamapt democratise access to financial services through their agent networks and mobile payments infrastructure.\n\nBut telecoms companies are more positioned to deepen mobile money services due to their subscriber numbers, available infrastructure, and broader agent networks, which outnumber those of banks and fintechs. MTN and Airtel agents can be seen selling recharge cards in nearly every corner of the country.\n\n\u201cThe telecoms industry has ready infrastructure and resources to push financial inclusion all over the country. If you truly want to deepen the use of mobile technology for financial service, the last mile to reach the people is through network operators,\u201d the expert said.\n\nThere have been calls for a more liberalised regulatory framework where telcos lead. However, if the CBN\u2019s latest mobile money regulatory framework published July 9 is anything to go by, network operators will continue to play the second fiddle in Nigeria\u2019s mobile money space under the current administration.\n\nIn the new framework, the banking regulator reiterates its long-held stance that Nigeria will not adopt the model in which telecommunications companies are the drivers of mobile money services.\n\n\u201cThe CBN recognises the importance of Mobile Network Operators in the operations of mobile money services and appreciates the criticality of the infrastructure they provide. However, the telco-led model (where the lead initiator is an MNO) shall not be operational in Nigeria,\u201d the 40-page document reads.\n\nThe framework stated only two acceptable models for the implementation of mobile money services: bank-led (bank and/or its consortium as lead initiator) and non-bank-led (a corporate organisation duly licensed by the CBN as lead initiator).\n\nAlthough the CBN says it recognises the importance of telecoms companies in providing the infrastructure to drive the exchange of messages for mobile payments, it feels compelled to prohibit the Telco-led option. This, according to the bank, is to \u201cretain full control of monetary policy operations, minimise risks and ensure that the offering of financial services is driven by organisations that have been licensed to do so.\u201d\n\nAfter failing to meet its 2020 target, the CBN has revised its financial inclusion goal to 95% by 2024. But with its continued regulatory conservatism towards telecoms-led mobile money, the regulator is likely to find it only more difficult to bring millions of unbanked Nigerians into the financial system.\n\n\u201cCBN\u2019s models will only slow down financial inclusion penetration,\u201d the expert said. \u201cInstead, telecoms companies should be allowed to take the lead in the mobile money space as seen in other African countries. This is the only way speedy coverage and easy access can be achieved and financial inclusion improved.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "This app wants to simplify Twitter giveaways, without bank accounts",
          "text": "Let\u2019s say I wanted to send a surprise \u2018happy birthday\u2019 cash gift to a friend; my first thought would be to ask for their bank account number. I would do this for people I know very well but also for someone I only know on social media.\n\nBut what if my virtual friend, feeling we are not buddies as such or having been scarred by online money doubling scams, hesitates to share such personal information? Can I thrill them on their special day by using public information I have about them?\n\nSometime in June, I tried Vendly, a web app that is trialling a solution for this need (or desire, if you\u2019re not yet persuaded). \u2018Payments made Social\u2019 the landing page declares on a light green background. Bob Nzelu, the brain behind it, described it to me as a way to share and receive items of digital value \u2013 money, crypto, airtime, e-tickets \u2013 over social media.\n\n\u201cLike sending money through email addresses using PayPal, Vendly hopes to replicate that using social media handles,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that is just the basic use case he anticipates, cutting in to assuage my skepticism that money transfer on social media is a compelling enough value to build a (potentially venture-backed) company on. Long-term, Vendly will help social media users monetize their social media presence, the CEO said.\n\nBack to social money vending. Nzelu believes Vendly is similar to Cash App and Venmo because it seeks to simplify transfers between people who don\u2019t know each other. \u201cVendly is not built for chummy friends who have each other\u2019s account details.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor this type of relationship, creating a \u2018vend\u2019 with a social media handle and sharing the link with a beneficiary walks a fine line of not being too personal or invasive while caring.\n\nIt\u2019s the online equivalent of a co-worker dropping a birthday cake with a card at your desk but not inside your drawer.\n\nSomeone who receives a vend can decide to either make a claim for or ignore it by clicking the link in their DM. The message states the amount sent; recipient inputs the bank account where they want the cash to go. And like cakes, the link expires after some time (Nzelu sent me a vend of about $1 as a demo).\n\nVendly stores the recipient\u2019s bank details to make future transfers seamless but the sender never sees the account information. Because a sender can create one vend to go to multiple social media handles, Nzelu thinks it should appeal to brands or influencers who target giveaways at 3 million Nigerian social media users who have a bank account and phone number.\n\nVendly is part of a crop of social gifting apps seeking to delight people online.\n\nA few months ago, after my managing editor promised to get me a book, I got a Tweet from Showlove, a Lagos-based company, with a voucher to claim my books at a particular bookstore (thanks again, KK). Getcards, a product of the cryptocurrency startup Buycoins, was floated last December for people who want to gift services like a Netflix subscription, an Amazon or Delta airlines ticket to friends and family.\n\nLike these two services, Vendly hopes that its first platform for traction will be Twitter, because the platform is the most friendly for services that require people to click links to claim rewards.\n\nBut Nzelu knows that can\u2019t be the long-term plan. After all, Twitter is officially banned in Nigeria at the moment, an event that currently hampers Vendly\u2019s ability to be fully functional. An alternative is to send vends using phone numbers, although that option might raise privacy concerns. Integrating other platforms \u2013 Instagram, Facebook \u2013 is on their roadmap.\n\nRight now, Vendly is a prototype undergoing iteration. It may yet face hard questions about monetization, like Abeg\u2019s mobile app which launched last year to enable peer-to-peer money transfers using social handles. But Nzelu says Vendly will answer most user concerns at launch in a few weeks.\n\nHe\u2019s been working at it for two years now and feels the time is right to tap into the social and creator economy bump that started last year. Being Nigerian, his home country is the market of choice. But if it proves tough for a start, Vendly will seek initial users in Ghana, Kenya and Uganda.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Telecommunications infrastructure owned by several mobile network operators was severely damaged in the rampant looting and destruction of property that rocked South Africa last week.\n\nThe Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) revealed on Tuesday, July 13, that the vandalism included more than 100 mobile network towers in some parts of the country.\n\nAfter the statement, rioters destroyed many more mobile sites, according to multiple reports. Virtually all network providers operating in South Africa reported disruption to service delivery.\n\nMTN alone reported damage to over 100 of its base stations which the company\u2019s technicians could not safely reach the sites to repair.\n\n\u201cOver 1,000 MTN employees can\u2019t get to work, and millions of calls and queries from our customers cannot be attended to, as our primary call centre remains inaccessible,\u201d MTN South Africa chief executive, Godfrey Motsa, said Friday.\n\nAccording to Vodacom spokesperson, Byron Kennedy, there was a connectivity issue that affected customers in many parts of the country. Like MTN, the crisis prevented its staff from fixing a fault in its infrastructure.\n\n\u201cUnrest in these areas meant that it wasn\u2019t safe for technicians to immediately visit affected sites physically to remedy faults,\u201d Kennedy was quoted as saying by MyBroadband. An estimated five to ten of Vodacom\u2019s base stations at malls were also damaged by fires.\n\nData-only operator Rain, which has a lease agreement for using Vodacom\u2019s network towers, also said it has sites in the affected areas that had been vandalised and were down. The network provider operates in South Africa\u2019s major metropolitan areas with 3,000 towers.\n\nChildren are evacuated from a burning building in downtown Durban, South Africa.

          "text": "The Pasteur Institute in Senegal will produce rapid antigen tests for diagnosing the coronavirus disease from early 2022 with the help of a new tech transfer agreement.\n\nThe Dakar-based centre is partnering with Bionote, a South Korean company that provides diagnostic solutions for Covid-19, and Mologic, a British biotech company set to be acquired by a Bill Gates-backed consortium.\n\nAn antigen test is regarded as a suitable \u2018first line of defense\u2019 against the coronavirus disease for individuals who have symptoms. It is a simpler and quicker procedure compared to other approaches like PCR testing.\n\nA typical antigen testing takes around 15 minutes to determine whether a patient is infected, although it is less accurate than PCR, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe agreement between Pasteur and the companies was disclosed in a statement from two international health agencies, UNITAID and FIND, a global alliance for diagnostics, as reported by Reuters.\n\n\u201cHigh-quality antigen tests are the primary diagnostic tool for detecting active infection in poorer settings where molecular testing is not available,\u201d the statement read.\n\nUnder the deal, the technology and expertise for making the Covid tests will be passed from the foreign pharmaceutical giants to Pasteur\u2019s DiaTROPIX, a diagnostic test production unit launched in November. The goal is to boost Covid detection in Africa.\n\n\u201cExpanded production capacity in local and regional hubs is critical to ensuring that healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries can implement effective testing strategies to contain the spread of the virus,\u201d UNITAID spokesman Herve Verhoosel, said.\n\nDiaTROPIX will seek regulatory approval in Senegal for the tests transferred from Mologic and Bionote and commercialise them under its own brand. It plans to make 2.5 million tests per month in 2022, according to the statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnprecedented surge in infections\n\nCompared to its regional peers like South Africa and Nigeria, Senegal has seen fewer coronavirus-related cases and deaths.\n\nDakar has so far recorded more than 52,000 infections and 1,220 deaths since the outbreak started. The numbers pale in comparison to South Africa\u2019s (2.24 million infections and 65,000+ deaths) and Nigeria\u2019s (169,000+ infections and 2,000+ deaths).\n\nHowever, the rapid antigen test deal involving the Pasteur Institute comes at a time when Senegal is grappling with soaring coronavirus cases.\n\nAccording to health ministry spokesman Mamadou Ndiaye, the West African nation was seeing an \u201cunprecedented\u201d surge in Covid infections. He said this after a new daily record of 733 cases was recorded, beating the previous record of 529 cases.\n\nMore than 25% of the 2,854 tests carried out in the past 24 hours to Wednesday came back positive, according to Ndiaye.\n\nVaccinations have been slow, making Senegal vulnerable to fresh surges. Out of over 16 million people, only 590,969 have been vaccinated. Senegal lacks enough doses to vaccinate everyone, like most African countries.\n\nSenegalese authorities are expecting 165,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine and 300,000 doses of China\u2019s Sinopharm shots, Ndiaye said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nVictoria here.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nTwitter\u2019s shiny new downvote button\n\nConvergence\u2019 Partners\u2019 $120m round\n\nCellulant\u2019s licence approval in Tanzania\n\nTwitter is testing out a downvote button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Claudio Schwarz | @purzlbaum on Unsplash\n\nWhat happened? Micro-blogging platform, Twitter is testing a way to upvote or downvote replies as part of efforts to understand what users find relevant in a conversation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does this work? Twitter says while the downvote button will be visible, only the reply owner can know the exact number received.\n\nFor now, it is a test for a research the company is conducting to see if the up and down voting match what it suggests as relevant replies. It is currently available to a few iOS users.\n\nHave we seen something similar? Platforms like Reddit and YouTube have a downvote and dislike button, respectively.\n\nHowever, according to Twitter, this is not a dislike button and while it bears some resemblance to Reddit\u2019s downvote button, it will not affect the order of replies. This means they will not be ranked according to the highest numbe of downvotes.\n\nWait a minute, how will this improve interaction on Twitter? Will it reduce toxic tweets? Won\u2019t this encourage trolls especially since only the recipient can see it?\n\nWell, I found Ashton Kutcher, actor and tech investor\u2019s comments on a \u201cdislike button\u201d quite interesting.\n\nPer CNET, Kutcher believes a dislike button will head off more volatile expressions of disagreement on social media platforms, giving people a simple, frictionless way to give negative feedback.\n\nI\u2019m somewhat inclined to agree but I still have some reservations. I also wonder if there might be an option to turn this feature off if you don\u2019t want it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, in May 2021, Jane Wachung Wong, an app researcher, revealed that Twitter was working on adding Facebook-like reactions \u2014 \ud83d\ude02, \ud83e\udd14, \ud83d\ude13 \u2014 to the platform.\n\nWhat is Twitter going to spring on us next? Any ideas? Let me know what you think in the comments section below.\n\nCellulant\u2019s licence approval in Tanzania\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTanzanian shilling notes\n\nWhat happened? Kenyan African payments company, Cellulant, has received approval-in-principle from the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) to operate as a Payment Solution Service Provider (PSSP) in the country, having met all the necessary requirements.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means Cellulant is now one of the PSSPs supported by the Bank of Tanzania to offer digital payments solutions across the country.\n\nDo you know? Cellulant was founded in 2002 as a music streaming platform that enabled musicians to get a percentage of the money paid by fans to download their songs.\n\nThen over the years, the music streaming platform rebranded as a fintech company, offering digital payments and managing an ecosystem of retailers, merchants, banks, mobile network operators, governments, and international development partners.\n\nWith a physical presence in 18 African countries, the company boasts of offering more than 154 payment choices in 34 countries, and connecting 220 million users to a single inclusive network, enabling interoperability that has evaded multiple companies in the payments market.\n\nIn July 2021, Cellulant launched Trigg, a digital payments network, in Zambia, that enables companies around the country to seamlessly take payments from their customers.\n\nTrigg is said to help businesses wishing to digitise their payments to collect and make payments across many payment methods and currencies with the greatest customer experience.\n\nEdwin Kiiru, Tanzania\u2019s Cellulant Country Manager, says the approval by the BOT will enable the company to extend its payment solutions across all spectrums of Tanzania\u2019s payments ecosystem.\n\nCellulant\u2019s new approval will allow it connect to banks, online merchants, payment processors, merchants, state governments, and customers to meet their digital payment demands in Tanzania.\n\nConvergence Partners raises $120 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African tech investment firm, Convergence Partners, has raised $120 million to drive inclusion in Africa.\n\nWho participated in the round? CDC Group the UK\u2019s development finance institution, the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Proparco \u2014 private sector arm of the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD Group) \u2014 participated in the round.\n\nWhat about Convergence Partners? Founded by Andile Ngcaba, CEO, in 2006, the investment firm is focused on the Technology, Media and Telecom (TMT) sector in Africa.\n\nAccording to the official website, the firm has invested in submarine cable systems, geostationary satellites, terrestrial long-haul, metro and access fibre, wireless networks, data centres, and service provision like enterprise connectivity, fintech and healthtech solutions, and data switching since its launch.\n\nIn February 2021, it acquired Ctrack, a telematics Software-as-a-Service (Saas) digital infrastructure platform that offers fleet management, insurance and weather telematic solutions and asset tracking solutions to its subscribers in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nThe new funding will be utilised to further digital infrastructure\u2019s emerging growth areas, particularly fibre, wireless, data centres, 5G, Cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), network virtualisation, and artificial intelligence.\n\nAlso, the funding when invested is aimed at boosting entrepreneurship, innovation, skills development, and creating jobs while increasing access to the Internet and all the critical digital tools it provides.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nTwitter may be adding voice effects to Spaces.

Open to Kenyans, Nigerians, and Ghanaians, applications began on July 19 and will close on August 2, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGaming has evolved from a simple way to pass the time to one of the most profitable industries in the world.\n\nFor context: In September 2013, on launch day, Grand Theft Auto V made $800 million. According to Fast Company, this is more sales in 24 hours than any movie or musical album in history.\n\nMobile gaming: Per Business Wire, the mobile gaming market was worth $98 billion globally in 2020 and is expected to grow to $272 billion by 2030.\n\nInterestingly, people play more games on mobile than personal computers (PC) and consoles. According to Kevuru games, 59.9% of games were played on mobile in 2020, while 28.70% and 16.11% were played on PC and console, respectively.\n\nWhile nothing beats gaming on a 60\u201d, 4K display TV\u2014 at least for me \u2014 smartphones are mobile, hence their lead.\n\nTo know more about the GameUpAfrica Bootcamp, check out this article\n\nNew features on Instagram and YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram is giving users more control over the kind of content they consume on the app.\n\nOn July 20, 2021, the company announced in a blog post that it was launching Sensitive Content Control. The feature will help users control the content they want to see on the content discovery page, Explore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this mean? Essentially, Instagram is giving you the option to decide which kind of content you want to see while you scroll through the \u2018Explore\u2019 page. Not a puppy person? No more doggy pictures jumping out of your timeline.\n\nAccording to Instagram, sensitive content isn\u2019t content that breaks the rules but could upset some users.\n\nMore control: Back in May 2021, Facebook and Instagram allowed users to remove the Like count on their posts to give them more power over their experience on the apps.\n\nWhile Instagram is giving more power, YouTube wants to help creators make more money.\n\nOn July 20, 2021, YouTube announced it is rolling out a beta version of its new feature, Super Thanks.\n\nWhat\u2019s that? Well, YouTube says in its blog post that it\u2019s a way for fans to show appreciation to their favourite creators on the platform.\n\nHow does it work? While you\u2019re watching a video \u2014 live or not \u2014 you can purchase a Super Thanks that ranges between $2 to $50 to show your appreciation.\n\nYou can make payments through Google Pay, the same way you pay for apps on the Play Store.\n\nStill in beta: According to YouTube, \u201cSuper Thanks is currently in beta and with today\u2019s expansion, is now available to thousands of monetising creators. The feature is available to creators and viewers in 68 countries on desktop and mobile devices.\u201d\n\nClubhouse no longer requires an invite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Dmitry Mashkin on Unsplash\n\nOn Wednesday, July 21, 2021, live-audio chat platform Clubhouse announced in a blog post that it is no longer in beta testing and the app is no longer invite-only.\n\nFor the past 16 months, Clubhouse was exclusive to invites only. Before now, you needed someone already invited to the platform with your phone number to send you an invite. Business Insider says some people even started a business out of selling invites\n\nWhile this exclusivity made it even more appealing, it was a way to control the rise in the number of app users.\n\nIn its blog, Clubhouse said the invite system was essential to its history. By adding people in waves, it has been able to \u201cgrow Clubhouse in a measured way, and (mostly \ud83d\ude2c ) keep things from breaking\u201d\n\nBreaking the barriers: The invite system wasn\u2019t the only thing that made Clubhouse exclusive. Until May 2021, it was only available to iPhone users.\n\nAs competition mounts from Twitter and Facebook, the app seems to be shedding its exclusivity to accommodate more users.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nDON\u2019T buy a new PC for Windows 11!

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Google\u2019s interest in Africa\u2019s tech talent pool deepens, the tech giant has partnered with Nigerian-founded game development studio, Maliyo Games, to open applications for a mobile game developer training program. Called GameUpAfrica Bootcamp, the program is available to interested individuals in Kenya, Ghana, and Nigeria.\n\nThe applications, which opened on Monday, July 19, 2021 \u2014 and closes by August 2 \u2014 will offer developers planning to build a career in game development access to mentorship and relevant tools. Selected applicants will go through a virtual training program from August 16 to December 23, 2021, where they will learn to refine, package, and develop Android games.\n\nBeing a project-based learning program, by the end of the training period, successful participants will be evaluated based on the completion of the curriculum and ability to publish a game on the Google Play Store successfully.\n\nParticipants will pass through three levels of training, themed: Game Development Fundamentals, Succeed on the Play Store, and Publish Your First Game. The successful completion of one level validates moving to the next level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEligibility\n\nIntending applicants must:\n\nReside in Nigeria, Ghana, or Kenya\n\nHave a basic background in programming languages like C#, C++, and PHP.\n\nOwn a PC.\n\nBe available to commence Bootcamp by August 16, 2021\n\nNote: Selected participants will be judged based on three metrics: competence, commitment, and creativity.\n\nApplication process\n\nApplicants will pass through two stages before final shortlisting.\n\nStage one: Fill the online application form on the company website.\n\nStage two: After scaling the first stage, shortlisted candidates will have to undergo a C# (a core language for game developers) assessment to demonstrate their competence in the programming language. The assessment is scheduled to hold on August 9, 2021.\n\nNote: The organisers will provide data allowance for selected developers during the training.\n\nAbout GameUpAfrica Bootcamp\n\nThe GameUpAfrica Bootcamp is an adaptation of an existing training project by Maliyo Games, which was instituted in 2020. It is a curriculum-based training program that prospective hires must go through before they are accepted into the company.\n\nBetween 2020 and now, the company has trained seven people and absorbed one into the company. Interestingly, the program was born out of the need to solve the problem of talent acquisition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe actually launched this program because, as a game development studio, we are constantly looking for talented individuals to join our team. And because of a lack of structured education system that produces competent game developers in Nigeria, we made the decision last year to launch an in-house program that will enable us to train individuals who are interested in becoming game developers.\u201d That\u2019s Hugo Obi, Founder, Maliyo Games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHugo Obi, Founder, Maliyo Games. Source: Supplied\n\nFounded in 2012, the company has grown to become one of Nigeria\u2019s longest-standing Android game development studios. According to the founder, this is one of the qualities that attracted Google to the project, aside from the fact that Maliyo Games has published some Africa-themed games on the Google Play Store.\n\nNotable mentions include Aboki Run (similar to Temple Run), Whot King, and Jungle escape. Others like Danfo Racer are still in development.\n\nEven though the company\u2019s initial intention for the curriculum is limited to the Nigerian market, Google\u2019s partnership increased the scope to reach multiple locations, thereby raising the number of selected applicants to 500. In addition to that, Google will also provide support for app store success, which includes successful publishing of content on Google Play Store.\n\nAnother way this program will help beginner game developers is by providing them with a pool of mentors. Going by the number of admitted candidates, mentorship will not only come from Maliyo Games team, but the company will also crowdsource mentors from the international gaming ecosystem.\n\nExperienced mentors can volunteer through this link.\n\nMaliyo Games\u2019 fit\n\nAs is typical of content from many indigenous companies, Maliyo Games studio ensures that its content reflects the African scene.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t do the generic stuff, like working for third parties and designing based on their requirements or being part of a production team where we only look after one aspect of e development. For us, it has always been about African-inspired. And this is what stands us out in the gaming community,\u201d the founder explains.\n\nFor Obi, the ultimate goal of the GameUpAfrica Bootcamp \u2014 which could become a yearly affair \u2014 is to upskill people and have more game developers in the African gaming ecosystem. In addition to that, to increase the number of African-published content on the Google Play Store, and help to identify and attract talents into the company as it plans to grow its team.\n\nIn achieving the former, Obi reveals that top candidates from the Bootcamp will be linked with other studios across the continent. Already, there are existing internal partnerships with studios in Kenya, Ghana, and Senegal.\n\nAside from that, Maliyo Games is part of the Africa Game Developer Community, where it networks with gaming studios in South Africa, Uganda, Cameroon, and Ethiopia. Eventually, Obi believes that the Bootcamp will become a talent pipeline for these studios.\n\nMeanwhile, game studios looking to hire developers through the program can show their interest here.\n\nAfrica\u2019s gaming industry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe growth of the African gaming industry has been gaining momentum for the past three years with growing broadband and smartphone penetration. In fact, prospects are increasing despite the pandemic.\n\nObi likens games to music and movies, not only as a form of escape, but also entertainment which is universally accepted without discrimination of the source.\n\nHe identifies three major challenges that may have stalled the growth of the country\u2019s gaming industry in the past decade: talent, distribution, and monetisation.\n\nIn his opinion, in the past 9 years of running Maliyo Games, opportunities that exist now are thinning out the effects of these challenges. For instance, global distribution channels now exist \u2014 the likes of app stores \u2014 supporting reach and marketing, and payment solutions abound.\n\nWith this, creators can focus on developing and releasing content. If anything, local content are assured of global consumption. Obi\u2019s dream is that by the end of 2022, a product of the Bootcamp would become a highly grossed game on the Google Play Store.\n\nWith projects like this, Africa\u2019s gaming community is, perhaps, on its way to becoming a major contributor to the over $121.1 billion global mobile gaming industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo of Commonwealth Of Zion Assembly (COZA) has thrown his support behind David Oyedepo of Winners\u2019 Chapel, who is embroiled in a scandal over the firing of his subordinates.\n\nAccording to Politics Nigeria, in a video that went popular on social media, one Pastor Peter Godwin said that the Oyedepo-led denomination fired him and other pastors for not generating enough money in their various branches.\n\nAccording to Godwin, on Thursday, July 1, 2021, the state pastor of the church, whose name he did not specify, invited him along with forty of his colleagues and issued them the sack letters.\n\nHis words: \u201cActually, by the special grace of God, our father in this great assembly, Living Faith Church received a mandate from the Lord to plant 10,000 churches in Nigeria and by the special grace of God, I was privileged to be one of the pastors that were employed on the 28th of August, 2020, that was last year.\n\n\u201cSo after that, I started working, engaging myself in the work of the Lord. I tried my possible best to make sure I win souls for Christ but unfortunately, on the 1st of July, I received a call that the state pastor wants to see me, so I thought I was the only one. I was surprised, so I went to his office.\n\n\u201cWhen I got there, I saw other pastors too, over 40 of them, so I joined them. A few minutes later, we were issued a letter. I opened the content of the letter to see what was there and I saw that it was a sack letter.\n\n\u201cThe content of the letter says \u2018Consequent upon the recent performance review which revealed that your church growth index falls below expectation. Please be informed that your service as the pastor in charge is no longer required in this commission with immediate effect. You are to vacate your official accommodation and hand over all properties including the official ID card to the area pastor before departure.\n\n\u201cSo I called the management the next day to know what happened since I wasn\u2019t involved in any dubious activity or evil act. I was told by the management was that the church doesn\u2019t operate at a loss, they also told me the total income that is being generated from my station should be able to cater for my welfare and accommodation, so as a result of low income, I\u2019m hereby dismissed.\u201d\n\nWhile addressing his audience, Oyedepo confirmed that the pastors were really fired, and wondered why there was no noise on social media while the church employed 7,000 people.\n\n\u201cPeople are confused about our Ministry. I learnt some fellows said, \u201cyou know, they are not bringing income, that is why they asked them to go,\u201d he said.\n\nContinuing, he added: \u201cWe asked you to go because you are unfruitful. Unfruitful! Blatant failure. Doing what there? We have no patience with failure here.\n\n\u201cWhen we employed 7,000 people at a time, social media was dead.\n\n\u201cWe have more employees in this organisation than most of the states. No one is owed a dime salary and we don\u2019t borrow, we don\u2019t beg. Ask our bank whether we take overdraft.\n\n\u201cWe are covenant bound, working in the light of God\u2019s word, enjoying an open Heaven.\u201d\n\nBacking the bishop for sacking the pastors, Fatoyinbo shared Oyedepo\u2019s explanation to why the pastors were sacking, captioning it \u201cno room for laziness and unfruitfulness.\u201d",

          "text": "The dust raised by the 3% Host Communities Trust Fund approved by both chambers of the National Assembly in the recently passed Petroleum Industry Bill ( PIB) remained unsettled, with Senator Seriake Dickson ( PDP Bayelsa West) raising the fear the proposal may lead to unrest in the Niger Delta region.\n\nThe lawmaker also justified the backlash being faced by the Senate from Nigerians over amendment made to Clause 52(3) of the Electoral Act (Amendment ) Bill 2021, which according to him, unconstitutionally subordinated independence of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC).\n\nExpressing his anger over perceived shortcomings in the two bills at a media briefing Thursday in Abuja , Dickson described the two legislations as offensive and insensitive to concerned Nigerians.\n\nHe specifically declared that the PIB passed with 3% for Host Communities Fund won\u2019t in anyway, help Nigeria and investors in the oil and gas sectors.\n\nThe former governor also said the 5% earlier recommended by both Committees of the National Assembly which was even far below the 10% being demanded by stakeholders across the various oil producing communities, ought to have been retained in the interest of fairness , justice and equity.\n\nHe said: \u201d When PIB was first introduced and forwarded to the National Assembly by the late President Umaru Yar\u2019 Adua , 10% was proposed for Host Communities fund and Frontier Basins for exploration of oil as against the Bill recently passed , given 3% for Host Communities and 30% for Frontier Basins.\n\n\u201cThese, as far as the people of Niger Delta or oil producing states are concerned, are unjustifiable and look like opening another chapter for unrest in the area which will not benefit anybody.\n\n\u201cImagine the problem the country has been facing with Boko Haram insurgency in the North East for the past ten years, the Armed banditry and kidnapping also being faced in the North West within the last three to four years as well as agitations being faced in South West and South East , to now be added up with avoidable crisis in the South South.\n\n\u201cThose of us from the area did our best to prevail on our colleagues to listen to us and buy into our demands but number or majority position was used, which in actual fact do not build a Nation with diversities like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMight and Majority do not build a diversified nation like Nigeria but presence of Justice , fairness. Mere reliance on numbers without fairness, equity and justice is inimical to Nation building,\u201d the lawmaker said.\n\nHe therefore appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari not to assent to the bill ,but send it back for more consultation and required inclusiveness in its proposals.\n\nDickson disclosed that he along other senators from the zone staged a walk out from the dinner night President Buhari had with the 109 Senators and 360 members of the House of Representatives, held before the final consideration and passage of the bill when they discovered that it was 3% being canvassed for Host Communities.\n\n\u201cIt was a terrible evening for us on account of the 3% proposal, which as a politician of conviction and not that of convenience, led to my walk out from the dinner along with some other Senators.\n\n\u201cWe put up the required moves on the floor of the Senate to push it up to 5% as recommended by the joint committees of both chambers but those who rely solely on numbers , have their way,\u201d the lawmaker said.\n\nOn the controversial amendment made by the Senate on Clause 52(3) of the Electoral Act (Amendment) 2021, Dickson said the backlash being received by Senate over the amendment was not unexpected.\n\nThis, he said, was because the original proposal made in the clause had already taken care of whatever exigencies being envisaged on electronic transmission of election results.\n\n\u201cAs a member of the Senate Committee on INEC, the phrase of where and when practicable used in clause 52(3) was enough to take care of any exigencies , making the amendment which included NCC in the entire process , unnecessary and unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cFortunately, a window of striking out that amendment is already provided by the House of Representatives which adopted the clause as originally proposed.\n\n\u201cSo it is expected that the earlier version of the clause, will be the one to be adopted by the confluence Committee which will be set up by both chambers for the required harmonization of reports before transmitting the bill to the President for assent,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nNigeria\u2019s Chief of Defense Staff (CDS) General Lucky Irabor has warned that the country\u2019s security authorities will not tolerate any form of violence in the guise of agitations and secessionists\u2019 threats, urging people to channel their grievances via the right quarters.\n\nGeneral Irabor made the remark when he met with retired senior military officers in the Southeast in Owerri, the Imo State capital on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe military will resist any attempt by anybody, group or individual wanting to use the instrument of violence against the state, that we will not allow,\u201d the CDS noted but added that the military is not against peaceful agitations.\n\n\u201cAgain, there are provisions for anyone who believes that he has certain desires within the confines of the arrangement as enshrined in the Constitution to ventilate such views.\n\n\u201cSo this is the reason why we think that violence is not the way to go, we are appealing to everyone to seek the course of rule of law to bring about whatever his agitations are.\u201d\n\nThe CDS described retired military officers as valuable assets in the country\u2019s fight against criminality. He said the officers, having served the nation, have a crucial role to play in quelling agitations and stamping out crime in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cGiven the current dynamics of insecurity, the asymmetric nature of its spread, dit behooves retired senior officers to advise us on the way forward towards for their containment,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201dYes, the Armed Forces, just at it was earlier pointed out, are at the forefront of addressing these security threats but we also believe that the feedback coming from you will be very critical in redressing these security issues.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Bandits Release Over 70 Abducted Women In Zamfara\n\nREAD ALSO: Ortom Laments Over Killing Of Two Aide Workers, Six Others By Suspected Herdsmen\n\nREAD ALSO: Sunday Igboho Should Have Joined Amotekun \u2013 Ex-DSS Official\n\nCrackdown On Dissidents\n\nSeparatist agitations have gathered steam in the southern part of the country, further compounding Nigeria\u2019s security challenges which have lingered for years.\n\nIn the southeast, members of the outlawed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) led by Nnamdi Kanu are agitating for the creation of the Biafran nation from the region while Sunday \u2018Igboho\u2019 Adeyemo is leading calls for the carving out of a Yoruba nation from the southwest.\n\nBut the Nigerian government which recently launched a clampdown on secessionist movements in the West African country, has vowed to defend the nation\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nThe move seems to be yielding fruits as Kanu has been extradited to Nigeria -after jumping bail in 2017 \u2013 to face charges of \u201cterrorism, treasonable felony, managing an unlawful society, publication of defamatory matter, illegal possession of firearms and improper importation of goods, among others.\u201d\n\n\u2018Igboho\u2019s house in Ibadan was equally raided by the Department of State Services (DSS), with arms and ammunition recovered from the apartment. He was declared wanted by the Nigerian authorities and subsequently arrested in neigbouring Benin Republic weeks later.\n\nCritics have faulted the crackdown, insisting the move may cause more troubles for the country.\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong in canvassing for self-determination so long as such agitation is devoid of violence?\u201d the pan-Yoruba group, Afenifere asked following the raid on Igboho\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cThe constitution the country is running guarantees the right of every Nigerian to express an opinion and even carry out rallies as long as such is done without violence.\u201d",

          "title": "Kanye West Unveils New Album, Jay-Z Track at Listening Event",
          "text": "Kanye West barely said a word during his album listening session Thursday night, but the mercurial rapper still had most attendees standing on their feet while hanging on every word of his new project.\n\nWest unveiled his 10th studio album, \u201cDonda\u201d in front of a packed crowd at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. His album was named after his mother, Donda West, who died at the age of 58 following plastic surgery complications in 2007.\n\nPulling off the listening session \u2014 which was live-streamed on Apple Music \u2014 was an impressive feat for West, who sold out the venue after he announced two days ago that the first public listen of his highly-anticipated album would take place. Some of the big names who attended the event were Rick Ross, Khloe Kardashian and his estranged wife Kim Kardashian West, who showed up in a red jumpsuit with their kids.\n\nUnlike West\u2019s typical high-energy concerts, he appeared more mellow. He let his music do the talking while most attendees listened in silence and applauded at the end of each track of his album, slated for release Friday, that features gospel themes, hip-hop vibes, his Auto-Tune vocals, a track featuring his friend-mentor Jay-Z and recorded speeches made by his mother.\n\nWhile sporting an all-red outfit with orange shoes, West sometimes walked, fell to his knees, and pranced around on a white flooring about the size of the football field, where the city\u2019s professional football and soccer teams play home games.\n\nThe 22-time Grammy winner revealed in a commercial, featuring U.S. track star Sha\u2019Carri Richardson, during the NBA Finals on Tuesday that his album will be released Friday. The commercial, scored and directed by West, featured \u201cNo Child Left Behind,\u201d a song from the album.\n\nWhen West began playing \u201cNo Child Left Behind,\u201d he drop to one knee before he slightly lifted up into a track runner\u2019s stance like Richardson, who will miss the Tokyo Olympics after a positive marijuana test this month. The rapper then stood up and pointed his finger into the air as the words \u201che\u2019s done miracles on me\u201d were heard on the song.\n\nThe crowd appeared surprise to hear when Jay-Z began rapping on the final song of the listening session. On social media, the song was lauded for Jay-Z\u2019s verse that included \u201cThis might be the return of the throne,\u201d a nod toward the tandem\u2019s 2011 album \u201cWatch the Throne,\u201d which earned a Grammy nomination.\n\nAfter the song finished, West made his way toward the end zone area, stared at the crowd for a few moments and calmly walked off the floor as the audience collectively cheered for him.\n\nWest, 44, is mostly known as being associated with Chicago, but he was born in Atlanta \u2014 a Georgia city where there are no restrictions against large gatherings. He gifted 5,000 tickets to faculty, staff and students from some Atlanta HBCUs including Clark Atlanta, Morehouse, Spelman, Morris Brown and the Interdenominational Theological Center.\n\nWest\u2019s new project is a follow up to his 2019 gospel-themed album \u201cJesus is King,\u201d which won a Grammy for best contemporary Christian album.\n\nLast year, West announced on Twitter \u2014 with colorful cover art and a track list \u2014 that he would release his latest album. At the time, his tweets indicated that his project would release on the same day as his rival Taylor Swift\u2019s project \u201cFolklore,\u201d but his album ended up being postponed.\n\nThe two music stars have been in an ongoing beef since West famously interrupted Swift\u2019s speech during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards when she won for best female video. It appeared both put their differences aside after she introduced him when he won the video vanguard award at the 2015 VMAs, but a leaked video clip between both about his controversial song \u201cFamous\u201d caused more drama.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Kanye has hosted a listening event for an upcoming album. In 2016, he debuted his album \u201cThe Life of Pablo\u201d during a massive event and fashion show at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Several big names who attended the show included Kardashian West, 50 Cent, Lil Kim, Caitlyn Jenner, A$AP Rocky and 2 Chainz.",

          "text": "The Tokyo Olympic Games are upon us. They look and feel different to any other Games of times gone by, but they are here. At last.\n\nWith an unexpected additional year of preparation under their belts, more than 11,300 athletes from 207 nations will compete over the next couple of weeks, all vying to get their hands on the medal they\u2019ve worked so long for.\n\nWhen the Games were postponed in March 2020, organisers said the Olympic flame \u201ccould become the light at the end of the tunnel\u201d. With the Covid-19 pandemic still raging worldwide, that metaphorical tunnel is still being traversed, but Friday\u2019s opening ceremony offers a glimmer of that light.\n\n\u201cI think it will be a moment of joy and relief when entering the stadium, a moment of joy in particular for the athletes because I know how much they are longing for this moment,\u201d said International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach.\n\n\u201cThen they can finally be there, they can enjoy this moment under very special circumstances.\u201d\n\nWith Tokyo in a state of emergency throughout the Olympics after a spike in Covid-19 infections, the Games have come under huge criticism from the Japanese public, the majority of whom have said they want the Olympics to be cancelled or postponed again.\n\nBut safety is paramount for the organisers, and huge precautions are being taken, including holding the Games behind closed doors with no fans, from either Japan or overseas, being permitted inside venues.\n\nAs for the athletes, they are under strict restrictions too. They must wear a face mask at all times \u2013 except when eating, drinking, training, competing or sleeping \u2013 and minimise physical interaction with others, and are being tested for Covid-19 every day.\n\nBut unfortunately the virus has affected the Games already, before they have officially started.\n\nOn Friday, 19 new cases of Covid-19 were reported, bringing the total of cases related to Games personnel to 106. There have been 11 positive cases among athletes in Tokyo.\n\nSix Team GB athletes have had to isolate in their rooms after being identified as close contacts of someone on their flight who later tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nUS tennis player Coco Gauff had to pull out of her debut Games after testing positive before arriving in Tokyo, while Team GB\u2019s Dan Evans and Johanna Konta and world number one shooter Amber Hill withdrew for the same reason.\n\nWhat\u2019s new?\n\nThere will be a record 339 medal events held across 33 sports, with five new sports \u2013 and 34 new events in total \u2013 added to the Tokyo 2020 programme by the IOC. Some 48.8% of athletes competing at the Tokyo Olympics are women \u2013 a record figure.\n\nThe five new sports are karate, skateboarding, sport climbing, baseball/softball and surfing. Baseball and softball technically aren\u2019t \u2018new\u2019 sports on the Olympic programme, but they haven\u2019t been contested at a Games since Beijing 2008.\n\nNew events have been introduced to the boxing, canoe slalom, canoe sprint, cycling, rowing and swimming programmes, while there are new mixed-gender events including a 4x100m mixed medley relay in swimming and a mixed relay in triathlon.\n\nThese sports have been introduced in a bid to attract younger audiences and reflect \u201cthe trend of urbanisation of sport\u201d.\n\nIOC president Bach said: \u201cWe want to take sport to the youth. With the many options that young people have, we cannot expect anymore that they will come automatically to us. We have to go to them.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s Games are also doing their bit for sustainability. The medals are made from recycled mobile phones, while the Olympic torch was made from aluminium waste from temporary housing built in the aftermath of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake.\n\nOnly eight new competition venues have been built from scratch, while much of the energy powering Tokyo 2020 comes from renewable sources.\n\nIn total, the Games will cost \u00a311.5bn, up 22% because of the one-year delay.",

          "title": "Raging Pandemic in Indonesia Offers Fertile Ground for New Variants",
          "text": "The speed and scale of the coronavirus outbreak in Indonesia has created a perfect breeding ground for a potential new super-strain that could be even more contagious and deadly than the Delta variant, infectious disease experts from around the world are warning.\n\nLast week Indonesia surpassed India and Brazil to become the country reporting the world\u2019s highest number of daily cases. On Thursday, the archipelago reported more than 49,500 new cases and 1,449 deaths.\n\n\u201cNew variants always appear in regions or countries that cannot control outbreaks,\u201d said Dicky Budiman, an Indonesian epidemiologist researching coronavirus variants at Australia\u2019s Griffith University. \u201cThe World Health Organization [WHO] says if more than 5 percent of tests come back positive, the outbreak is uncontrollable. In Indonesia, it\u2019s been higher than 10 percent for 16 months at the start of the pandemic. Now it\u2019s higher than 30 percent. So you can imagine how high the possibility is for Indonesia to create a new variant or a super variant of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nAmin Soebandrio, a director at of the Eijkman Institute, a government organisation studying tropical and emerging infectious diseases, says while no new variants have yet surfaced in Indonesia vigilance is crucial.\n\n\u201cWith the increasing number of cases, we cannot deny that it\u2019s possible and have to carefully observe to identify new variants as soon as they emerge,\u201d he said.\n\nViruses constantly change through mutations to their genes, creating more advanced variants.\n\nDr Stuart Ray, the vice chair of medicine for data integrity and analytics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, says new COVID-19 variants are being detected around the world every week but \u201cit is in the nature of RNA viruses such as the coronavirus to evolve and change \u2013 gradually\u201d.\n\nHe says \u201cmost come and go \u2013 some persist but don\u2019t become more common; some increase in the population for a while and then fizzle out.\u201d\n\nOnly when a variant displays a jump in its ability to transmit, increased severity based on hospital admissions or deaths, or reduced effectiveness of treatments and vaccines, does WHO classify the strain as a \u2018variant of concern\u2018.\n\nGlobally, there are four variants of concern: the so-called Alpha variant, first identified in the UK; the Beta variant, first identified in South Africa, the Delta variant, first identified in India; and the Gamma variant, first identified in Brazil.\n\nSoebandrio says all but the Gamma variant have been detected in Indonesia, and that the country now has the diagnostic capacity to detect new strains within short time frames. More than 3,000 genome strings have been sequenced since the start of the year in Indonesia compared with only 200 to 300 last year. The results show the Alpha variant is still spreading but Delta is dominant.\n\nThe Delta variant is \u201cfour to five times more infectious than the original virus,\u201d said Shahid Jameel, India\u2019s top virologist who until recently led the advisory group at the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortia, which monitors variants of COVID-19.\n\nJameel says the situation in Indonesia is now \u201cvery similar\u201d to India\u2019s second wave due to \u201cpoor rates\u201d of vaccination. Only 8 percent of Indonesians are fully vaccinated according to the Ministry of Health.\n\nRepresentatives of two of the world\u2019s leading coronavirus research groups in the United States worry conditions in Indonesia are ripe for the emergence of a new COVID-19 variant of concern.\n\n\u201cThe more infections in a community, the more a chance for a new variant,\u201d said Ali Mokdad, a professor of Health Metrics Sciences at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle. He also expressed concern about Indonesia\u2019s Eid al-Adha festival, which took place this week and \u201cactivity around it\u201d.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s COVID-19 task force issued a special directive for the holiday week, banning public travel nationwide. It also extended an emergency partial lockdown, introduced on July 3, until next Monday.\n\nThousands of security personnel have been deployed around the country to enforce the travel ban, after a similar order at Eid al-Fitr, the end of the fasting month of Ramadan, did little to stop people travelling.\n\nBut last weekend, police and army at the port of Gilimanuk in west Bali looked on as thousands of migrant workers boarded overcrowded ferries to return to their families in Java, the epicentre of the outbreak in Indonesia, to celebrate the holiday. I Nengah Tamba, the head of the regency in which Gilimanuk is found, is refusing to enforce the extension of the emergency partial lockdown.\n\nDr Robert Bollinger, a professor of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, warns COVID-19 \u201chas the potential to mutate into a new variant every time it infects a new person. So the risk of new variants is highest in communities and countries with the highest number of new cases, which includes Indonesia.\u201d\n\nBut predicting where and when a new variant of concern will emerge, is currently beyond the ability of today\u2019s scientists.\n\n\u201cAll I can say is that when you give an RNA virus like this the opportunity to run wild, it will accumulate random mutations more frequently and the chances of a new variant will increase,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey should learn from India\u2019s experience, the foremost being a very quick surge in hospital capacity and oxygen availability. Because unfortunately, the worst is yet to come for the region.\u201d",
