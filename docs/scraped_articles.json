          "text": "\u2026Urges FG to provide enabling environment for media\n\nBy Dirisu Yakubu\n\nThe Nigerian Guild of Editors, NGE, Wednesday, expressed worry over the spates of killings and sundry criminality across the country.\n\nThe umbrella of all editors in Nigeria also called on the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government to provide an enabling political and economic environment for the media to play its constitutional role of deepening and sustaining democracy in the country.\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 jointly by Mustapha Isah and Iyobosa Uwugiaren, President and General Secretary respectively of the body at the end of its 2021 biennial convention in Kano, the NGE called on the federal government to urgently expunge, repeal or amend as may be appropriate, all existing obnoxious media laws in the country that are inimical to press freedom even as it tasked media practitioners to continue to uphold the ethics of journalism as developed by the Nigerian Press Organisation, NPO.\n\n\u201cThe guild observes the need for the Nigerian mass media to exercise their freedom to operate freely with a sense of responsibility. And considering the spikes in the levels of insecurity across the length and breadth of the country, it is high time for the media to set the agenda and lead the country\u2019s drive to sustaining national cohesion.\n\n\u201cWhile observing Nigeria\u2019s consistent deterioration in the Global Press Freedom Index since 2005, the guild notes that it is worrisome that the slide is happening in a democracy, whereby the guild has had cause in recent times to issue three press statements on the threats of closure and imposition of fines on some broadcast stations by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC)\u2019\u2019, the communique read in part.\n\nThe editors also noted the huge disruption the COVID-19 pandemic has created globally, adding that the development has also had negative effects on the Nigerian media industry, leading to significant drop in the media businesses\u2019 revenues.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 further read: \u201cFor the media to respond to these challenges creatively, there is urgent need for the media managers to evolve diversification, designing of a dynamic management system, producing innovative contents, restructuring their production technologies and adapting new funding and business models.\n\n\u201cConsidering that the role of information dissemination by the mass media is an essential public and social service, the guild calls on government to consider mitigating the media\u2019s operational costs and economic challenges by floating a national media subsidy regime, including tax holidays and waivers, lifting of license fees for the broadcast media and offsetting debts of government media agencies in the country.\n\nThe guild\u2019s national convention, which attracted over 300 editors and media owners across the country also expressed concern over the prevalence and massive elevation of fake news, disinformation and propaganda due to the mishandling of the social media platforms by negative persons.\n\nThe Guild therefore harped on the need for Nigeria\u2019s media publics, particularly the youths whom the media must carry along, to use, decipher and rely on the conventional media for reliable and credible information in taking their decisions.\n\nThe safety of journalists also attracted the attention of the editors, as they called on both the public and the private media operators to lift the media out of the current dangers by devising measures inclusive of guaranteed welfare and insurance schemes for the safety and security of journalists working for them.\n\nThe communique added, \u2018\u2019against the backdrop of the assailing new media trends, the guild highlights the essence of training and retraining of the Nigerian journalists to update their knowledge, skills and expertise of the profession \u2013 with a view to attaining the needed proficiency and competencies that are required to overcome the new media drifts dragging the journalism profession.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile commending Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano state for keeping the state safe even in the midst of the prevailing insecurity in some parts of the country, the editors also appreciated the state government\u2019s phenomenal drive of infrastructure development; as well as the state government\u2019s determination to change Kano\u2019s face to a modern city",

Because it was said to be a particular group, we decided to extend the meeting to all the major markets, not only Alaba International market alone. We have those from TradeFair where we have the concentration of same set of people. We have them at Ladipo market,computer village and part of the Island.\n\n\u201d The purpose of the meeting is to let them know the preparedness of the command , should any security breach come up and that they should go about their lawful businesses without any fear of any attack.\n\n\u201cWe have heard of the areas where they said they needed assistance, like manpower , police stations and posts. I advised them on how to enforce their own regulations within their markets, to empower their own officers because we know at their markets they have their own task force that enforce their regulations. We told them to empower them (task force ) and that they must not ascribe it to any tribe and also , that they must not allow any form of disunity among them because they need to close ranks so that collectively they will fight any external aggression if there is any\u201d.\n\n\u201cSome of the resolutions reached include the need to illuminate the market because in darkness crime strives; that nobody should be allowed to sleep in the market at night; that they should have a holding bay where goods are kept because If they allow them to load at night, some people may cash-in in on that .\n\n\u201c It was also agreed that combustive substances should not be sold in the market; that all electricity gadgets must be put off before leaving the shops to avoid fire incidents and the need for them to say something if they see anything and we have given them our telephone numbers to that effect.\n\nOn the part of the command, \u201c our strategy won\u2019t be disclosed but one thing is that as part of our proactive measure, we started a show of force at the Alaba International market and across the length and breadth of Lagos to mobilize our resources, in order to let the criminals know that we are ready, as well as to let law abiding citizens know Police are there to protect them.\n\n\u201c We are not just having covert patrol . What we have is increasing our presence. The EOD personnel are already out. They are everywhere. Infact for the past two months now, we have been b having training and retraining of all the officers of the command right from Area Commanders, DPOs and others . All are part of proactive measures to prepare the police for any eventuality\u201d.\n\nEarlier in their responses, some leaders from the respective markets who spoke, lauded Odumosu\u2019s efforts at ensuring they were saved and called for more action on the part of the command, noting thatsince Lagos was the only secured state in the country, there was need for all hands to be on deck tosustain the tempo.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Delta Governor Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, Wednesday said the state government would partner with Isoko youths on skills training in the oil and gas industry.\n\nOkowa disclosed this when he received the President and Members and Board of Trustees of the Isoko National Youths Assembly (INYA) at Government House, Asaba.\n\nHe congratulated the President on his successful election and commended the youths of Isoko nation for their partnership with the government in ensuring peace and security in the area.\n\nHe stated that his administration couldn\u2019t have achieved much without the peaceful atmosphere created by youths in the state.\n\n\u201cI congratulate you for your victory at the election. Am glad that the Isoko youths have carried themselves above board.\n\n\u201cAt every point in time, I have always believed in free and fair elections, where dialogue cannot produce a consensus candidate.\n\n\u201cAm glad that you have spoken so well about the issues that affect the Isoko nation and am happy that you are thinking in the direction of synergy with the state government in terms of training of Isoko youths in the area of skill acquisition and development.\n\n\u201cI encourage you to make sure that the 50 persons trained by your predecessor that you mentioned, are monitored to ensure that most of them remain in business.\n\n\u201cThe greatest problem we suffered in the past was that, after training people and giving them starter packs, about 80 percent of them sell off these packs.\n\n\u201cWe have been undertaking entrepreneurship programmes to make sure our youths are engaged and we have also monitored them closely.\n\n\u201cSo we would have to sit down with you and see your proposal, so we can know where we can provide support as a government,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the request for inclusion of Isoko youths into the Presidential Amnesty Programme, Okowa said \u201cThe idea behind the Amnesty programme was to train the youths to be either self-employed or employed in the private sector to become self-reliant and I believe that the amnesty office should truly re-engineer the entrepreneurship programme.\n\n\u201cThe payment of allowances without going through any training to become business owners of their own is not the original intention for establishing the Amnesty programme.\n\n\u201cIf many youths establish themselves they will take up more youths and the effect will pay off in the years to come in terms of reduction in unemployment,\u201d\n\nOn conversion of Oleh campus to a Polytechnic, Okowa said his administration was not thinking in that direction as he was committed to ensuring full functionality of the newly created universities.\n\n\u201cWe just recently upgraded three tertiary institutions to Universities and we are concentrating on making sure that they kick off smoothly.\n\n\u201cThe universities will help solve the problems of lots of Deltans who go to any lent including out of the shores of this country just to get university education,\u201d Okowa stated.\n\nOn the recent communal clashes in the area, the governor urged the President to work hard towards sensitising the Isoko youths on the need to avoid communal clashes which had claimed lives in the past.\n\n\u201cI urge you to continue talking to our youths to stop taking arms against themselves. The elders don\u2019t fight it is the youths that fight so the youths must rise up to ensure that this must stop.\n\n\u201cIf we resolve as youths that we will not go in that direction it will not happen again. It\u2019s important we take this very seriously so that we can have lasting peace,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nEarlier, President of the Isoko National Youths Assembly Comrade Amos Etaluku had commended the governor for his developmental strides in Isoko nation and beyond.\n\nHe called for the partnership of the state government in the training of Isoko youths in various skill acquisitions in the oil and gas development.\n\nHe appealed to government for the completion of the electricity step down project in Ozoro and partner with INYA for the proposed Isoko Youth Peace and Security Summit.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, since the commencement of the non violent stage of the amnesty programme, no single Isoko youth had been admitted into the amnesty programme and we consider it is an injustice to the peaceful Isoko youths.\n\n\u201cThe exclusion of Isoko youths in the GMOU in Heritage Energy Oil Services is another bitter pill that is difficult to swallow,\u201d he stated.\n\nChairman Board of Trustees of the Isoko National Youths Assembly Comrade Morista Idibra, had commended the governor for the upgrade of the Delta State Polytechnic Ozoro to University of Science and Technology.",

          "title": "Should Nigeria go back to 1963?",
          "text": "By Emmanuel Oladesu, Deputy Editor\n\nThe analysis of the memoranda by many stakeholders to the National Assembly Committee on Constitution Review during the public hearings shows that Nigerians yearn for an amendment that will foster \u2018true\u2019 federalism.\n\nIf at the end of the amendment there is gap between the expectation and reality, the review will pale into tokenism; a hypocritical effort, piecemeal attempt and parliamentary window dressing that will ultimately dampen public hope.\n\nThe residual class of founding fathers are re-echoing the 1947 solution canvassed by the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo in his book: \u2018Path to Nigeria\u2019s Freedom.\u2019 To them, federalism is non-negotiable. It is the key to unity in diversity.\n\nThe last document that came close to their expectation was the 1963 Constitution. The lieutenants of these illustrious pathfinders-Zik, Awo and Bello-are full of nostalgia. They want Nigeria to return to the historic era characterised by regionalism and the practice of parliamentary system. They are of the view that cabinet system was less expensive to run. They have forgotten the friction that characterised relations between the ceremonial president and head of government.\n\nThe men of the old order and some rights activists are also pushing for a national dialogue or conference to debate the basis for peaceful coexistence.\n\nLatter-day actors disagree with them, saying that today\u2019s circumstances may make regionalism impracticable since the four regions have become 36 states.\n\nTheir major fear is that if the states cease to exist, it will herald a sort of backwardness and it may position the current crop of actions very far from political opportunities and state resources. However, these younger elements support theoretical regionalism to the extent that its elements are limited to inter-state cooperation in matters of mutual interest, based on common historical background and cultural affinity.\n\nAlso, their mood cannot accommodate the Westminster model, having never experienced the workings and relative efficacy of the cabinet system from a close range in their adult life.\n\nThe Republican Constitution of 1963 has its merits, and certain elements and provisions of the first Indigenous constitution can be replicated in the fashioning of a new document suitable for a highlg diverse or heterogeneous nation-state.\n\nThere was the Federal Government headed by Prime Minister Abubakar Tarawa Balewa. The federal constitution acknowledged the existence of semi-autonomous four regions as component units that were coordinate with the federal, central or national government.\n\nThe document played a unifying role through its exclusive jurisdiction over defence, immigration, ommunicstions, postal service, and currency.\n\nThe West, Midwest, East and North existed independently of each other, but gave recognition to the powers of the Federal Government in the exercise of power and authority over the mutually agreed, but limited, exclusive items.\n\nThe regions were administered based on the peculiarities of the ethnic clevages that threw them up. The systems of administration were slightly different across regions. The development priorities were also different.\n\nThe West, for example, savoured its own constitution, symbols and coat of arms. The West had diplomatic missions abroad, with the late Chief Toye Coker, serving as Agent-General of Western Region in London.\n\nThe four regions depended on their potentials and resources. Agriculture was the mainstream of the economy. While the North took pride in its groundnut pyramid, the West depended on its cocoa for revenue. The Midwest was the home of timber and rubber plantations. The coal belonged to the East.\n\nIn those days, the regions only remitted taxes to the Federal Government, based on their earnings. The picture contracts with the monthly visit to Abuja by 36 finance commissioners, with caps in hands, begging for allocations. There was no distributive crisis.\n\nThere was power devolution. The lands belonged to the regions. That was why many farm settlements sprang up for the development of agriculture.\n\nThere was regional police for the maintenance of law and order. Unlike under the 1999 Constitution, the 1963 Constitution provided for a regional police that was answerable to the premier, who was the regional chief security officer.\n\nThe Federal Government in 1963 never had anything to do with the local government. Councils were created by Regional Houses of Assembly as administrative units for ease of administration at the grassroots. The Premier of the North never bothered about the number of local governments in the West or East and vice versa.\n\nIn fact, there was no uniformity of electoral system and election dates across regions. There was no special attraction to the centre, making Sir Ahmadu Bello, to contend with staying in the North as Premier, instead of coming to Lagos to serve as prime minister.\n\nAn important element of the regional constitutions was the role of traditional rulers as the links between the government and the people.\n\nCan theNational Assembly that is constitutionally saddled with the proposed review tap from the 1963 idea?\n\nIt is the third attempt at review. Can the panel chaired by Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege and the entire federal parliament make a difference?\n\nThe 1999 Constitution has been in operation for 22 years. It is the longest in the history of Nigeria, second only to the Hugh Clifford Constitution of 1922-1946.\n\nOmo-Agege acknowledged that no other constitution has received as many and diverse criticisms as the 1999 Constitution.\n\nUnlike the 1963 and 1979 document, the 1999 Constitution was imposed by the military. Eminent lawyer Chief Rotimi Williams (SAN) said the constitution lied against itself by the prefix: \u201cWe Nigerians.\u201d Thus, civil society groups, socio-cultural organisations, regional organisations, professional bodies, ethnic nationalities, pressure groups and individuals have kicked against it. They are unanimous that it is a unitary contraption masquerading as a federal constitution.\n\nBut, the fundamental questions, which the 1963 Constitution were targeting, have increased in leaps and bounds.\n\nOmo-Agege disclosed that his committee inherited about 32-header 1999 Constitutional Alteration Bills, which were considered and streamlined to a 16-point frame of reference, to which memorands were requested.\n\nThe issues are:\n\nGender Equity/Increased participation of Women and Vulnerable groups in governance\n\nThe Federal Structure in governance and Power Devolution\n\nLocal Government Administration/Local Government autonomy\n\nPublic Revenue, Fiscal Federalism and Revenue Allocation\n\nConstitutional provision for the establishment of State Police\n\nJudicial Reform \u2013 Adjudication of election and pre-election matters and other justice delivery concerns.\n\nElectoral Reforms that will make INEC deliver transparent, credible, free and fair elections, Political parties, Independent candidature and election management\n\nSocio-economic rights as contained in Chapter II of the Constitution.\n\nResidency and indigeneship\n\nImmunity \u2013 Removal of immunity in prima facie criminal cases\n\nTime-line for Assent of Bills and Passage of Appropriation Bill\n\nStates and local government creation\n\nStrengthening the independence of institutions like the office of the Accountant-General of the Federation, Auditor-General of the Federation and Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation.\n\nF.C.T.

          "text": "Chief Chekwas Okorie was the founding National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and Chairman of the defunct United Progressives Party (UPP). Last year, he collapsed the UPP into the All Progressives Congress (APC), following its deregistration by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). In this interview with Deputy Political Editor RAYMOND MORDI , the politician speaks on the constitutional review by the National Assembly.\n\nNigerians have been calling for the adoption of the 1963 Constitution. Are you in support of this idea?\n\nNo, I am not in support of the idea of adopting 1963 Constitution because this is 2021. A lot of things have happened to change the political template between then and now; a lot of changes in population, demography and indeed everything in the whole world has changed. So, I don\u2019t subscribe to that idea. I have listened to those canvassing this idea; many of them were very active participants in 1963, so they just want to take us back to the time they were young. But, they forget that there are a lot of Nigerians who did not witness that era and so their circumstances are totally different. I will support an amendment of the 1999 Constitution, in line with present-day realities.\n\nWhat are some of the amendments you want to see in the constitution?\n\nOne thing we have to come to terms with is the fact that we now have 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), which has the status of a state. Although it is not written in the constitution, the existence of six geo-political zones in the country appears to have come to stay. The government at the centre usually takes this factor into consideration in its policies and programmes, even when it is expressly recognized in the constitution. So, maybe the existence of the geo-political zones should be enshrined in the constitution. I would also want to see the devolution of powers to states in the federation in a manner that would encourage them to explore all the resources God has given them \u2014 because every state in the country has been endowed with sufficient resources, both human and material to develop and make life better for all Nigerians. The devolution should be done in a manner to give the states the latitude to explore and exploit all their comparative advantages, to the benefit of the whole country. This is the sort of restructuring I would like to see. For instance, Nigeria is too large to have a central police command. This has not helped to deal with the issue of insecurity in the country. Unfortunately, government after government, including the present government, has turned deaf ears to the call for the decentralization of the policing structure. I have always been an advocate of state police and community policing. This issue featured prominently in my manifesto and my party\u2019s manifesto when I ran for the presidency in 2015. I also like to see a situation where you do not rob Peter to pay Paul. I am talking about fiscal federalism. I no longer want to see a situation where a state or region is opposed to the consumption of something like alcohol, but end up becoming the biggest beneficiary of such taxes collected elsewhere in the country. They even go to the extent of destroying alcoholic beverages that have been procured for sale by some entrepreneurs. But, at the end of the day, they receive the lion share of the value-added tax (VAT) derived from such beverages elsewhere in the country. If we introduce fiscal federalism, it would help to bring equity, justice and fairness into the share of national resources. Of course, the present revenue allocation formula is not acceptable. If we reduce the items on the Exclusive Legislative List and devolve them to the Concurrent and the Residual List, then the same thing would apply in revenue allocation. The idea of using landmass as a key factor in revenue allocation is not the very best. This is particularly when you take into consideration the fact that states and local governments which form the basis for sharing the national resources were created by executive fiat by the military and that they were not based on any well-established demography. This is unjust. These are the issues that we would have to look into when restructuring the federation.\n\nWhat would be the benefits of retaining the current 36-state structure?\n\nOne thing about human nature is that every human being cherishes freedom. Ordinarily, one would say that the 36-state structure is a bit unwieldy. But, having been created, they should be allowed to stay. Don\u2019t forget that people celebrated the creation of such states. Some of the proponents of the creation of several states may have since joined their ancestors, but they were celebrated as champions of such freedoms; no matter how haphazard the freedom may appear. I don\u2019t any state in Nigeria, where stakeholders and the people, in general, would agree for their state to be merged with others. So, the best thing to do is to encourage the states to grow on their own, without going cap in hand to Abuja every month for monthly allocation from the Federation Account. The smallest state in Nigeria is bigger than some countries in Africa and these countries have all the paraphernalia of sovereign nations, including national armies, currencies and so on and so forth. So of them are even doing better than we are doing here. I don\u2019t see any state that would be unviable if it finds itself in a situation where it would be compelled to be creative and promote growth in its domains, which in aggregate would translate to national growth.\n\nHow do bring down the cost of governance because the major reason why people are advocating for regionalism is to reduce the cost of governance?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNaturally, the cost of governance would be reduced by exigencies of a new reality the state in question is facing. Look at Kaduna State for instance. The reality there is compelling the governor to say that some people must leave the civil service; a development labour is still contesting. The new reality in Ebonyi State today is that the governor is dissolving all the boards and definitely it is not likely that the same number of people that constituted the boards until now will come back. The new reality when restructuring is done is that states would now have to tailor their needs according to their resources. If any state discovers that its cost of governance is not sustainable, it becomes an internal thing within the state to bring down its spending to a sustainable level. At the federal level, if the share of revenue is reduced to make it commensurate to the responsibilities of that arm of government, then the Federal Government may have to shed a lot of weight. This will amount to a reduction in the cost of governance. But, what is happening now is that there are too much resources at the centre and the states have equally become lazy. All the states do now is to go to Abuja to get their share of resources from the Federation Account; most states contribute practically nothing to the national purse. In that way, nobody sits down to do proper planning. So, we don\u2019t have to bother ourselves too much about the issue of reduction of the cost of governance, until we come to a situation where each state will account for its survival. Even at the family level, when circumstances change, the structure of the family, in terms of the number of house-helps and other things will change. In the process, a number of things you have been taking for granted will be restructured within the family without an external influence compelling you to do so. It is the exigency of the time when restructuring takes effect that will compel re-adjustment of the cost of governance.\n\nIn your view, what is the main thing about the 1999 Constitution that Nigerians are not happy about?\n\nFirst and foremost, those that imposed the constitution on Nigerians were not honest with us; they didn\u2019t do it to allow Nigeria to grow. They taught that when they hold a part of the country down, then the other part will rise. In doing this, they forgot the simple natural phenomenon that when you are holding somebody down, you are on the same spot with him; he may be down and you are top, but you are not moving an inch. Any time you loosen your grip on him, he rises. So, by drafting and imposing a constitution that tended to hold a certain section of the country down, the other side is not moving or developing. In other words, those who appear to be the beneficiary of this obnoxious constitution have turned out to be the main loser in all indices, including education, health and virtually anything. If you talk of Nigeria being the poverty capital of the world, you know where that poverty is mainly located. Then, you ask yourself, what is the benefit of this constitution? The constitution came, first of all, came with outright deceit, saying we the people of Nigeria came out with this constitution and there is nothing like that. Then, of course, here is a constitution that put about 58 items on the Exclusive List. These are things that are not supposed to come near federal responsibilities. That type of constitution is not going to make Nigeria grow.\n\nAre you satisfied with the conduct of the National Assembly so far, with regards to the current bid to amend the constitution?\n\nMany of us will be very much disappointed if members of the National Assembly embarks on any recess at this point in time because I have it on good authority that they are going on their long vacation from July. That would be the most unpatriotic and insensitive thing any legislature would do at this critical time. This is the time for them to make a little sacrifice, to ensure that this issue of constitutional amendment, as well as that Electoral Act are properly sorted out and presented to the president as quickly as possible for his assent. Once this sorted out, they can go on their vacation, nobody cares. But, to go on vacation with the two critical issues unresolved would be the most unpatriotic and insensitive thing to do. That would be putting their personal comfort over and above the survival of Nigeria.\n\nIn your view, why is there so much tension in the land today?\n\nFrustration definitely; there is too much frustration. There is also injustice. Everybody knows with elementary knowledge that there will never be peace where there is injustice. Where there is justice, peace will reign, unity will blossom. The issue of injustice is something the government of the day must sit back and take a deep look at. Let me say this without any equivocation that in so many areas President Muhammadu Buhari has done exceptionally well. In fact, sometimes I shudder to consider what would have been the fate of Nigeria if the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) had been in power in this period when the world economy is in shambles. So, the president has done well in many areas, but most unfortunately the issue of lopsidedness in appointments, the issue of nepotism and that of parochialism has reduced his accomplishments in all sectors. He has done very well in the area of fighting corruption; he has done exceedingly well in infrastructural development, more than any government I can remember in recent times. He has also done well in managing the economy. In fact, that we are out of recession and that we do not have to queue to buy things like milk and sugar in shops is a testimony to how the economy has been managed. Many countries, including Indonesia, have gone to that level of depression. But, Nigeria did not go that route.\n\nDespite these achievements, I appeal to him \u2014 he has two more years to stay in office \u2013 let him take a second and deeper look in this area of nepotism, parochialism and lopsidedness in appointments in the commanding heights of national politics, bureaucracy and economy. The National Security Council is one sensitive area that he cannot justify the exclusion of the Igbo people. What caused the American Civil War? American Civil War under George Washington was predicated on \u2018no taxation without representation\u2019. They see no reason they should continue to pay tax to Britain when they were not represented in parliament. I implore the president to take a look at that because it constitutes a dampener to his other achievements.",

If an organisation is proscribed abinitio, that organization does not exist in that country. There are many Nigerians, for instance, who have been inciting people against government. Who appointed Gumi middleman between government and Boko Haram?\n\n\u201cListen, for me, unless you come and tell me this is what Gumi said that is inciting that you are comparing to Kanu\u2026 anyway what we\u2019re discussing is different. We\u2019re discussing Twitter. If you want to ask any question about Gumi or any other person, go ahead but please, be objective.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many people who have been spewing hate against Mr. President, against this governments. So if you want to comment be fair, don\u2019t take a position which is not objective. If we were to pick up everybody today who had been abusing this administration, the detention centres will be filled up and you will be the first person also to talk about lack of tolerance, lack of rule of law. But I\u2019m saying that you cannot compare anybody with Kanu who boldly say, go and kill policemen.\n\n\u201cI think sometimes\u2026policemen are brothers, they are our uncles, they are children. When we kill them their wives become widows, their children become orphans. And what is the offence of these policemen? Because they are workin to keep the country one. What about soldiers that are putting down their lives so that me and you can sleep? It is not acceptable anywhere in the world for anybody, anywhere, to stay in the comfort of wherever he is and now give directives to go and kill soldiers, to go and kill policemen.\u201d",

He made very solid contributions to our educational road map. He was clearly one of the finest Mathematicians this country has ever produced. I feel a deep and personal sense of loss at his death. It is almost impossible to produce alternatives to men like Professor Obioma.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Niger state police command has dismissed reports that the NECO Registrar, who died on Monday, was assassinated.\n\nPublic Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Wasiu Abiodun, yesterday, in a statement, in Minna, described the story as \u2018totally false, untrue and a pure element of fake news.\u201d\n\nThe police, in the statement, further stated: \u201cIt is important to state, categorically, that on May 31, 2021, Prof Obioma was rushed to National Hospital Abuja by his family members, where he was later confirmed dead, after a brief illness.\n\n\u201cHe was said to have returned from Abuja for an official assignment at about 9:00am, in the morning, and was expected before his sudden death.\u201d\n\nWhile the wife said he died of heart attack, the son in a conflicting report said his father died after a brief illness.\n\nA short message sent by his son to NECO management read: \u201dDear Sir, this is to formally inform you that my father, Prof. Godswill Obioma, the Registrar/Chief Executive of NECO passed to eternal glory yesterday, 31/5/2021, after a brief illness.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Chief Whip of the Senate and former governor of Abia State, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, has expressed sadness over the demise of Registrar and Chief Executive Officer of National Examinations Council (NECO), Professor Godswill Obioma.\n\nDescribing the death of Obioma as a huge loss to the academia, the former governor acknowledged the contributions of the late Professor to nation building in various capacities.\n\nKalu, while commiserating with the Obioma family, prayed to God to repose the soul of the deceased.\n\nIn a condolence message, the Senate Chief Whip said: \u201cThe demise of the Registrar and Chief Executive Officer of National Examinations Council (NECO), Professor Godswill Obioma, is painful.\n\n\u201cThe late Professor contributed immensely to the academia in no small measure. He will be remembered for academic excellence.\n\n\u201cOur prayers and thoughts are with the Obioma family at this period of grief.\n\n\u201cMay his gentle soul rest in peace\u201d.\n\nThe former governor condoled with the government and people of Abia state, while calling on the Obioma family to take solace in the fact that the deceased lived a remarkable life.",

There will be no excuse for failure. We\u2019ll meet all INEC\u2019s demands.\u201d\n\nHe, however, warned those bent on destroying the country through promoting insurrection, and burning down critical national assets to back off as a rude shock awaits them soon.\n\n\u201cI receive daily security reports on the attacks, and it is very clear that those behind them want this administration to fail.\n\n\u201cInsecurity in Nigeria is now mentioned all over the world. All the people who want power, whoever they are, you wonder what they really want. Whoever wants the destruction of the system will soon have the shock of their lives. We\u2019ve given them enough time,\u201d he stated.\n\nBuhari recalled that he visited all the 36 states of the country before the 2019 elections, \u201cand majority of the people believed me, and the election proved it.\u201d\n\nHe promised to continue leading the country in accordance with the constitution.\n\nAccording to him, those misbehaving in certain parts of the country are too young to know the travails and loss of lives that attended the Nigerian civil war.\n\nHe added: \u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand. We are going to be very hard sooner than later.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the service chiefs and the Inspector General of Police have been changed, \u201cand we will demand security from them.\u201d\n\nShedding more light on his meeting with the INEC officials via his official Twitter handle, Buhari tweeted: \u201cI received a briefing today from the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, on the series of attacks on their facilities nationwide. These attacks are totally unacceptable, and we will not allow those behind them to achieve their evil objectives.\n\n\u201cI have assured INEC that we will make available to them everything they need to operate efficiently, so that no one will say we don\u2019t want to go, or that we want a third term. There will be no excuse for failure. We will meet all of INEC\u2019s demands.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Yakubu had said so far, 42 cases of attacks on INEC offices nationwide had been recorded, since the 2019 general election.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe 42 incidents so far occurred in 14 states of the federation for a variety of reasons\u2026.Most of the attacks happened in the last seven months, and they are unrelated to protest against previous elections. \u201cFrom the pattern and frequency of the most recent attacks, they appear to be targeted at future elections. The intention is to incapacitate the commission, undermine the nation\u2019s democracy and precipitate a national crisis.\u201d\n\nLawan Seeks More Legislative Interventions to Secure Nigerians\n\nMeanwhile, the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, has stressed the need for more legislative interventions to secure Nigerians.\n\nHe stated yesterday that that the lawmakers were tired of observing one-minute silence for the victims of insecurity.\n\nThe Senate also expressed concern about the frequency of the one-minute silence usually observed at its plenary as a result of deaths associated with security challenges facing the nation.\n\nSo far, it has observed one-minute silence six times in recent times for those who lost their lives through killings and murders in the wake of security issues across the country.\n\nLawan, at yesterday\u2019s plenary, said: \u201cLet me observe that we have observed about six one-minute silence and most of it was to pray for the repose of the souls of Nigerians who were murdered or killed by criminals.\u201d\n\nHe called for the intensification of legislative interventions by the National Assembly to protect Nigerians from the heightening insecurity in the country.\n\nAccording to him, it is imperative for the National Assembly to step up legislative interventions to reduce the number of deaths caused by criminal activities.\n\nHe added that such interventions would be backed by collaborative efforts among the legislature, executive and Nigerians to address the security challenges.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is very important that we step up our legislative intervention in ensuring that we protect the lives and properties of Nigerians to reduce the incidence of one-minute silence.\n\n\u201cI believe that the Senate and, indeed, the National Assembly, working together with the executive and getting the support of Nigerians, we can bring the much needed succour to our people, and that is why we are here.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Sultan seeks immunity clause removal, role for monarchs\n\n\u2022Akeredolu wants Senate scrapped\n\nSegun James in Lagos, Christopher Isiguzo and Gideon Arinze in Enugu, Seriki Adinoyi in Jos, James Sowole in Akure and Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi\n\nThe clamour for federalism, local government autonomy, community policing and devolution of power dominated the nationwide public hearings conducted yesterday by the House of Representatives Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nHowever, while the Sultan of Sokoto and President-General of the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, called for the removal of the immunity clause in the constitution, the Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu , advocated the scrapping of the Senate to make the federal legislature unicameral, as one of the ways of reducing the cost of governance.\n\nPlateau, Benue and Nasarawa states have also unanimously demanded devolution of power in a manner that the states will be given more powers and finance considering their enormous responsibilities.\n\nAt Akure, one of the two venues of the public hearing for the South-west zone, Akeredolu said devolution of powers, true federalism, state police, among others, as presented last week to the Senate Committee on Constitutional Review were germane in restructuring the country.\n\nAkeredolu, who was represented by his deputy, Mr. Lucky Ayedatiwa, also advocated that membership of the National Assembly should be part-time.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe membership of the (National) Assembly should be part time. No member should earn allowances not known to the Revenue Mobilisation and Allocation Committee and, more importantly, people they claim to serve.\n\n\u201cLegislators should earn under a uniform salary structure. Allowance peculiarities must not be about obscenity. The Senate should be scrapped. The House of Representatives too should not be unwieldly. A maximum of four representatives should come from each zone.\u201d\n\nThe governor also advocated the decentralisation of the Supreme Court.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Supreme Court should be decentralised to ease the current burden of the appellate court.\n\n\u201cIn a true federal state, there should be a Supreme Court whose decisions are final in residual matters. The Supreme Court at the centre should concern itself mainly with issues bordering on constitutional interpretations and matters arising between and among the states and the federal government, as well as revenue generation by the federal government. It should also administer the National Judicial Council.\u201d\n\nIn Bauchi, the state Governor, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed, stated that Nigeria needed a workable and acceptable constitution to serve the interests of the people.\n\nSuch a document, he added, should allow for true federalism where Nigeria states are autonomous entities with power to run their affairs.\n\nThe governor also appealed to the House Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution to look into the various agitations of the state and reflect them in its report.\n\nAccording to him, the participatory approach by the National Assembly in the amendment of the constitution is expected to produce a people\u2019s constitution that will address the social-economic problems in the country.\n\nHe added that Nigeria must break from the command structure imposed on the country by the defunct military government, which concentrated enormous power at the centre as manifested in the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe constituent units of the Nigerian federation represented by the current 36 states, the FCT and the 774 local government areas are near to the people that must be given enough powers with resources in order to positively impact the lives of the people at the grassroots,\u201d he stated.\n\nIn Lagos State, the Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, restated his calls for a special economic status for the state owing to its status and the economic epicentre of the nation and the burdens it bears.\n\nHe said at the South-west zonal public hearing that the continuous request for a special status for the state was by no means a selfish one, but stemmed from the interest of every Nigerian in the state.\n\nHe stated that progress and prosperity of Nigeria as a nation is linked to that of Lagos State.\n\nEarlier, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, while urging Nigerians to take the ongoing constitutional amendment seriously, had said the process of review and amendment would give the nation a near perfect constitution.\n\nHe expressed optimism that such a new constitution will resolve the issue of \u201cidentity, political structure, human rights, administration of government, resource control, national security and so much else that has made our nation fragile and that has hindered our progress and prosperity.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe 1999 Constitution is as a result of a hurried national compromise that Nigeria entered into two decades ago, just to allow the military vacate the political scene and return to the barracks. It has always been our intention that one day, as one people, we will return to amend this document to give voice to the yearning of the Nigerian people\u201d.\n\nIn Enugu, the Governor, Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, reiterated his administration\u2019s unwavering commitment to an egalitarian Nigeria where justice, fairness, equity and inclusiveness shall be functional directive principles of state policy.\n\nThe governor had declared the state government\u2019s support for amending the constitution to enhance the nation\u2019s quest for unity and prosperity \u201cin an environment where justice, fairness and equity shall prevail.\u201d\n\nDeclaring open the South-east zonal public hearing in Enugu, the governor enjoined all institutions, civil society organisations, stakeholders and the entire Enugu State citizenry \u201cto stand up and be counted in this important national discussion.\u201d\n\nWomen groups, organisations and labour unions made varying submissions on how to improve the constitution.\n\nLabour unions demanded autonomy for local government, the legislature and the judiciary for improved service delivery, autonomy.\n\nAlso, women groups called for gender parity and inclusion to allow women to participate actively in governance and decision-making.\n\nSultan Seeks Removal of Immunity Clause\n\nOn his part, the Sultan of Sokoto and President-General of the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, called for the removal of the immunity clause in the constitution, saying it will compel leaders to live up to their responsibilities.\n\nHe also advocated a constitutional role for traditional rulers, saying it was time Nigerians talk frankly on how they want the country managed.\n\nAddressing stakeholders at the Kebbi zonal hearing comprising Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara States, the sultan attributed the crisis in the country to the relegation of traditional rulers as they were given no constitutional role to play.\n\nHe said before the Nigerian nation came into being in 1914, the traditional institution had existed.\n\nHe said: \u201cOne of the controversial issues, which I feel strongly about is the immunity clause. When you are immune, nobody can take you to court as a leader and it means that you can do whatever you want to do. You can claim to be God.\n\n\u201cBut when that immunity is removed and you are made to live in a society where people are taken to court for abuse of office, I think our leaders here will wake up. Let us see how to tinker with that immunity clause.\n\n\u201cWill it be better to give immunity to a few people or remove the immunity so that all of us will be equal? It is another food for thought. So, please don\u2019t hold back, speak your mind on how you want this country to move on.\u201d\n\nPlateau, Benue, Nasarawa Demand Devolution of Power, Single Tenure for Presidents.\n\nMeanwhile, Plateau, Benue, and Nasarawa states have unanimously demanded devolution of power in a manner that the states will be given more powers and finance considering their enormous responsibilities.\n\nThey also requested that the state governors, as the chief security officers of their states, be given the powers to control the police in their states to enhance quick and rapid response to crisis and crime.\n\nThey decried the situation where a state police command has to get clearance from Abuja to respond to crisis in its domain.\n\nPresenting their memoranda at the North-central zonal public hearing in Jos, the three states also advocated a single tenure of five years for the president.\n\nPresenting the position of Benue State, representative of the governor, and Speaker of the Benue State House of Assembly, Hon. Titus Ugba, urged the National Assembly to grant the demands of people seeking creation of additional states.\n\nPlateau State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Chrisantus Ahmedu, and his Nasarawa State counterpart, Abdulkareem Kana, who toed the same line with Ugba on most of their demands, added that the three tiers of government could be reduced to two; comprising only the federal and state governments, such that states are given the resources to cater for the local governments.\n\nEarlier, while addressing the audience, Plateau State Governor, Hon. Simon Lalong, had urged Nigerians to be bold, sincere and patriotic in their submissions to the constitution review panel in their quest for a greater nation.\n\nLalong stated that the much-talked about restructuring will be considered to ensure that the agitations and anxieties being expressed are addressed.\n\nAccording to him, there are high expectations that this particular exercise will not go the way of previous ones which failed to address some key issues affecting the governance of the nation, leading to further agitations that are growing and in some way threatening peace, security and unity of the country.\n\n\u201cI therefore appeal to members of this special committee and Nigerians presenting memoranda at this public hearing to see this exercise as a very important duty which presents another opportunity for us to build a Nigeria that we desire to see. We should take advantage of the platform to ventilate and make submissions as to what we want injected or removed from the 1999 Constitution to make it more people -centred,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Microblogging platform, Twitter has deleted President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet where he threatened to treat Nigerians \u201cmisbehaving\u201d in \u201cthe language they understand\u201d.\n\nBuhari had in a tweet on Tuesday stated that his government will get \u201charder\u201d on those hell-bent on destroying the country.\n\nHe said those wanting to destroy his government will receive the shock of their lives as his administration will do everything possible to ensure they fail.\n\nThe president said the sponsors and orchestrators of insecurity in the country are doing so because they want his administration to fail.\n\nHis tweet had read, \u201dI receive daily security reports on the attacks on critical national infrastructure, and it is very clear that those behind them want this administration to fail. Whoever wants the destruction of the system will soon have the shock of their lives. We\u2019ve given them enough time.\n\n\u201cI received a briefing today from the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on the series of attacks on their facilities nationwide. These attacks are totally unacceptable, and we will not allow those behind them to achieve their evil objectives.\n\nI receive daily security reports on the attacks on critical national infrastructure, and it is very clear that those behind them want this administration to fail. Whoever wants the destruction of the system will soon have the shock of their lives. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve given them enough time. \u2014 Muhammadu Buhari (@MBuhari) June 1, 2021\n\n\u201cI have assured INEC that we will make available to them everything they need to operate efficiently, so that no one will say we don\u2019t want to go, or that we want a third term. There will be no excuse for failure. We will meet all of INEC\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cIn the area of security, we have changed the Service Chiefs and the Inspector-General, and we are demanding that they rise fully to the challenges confronting us. There must be zero tolerance for all those bent on destroying our country by promoting crime and insurrection!\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe President's Twitter account was reported by Nigerians who understood the last part of the thread as threats against the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its military wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\nMany reminded Buhari of the consequences of the Nigerian Civil War which lasted from 1967 to 1970, stating that such must not be repeated.\n\nAlso, social media users likened President\u2019s statement to that of the former United States President Donald Trump which earned the latter a permanent suspension.\n\nTrump's Twitter account was \"permanently suspended... due to the risk of further incitement of violence,\" Twitter had said.\n\nTwitter said the decision was made \"after close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account\".\n\nTrump was locked out of his account for 12 hours after he called the people who stormed the US Capitol \"patriots\".\n\nHundreds of his supporters entered the complex as the US Congress attempted to certify Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election. The ensuing violence led to the deaths of four civilians and a police officer.\n\nTwitter warned then that it would ban Trump \"permanently\" if he breached the platform's rules again. Trump posted two tweets further that the company cited as the final straws.\n\nFollowing widespread condemnation of the tweet, Twitter deleted the message on Wednesday.\n\nThe platform said the message by the Nigerian President violated its rules.",

The policy provides cover to the insured against death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMohammed said: \u201cOn behalf of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation, I will like to report that council today approved the award of contract for the appointment of insurance companies for group life assurance for federal government employees, public servants paramilitary and the intelligence community for the year 2021-2022 in the sum of N9, 248. 995, 907 and this premium is for a period of 12 months.\n\n\u201cThis is part of the government\u2019s welfare programme for our public employees so that in case of death, they are assured that there would be compensation\u201d.\n\nIn August 2020, the federal government had paid about N15 billion premium under the group life insurance scheme to insure over 89,000 workers across the country.\n\nMohammed said FEC also approved N18.1 billion for the ministry of industry, trade and investment; N864.7 million for two road contacts that were abandoned by previous administrations; and N1.1 billion for the procurement of aviation security uniforms and accessories for use in various airports across the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMinister of Aviation got an approval for the award of contract for direct procurement for the design, manufacture and supply of aviation security uniforms and accessories. The sum total is N1, 127, 945. The unique thing about uniforms for the aviation industry is that it has some International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards that would be followed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Niger Delta got approval for Okpula-Igwartanta Phase I linking Imo and Rivers state, started in 2010.

          "text": "A tweet by Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria\u2019s president, that seemed to imply certain people in the country will be dealt with violently caused a stir on Tuesday evening.\n\nAlmost immediately, there were calls for Buhari\u2019s tweet to be removed from the social media platform.\n\nTwitter answered that call on Wednesday afternoon. The tweet was part of a thread in which Buhari expressed displeasure at \u201cattacks on critical national infrastructure,\u201d including on facilities belonging to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nBuhari\u2019s deleted tweet was widely criticised as summoning the ghosts of the Nigeria civil war, a deadly three-year combat between the Nigerian government and a government in southeast Nigeria, which had seceded from the republic.\n\nThe Biafra war, as it is alternatively called, led to the death of nearly 1 million people, according to various accounts.\n\nWhile he may have intended to send a strong message against recent vandalism in the southeast supposedly led by the Indigenous People of Biafra, a proscribed militant group, Buhari\u2019s comment was interpreted as an affront and a threat to people in the region.\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War,\u201d the tweet read.\n\n\u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe controversial tweet was from what Buhari said in a televised meeting with the leadership of INEC. He did not seem to be reading from a script, according to a video recording.\n\nTwitter had never deleted tweets by the Nigerian president before. Given that Nigeria is the platform\u2019s biggest market in Africa, it marks a new paradigm in the role it plays shaping civic spaces and citizen-government relations in Africa.\n\nTwitter may have been nudged to take action on Buhari\u2019s tweet following complaints by multiple accounts. Peoples\u2019 Gazette, an online publication on political affairs, reports that Twitter initially said Buhari\u2019s tweet did not violate its policies but reversed itself later.\n\nIn a statement to TechCabal, Twitter said the tweet \u201cwas in violation of the Twitter Rules. The account owner will be required to delete the violative Tweet and spend 12 hours with their account in read-only mode.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Lai Mohammed, Nigeria\u2019s information minister, has accused Twitter of not being clear in its standard for deleting tweets, implying the US company has a longstanding bias against the Nigerian government.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very very suspect,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\n\u201cHas Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? The same Twitter that was funding #ENDSARS protesters\u2026 When people were burning Police stations and killing policemen, for Twitter it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened at the [US] Capitol, it became an insurrection.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria, citing those two examples, is very suspect. What is their agenda?\u201d\n\nLast October, Twitter became the platform where the world learned much about END SARS protests in Nigeria. Jack Dorsey, the company\u2019s CEO, expressed solidarity in a couple of tweets. But it is not clear that the company funded protesters in the way the minister alleges.",

          "title": "Banks don\u2019t fund African renewable energy startups. So where can founders find money?",
          "text": "Small and medium scale enterprises in Africa receive about $70bn of credit each year. But the International Finance Corporation estimates that the gap exceeds $300bn.\n\nWhy does the gap exist? Michael Famoroti, chief economist at Stears gave two reasons during a recent TechCabal Live event on financing renewable energy companies in Africa.\n\nFirst, there is an information problem.\n\nCredit providers seem to lack enough information with which to assess the risk worthiness of many borrowers. This problem exists at the retail level as most bank customers who have tried to take personal loans will be aware.\n\nBut it is arguably a bigger problem for SMEs and startups whose businesses are typically regarded as high-risk and unproven.\n\nThe second reason Famoroti gave is that credit providers may not find enough value in the use proposed for the funds. In this case, creditors may play safe by lending to legacy industries like real estate or banking, while taking a skeptical approach to promising but new ventures. Like renewable energy for example.\n\nSo if you are setting up a renewable energy startup to provide electricity to the more than 50% of people living in SubSaharan Africa who lack access, how do you find funding?\n\nThe TechCabal Live event had Marly Diallo, Wiebe Boer and Christian Wessels in attendance as guests.\n\nDiallo runs BRT Energy, a startup that regenerates batteries by reducing lead-acid waste. She started her career in fintech and banking, but when it was time to raise money for BRT, she hid many roadblocks.\n\nIn BRT\u2019s early days, she met the criteria for a certain funding program. But because she could not produce three years of financial statements, she did not get access to the money.\n\nMarly\u2019s experience is not an anomaly.\n\nWessels, co-founder and CEO of Daystar Power, also has a banking background having worked at Barclays for years. Founded in 2017, Daystar now operates hybrid energy solutions that combine solar and generator sets in Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal and Ivory Coast.\n\nLast year, they raised $38 million in a Series B round but it was mainly from development finance institutions in Nordic countries. But Wessels still remembers the anxiety that came with sourcing funds locally.\n\n\u201cNigerian banks played zero role in our financing. That\u2019s not great because we don\u2019t like the idea that as a West Africa company, that we are getting money mainly from overseas.\n\n\u201cI mean, thank God we get the money but why is it that we need to rely on DFIs and European investors when what we are doing is locally valuable?\u201d\n\nSuch experiences scar founders and make it seem like there are no funding opportunities for renewable energy financing within Africa. But some organisations have come aboard bearing some hope.\n\nAll On is an independent, off-grid energy impact investment company. It was founded by Shell, the oil company, as a vehicle for giving back to Nigeria by making impact investments into the renewable energy sector. Shell provided the seed funding but doesn\u2019t make any money from the venture.\n\nWiebe Boer, All On\u2019s managing director, empathizes with founders who need funding but have little sources to reach out to. With banks an obvious \u201cwaste of time,\u201d he advises that family and friends will continue to be the first base for most founders.\n\nFrom there, it might be possible to access funding from All On\u2019s initiatives for projects at the ideation stage. At the moment, the firm partners with two organisations for this purpose: the Clean Tech Hub in Abuja and the Nigeria Climate Innovation Centre in Lagos. These initiatives give up to $10,000.\n\nAbove that is another stage of up to $50,000 debt investment for companies that are, for example, doing their first minigrid or importing solar equipment. All On does this in partnership with the US Africa Development Foundation. USADF matches All On\u2019s $50,000 loan with a grant of $50,000.\n\nAll On could invest further in startups that show promise after this stage. For example, Auxano, a solar equipment company, received the $50,000 loan in 2018. It performed well enough for All On to invest $1.5 million last September to help the startup scale its assembly plant over the next five years.\n\n\u201cIt really is about being credible from the beginning and delivering even at a small level. With that, investors can give you more money,\u201d Boer says.\n\nWhat Marly, the BRT founder, has learned is that a pilot program can be useful in showing how useful an investor\u2019s funds will be.\n\n\u201cYou need to prove your concept by doing pilots to get customers.You need to make sure that what you are pushing is adopted by the market,\u201d she said.\n\nWessels, who now has access to entrepreneurship support networks like Endeavor Nigeria that give Daystar access to more funding, says new founders will need much tenacity and patience along the way. But he hopes they persevere because \u201cultimately, there is a big market to serve.\u201d\n\nWatch the full video of the TechCabal Live event on financing an African renewable energy company here.",

          "title": "Sawari Ventures is leading investments in North Africa",
          "text": "From a fresh and relatable perspective, the Ask an Investor series focuses on investors in Africa \u2014 Investment Banks, sovereign wealth funds, Private Equities, Venture Capitalists and every other class of investors, explaining why and how these investments happen by talking to the people who make them happen.\n\nBefore co-founding Almentor, Ihab Fikry wore three hats. He was a management professor, author of bestsellers on management (mainly in Arabic) and a multinational expatriate at companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil.\n\nThen he decided to quit it all to start sharing his knowledge via different mediums \u2013 television, newspapers, and YouTube.\n\nWhile he was doing this, he saw it as an opportunity to give back to the community until May 2015 when the news of Microsoft acquiring Lynda.com for $1.5 billion caught his attention. He spent the next 12 months learning about video-based learning. He was certain there was a business case for the video content he was putting out on YouTube.\n\nIn June 2016, he partnered with co-founders who worked for Google, Microsoft and other multinationals to start Almentor, a video-based online learning platform for the Middle East and North Africa. They started with a seed round of $3.5m.\n\nThe initial plan was to generate $10,000 in sales just to validate the business idea but they ended up making $300,000 in sales that year.\n\nIn 2019, they crossed the $1 million revenue line and raised the next funding round \u2013 Series A. Almentor\u2019s Series A round was led by Sawari ventures.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition of Ask an Investor I talk to one of the oldest venture capital firms in the Middle East and North Africa \u2013 Sawari Ventures.\n\nFikry pointed out that Sawari Ventures helped Almentor in three critical areas: Governance, networking with the ecosystem and technical support.\n\nSawari Ventures helped them put structures that enable the company to last for decades. It also helped with meeting relevant people in the ecosystem and provided good technical support and advice.\n\nI talk to Tamer Azer, a principal at Sawari Ventures; he joined the firm in 2019. One of the first things he pointed out to me early in our initial email exchange was that he had done an Ask an Investor series before. His own version was a free-flowing conversation with people interested in learning about how investors make decisions and the differences between concepts like equity and convertible notes.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: Tell me about Sawari Ventures\n\nTamer Azer: Sawari ventures has been around since 2010. It was founded by three partners \u2013 Ahmed El Alfi, Hany Al-Sonbaty and Wael Amin. They\u2019re also the founders of Flat6Labs \u2013 the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator. Sawari Ventures is also a limited partner in Flat6Labs Cairo and Flat6Labs Tunis. We invest in companies anywhere from a million to $3 million per ticket and up to $5 million for the life of the company, across Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco. We\u2019re fairly sector-agnostic. We most definitely look for companies who have a very clear product-market fit and are doing something really innovative and meaningful.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the premise behind the investments you make?\n\nTA: There\u2019s an argument to be made that the tech entrepreneurship ecosystem in Egypt became a lot more attractive after the Arab Spring when a lot of people found their sense of purpose and sense of independence.\n\nIt\u2019s picking up a lot from there. A lot of people saw it as a way to express themselves in a way to be able to engage on their own terms. There\u2019s an argument that a lot of people make that\u2019s connected somehow. In terms of the investment thesis, we\u2019re definitely sector-agnostic. We look out for companies that really have unique intellectual property. I\u2019m not just talking about documentation. The company has to be doing something really defensible and really unique. It can be doing something that we all know and love, but in a way that nobody else has done. Obviously, teams factor in a huge way. We\u2019re looking for professionally mature people who work with intention, who are coachable, who understand why, what and how they\u2019re doing it.\n\nDA: How do you find these companies or better still how do people get your attention?\n\nTA: I made a decision when I first started working in this industry to respond to absolutely everybody. I respond to anyone who messages me on LinkedIn, anyone who emails me. I try to put myself out there a lot and speak at events and do articles like the one I\u2019m doing with you right now, so that people hear about me and they try to reach out to me. Deal sourcing is always two ways.\n\nSometimes it takes me longer than I\u2019d like to admit, but I do try my best to respond to absolutely everyone.\n\nDA: That\u2019s really generous. If you get more popular you\u2019ll probably need to get an assistant. So does Sawari invest in cohorts?\n\nTA: We\u2019re not an accelerator. These are types of activities that Flat6Labs would organize. For us, we look for companies that are a bit more mature than that.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the relationship between Flat6Labs and Sawari ventures?\n\nTA: The founders of Sawari Ventures and the founders and Flat6labs are the same. When Sawari Ventures raised its North Africa fund, we invested in Flat6Labs Cairo and Flat6Labs Tunis. There\u2019s something really important here I need to point out between when a company joins Flat6Labs and when it can join Sawari Ventures. There has to be a bit of a gap, where they go out into the world and raise their middle round.\n\nJust because you get into Flat6Labs does not mean that once you graduate you\u2019re going to get money from Sawari Ventures automatically. We look out for whoever survives, manages to go out into the world, get a seed fund, grow their business even more, and then they can come to Sawari for their Series A round.\n\nDA: What does support from Sawari Ventures look like?\n\nTA: Typically, one of the partners of the firm would sit on the board. We\u2019ve worked very closely with our companies in the beginning to build a strong relationship and to build a strong plan for the business. Moving forward, we work very closely with them to help with business development, growth, as well as fundraising. We work with them to analyze the data that they share with us and help them make data-driven decisions. Obviously, we deploy our entire network to support their growth.\n\nThese are how most VCs support the portfolio companies. We\u2019re also in a position where we have some very strong limited partners who are interested in co-investing. We have a really wide network that allows us to bring a lot of international VCs into the next rounds for the companies. For instance, we brought in Partec to co-invest with us in MoneyFellows.\n\nDA: How does due diligence happen and how long does it take?\n\nTA: Each company will have a different level of preparedness, investment readiness, and every company will have different rounds. A priced round will have a very different timeline than a convertible note round or a safe round. So ultimately, every process is fluid depending on the nature of the round and the co-investors in the round and the lead.\n\nWe will always want to be the lead on any investment that we make and we\u2019re always trying to bring co-investors into the process. We definitely conduct four layers of due diligence. There\u2019s commercial, financial, legal, and tech.\n\nThe rest happen a little later in the process. Initially, there has to be a good solid commercial due diligence, so we can buy into the market, the team, the company, and then we take it forward from there.\n\nDA: What are some red flags?\n\nTA: One that comes to mind is coachability. I\u2019m turned off when I see that a founder or co-founders are not really being responsive to feedback from an investor or a customer. When they have a reputation for being not just defensive, but being uncoachable. That\u2019s a major red flag because when you invest in someone, the relationship is very close for a very long period of time. If you can\u2019t give and take, then it becomes really tricky to nurture this relationship over that period of time. Another thing I really look for as a red flag is co-founder dynamics. Are they both at the pitch? How do they talk during the pitch? How do they answer questions? What does the dynamic and the relationship between them look like? If it looks out of sync, that\u2019s a pretty major red flag.\n\nDA: You said Sawari Ventures typically takes the lead on investments. Why the emphasis on this?\n\nTA: We also co-lead. As regards the times we lead investment rounds, it\u2019s because of the environment. Many companies in this region find investors who can\u2019t and won\u2019t lead, who will tell them, find the lead and we\u2019ll follow. It\u2019s part of a fund ethos that we like to lead our own investments because we really believe in them. Another reason is the market dynamics in the region, there\u2019s a lot of people who want to follow on, but not lead, which ultimately leaves you in a strong position when you are capable and willing.\n\nWe\u2019re a very experienced team. We have very clear intentions about what we like to invest in and why we invest in certain things.\n\nDA: What are your thoughts on exits and M&A?\n\nTA: I think the African market, we\u2019re all suffering from a lack of exits. We all have that problem. Angel investors all over the continent are just dying for an exit because they\u2019ve been investing for years and years. We\u2019re all really dying for exits but exits are really a function of foreign direct investment. It\u2019s a function of mature stock exchanges. I think we\u2019re going to start seeing more and more exits from North Africa. We have seen a few and they\u2019re getting bigger, but we still need so many more before more capital comes into North Africa and that capital gets redeployed.\n\nYou know how it works, you have a company and you exit, all of a sudden you\u2019re an angel investor. Then you\u2019re a fund manager or you start another company that people want to invest in quickly because you already have a successful exit. We\u2019re seeing the industry in North Africa mature, and it\u2019s heading more and more towards some of these interesting exits. We\u2019re starting to see bigger rounds. We\u2019re starting to see exits, we\u2019re starting to see mergers in the continent, in North Africa and in Egypt especially because it\u2019s the market that I\u2019m closest to. We are seeing a lot of maturity, a lot of growth. For example, a lot of ex-Uber and ex-Careem staff are starting companies that have been doing fantastically well. As more and more of these things happen, the maturity of the entrepreneurs and investors grows, and exits will come. We just have to keep at it.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup?\n\nTA: VC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime, They have a 10 year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\nJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time, and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\nWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing checks, we have to get the money to be able to write these checks first.\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these checks. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\n\nDA: What are some trends you\u2019re seeing in the market?\n\nTA: I think for me, the main trends are the fact that people are starting to solve deep-rooted fundamental problems. They\u2019re starting to solve access to finance. They\u2019re starting to solve financial literacy and financial inclusion. They\u2019re starting to solve healthcare problems. People are actually tackling the big-ticket issues that were previously left to the public sector. We\u2019re seeing the market respond very positively to that.\n\nDA: Any final words?\n\nTA: It\u2019d be interesting to see more engagement from large institutional investors with investing in startups. There\u2019s immense potential and having your local financial institutions support you as a fund manager helps immensely when it comes to getting international development. It\u2019s a team effort, we have to do it together.\n\nI\u2019m encouraging more engagement from African financial institutions, not just banks but hedge funds, insurance companies and pension plans.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Airtel Africa has announced the sale of its Tanzanian tower portfolio for $175 million. According to the company, the sale to SBA Communications Corporation and Paradigm Infrastructure Limited would allow it to prioritise its core subscription services.\n\nAirtel Africa will receive approximately $157.5 million of the total amount in the first instalment, which is expected to take place in the second half of the group\u2019s financial year.\n\nA portion of the proceeds would be distributed to the Tanzanian government as part of the terms of the company\u2019s public listing in 2019. The rest is to be used for debt reduction at the group level and investment in network and sales infrastructure in Tanzania.\n\nIn 2020, Airtel Africa CEO, Raghunath Mandava, outlined plans to sell approximately 4,500 towers in five countries: Chad, Gabon, Madagascar, Malawi, and Tanzania.\n\nThe move aimed to reduce the company\u2019s $3.5 billion debt and prepare for upcoming bond repayments.\n\nThe telecommunications giant has recorded significant losses in India because of low data prices and high competition among telcos. There is also the considerable cost of the infrastructure associated with running a telecoms business.\n\nHowever, there is a growing trend of asset-light telcos focused on core network and services provisions like calls and data services with third-party providers tasked with providing last-mile access. This results in a reduction in operational and maintenance overhead.\n\nAn example of a company divesting its assets is the Indonesian telco XL Axiata which has sold 6,000 radio towers since 2014.\n\nIn 2020, the Lagos State Government also moved to provide the infrastructure that telcos can latch on to provide telecommunications service to customers through its partnership with Western Telecommunications and Engineering Services Metro Limited.\n\nIt appears that Airtel is choosing to go this route as it aims to reduce its debt and increase competitiveness.",

          "text": "Following a partnership between Releaf \u2014 an agritech startup \u2014 and fintech startup, OnePipe, farmers in Cross River and Akwa Ibom states can now easily access digital financial services.\n\nSpeaking on the partnership, Releaf\u2019s Co-founder and CTO, Uzoma Ayogu, said, \u201cSince inception, Releaf has empowered over 1,000 farmers to supply over 10 million kilograms of quality crops to various food factories.\n\nWhile disbursements to our farmers have been largely cash-based, we now have access to digitised fund disbursement via embedded, customised accounts, provisioned by OnePipe, to drive financial inclusion of previously financially excluded farmers in the digital economy.\u201d\n\nHe also revealed that Releaf is exploring the provision of insurance services leveraging OnePipe\u2019s infrastructure and partnerships. The partnership provides the farmers with an embedded account branded as Releaf Wallet, which can be opened and operated by USSD and Progressive Web Apps (PWA) channels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith these accounts, the farmers can receive money from any bank/channel, transfer funds to any Nigerian bank account, and purchase airtime for themselves or third parties.\n\nLike most digital finance services on offer, they can also access loans with the loan amounts increasing according to their wallet usage.\n\nAccording to OnePipe\u2019s Founder and Chief Plumber, Ope Adeoye, \u201cworking with Releaf was inevitable as the company\u2019s vision to transform Africa\u2019s agricultural future by making decentralised food processing scaleable coincides with OnePipe\u2019s social mandate to drive financial inclusion through technology for all \u2014 including the 700m+ smallholder farmers on the continent.\u201d\n\nAs of May 30, 2021, data from the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System Plc (NIBSS) reveals that 48 million Nigerians had a BVN. With Nigeria\u2019s adult population sitting at 105 million according to the World Population Review, that means that 57 million Nigerians are unbanked.\n\nWhile fintech startups have sprung up trying to increase the number of Nigerians connected to financial services, they have mostly solved the problems associated using existing financial services.\n\nResearch shows that poverty, a lack of education, or living in rural areas \u2014 all qualities of the average Nigerian smallholder farmer \u2014 are barriers to financial inclusion.\n\nReleaf\u2019s partnership with OnePipe is a welcome development that follows the playbook used by super apps in Asia.\n\nMost of the farmers who work with Releaf are smallholder farmers who live in rural areas. By providing them with an opportunity to access financial services through digital channels, they can create a digital footprint enabling them to access more financial services, thus accelerating their financial inclusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it is not yet clear if this service is available to farmers outside Releaf\u2019s network.\n\nFounded by Isaiah Udotong, Ikenna Nzewi, and Uzoma Ayogu in 2017, Releaf was originally an online marketplace that connected buyers and sellers of agricultural commodities to trustworthy customers.\n\nThe startup was accepted into Y Combinator in 2017, receiving $120,000 in funding. After the founders returned to Nigeria, they continued to provide a marketplace for agricultural commodities until they realised that food factories were struggling to secure raw materials for their operations.\n\nThis led to a change in priority as the startup now functions as a raw materials procurement and logistics platform with oil palm as the leading product.\n\nThrough this partnership with OnePipe, it is expected that smallholder farmers in Nigeria, most of whom lack access to financial services, can now access financial services and, in the process, drive Nigeria\u2019s financial inclusion goals.",

          "title": "Nourishing dairy with tech, a path to Nigeria\u2019s economic growth?",
          "text": "Milk\u2019s nutritional value compares favourably to its economic value. According to Agrilinks, milk is a commodity in high demand in Nigeria, with over a billion tons needed annually. Unfortunately, several factors impede Nigeria\u2019s capacity to meet the demand for dairy products.\n\nThe Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations says, \u201cA healthy productive population is increasingly recognized not only as resulting from but also as an important prerequisite for poverty reduction and economic and social development.\u201d\n\nIn 2001, the FAO declared June 1 World Milk Day to highlight the importance of milk and draw attention to the global dairy sector.\n\nSadly, two decades later, Nigeria\u2019s milk production pales in comparison to its potential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) reports that pastoral systems, which yield meagre output, produce 90% of Nigeria\u2019s milk.\n\nConsequently, the country relies heavily on imported milk. According to a Vanguard article, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD) estimates that $1.5 billion is spent on milk importation annually.\n\nDeveloped countries have employed scientific and technological innovations in the dairy sector. The US, for instance, is the second-largest producer of milk globally per the FAO. And according to Statista, it made $40.4 billion from milk in 2020.\n\nThe dairy industry\u2019s success in developed countries is mainly due to adopting technologies that make larger herds profitable. These technologies, as the FAO puts it, \u201crequire large capital investments.\u201d From milking to preserving to distribution, the role of technology in the dairy sector cannot be overemphasised.\n\nThe quest for indigenous milk\n\nIkun Dairy Farm\n\nThe demand for milk in Nigeria is an opportunity to generate revenue internally. Besides the imperfect production process, Data by AsokoInsights reveals that the country has 20 million cows \u2014 the fourth-largest herd in Africa \u2014 but only 11.5% are used for milk. In contrast, 88.5% go towards producing beef.\n\nResearch by SpringerLink highlights reasons for Nigeria, and by extension, sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s failing dairy sector. Subsistence-oriented modes of production and the genetic make-up of indigenous cows are some of many.\n\nAccording to AsokoInsights, Nigerian cows can only produce between one and a half to two litres of milk daily. A cow in Kenya, one of Africa\u2019s largest producers of dairy products, produces 30 litres of milk daily.\n\nCorroborating AsokoInsights submission, research by the UK College of Agriculture, Food and Environment, shows that only two African countries \u2014 Ethiopia and Kenya \u2014 are self-sufficient in milk production. For context, Africa has five times the number of dairy cows in the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can infer from Dairy Australia\u2019s account of the milk-making process that, unlike most parts of Africa, dairy production is more technology-driven in developed countries like the US and New Zealand.\n\nFor example, cows are milked using vacuum cups attached to their teats. The milk is then sent to large steel vats and stored at five degrees for two days. It is then pasteurised, increasing shelf-life.\n\nWhile the genetic nature of Nigerian cows cannot be overlooked, the predominantly manual production process poses a major obstacle to a sustainable dairy sector.\n\nMilking Nigeria\u2019s potential\n\nIkun Dairy Farm\n\nThe Nigerian Dairy Development Program, NDDP, started in 2019 in partnership with Sahel Consulting Agriculture and Nutrition Limited, was designed to help address the local dairy sector\u2019s problems.\n\nAccording to Agrilinks, some local producers who benefited from the programme recorded a 198% increase in milk sales. While this proves the viability of the dairy sector, more still needs to be done.\n\nAlso, the Central Bank of Nigeria, per Nairametrics, released a circular in March 2020 restricting the importation of milk. However, the restriction didn\u2019t affect six companies: FrieslandCampina WAMCO Nigeria, Chi Limited, TG Arla Dairy Products Limited, Promasidor Nigeria Limited, Nestle Nigeria Plc., and Integrated Dairies Limited.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s restriction is a way of enabling backward integration in the dairy sector. Ekiti State\u2019s Commissioner for Finance and Economic Development, Akin Oyebode, explains why the CBN\u2019s directive might not work and what Ekiti State is doing differently.\n\nIn a tweet on April 22, 2021, Oyebode announced the arrival of 250 Jersey cows in Nigeria to be delivered to Ikun Dairy Farm, Ekiti State. This was a sequel to a joint venture between Promasidor Group, a food and beverage company, and the state government.\n\nGot 41 of c. 250 heifers in today, due to their weight (mostly pregnant) and available cargo space. Hope to get the other 200+ in very soon. Another tiny milestone hit. pic.twitter.com/rWzequMybQ \u2014 Akin Oyebode (@AO1379) February 9, 2021\n\nOyebode tells Techpoint Africa that Promasidor was a strategic choice by the state government. Unlike some of the other companies restricted by the CBN, Promasidor is not from a milk-producing country. According to him, companies in milk-producing countries would be hesitant to develop Nigeria\u2019s dairy industry.\n\nThe strategic joint venture is leading to the gradual revitalisation of the Ikun Dairy Farm (IDF).\n\nOyebode identifies low-yield cows as one of the sector\u2019s challenges, hence the importation of Jersey cows. According to him, 40 indigenous cows in the IDF produce 60 litres of milk a day, while six Jersey cows produce 150 litres a day.\n\n\u201cThe cow variant in Nigeria has been really focused on beef, and we generally do a lot of open grazing over long distances. Over the years, the genes of our cows won\u2019t give us the kind of milk that we require,\u201d Oyebode says.\n\nHe adds that it will take a long period for Nigeria to regain the milk-generating capabilities of its cows through cross-breeding.\n\nOyebode admits that while factors like science and technology go into building a sustainable dairy farm, they will be futile if the cow yield isn\u2019t proportional to the infrastructural inputs.\n\nHowever, Alhaji Muhammadu Damakka Abubakar, Executive Director and owner of L & Z Integrated Farms Nigeria Limited, a dairy company established over 15 years ago, believes low-yield cows are not a major problem for the country\u2019s dairy industry.\n\nHe cites India, the largest producer of milk globally, as an example.\n\n\u201cAverage milk per cow in India is not up to ten litres, but they have plenty, so if you have low-yielding cows but in large numbers, it makes up for their low yield.\u201d\n\nAbubakar believes the problem isn\u2019t the low-yield cows but the technology used in the milk collection process. Also, rather than open grazing, he suggests ranching as an alternative.\n\n\u201cThe era of allowing cows to roam is gone,\u201d Abubakar says.\n\nWith 20 million cows milked optimally \u2014 using a technologically-based milking system \u2014 in the right conditions with the right tools, he maintains that Nigeria will produce enough milk to meet the demand.\n\nWhile increasing cow yield can be looked into in the long run, Abubakar says using the indigenous cows optimally should be prioritised.\n\nSpeaking on the dairy sector\u2019s viability, he says, \u201cFrom milk, you can derive over 100 components; and from oil, you have only 20 or 25. A barrel of milk is worth almost 100 times what a barrel of crude oil is worth.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, a barrel of crude oil is currently worth $67 while its equivalent in milk is worth $57. In terms of daily demand, more crude oil is consumed. Knoema, a data technology company, puts Nigeria\u2019s daily crude oil consumption at 522,000 barrels \u2014 82.9 million litres \u2014 in March 2021.\n\nThese numbers exceed the demand for milk greatly. Per LEADERSHIP, the yearly demand for milk is 1.6 billion litres, putting the daily demand at 4.4 million litres.\n\nWhile these numbers nullify Abubakar\u2019s claims, they do not reduce the viability of the dairy sector as a major source of revenue.",

          "text": "Shares of the South African retail giant Shoprite traded almost 4 percent higher Wednesday, the day the company announced it had received 70 percent of proceeds from the sale of its troubled Nigerian unit.\n\nAt R160.89 a share, Shoprite shares are on track for their best day in about two weeks. The group\u2019s shares have risen almost 15 percent in 2021, and 28 percent since the start of 2020.\n\nShoprite, one of the first South African companies to expand into Nigeria in the early 1990s, recently completed the sale of its supermarket business in Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nShoprite had announced its exit from Nigeria in August 2020, and has not put a price on the sale of the business, with the group also closing its last stores in Kenya earlier in 2021. The sale is to a subsidiary of Nigerian property group, Persianas Investments.\n\nThe company said the Nigerian business environment had become unfavourable for its operations and it would be closing down as a result.\n\n\u201cThe Board has decided to initiate a formal process to consider the potential sale of all, or a majority stake, in Retail Supermarkets Nigeria Limited (RSNL), a subsidiary of Shoprite International Limited. As such, RSNL may be classified as a discontinued operation when Shoprite reports its results for the year,\u201d the company had said in a statement released last year.\n\nIn a recent publication, the company announced its investment in Africa, particularly Nigeria and Kenya, had not yielded desired gain and it would like to explore new territories.\n\n\u201cWe are cognisant that there is no one-size-fits-all approach and, for that reason, we are assessing the future for each investment on an individual country basis.\n\n\u201cAgainst this backdrop, we have resolved to either find a local partner or sell our Nigerian supermarket business. Furthermore, we have decided we will not allocate any further capital in the pursuit of a Kenyan market greenfields expansion. The region has not met our required return-on-investment targets and, while this factor is in part because the investment is still subscale, we believe now is not the time for Shoprite to lean in and invest further into new territory,\u201d the company said in the report.\n\nThe company also revealed that the exchange rate crisis of the dollar and naira led to a 7.9 percent loss in 2020, when compared to 2019.\n\nThe terms of the transaction include both a franchise agreement that secures the Nigerian business\u2019s right to continue to use the Shoprite brand. It also includes an agreement that provides for administration and technical support from the Shoprite Group for an initial period of five years.\n\nShoprite has been trading in the rest of Africa since 1990 and operates in many markets outside South Africa, including Botswana, Madagascar, Mozambique and Angola. The group, under CEO Pieter Engelbrecht, has been assessing the capital needs of its non-South African operations, which generate less than a quarter of group revenue.\n\nIn 2013, it considered expansion to 44 Shoprite stores across Nigeria, but halted the expansion project after encountering various challenges in the West African country. In 2019, Engelbrecht said the group would not remain in Nigeria at any cost.\n\nIn that year, it faced lower consumer demand in Nigeria as locals boycotted South African brands to protest against xenophobic violence in South Africa.\n\nShoprite follows Tiger Brands, Woolworths and Mr Price in exiting the country, which is seen as a difficult market to operate, amid oil price and currency volatility, and difficulties in repatriating funds.\n\nShoprite said on Wednesday that the transaction took effect on May 23, with 70 percent of the transaction proceeds having been received and the balance due in four equal instalments over 30 months.\n\nShoprite, valued at R95 billion on the JSE, had treated the Nigerian business as a discontinued operation in its half year to end-December, reporting that assets held for sale amounted to R1.4 billion, while the liabilities of these assets stood at R1.56 billion.\n\nAt the end of December, its core business, Supermarkets SA, made up 78 percent of group sales, with 1,685 stores under the Shoprite, Usave, Checkers, Checkers Hyper and LiquorShop brands.\n\nIt had 417 stores outside South Africa, including its discontinued operations.\n\nThe company says it will be focused on investing in technology and its employees.\n\n\u201cWe want to focus on further investment in building our information and technology-driven business infrastructure. We are firm believers that the future will be strongly data-led and as such, we are strengthening and future-proofing our business and strategy by investing in our IT ecosystem and our people,\u201d the company said.",

          "text": "In a bid to boost confidence in its major asset, which is land, Lagos State government has reduced time for registering property and also for obtaining construction permit.\n\nThe state has consolidated all payment fees and taxes for property registration into a single demand notice with the aim of making doing business in the state a lot easier and even \u2018cheaper.\u2019\n\nThe sprawling city has also strengthened real estate transaction regulations with the setting up a 16-man technical committee piloted by the Lagos State Real Estate Regulatory Authority (LASRERA).\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had, shortly after assuming office in 2019, reversed the Land Use Charge, which raised enormous dust when it was reviewed upwards, to pre-2018 levels.\n\nThe implication of these moves is not only that they enhance ease of doing business in the state, which is an otherwise difficult business environment, but also to boost investors\u2019 confidence and raise public trust in real estate and land-related business in the state.\n\nThe consolidation of the property registration fees, for instance, has led to the reduction in the number of days required to obtain Certificate of Occupancy (C-of-O) and Governor\u2019s Consent. This has come down from 72 to 61 days, according Hakeem Okunola, the state\u2019s Head of Service (HoS).\n\nThe state\u2019s e-planning platform has also been activated for the submission of all construction permit applications such that the fee procedures and laws are now on the website, while there is also a reduction in the average number of days for obtaining construction permit from 42 to 28 days.\n\nThese steps are of tremendous assistance to investors who, before now, have been finding it difficult getting property registration and construction permit. It was worse for those of them who were exposed to bank credit as their projects could not take off yet interest on the loans were running.\n\nRead Also:Veritasi reiterates commitment to provide affordable housing with Eystone\n\nThe HoS, who spoke at the annual ministerial briefing to mark Sanwo-Olu\u2019s second year in office, explained that the decision to take these steps was a response to continuous demand from stakeholders in the built environment through the state\u2019s online complaints and feedback\u2014the Citizengate.\n\nAt the inaugural meeting of members of the technical committee on regulation, Toke Benson-Awoyinka, special adviser to the Governor on Housing, explained that the committee\u2019s mandate was to design a policy and fiscal framework, institute and promote global best practices in the sector.\n\nShe added that the committee had the mandate of addressing challenges in the sector with particular attention to reforming homeownership model to increase housing stock and reduce the deficit.\n\nLagos, according to a report by the Pison Housing Company, has an estimated 3 million housing demand-supply gap with a very active rental market where over 50 percent of the state\u2019s 20 million population lives in a rented apartment.\n\nIt is, therefore, hoped that a well-regulated real estate market and a friendly business environment that enables more investment in the sector would lead to increased housing stock and less \u2018homelessness.\u2019\n\nBenson-Awoyinka noted that one of the lessons learnt from COVID-19 pandemic was the need to create and develop a robust housing policy with stakeholder involvement and engagement as well as curtail malpractices in the real estate sector, while also improving financial transparency and fiscal responsibility.\n\n\u201cTo achieve its objective, the committee will be required to set up a comprehensive system and framework, which will prioritise the development of a fiscal responsibility and transparency model, to promote the inflow of local and international funding required to confront the housing deficit.\n\n\u201cThe committee will also set up a governance structure that will oversee the entire real estate framework and stakeholder engagement in the state to minimise trust deficit,\u201d she said\n\nThe special adviser explained that the structure would cater to the entire system of the real estate process and incorporate participation from private developers, financial institutions and the government in a Public-Private Partnership model.",

The virus has changed the way we live and interact with one another globally.\n\n\u201cIt is heartwarming today that we continue with our gradual return to our normal lives with the commencement of the second dose coronavirus vaccination. With this, we hope for brighter days ahead as we collectively fight to defeat the virus.\n\n\u201cThe second dose vaccination exercise commences today, June 1, and will last for 40 days, during which period we intend to get the vaccines to our people, including frontline workers who are 18 years and above across the 18 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the State.\n\nObaseki said the second dose is a booster dose which will provide full protection against the coronavirus disease, adding: \u201cThe flag off is important to create awareness in the state and boost public confidence in the safety and efficiency of the vaccines.\n\n\u201cI took the first dose. Despite all the fears expressed, nothing happened. I am here today to flag off the second dose vaccination. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t take my second dose today because the time scheduled for me is not due. I will be due for the second dose on the 12th of June. However, some people have earlier dates. That is why the programme is launched today. I will take my second dose on the 12th of June and you will be invited to know the importance of the vaccination.\u201d\n\nNoting that the vaccines will be rolled out in phases, he said: \u201cThe first phase is now being administered to frontline workers, strategic leaders and the elderly; as scheduled for them. The second and third phase will follow and the rest of the eligible population will take turns to be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the goal of his administration is to vaccinate about 70 per cent of the population.\n\n\u201cFor those who have not been vaccinated, it is important to take the vaccine because by the end of June, it might be almost impossible to travel around the world without a vaccination certificate.\n\n\u201cGovernment alone can\u2019t fix this pandemic. We must all play our part by adhering to COVID 19 protocol to enable us to protect our loved ones, even after taking the second dose of the vaccines.\u201d\n\nGovernor Obaseki seized the opportunity to thank President Muhammadu Buhari for his support and role played in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that different stakeholders, particularly development partners, worked in synergy with the Edo State Government in ridding the state of the virus.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have vaccinated 38,500 people in the first phase of the first dose vaccination exercise. We are expecting that 38,500 people will come forward for their second dose. It is only then that you will have full immunization.\u201d\n\n...",

Fr. Fidelis Arhedo made the call while delivering a keynote address to audience at an event organized by the body in Uromi, Esan North East Local Government Area of Edo State, to commemorate the 2021 Child Protection Day.\n\nHe described Child Protection as the safeguarding of children from violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect, adding that Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Right of the child provides for the protection of children in and out of schools and places of worship.\n\nThe clergyman also emphasized the need for leaders in the community to be supportive of children and families, just as he asked employers to provide family-friendly work environment.\n\nHe blamed lack of parenting skills, drug and alcohol use, poor parent-child relationship, difficulties in managing anger and stress, personal health issues, including low self-confidence, among others for the prevalence of child abuse in the society.\n\nRev. Fr. Arhedo consequently admonished parents to discipline their children thoughtfully, teach children their rights, invest in kids and implored people to endeavour to report any case of child abuse to relevant agencies for prosecution.\n\nSpeaking on the the theme of the 2021 Child Protection Day, \u201cThe Role of Parents and Caregivers in the Protection of Children, the Coordinator of the Edo State Child Protection Network, Barr.

          "text": "Two lecturers of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), Akoka, who were involved in a sex-for-marks scandal, Boniface Igbeneghu and Samuel Oladipo, have been dismissed by the institution.\n\nThe university\u2019s new governing council, which is headed by a medical practitioner and an alumnus of the institution, Lanre Tejuoso, took the decision on Monday during its second meeting since its constitution.\n\nThis decision was taken almost two years after the two lecturers were exposed in a 52-minute documentary by BBC Africa where an undercover journalist, Kiki Mordi, disguised as a 17-year-old admission seeker, to expose the antics of the randy lecturers.\n\nA statement issued on Wednesday by the university\u2019s communication unit, corporate affairs division at the office of the vice-chancellor, said the dismissals were effective from Monday, May 31.\n\nThe statement reads in part; \u201cThe Governing Council of the University of Lagos, at its meeting on Monday, May 31, 2021, approved the immediate dismissal of Dr. Boniface Igbeneghu of the Department of European Languages and Integration Studies, Faculty of Arts and Dr. Samuel Omoniyi Oladipo of the Department of Economics, Faculty of Social Sciences, from the services of the University.\n\n\u201cCouncil, at its meeting, considered the report and findings of the Senate Committee set up to investigate allegations of sexual harassment levelled against them in a British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) World Service Investigative Series titled AFRICA EYE (which centred on sexual harassment in tertiary institutions)\n\n\u201cThe Council consequently decided and approved that both Dr. Boniface Igbeneghu and Dr. Samuel Omoniyi Oladipo be dismissed from the services of the university for misconduct, with effect from Monday, May 31, 2021 in line with section 18 of the University of Lagos Act 1967.\u201d\n\nThe university added that the council had mandated the university authorities to review its sexual harassment policy \u201cas may be necessary and institute effective strategies to prevent future occurrence.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nOn October 7, 2019, the BBC released the documentary which focused on the inappropriate sexual advances of four lecturers from both the University of Ghana and UNILAG.\n\nThe quartet, Ransford Gyampo and Paul Butakor from the Ghanaian university and Messrs Igbeneghu and Oladipo from UNILAG were captured in the video which went viral.\n\nThe two West African universities immediately announced the suspension of the lecturers involved.\n\nAnd in the case of UNILAG, Virgil Onyene, a professor, was appointed to chair the investigative panel to unravel the circumstances surrounding the allegations and make recommendations.\n\nDelayed verdict\n\nHowever, more than one year after the panel had submitted its report to the Senate of the university through the Oluwatoyin Ogundipe-led management of the university, no action was taken by the institution.\n\nHowever, at various fora, the vice-chancellor linked the delay to the prolonged crisis that rocked the university over disagreements between the management and the university\u2019s sacked governing council.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reported how the former council, which was chaired by another alumnus and a businessman cum lawyer, Wale Babalakin, and the Ogudipe-led management had engaged in a supremacy battle leading to the suspension of both the vice-chancellor and the governing council by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nMr Buhari acted in his capacity as the Visitor to the university.\n\nBut following the reinstatement of Mr Ogundipe as the vice-chancellor and the dissolution of the Mr Babalakin-led council, a new council was inaugurated in April. The council held its inaugural meeting between May 4 and 5, and held the second meeting on Monday.\n\nAbout the lecturers\n\nMr Igbeneghu, a PhD holder, is a former sub-dean of Faculty of Art and head pastor of a local Foursquare Gospel Church in Lagos.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the video, he invited the \u2018admission seeker\u2019 to his office for \u2018tutorials\u2019 and at their first meeting he asked: \u201chow old are you?\u201d\n\nAfter responding, the lecturer commented on her appearance.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know you are a beautiful girl? Do you know I am a pastor and I am in my 50s but if I want a girl of 17 years, all I need is a sweet tongue and put some money,\u201d he said.\n\nHe later continued with the harassment of the undercover reporter oblivious that he was being filmed.\n\nOn his part, Mr Oladipo, also a PhD holder, is a graduate of Obafemi Awolowo University.\n\nHe was a lecturer at the Bells University of Technology (BELLSTECH), Ota, Ogun State, a private university owned by a former President, Olusegun Obasanjo. He later joined the department of economics at the University of Lagos.\n\nMr Oladipo\u2019s offence as captured in the video was that he took the undercover reporter to a popular joint for the lecturers on the campus which they nicknamed \u201ccold room.\u201d\n\nThe university management immediately shut down the \u201ccold room\u201d as soon as the documentary was released.\n\nMeanwhile, PREMIUM TIMES learnt from a source, that the university\u2019s Senate had recommended the dismissal of Mr Igbeneghu. It had said Mr Oladipo should be suspended for three years \u201csince he was never caught in any act\u201d.\n\nHowever, a reliable source at the university who does not want to be quoted, said the governing council overruled the Senate\u2019s decision, insisting that the two lecturers were guilty of the same offence.",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun state Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Wednesday said his government is committed to youth development.\n\nThe governor spoke at the launch of Osun Youth Policy Document to develop and empower young people in the state and put them at the centre of development.\n\nThe newly-unveiled Youth Policy Document which has four components 4Es\u2014Youth Empowerment, Youth Engagement, Youth Entrepreneurship and Youth Education, was developed to provide a crucial framework for guiding the state\u2019s approach to ensuring that large number of youth residing in the state are provided with quality of life.\n\nLaunching the Policy Document at the Aurora Event Centre, Osogbo, Governor Oyetola said his administration has enunciated a clear policy framework to ensure that an enabling environment is created for the youth to maximally realise their creative and productive potential.\n\nHe noted that the Osun Youth Policy contains commitment by government, the youth of the state and the society in pursuance of youth development and growth.\n\n\u201cAs captured in the Policy, youth development is holistic and integrated, requiring the support and active involvement of all relevant Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs), Youth Organisations, Non Governmental Organisations and the Public Sector, Private Sector and Philanthropists,\u201d he said.\n\nOyetola who described the youth as the most productive, efficient and energetic segment of the population, said his administration has invested tremendously in them as part of efforts to build a virile and sustainable economy and ensure all-round growth and development.\n\nAccording to him, the youth have part of the reasons the administration since it came to power, hence, the careful crafting of Osun Development Agenda to bring all the sectors and the people into the development net.\n\nHe said his administration has been engaging youths productively as loans ranging from N500,000 to N2, 500,000 were facilitated for 4,650 people and that efforts were on to increase the number of the beneficiaries.\n\nOyetola added that the unveiling of the Youth Policy Document was to further demonstrate his administration\u2019s commitment to youth development, saying that government remains resolute to continuously engage in research and monitoring, while deploying an effective evaluation template to constantly enrich the initiative and ensure proper and sustainable implementation of the policy.\n\n\u201cYouth is a critical stage in the life cycle of human beings because of the admixture of high energy, enthusiasm, insecurities, idealism, confusion and challenges that characterise this unique life stage,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe youth are the hope of our nation and our State. They are the face and engine of any meaningful sustainable development. Unfortunately, in our clime, social norms and practices often exclude them from participating in critical decision-making pertaining to their lives and activities with dire consequences.\n\n\u201cConscious of this misnomer and intent on correcting it to harness the bundle of energy that characterises youth, our government has in recent times focused its attention on the youth, while designing programmes and projects that impact on youth empowerment, employment and social justice.\n\n\u201cThe people, including the youth, are the reason we are in government. Our Administration came into office on the shoulders of Development Agenda, a programme carefully created to bring all the sectors and the people into the development net.\n\n\u201cWithin two years after coming into office, we have delivered adequate and quality services, projects and programmes across the State in a manner that will sustain the peace in the State, transform the economy, industrialise the State, provide jobs for the people, especially the youth, and provide security and welfare for the people.\n\n\u201cWe are also determined to use sports as a vehicle for encouraging school enrolment and retention and talent identification, just as we intend using it to create opportunities for young people in our rural communities.\n\n\u201cOnly two days ago, the State Executive Council gave approval for the commencement of Osun Sports Festival. The first edition will commence in June this year.\n\n\u201cThe unveiling of the Osun Youth Policy Document today is to further demonstrate our Administration\u2019s commitment to youth development.\n\n\u201cI therefore, recommend the document to all levels of government for accelerated implementation as the roles of all stakeholders are clearly spelt out.\n\n\u201cI want to also assure all the youth in the State that this new State Youth Policy vividly captures workable strategies for achieving the Youth Development Plan of the present Administration and we will do all that is necessary to ensure that, in collaboration with other Stakeholders, the lofty intention of the Policy is made a reality for our teeming youths,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Commissioner for Youth and Sports, Hon. Yemi Lawal, said the newly- launched Youth Policy Document would serve as a veritable tool towards the actualisation of the lofty programmes of the administration to guarantee a better future for the youth.\n\nLawal who described the document as the first in the history of the state, expressed confidence in its significance to redefine the socioeconomic fortune of the young ones and by extension make life more meaningful and worthwhile for them.\n\nHe said the Document came into being after various stakeholders meetings with members carefully drawn from relevant MDAs; the leadership of the National Youth Council of Nigeria, Osun State Chapter; Representatives of both State and National Youth Parliaments; Political Youth Leaders; Student Bodies, as well as the officials of the Ministry of Youth and Sports to work on the production of the Document so as to have a guide that will be acceptable to all.\n\nThe Youth and Sports Commissioner further stated, \u201cThere is the need to protect the present life of these young persons in order to safeguard their future. With this in mind in mind, the Government of Osun has been striving to ensure that the youth of the State are given various opportunities through education and empowerment programmes at all levels.\n\n\u201cThe State Government had worked out this Document that would serve as policy direction for the entire youths. I commend the strong desire of the present Administration in the State under the leadership of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola who seeks to improve socioeconomic and general well being of the young people in the State.\u201d\n\nIn their separate remarks, the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdul-Rasheed Akanbi and the Orangun of Oke-Ila, Oba Abolarinwa Odedokun, urged Nigerian youths to take their destines in their own hands.\n\nThe monarchs who commended the Governor on the lofty initiative, expressed the hope that the document would go a long way to address the challenges confronting the youth in the State in particular and the nation at large.\n\nEarlier, the Speaker, Osun House of Assembly, Hon. Timothy Owoeye, attributed the conceptualisation and unveiling of the Policy to the positive manifestation of the \u2018all inclusiveness\u2019 posture of the Governor Oyetola Administration.\n\nTimothy noted that the Policy would further create opportunity for the youths to be more productive and fully engaged in things that would bring about socioeconomic values to their lives.\n\nHe commended the Governor for developing a Document that would help the youths of the State to take their rightful positions in the world.",

          "title": "Military invasion of South East will lead to chaos \u2013 Uko warns",
          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nFounder, Igbo Youth Movement (IYM), Evangelist Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari against ordering military invasion of Nigeria\u2019s South East region, as according to him, such move would lead to chaos and an unprecedented meltdown of the country.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Uko who is also the secretary of Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA), warned that military invasion rather than resolve the security situation in the zone, will make things much worse, even as it could lead to anarchy.\n\nUko\u2019s warning comes amid reports that President Buhari had concluded plans to order a major military operation in all the five states of the South East in response to recent attacks on police stations and other public facilities in the zone by gunmen amid growing agitations for a separate state of Biafra.\n\nOnline newspaper, TheCable quoted multiple security sources to have confirmed that President Buhari has given the security agencies the marching order to curtail the attacks.\n\nBuhari had in a series of tweets via his verified Twitter handle, @Mbuhari on Tuesday, tweeted that, \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe president went on to say that the agitators would soon get the shock of their lives, an indication that he had a major military operation in mind.\n\nThe tweet which referenced the 1967-1970 Biafra war, in which an estimated three million people, mostly in Nigeria\u2019s Southeast, were killed, including over a million children starved to death by food blockade, however, sparked angry reactions from many Nigerians on the social media platform, with many reminding the president that he had not made similar moves against bandits wreaking havoc in the country\u2019s Northwest and Boko Haram in the Northeast.\n\nReacting to the speculations, Uko emphasized that dialogue remained the only viable solution, as according to him, an invasion could lead to an all out conflict and Nigeria may never be the same again.\n\n\u201cRumours of proclamation of a state of emergency and the invasion of South East Nigeria by contingents and battalions of Nigerian military any time now, should not be true,\u201d Uko said.\n\n\u201cIf it is, then, the largest black nation on earth, may drift into an unexpected and unprecedented meltdown, which may be difficult to contain and impossible to control, and that would be because the rulers of the land, do not have the faintest idea of the resolve and anger in the souls of majority of the citizens of that region. The rulers will certainly meet unexpected reaction from the people of the zone. 51 year old pent-up anger in their hearts will explode in an unimaginable dimension, that may make it extremely difficult to save Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe stored up anger and bitterness in the hearts of Serbs as their parents retold stories about the sufferings of their people during the siege of Sarajevo in the 19th century, ensured the destruction of Yugoslavia over a century later.\n\n\u201cThose planning to invade South East and conquer the region, clearly, do not know the pain and humiliation the people of the region have had to endure and swallow for years, their strength and wealth, and especially the commitment of the diaspora population, and their readiness for a long and protracted struggle for justice and freedom from oppression. The government underestimates the mindset of over 20 million Igbo youths scattered all over the world, who have sworn not to hand over a situation of eternal servitude as permanent onlookers in the Nigerian project, to their progeny.\n\n\u201cRegardless of whatever may be wrong with the methods of the agitators, 90 percent of the masses, sympathizes with their cause, therein lies the problem.\n\n\u201cThe government will not face stiff resistance from the people, because the agitators are saints, angels and very polite folks, agitating with humility, no, that doesn\u2019t bother the people. The people are rather, very deeply offended, that the same government that has refused to rein in the deadly Fulani herdsmen who have made it extremely difficult for them to farm in their ancestral lands, paid hundreds of millions to vicious armed bandits terrorizing the North West, are suddenly bringing war to the most isolated, ostracised and persecuted region in the country.\n\n\u201cThis planned and ill-advised military campaign to the South East, will only confirm and affirm the rhetorics of the agitators, that the South East is deliberately hated and unwanted in the land. It will be difficult to convince the people otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe collateral damage in terms of human lives of innocent citizens, damage to infrastructure, rude interruption and destruction of economic life, and obstruction of trade, academic pursuits and civil and social activities, will produce enough bitterness and hatred of the central government, that the agitators will become heroes and idols of the much oppressed people of the zone.\n\n\u201cI have been closely involved with Igbo youths for close to 4 decades. I know that the last 2 years have been a remarkable period in the renaissance of ideas for self determination, never before experienced in this clime. I happen to know, not because I am a very smart person, but because I have intensely interacted with Igbo youths over the years and managed to earn their confidence.\n\n\u201cI say this confidently: Neither their parents nor teachers have any idea the degree of anger and bitterness in the hearts of Igbo youths born between 1990 and 2000, who are aged between 31 and 21 years of age. Certainly not the government. The whole world is in for a rude shock, you may wish to take my words to the bank.\n\n\u201cThe government, politicians and leaders across strata, made terrible mistakes by misjudging the agitators and applying very wrong strategy, that led to this unpleasant tension in the land. Military option will spiral into a conflagration that will be difficult to contain.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, it is important, to advise the South East Governors to, urgently meet with and explain to Mr President, the true situation on ground. Dialogue should replace military action. The government has never demanded a list of grievances from the agitators, government must do so now. More bloodshed will only prepare the ground for a bitter, protracted conflict, that will certainly change Nigeria for ever.\n\n\u201cNobody supports the agitators\u2019 sudden militant posture. But the brigandage of the ruthless Fulani herdsmen and their seeming above-the-law arrogance, forced the helpless masses to embrace the agitators\u2019 defence militia.\n\n\u201cThe refusal by government to invite and hear the grievances of the agitators and the decision to only kill them extra-judicially, granted the agitators, huge sympathy. Marching in to kill more of them, will complicate matters completely.\n\n\u201cBesides, Nigeria\u2019s multiple heamorage on many fronts, and the deep silence of the international community to support and advise Nigeria on the urgency to restructure the polity and adopt a new federal constitution, that would enthrone equity, suggests a conspiracy to programme Africa\u2019s largest nation to implode.\n\n\u201cHeavily indebted, with a steady inflation figures, unrest in all the regions, weak economy and agitation for seccesion thriving in the South East and South West, military action in the East will ensure the utter destruction of the road to peace.\n\n\u201cWhy is our colonial master watching and not advocating a new constitution for Nigeria? Why is the Bohemian club silently watching. Why is the council on foreign relations, the trilateral commission, the U.S state department etc, not pushing for a new people\u2019s constitution for Nigeria. Is their a silent conspiracy by the west, to watch Nigeria implode?\n\n\u201cHow come, all the eggheads in Nigeria are pretending they do not know that military invasion of the South East, will have dire consequences, first on the economy, and then on the unity and the very survival of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe government should engage the agitators in a dialogue. Military option should be out of it.\n\n\u201cIt is very doubtful if other regions will applaud the decision by the federal government to use military operation in the east to save the 1999 constitution. Everybody knows where Nigeria\u2019s problem is rooted. Insistence on preserving the 1999 constitution with the blood of citizens is unholy.\n\n\u201cHistory will judge all our actions today.\u201d",
          "summary": "OBINNA EZUGWUFounder, Igbo Youth Movement (IYM), Evangelist Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari against ordering military invasion of Nigeria\u2019s South East region, as according to him, such move would lead to chaos and an unprecedented meltdown of the country.\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Uko who is also the secretary of Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA), warned that military invasion rather than resolve the security situation in the zone, will make things much worse, even as it could lead to anarchy.\n\u201cRumours of proclamation of a state of emergency and the invasion of South East Nigeria by contingents and battalions of Nigerian military any time now, should not be true,\u201d Uko said.\n\u201cThis planned and ill-advised military campaign to the South East, will only confirm and affirm the rhetorics of the agitators, that the South East is deliberately hated and unwanted in the land.\n\u201cHeavily indebted, with a steady inflation figures, unrest in all the regions, weak economy and agitation for seccesion thriving in the South East and South West, military action in the East will ensure the utter destruction of the road to peace.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal Government has reacted angrily as social media giant, Twitter deletes President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet threatening violence against pro Biafra agitators in the country\u2019s Igbo dominated Southeast region.\n\nBuhari had in a series of tweets via his verified Twitter handle, @Mbuhari, tweeted, in reaction to series of attacks on police stations and the facilities of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the region by gunmen, that, \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe tweet which referenced the 1967-1970 Biafra war, in which an estimated three million people, mostly in Nigeria\u2019s Southeast, were killed, including over a million children starved to death by food blockade, sparked angry reactions from many Nigerians on the social media platform, with many reminding the president that he had not made similar moves against bandits wreaking havoc in the country\u2019s Northwest and Boko Haram in the Northeast.\n\nThe president had put up the tweet on Tuesday night, a day after many in the Southeast stayed indoors to mourn those killed during the bloody civil war, which also prompted suggestions that the tweet may be a response to the event.\n\nFollowing several complaints, Twitter deleted the tweet, stating: \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules\u201d.\n\nBut reacting to Twitter\u2019s decision, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, accused the platform of double standard.\n\nHe argued that the social media giant has conveniently ignored inciting tweets by Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and his cohorts.\n\n\u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule. If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concern about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges. If an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTwo, any organisation that gives directives to its members, to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that? Are we the ones guilty of double standards? I don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation, a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria, and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, indications have emerged that Buhari, in fulfilment of his threat, has ordered a major military offensive in the region, further raising concerns of possible human rights abuses and extra-judicial killings\n\nOnline newspaper, TheCable quoted multiple security sources to have confirmed that President Buhari has given the security agencies the marching order to curtail what many Nigerians fear is a descent to anarchy.\n\n\u201cThe Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has recruited over 50,000 foot soldiers, as it were, into its Eastern Security Network (ESN) and stockpiled arms, most of which were stolen from police armoury during the End SARS protests,\u201d a security operative told TheCable.\n\n\u201cThey have been bringing in arms through Cameroon in partnership with the Ambazonia Governing Council, the separatist movement in Southern Cameroon. IPOB sends at least 2,000 men and women to Cameroon for training on weapon handling every week.\u201d\n\nAnother top security official said IPOB has stockpiled \u201cbottle bombs\u201d, locally made explosive devices, Pump Action rifles \u201cas well as swords\u201d.\n\nIn a recorded tape, two people described as \u201ctop commanders of ESN\u201d were heard discussing issues such as surveillance of INEC offices, militants wounded in previous attacks, operations of IPOB camps, doctors treating wounded colleagues, installation of CCTV camera at their training camps in Udi, Emene and Nsukka and how to attack police cells,\u201d TheCable reported.\n\nIPOB has, however, denied being violent in its separatist campaign, but it has also said it assembles arms and ammunition locally.",

Those of us who spent 30 months in the fields and lived through the conflict will speak to them in their own language.\u201d\n\nTwitter removed the tweet after receiving many complaints, noting, \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d\n\nAlhaji Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Information and Culture, reacted to the news by accusing Twitter of discrimination.\n\nAccording to Mohammed, Twitter has casually disregarded inciting posts by Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), and his associates.\n\nHe claimed Twitter disregarded Kalu\u2019s comments encouraging the assassination of police officers, as well as the display of similar biases at the ENDSARS protest, which saw government and private property plundered and set ablaze, claiming it was a violation of human rights.\n\nMohammed, who wondered why the organization now found President Buhari\u2019s tweet offensive, said Twitter\u2019s role is suspect and Nigeria will not be fooled.\n\nHe said: \u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule. If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concern about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges. If an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed.\n\n\u201cTwo, any organisation that gives directives to its members, to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that? Are we the ones guilty of double standards? I don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation, a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria, and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\u201d",

          "text": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Tuesday ranked Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine rollout as the best in Africa in terms of storage and utilisation of the covid-19 vaccines for its population.\n\nIt noted that although Africa has not received its fair share of vaccines owing to global vaccine shortages, many African countries cannot still utilise their vaccines before they expire. It stated that many countries are now looking up to Nigeria to learn how to better roll out vaccination programmes.\n\nWHO Country Representative Dr. Kazadi Mulombo spoke during a joint news briefing on COVID-19 vaccination update of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), WHO and the United Nations Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) in Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cMore than 1.8 billion vaccines are being distributed globally as of today, mostly in 10 countries. Africa is lagging behind, but even though Africa is lagging behind, Nigeria is among the countries that are distributing the most covid-19 vaccine as we speak. In terms of volume, we are still a long way to go because we plan to vaccinate more than 100 million of our population.\n\n\u201cIn Africa, we are witnessing a kind of paradox. While on the one hand, the continent has received less of its share in terms of vaccines through the COVAX facility and other mechanisms. At the same time, we have a number of African countries that are losing the vaccines because they expired before they could be used. Some are redistributing the vaccines elsewhere. So, it is kind of sending a contradictory message about the need for vaccines to end the acute phase of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThere are some strategies that are being devised to prevent the loss of vaccines required under difficult circumstances. I am glad to say here that among most of the strategies that the Africa regional office of WHO is advocating for in terms of minimising the risk of losing the vaccine come from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe experience of engaging with strategic leaders, doing the weekly press briefing and continuous risk communication with the beneficiaries; all these engagements securing those for the second dose, while including other groups that were not included in the first phase are being shared today as best practices in terms of averting expiry of the covid-19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cThis is to say that on the African continent, many countries are now looking at Nigeria to learn how to better roll out vaccination programmes. WHO has challenged all the member states to ensure that by September, we vaccinate at least 10 per cent of our population. Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Tuesday ranked Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine rollout as the best in Africa in terms of storage and utilisation of the covid-19 vaccines for its population.\n\nIt noted that although Africa has not received its fair share of vaccines owing to global vaccine shortages, many African countries cannot still utilise their vaccines before they expire. It stated that many countries are now looking up to Nigeria to learn how to better roll out vaccination programmes.\n\nWHO Country Representative Dr. Kazadi Mulombo spoke during a joint news briefing on COVID-19 vaccination update of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), WHO and the United Nations Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) in Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cMore than 1.8 billion vaccines are being distributed globally as of today, mostly in 10 countries. Africa is lagging behind, but even though Africa is lagging behind, Nigeria is among the countries that are distributing the most covid-19 vaccine as we speak. In terms of volume, we are still a long way to go because we plan to vaccinate more than 100 million of our population.\n\n\u201cIn Africa, we are witnessing a kind of paradox. While on the one hand, the continent has received less of its share in terms of vaccines through the COVAX facility and other mechanisms. At the same time, we have a number of African countries that are losing the vaccines because they expired before they could be used. Some are redistributing the vaccines elsewhere. So, it is kind of sending a contradictory message about the need for vaccines to end the acute phase of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThere are some strategies that are being devised to prevent the loss of vaccines required under difficult circumstances. I am glad to say here that among most of the strategies that the Africa regional office of WHO is advocating for in terms of minimising the risk of losing the vaccine come from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe experience of engaging with strategic leaders, doing the weekly press briefing and continuous risk communication with the beneficiaries; all these engagements securing those for the second dose, while including other groups that were not included in the first phase are being shared today as best practices in terms of averting expiry of the covid-19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cThis is to say that on the African continent, many countries are now looking at Nigeria to learn how to better roll out vaccination programmes. WHO has challenged all the member states to ensure that by September, we vaccinate at least 10 per cent of our population. Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

Senate President Ahmed Lawan and Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila will be informed about the decision ahead of implementation, he added.\n\n\u201cTo douse probable legal tension, it is important for the proclamation instrument of the statement of emergency to expressly provide for the suspension of Chapter IV of the 1999 Constitution and its attendant enforcement rules,\u201d Mr Malami wrote. \u201cThe suspension of rights pertaining to matters of national security will then give legal backing for the proclamation of the statement of emergency to be operational and effective without litigious or judicial distractions.\u201d\n\nIn the early pages of the document, Mr Malami cited widespread acts of insecurity and blamed prominent separatist agitators like Sunday Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu for fueling the protracted crisis that has enveloped the country and aggravated the social and economic conditions of Nigerians.\n\nThe memo was endorsed to the president by National Security Adviser Babagana Monguno and administration officials are divided on how to proceed with the advice.\n\n\u201cClearly, different factions of our government have different positions on this alarming proposal,\u201d a presidency official told The Gazette. \u201cBut everyone agrees that the AGF holds powerful sway over the president and it would be a miracle if the Constitution is not suspended as he recommended.\u201d\n\nAnother official also within the presidency, who confirmed hearing about the memo but had not seen it before they were reached by The Gazette, said Mr Buhari might have little resistance considering the potency of Mr Malami\u2019s argument.\n\n\u201cThe president is just saying they should act in the best interest of the country,\u201d the official said. \u201cEven as the president, he seemed to have given up on his own ability to get the AGF to back down.\u201d\n\nConstitution suspended\n\nMultiple constitutional scholars and practitioners who analysed the memo for The Gazette said it was essentially a suspension of the Nigerian Constitution and declaration of martial law since Chapter IV dealt with fundamental human rights absence of which there cannot be a democratic system.\n\nThe analysts acknowledged the powers of the president to issue a state of emergency under Section 305 of the Constitution but said the powers are not absolute and do not include outright suspension of Chapter IV. While Section 305 said the president can declare a national emergency to curb criminalities, it did not expressly permit suspension of Chapter IV, which analysts described as the most important section of the Constitution.\n\nThe right to life and other crucial rights of modern society will be suspended under Mr Malami\u2019s proposal.\n\nThe attorney-general appeared to lay the groundwork for the controversial plan when he decried on Tuesday that Mr Buhari\u2019s respect for human rights was largely responsible for the administration\u2019s seeming incompetence at tackling widespread carnage and lawlessness.\n\nUnder siege\n\nMr Malami and presidential spokesman Garba Shehu did not return The Gazette\u2019s requests for comments about the proposal.\n\nMr Buhari has been conflicted over widespread chaos that threatens to define his eight-year leadership as a democratically-elected leader. His administration is the fourth since Nigeria returned to democracy in 1999 following years of military dictatorship.\n\nWhereas he touted his military bona fides as a plus for his fitness for a nation beset by insecurity, the country has seen no changes in security challenges under Mr Buhari. Since 2015, thousands of Nigerians have been killed by armed bandits, killer herdsmen, kidnappers and even security agents. Millions of citizens are already racked by economic hardships which analysts blamed on the administration\u2019s rudderless policies.\n\nIn his argument, Mr Malami alerted the president to the dangers of allowing the situation to go on unchecked, saying it would wreak even more devastating chaos compared to the current level of disorder.\n\nBut the prevailing state of security in Nigeria can be addressed under the existing constitutional framework, legal analyst Abdul Mahmud told The Gazette on Wednesday evening.\n\n\u201cThe AGF\u2019s position is nonsensical,\u201d Mr Mahmud said. \u201cThey have their own sinister agenda and are trying to come under suspension of the Constitution to actualise it.\u201d\n\nMr Mahmud said he was incensed by Mr Malami\u2019s suggestion to the president, saying it was unbefitting of his position as attorney-general\n\n\u201cIf the attorney-general who ought to be the chief protector of our Constitution is suggesting the need to suspend Chapter IV of the Constitution, then it is clearly an attempt to plunge the country into further crisis,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no part of the Constitution, including Section 305, that contemplated the suspension of Chapter IV, which essentially is the suspension of the Constitution itself,\u201d the legal expert said.",

          "text": "Support group under the umbrella of All Progressives Congress, APC Legacy Awareness & Campaign (APC-LAC) , has challenged the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to practice its opposition duty by presenting to Nigerians comparatively its achievements during its 16-year stewardship as the ruling party.\n\nWhile acknowledging that criticisms and opposition are integral requirements of democracy, the group said the PDP and its leadership must never imagine that Nigerians have a short memory of how destructive they were as managers of Nigeria, insisting that APC is working to rebuild the country after years of neglect and destructions while President Buhari is laying solid and sustainable foundation for Nigeria\u2019s greatness.\n\nThe group\u2019s position was contained in a statement released Wednesday to showcase the achievements of president Muhammadu Buhari-led APC administration in the last six years, and made available to journalists in Abuja.\n\nThe statement, which was jointly signed by Barr. Ismail Ahmed, Mr. Lanre Issa-Onilu, Mr. Tolu Ogunlesi and Mr. Salihu Moh. Lukman, was titled: APC is Laying Foundation for the Greatness of Nigeria.\n\nThe group insisted that president Buhari\u2019s administration has developed more infrastructure in the last six years than the entire sixteen years of PDP\u2019s administration.\n\nParts of the statement reads, \u201cMore road and rail infrastructure are being built and/or completed since 2015, than in the sixteen years between 1999 and 2015. Several landmark infrastructure initiatives are being implemented by the Buhari Administration, from the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) to the Infrastructure Company (InfraCo), the Highway Development Maintenance Initiative (HDMI), the Sovereign Sukuk Bonds (that have collectively raised close to a billion dollars), and the Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme. All of these are unprecedented efforts in developing and upgrading national infrastructure. Equally unparalleled is President Buhari\u2019s commitment to completing abandoned and unfinished projects inherited from previous administrations.\n\n\u201cAchieving Agricultural Self-Sufficiency: Through landmark initiatives like the Anchor Borrowers Programme and the Presidential Fertilizer Initiative, millions of farmers across the country have benefited from improved access to land, input, credit and fertilizers; and private sector players have invested more than a billion dollars in cultivation, milling and processing.\n\n\u201cEntrenching Technology in Government Processes and Service Delivery: The presidential mandates to expand the coverage of the Treasury Single Account and the Integrated Public Payroll Information System (IPPIS) to all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, Automation of the Federal Budgeting Process, Automation of Import Duty Exemption, Electronic Visas, the launch of the Open Treasury Portal, National Digital Identification, and so on.\n\n\u201cCreating the first truly national Social Safety Net in the history of Nigeria: Nigeria has since 2016 built the largest social investment programme in Africa, with more than 10 million beneficiaries receiving one or more of the following: Cash Transfers, Micro-Credit, School Feeding, N-Power Stipends and a Special Public Works Programme across all 774 Local Government Areas of the country.\n\n\u201cEnabling the Private Sector: Under the watch of APC controlled Federal Government under President Buhari, the largest single-train refinery in the world is being constructed, in Lagos, as well as the first new Deep-Sea Port in the country in decades. Across the Niger Delta, several private-sector-led Modular Refinery Projects have kicked off since 2016 and are being completed; as well as the long-awaited Train 7 that will expand the NLNG\u2019s capacity by a third. Billions of dollars have been invested in every part of the country by private investors in Agriculture, Mining, Oil and Gas, Manufacturing, Logistics, and other areas, since 2016.\n\n\u201cGovernance Reforms: No administration since 1999 has assented to as much transformative legislation: the first Police Reform Bill since 1943, the first Prisons Reform Bill in almost fifty years, the first reform of Companies legislation (CAMA) in thirty years, the first reform of Fiscal Terms for the Oil and Gas Industry since 1993, the first legislation in West Africa aimed at criminalising Maritime Piracy, Clearing of longstanding Petroleum Joint Venture (JV) Cash Call Arrears, Restoration of the Budgeting Calendar to a January-December cycle, take-off of the Ogoni Clean Up, after several years of delays, and many more.\n\n\u201cA New Paradigm for Federal-State Relations: Under President Buhari led APC controlled Federal Government, the era of unhelpful Federal interference in subnational affairs, resulting in illegal impeachments of Governors, withholding of State Government Funds, balkanisation of the Governors\u2019 Forum, etc, has ended. Instead, the Federal Government under President Buhari has positioned itself as a vital source of support to the States, making available long overdue refunds like the Paris Club Refunds ($5.4 billion); Refunds for Federal Road Projects (approximately 700 billion Naira); and Bailout Funds and Budget Support in excess of Two Trillion Naira.\n\n\u201cRebuilding National Security Capacity: Even as the country continues to struggle with several historical security challenges, the APC led Administration of President Buhari has been planting the seeds for a more efficiently policed and secured country, through the following:\n\n\u201cUnprecedented investments in military hardware: dozens of new aircraft, ships, battle tanks and others have been ordered and are being delivered\n\nPresidential Assent to the new Police Act, in which Community Policing has been enshrined.\n\n\u201cEstablishment of the Police Trust Fund to finance training, logistics and welfare\n\nInvestment in technology-aided policing of land and maritime environments \u2013 Nigeria Police National Command and Control Centre (NPF-C4i); Nigeria Police Crime and Incident Data Base (NPC & IDB); NIMASA\u2019s Deep Blue Project; West African Police Information System (WAPIS) Data Collection and Recording (DACORE) Centre in partnership with INTERPOL, Nigerian Immigration Service Technology Center, and others.\n\nx\n\n\u201cWe firmly believe that these efforts will begin to yield fruit in the months and years ahead.\n\n\u201cBuilding Bilateral Partnerships and Advancing Nigeria\u2019s Foreign Policy Interests: The Buhari Administration has restored Nigeria\u2019s relations with countries like the United States, United Kingdom, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and our neighbouring countries, with positive outcomes like the sale by the United States of 12 fighter aircraft, the Presidential Fertilizer Initiative with Morocco, and the revitalization of the Multinational Joint Task Force and the Chad Basin Commission.\u201d",
          "summary": "The group\u2019s position was contained in a statement released Wednesday to showcase the achievements of president Muhammadu Buhari-led APC administration in the last six years, and made available to journalists in Abuja.\nLukman, was titled: APC is Laying Foundation for the Greatness of Nigeria.\nThe group insisted that president Buhari\u2019s administration has developed more infrastructure in the last six years than the entire sixteen years of PDP\u2019s administration.\nAll of these are unprecedented efforts in developing and upgrading national infrastructure.\nEqually unparalleled is President Buhari\u2019s commitment to completing abandoned and unfinished projects inherited from previous administrations.",

Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThis statement did not go down well with many Nigerians who felt Buhari\u2019s comments were insensitive particularly as his administration had not spoken hard on northern elements who cause trouble in the country\n\nHowever, the President\u2019s supporters, led by the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, who came to prominence through activism, defended Buhari\u2019s tweet.\n\nFollowing several complaints, Twitter eventually bowed to pressure, deleting the tweet.\n\nA comment by Twitter stated, \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules\u201d.\n\nThe social media giant had earlier in the year banned then United States President, Donald Trump, for his inciting comments which led to the attack on the US Congress.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed has taken a swipe at the US media giant, Twitter, saying its mission in Nigeria is suspicious.\n\nMohammed\u2019s comments came after Twitter deleted President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet where he issued a threat to trouble makers in the country while making reference to Nigeria\u2019s civil war.\n\nWhile defending its action, the tech company said the President\u2019s tweet violated its rules.\n\nBut briefing State House reporters at the Presidential Villa on Wednesday in Abuja, the Minister accused Twitter of ignoring inciting tweets by the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, and others, adding that Nigeria would not be fooled.\n\n\u201cWe have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is very suspect, they have an agenda,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspicious. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the ENDSARS protests that were funding ENDSARS protesters, it was the first to close the account of the former president of the US, Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd you see when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during ENDSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened on the Capitol, it became insurrection.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Twitter Deletes Buhari\u2019s \u2018In The Language They Understand\u2019 Tweet\n\nHe recalled the #EndSARS protest during which government and private property were either looted or destroyed in October last year, noting that the company also displayed the same bias during the period.\n\nThe minister also asked what rule of Twitter President Buhari violated to warrant his tweet to be deleted, wondering why previous tweets on #EndSARS protests were taken out.\n\nMohammed added, \u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule. If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concern about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges.\n\n\u201cIf an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed. Two, any organisation that gives directives to its members, to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centers, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that?\n\n\u201cWe are the ones guilty of double standards. I don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation, a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari had during a meeting with the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, issued a stern warning to those plotting to destroy Nigeria, saying they will soon receive the shock of their lives.\n\nHe also condemned the series of attacks on INEC facilities, stressing that the Federal Government has given the perpetrators enough time.\n\n\u201cI receive daily security reports on the attacks, and it is very clear that those behind them want this administration to fail,\u201d President Buhari said.",

I don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation, a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed.\n\n\u201cBy whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
