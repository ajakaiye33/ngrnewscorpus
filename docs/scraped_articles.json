Moshood Kayode Akiolu (APC-Lagos) said Monday.\n\nAkiolu who represents Lagos Island II federal constituency of Lagos state said it was unfortunate that he was listed among lawmakers who have not sponsored any bill in a recent report by an online medium, that said he is among the 10 lawmakers from Lagos without a bill in the last two years.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Abuja, Rep. Akiolu said \u201cImmediately the report came out I received calls from different personalities including my constituents, friends, colleagues and associates.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe report is actually a big misrepresentation of the procedures of bills and motions in the National Assembly. I am a lawyer by profession and I am trained to make policies for the good governance of the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am working on various bills and motions. But you don\u2019t just dabble into bills or churn out bills in the name of sponsoring bills. You sponsor bills that are workable and implementable; bills that can become law; bills that can impact positively on your constituents and the society\u201d.\n\nSpeaking further, he said, \u201cIf you look at the first motion I sponsored when I was inaugurated into the House- to immortalise Stella Adedavoh and others that were involved in the treatment of Ebola patients.\n\n\u201cThe motion made headlines and it reminded Nigerians that people who sacrificed their lives fighting deadly diseases and offering selfless services to the nation deserved to be honoured even in death.\n\nIf you see what other countries like Liberia, Sierra Leone went through, you will appreciate the contributions made by Stella Adedavoh and other health workers, some of whom paid the supreme price\u201d\n\nAkiolu, who is the son of Oba of Lagos, Rilwan Akiolu said \u201cBut I am not in the National Assembly to play to the gallery. We have about two years to go in the current Assembly and so there is time for my representation to be felt.\n\n\u201cThe problem we have is that many people don\u2019t know how the parliament works. In the US, if you are a new legislator, you are expected to understudy the system and get accustomed to how it functions.\n\n\u201cI believe those who carry out the assessment of our performance did not do their due diligence before releasing the result. However, that will not distract me. I have two years and can achieve a lot within the remaining period.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI have sponsored a lot of motions, one of which is the one on the immortalisation of Stella Adedavoh, which I told you earlier. I also sponsored a motion concerning the state of affairs in the southwest when we were having a crisis in the southwest.\n\nAnd there are very many other motions and bills that I will come up with when the House reconvenes later this month. But as I have said before, lawmaking is not only about sponsoring bills and motions.\n\n\u201cThe work of a legislator involves a whole lot of things- representation and oversight. So, I\u2019m not restricting myself to bills and motions but I\u2019m looking at the whole job of a legislator\u201d.",

          "text": ".\n\n**Says Failure is Failure irrespective of circumstances.\n\n**Orders Special Operations in North West & North Central Regions.\n\nBy: Kingsley Omonobi \u2013 Abuja.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of mounting security threats from different parts of the country, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Faruk Yahaya has charged Formation Commanders and Commanders at all levels to rise up to the challenge and seize initiatives that he has outlined to counter them, warning, \u201cI will not again take or accept excuses. Failure is failure irrespective of the circumstances\u201d.\n\nSpeaking at the opening ceremony of the COAS Combined Second and Third Quarter Conference at the Command Officers Mess 1, Abuja on Monday, the Army Chief said, \u201cI want to state that, the Nigerian Army under my watch will remain resolute and continue to chart progressive paths towards tackling the security challenges confronting the Country.\n\n\u201cHence, I have directed that serious attention be given to sustaining and improving the tempo in all ongoing Nigerian Army operations across the Country.\n\n\u201cI have also directed the conduct of special operations, especially in the North Central and Northwest Regions to address the deteriorating security infractions in the Regions.\n\n\u201cCommanders must therefore glean from my Command Philosophy to ensure that operational and administrative proficiencies of Nigerian Army units and formations are sustained and improved upon.\n\nAlso Read:\n\n\u201d Commanders must seize the initiative and commanders must take initiative, they must take decisive actions to defeat the threats in their respective Areas of Responsibility. I will not again take or accept any excuses. Gentlemen, failure is failure irrespective of the circumstances\u201d.\n\nContinuing the COAS said, \u201cWe have commenced building bridges across the Services and agencies through the robust joint, interagency, and inter-governmental framework to confront our current security challenges.\n\n\u201cAs formation commanders and Principal Staff Officers, your role is critical to the attainment of my vision.\n\n\u201cAs officers and commanders under whose charge are placed men, materiel, and other resources, you are the key drivers of these pillars.\n\n\u201cYou must therefore note that even if we have all we require, we might not achieve much without you providing effective leadership, a good attitude and acting professionally in all our conduct, operations and other activities.\n\n\u201d I, therefore, charge you all, to immediately key into my vision so that together, we can take the Nigerian Army to greater heights.\n\n\u201cI am aware of logistics constraints affecting operations across the country and I am glad to inform you that efforts are in progress to provide us with combat enablers that would enhance and boost our operations.\n\nConcerted efforts are also being made to eliminate the threat of improvised explosive devices which has been a major impediment to troops and our operations in Operation Hadin Kai.\n\nI want to assure you that I am determined to rebuild the fighting skills, capacity, confidence, and morale of our troops across the various theatres of operations. Training must also be given due attention that it deserves.\n\nIn order to achieve this, priorities for the fourth quarter of the year would include training and more training.\n\n\u201cI will ensure that through functional training, officers and soldiers of the Nigerian Army are equipped with the right attitude, competencies and skills to effectively undertake daring missions In addition to developing special operations forces.\n\nThis would be closely followed by procurement that ensures appropriate kitting and provision of protective gear, weapons, equipment and platforms.\n\nLet me however remind you all that while no effort will be spared in achieving these goals, it is the command responsibility to ensure the sustenance and maintenance of all equipment.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Steve Oko\n\nThe All Progressive Grand Alliance APGA has alleged that the decision of the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC, to store electoral materials for the Anambra November 6 governorship poll in Imo State, is suspicious.\n\nChairman of APGA, Abia State, Rev. Augustine Ehiemere who made the allegation while addressing newsmen after a State Executive Council, SEC meeting of the party in Umuahia, claimed that the decision of INEC to keep the electoral materials in an All Progressive Congress, APC-controlled state, was a ploy to manipulate the outcome of the poll in favour of APC.\n\nEhiemere who cried foul over the action said \u201cAPC is desperate to take over power in Anambra at all cost\u201d, and urged the people of the state to resist it.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nIn the same vein, the state Legal Adviser of APGA, Mr Chukwuemeka Nwokoro, said the suspicion of APGA was heightened considering the fact that the Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma, doubles as the Chairman of APC Campaign Council for the Anambra poll.\n\nHe argued that the excuse by INEC that the action was on security grounds was watery, contending that Anambra is more secure than Imo.\n\n\u201d Who doesn\u2019t know that Imo is the most insecure state in the South East today? If not for something sinister, why will INEC choose to warehouse electoral materials in Imo when Anambra is more secure than Imo? Why not Delta that is even closer?\n\nThe legal Adviser vowed that any attempt to manipulate the outcome of the poll and shortchange the Anambra electorates would be stoutly resisted by APGA.\n\nHe cautioned INEC against decisions that will cost the electoral umpire the confidence of the party, \u201cbecause we have lost half confidence in INEC for honouring the Jigawa Court judgement in a matter outside its jurisdiction\u201d.\n\nAPGA however, hailed the Abuja Court of Appeal judgement that restored Chief Victor Oye as the authentic National Chairman of APGA, and Professor Charles Soludo as the party\u2019s candidate for the Anambra governorship poll.\n\n\u201d The Judiciary has once again proved that it\u2019s really the last hope of the common man\u201d, Ehiemere said, while urging the Judiciary \u201d not to allow Judiciary shoppers to ridicule our democracy\u201d.\n\nHe pledged the unalloyed loyalty of Abia APGA to the Oye-led National Working Committee, NWC, of APGA; and unwavering support for the governorship bid of Soludo.\n\n\u201d Professor Soludo is an erudite Economist with the magic wand to sustain the successes recorded by Govs. Willie Obiano, and Peter Obi respectively.\n\n\u201cWe have no doubt in us that Anambra people clearly understand that the success of Soludo in the election will guarantee the sustainability and improvement of these successes.\n\n\u201cAnambra should not allow political locusts and merchants to eat up the state and convert it into personal estates as was the case before APGA came on a rescue mission.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Senator representing Nasarawa West Senatorial district and former governor of Nasarawa State, Abdullahi Adamu, said government owes it a duty to treat herdsmen the other citizens were being treated.\n\nHe spoke at a media parley with Senate Press Corps in Abuja on Monday, saying that the hullabaloo about herders in Nigeria were unnecessary given that they are also Nigerians and should be protected by government at various levels.\n\nHe lamented that herders because of their calling don\u2019t enjoy infrastructure like good road, electricity, pipe borne water etc, yet their rights were being stampeded.\n\nAccording to him, government should make funds available to herdsmen pursuing their legitimate business the same way businessmen across the country have access to funds from the national treasury.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis government has a duty like the way its treating businessmen in Alaba, Onitsha, Kano, and Port Harcourt to treat herdsmen too because they are Nigerians. These provisions are public funds. They are not from the private fund of any governor or senator. The funds are from the treasury of this country and every Nigerian has a stake in that treasury.\n\n\u201cSo the government has a duty to find a wherewithal to make it possible for herdsmen not to go astray in the course of pursuing his legitimate duty.\u201d\n\nAbdullahi, who is the Senate Committee Chairman on Agriculture and Rural Development, expressed disappointment at how governors are legislating on anti-open grazing law, saying that the right to movement of herders were being inhibited.\n\nWhile reacting to questions on national issues, he added: \u201cWhen I read the meeting of southern governors and the issue of open grazing and how they kicked against it and threatened to make law against it. I replied them in a manner that you recalled.\n\n\u201cI believe as governors, as members of the executive, operating in the different tier of government, they have a constitutional responsibility, the constitution upon which they take an oath of office.\n\n\u201cOne of the fundamental rights there is every Nigerian, no exception. Every Nigerian has a right of free movement. Every Nigerian has a right to pursue a legitimate business. Right of association is enshrined in the constitution. You cannot under any pretence take away these rights.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know under any condition which government can say, yes, we can take away this right. When they came up with this, I was wondering. First and foremost, a week earlier before the meeting the governors had here in Abuja and there was no such announcement like that. I was taken aback when I read about their meeting in Asaba.\u201d\n\nResponding to questions that anti-grazing law was gaining traction in the North, he said: \u201cI still stand by that. The fact that one or two governors in the North have said something like that does not take away the right of herdsmen.\n\n\u201cThe question here is nature has closed vacuum. You can\u2019t build something on nothing. The duty to protect herdsmen and farmers rest squarely on the national government, State Government and the Local government administration.\n\n\u201cThe question here is, has the government done what it is supposed to do to protect Nigerians who are in that calling, in that profession and in that trade? The answer is no and you cannot blame the person who is desperately looking for means of livelihood.\n\n\u201cHowever, this does not excuse somebody who is pursuing his right from doing harm to somebody\u2019s right. I must be very clear on this, a farmer has right to farm, if you dare carry your cattle and and damage his farm crops, he has right to make claims in the Court of law. That\u2019s the law as I understand it.\n\n\u201cSo, it doesn\u2019t matter. If the whole Northern governors make the same pronouncement that the Southern governors did, that doesn\u2019t shake my fundamental position on this. Government owes herdsmen a duty to protect their calling and I dare repeat that if you go to Wuse Market here, you will see how many infrastructure have been provided by the FCT and Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) like water, and electricity. These are for Nigerians. These herdsmen are Nigerians.\u201d",

          "title": "Lagos and quest for more varsities",
          "text": "Education stakeholders in Lagos State are confident that establishing more universities would help satisfy the people\u2019s yearnings for better qualitative education, writes OYEBOLA OWOLABI\n\nThe statistics are alarming and scary. Lagos is home to over 14 million youths, and going by the just-concluded university admission exercise, only 3,500 of the 36,000 qualified candidates that applied for admission into the Lagos State University (LASU), Ojo, got a slot, leaving the remaining 32,500 stranded.\n\nWhat do the remaining 32,500 do with their time and results? They would most probably sit back and wait for next year. The waiting process could however become laced with uncertainties, especially because a restive youth could be a time bomb for society.\n\nThis thus calls for strategies that would ensure that more opportunities for admission are created for youths.\n\nThe Lagos State government has thus initiated moves to bridge the shortfall and improve the quality of education for its residents. These moves are part of the larger efforts to actualise the THEMES agenda of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu led administration, of which education and technology form an integral part. This informed the various infrastructure upgrade across all public schools in the state.\n\nOne great move is the transformation of public schools\u2019/institutions\u2019 learning environment and capacity building for teachers. This will help to improve teaching and learning methods in schools.\n\nPerhaps, the most noticeable area where the government is making steady strides is in the development of tertiary education. Approval was given for e-lecture portals for the state-owned tertiary institutions \u2013 Lagos State University (LASU); Lagos State Polytechnic (LASPOTECH); Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education (AOCOED) Otto/Ijanikin; Michael Otedola College of Primary Education (MOCOPED), Noforija, Epe; Lagos State University College of Medicine (LASUCOM); Lagos College of Health Technology and Lagos State College of Nursing and Midwifery.\n\nThese state-owned institutions are also sailing on international waters, with LASU entering into collaboration with Michigan University on staff/student exchange, joint research work, fieldwork and data collection and analysis among others. Also involved in the partnership are Cape Town University, South Africa, Egerton University, Kenya and the University of Sierra Leone, Sierra Leone.\n\nLASPOTECH is not left out of the international accolades as it was ranked third-best Polytechnic in Nigeria by the latest Webometrics ranking for Polytechnic and Colleges of Technologies. Others are also undergoing one form of infrastructure upgrade or the other.\n\nPerhaps to crown these efforts are plans to upgrade three of the institutions into universities. The move is partly in response to the longings of Lagosians who have continued to demand more universities to meet the growing admission needs of their children/wards.\n\nThe House of Assembly gave the process support, especially with a public hearing on \u2018A Bill for a Law to provide for the Establishment of the University of Education, Lagos (UNEDLAG) and for connected purposes\u2019 aimed at converting AOCOED and MOCPED to a university, which received wide public approval.\n\nGoing by their submissions at the public hearing, stakeholders of MOCPED are showing eager signs to boldly own the initiative and see it to its fruition. MOCPED sits on 88 hectares of land, with additional 60 hectares pledged by the host community.\n\nThe Alara of Ilara-Epe, Oba Folarin Ogunsanwo, argued that with the large expanse of land available in Epe, the take-off site for the university should not be a problem.\n\nProvost of the MOCPED Professor Nosiru Onibon expressed the institution\u2019s readiness to be upgraded into a university. According to him, the College has the facilities, human resources and community accessibility for the university take-off.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you talk of the required landmass, we have it at MOCPED. And it would interest you that we currently occupy only 12.5 per cent of the total landmass and it is not swampy.\u201d\n\nThe College\u2019s Academic Staff Union also gave it total support for the proposed project, saying it is ready to work with stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition. Chairman of the union Jamal Apena said: \u201cWe wholeheartedly support the brilliant, noble and commendable transmutation plan of the government in upgrading the college into a University of Education.\u201d\n\nActing Chairman, Senior Staff Union of the College, Mrs. Ogunyemi Olubunmi, pledged the readiness of the union to ensure a seamless take-off process, while Speaker of the Student Union Government (SUG), Agboola Ifeoluwa, said the transmutation process would expose the students and redirect the minds of Epe residents towards attending the university rather than looking elsewhere.\n\nStakeholders also believe that when LASPOTECH is eventually upgraded to a University of Science and Technology, teaching and learning will focus on vocational and entrepreneurship skills development for job security. This, perhaps, is to boost entrepreneurship activities in the state, thereby further enhancing wealth creation.\n\nIt would provide manpower for the development of the state and the country since vocational and entrepreneurship skills development programmes will help develop the potentials of the youths to make them relevant in the 21st-century global digital economy and make them employers of labour.\n\nThis will also address youth restiveness, reduce crime and other vices capable of undermining development efforts across the country.",

          "text": "Sacked by Boko Haram, an agrarian community in Borno State has re-emerged beautiful and glowing, writes JOEL DUKU.\n\nIt was time for maghrib (evening prayers) and the sound of gunshots and loud explosions rent the quiet village of Ngwom,\u201d Adamu Modu, a father of eight children with two wives recalled.\n\nModu recalled in 2018 how Boko Haram came to their village Ngwom and set his house ablaze. The flames from the fire pierced his heart because he never got the chance to pick any of his belongings but to run for his dear life.\n\nWith his two wives and eleven children, Modu, a 37-year-old man who deals in petty trading of soup condiment from Mafa Local Government, is today a proud owner of a modern house built by the North East Development Commission (NEDC) and donated free of charge to him and other thousand beneficiaries.\n\nThis reporter met him in his new apartment at Ngwom. Modu was performing ablution for afternoon Muslim prayers. His children were playing in the courtyard of the compound, while his wife had gone to fetch firewood for cooking with the eldest of his daughters.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to Allah where we were staying before at Gidan Taki IDP camp in Maiduguri but this new house that we are staying in has uplifted my life better than it used to be. I pray that Allah blesses all the big men that made this possible for us,\u201d he said.\n\nAbubakar Mustapha was also displaced from this community and wandered around in different IDP camps in Maiduguri and finally settled at Gidan Taki before moving back to Ngwom to occupy a new house from the NEDC.\n\nThe story of his gratitude is captured in a few words: \u201cMasha Allah\u201d(glory to God) but his ordeal in the hands of Boko Haram is horrific and traumatising, to say the least.\n\n\u201cSurviving with eleven children in a makeshift house in the IDP camp for more than five years is the most harrowing experience he has faced in his entire lifetime,\u201d Mustapha narrated.\n\n\u201cIt was more difficult during the rainy season as the camps were flooded during that time. You spend sleepless nights sometimes holding the children because of water in our thatched houses at the camp,\u201d he added.\n\nThe story of Mustapha Kalari is not different from his neighbours. He has also escaped several Boko Haram attacks with his wife and thirteen children surviving in different IDP camps for more than ten years. With a stroke of providence, he has now become a proud owner of a new apartment in the new modern city of Ngwom.\n\n\u201cI have never owned this kind of house in my life. I never dreamt of having one. Look at me, I am 59 years old so when will I have to raise money to build this kind of house in my life? Today, I thank God that I can sleep in this kind of house. All my life as a farmer, I was sleeping in thatched houses.\n\n\u201cI thank the people that built these houses. I was told that we are not paying anything to get the house. Help me thank Baba Buhari, NEDC and Gov. Zulum. Tell them that we are grateful and Allah will reward them,\u201d Mustapha said.\n\nZainabu Bukar Buskuri and Fanta Modu have both crossed the age of 60. The two widows are proud owners of the modern apartments courtesy of NEDC.\n\nBoth could not speak the Hausa Language except Kanuri but their expressions of joy over their new accommodation could not betray the language barrier between them and this reporter. Fanta dragged me into the compound and pointed to her room as she raised her two hands in prayers and thanksgiving to Allah. Both live with their children and grandchildren.\n\nKyari Abba was not sure he was ever going to get the new house even though he heard about their construction.\n\nFor him, it was a dream come true to being allocated a house to live in with his family.\n\n\u201cI prayed silently for one of these houses to be given to me. I feel as if I am dreaming but I also believe that Allah has answered my prayers to occupy one of these houses,\u201d Kyari said.\n\nOur correspondent discovered that not just the people of Mafa are occupants of this new city but people from across the state.\n\nThere are people from Bama, Konduga, Gamboru, Dikwa and Kala-Balge who have decided to start a new life at Ngwom instead of going back to their ancestral homes.\n\nLife picks up Ngwom\n\nA visit to Ngwom has indicated that the residents have begun to quickly settle down and adjust to a new life in the community. Petty traders and small scale businessmen have started raising their shops to meet the economic demands of the people.\n\nAbba Ali Shehum, Musa Adams and Bula Ali displayed food items by the roadside.\n\nAbba Ali with his fresh Cassava tubers said he has already sold a 50k bag of the Cassava tubers when our reporter inquired.\n\nMusa Adams has also sold off his sachet water and was planning to travel to Munna Market to replenish his stock, while Bula Ali Kola Nuts is still awaiting buyers.\n\nBoth traders foresee a greater New Ngwom with the construction of the new houses in the community.\n\nThe work behind the new city Ngwom\n\nThe North East Development Commission was established in 2017 to help accelerate the level of development in the region. Due to the Boko Haram insurgency, the commission was also mandated to collaborate with the governors of the region to speed up rehabilitation, recovery, and resettlement of displaced people as well as provide infrastructure and re-build the ones that are destroyed by the insurgents.\n\nThe Managing Director of the North East Development Commission(NEDC), Mr. Mohammed Goni Alkali during the inauguration of 1000 houses built for IDPs at Ngwom village in Mafa Local Government Area of Borno State, said:\n\n\u201cAs you can see, we are today delivering a town at Ngwom as against its earlier village status. Each block sits on 400 Square meters with a perimeter fence and ample space for other home activities.\u201d\n\nApart from the houses, the NEDC also graduated 2018 graduates of ICT who were given starter-packs and N20,000 each as seed money to begin their businesses.\n\nThe Managing Director disclosed that an estimated N2 billion was spent on the 1000 housing projects alongside the establishment of technical and vocational centres around the state.\n\nMr. Alkali said the 1000 mass housing units consist of four blocks of 2-bedroom bungalows with veranda and courtyard in a cluster arrangement, stressing that, \u201ceach block sits on 400 square meters with a perimeter fence and ample space for other home activities. The 1000 housing units are also fitted with solar-powered street lights, four industrial solar-powered boreholes, planted over 3000 economic trees, provision made for school, market, police station and motor-park.\u201d\n\nApart from the handing over of the houses to the community, the MD announced food distribution and another livelihood for the IDPs.\n\n\u201cThe NEDC, with the approval of the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, will also distribute livelihood support to the occupants of the house after thorough needs assessment and training.\n\n\u201cThe livelihood support tool to be distributed comprised 1000 cooking stoves, 200 grinding machines, 200 knitting machines, 200 sewing machines and 200 spaghetti making machines,\u201d the MD explained.\n\nThe Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajiya Sadiya Faruq, stressed the commitment of the Federal Government in the reconstruction of the Northeast and making life better for the traumatised population.\n\nThe minister announced how the government has launched very comprehensive programmes to mitigate poverty, hunger and malnutrition.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari has shown commitment in addressing the issues of food insecurity and malnutrition, by initiating the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy (NPRGS). The Strategy specifically aims to address hunger, malnutrition and poverty through economic growth and social protection programmes.\n\n\u201d Furthermore, the Federal Government is focused on promoting local production, providing loans to farmers and skills acquisition, to enhance socio-economic capacities.\n\n\u201d Additionally, to mitigate food insecurity, malnutrition and other challenges faced by the persons of concern in the north-eastern states, the FMHADMSD through the NEDC is commencing the distribution of food and non-food items to the six states of the region which is part of an overarching goal to improve food security and reduce hunger.\n\n\u201cApart from that there is the handing over the Burn Centre which would cater for victims of burn injuries as a result of bomb attacks; Handing over of 1000 Ngwom Mass Housing units constructed under the Special Presidential Intervention for resettlement of IDPs; Graduating Batch B from the NEDC ICT training scheme in Graphic Design and Small Phone repairs and Groundbreaking of the construction of 300-seater auditorium/centre for the study of violent extremism for prevention.\u201d\n\nThe minister lauded the commitment of NEDC for their commitment to delivering on their mandate. She also praised Zulum and the governors of the Northeast for their support towards the rebuilding process in the region.\n\nZulum said the 1000 housing units were just one among the support the state gets from the commission and the ministry of humanitarian affairs.\n\n\u201cToday we are witnessing another support in the series of interventions from Mr President. And this one will go a long way in bringing succour and development to our people,\u201d Zulum said.",

The vagina was about 9.5 cm long and 8 cm at its widest point, near its vault. It was empty and contained no pus or any foreign material.\u201d\n\nThe report went on to add that \u201cthe mucosal lining displayed the normal and usual transverse ridges and the lining was smooth and clean.

          "text": "\u2022Oil contribution to GDP falls from 13% to 7% in seven years\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nA new report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) has advocated the setting up of a \u201cFuture Energy Fund\u201d that would incorporate elements of the transition to cleaner fuel sources, rather than devoting 30 per cent of profit from oil and gas to the Frontier Exploration Fund (FEF) as provided in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nThe global professional services and consulting firm, in a document which analysed the implications of the PIA, noted that based on the World Economic Forum (WEF) data, a country\u2019s energy transition readiness was measured by six factors. It listed the factors as availability of investment and capital; effective regulation and political commitment; stable institutions and governance; supportive infrastructure and innovative business environment; highly skilled human capital and consumer participation; and robust energy systems structure.\n\nIt stated that Nigeria scored 35 per cent in its energy transition readiness.\n\nThe report, titled, \u201cThe Petroleum Industry Act: Redefining the Nigerian Oil and Gas Landscape,\u201d explained that lack of enabling infrastructure, regulatory framework and governance of energy transition were the major reasons for the low score.\n\nThe new PIA stipulates that a frontier exploration fund shall be maintained for the exploration of unassigned frontier acreages financed by 10 per cent of rents on prospecting licences, 10 per cent rent on mining leases, and 30 per cent of NNPC Limited\u2019s oil and gas profit in production sharing, profit sharing, and risk service contracts.\n\nHowever, PwC, in the document, stated that the country should begin moves to join the global energy transition, stressing that presently, Nigeria\u2019s resources are being devoted almost solely to a fast waning commodity.\n\nPwC stated, \u201cExploration is a high-risk endeavour. In addition, raising the needed finance for the development, production and evacuation from the frontier basins might be a tall order as investors are staying away from high cost emission-intensive assets.\n\n\u201cThese basins will compete for funds with ambitious and more-environment friendly projects like gas, hydrogen, solar and wind. Rather than a frontier exploration fund, Nigeria could consider setting up a future energy fund.\n\n\u201cThe amounts being set aside in the PIA for the frontier exploration fund can be applied towards funding the development of Nigeria\u2019s future energy potential, which will include, but not be limited to, petroleum, in readiness for the energy transition.\n\n\u201cThe fund can also be deployed for funding the development of abatement technologies that can aid carbon neutrality.\u201d T\n\nThe firm, which operates in about 157 countries worldwide, maintained that with the projected decline in global demand for hydrocarbons, leading oil and gas production companies were cutting back significantly on their oil and gas business and on further investment in fossil fuels.\n\nIt recalled that British Petroleum (BP), for example, had announced that it would be suspending oil and gas exploration in new countries from 2021, saying the company aims to make a tenfold increase in its spending on low carbon energy.\n\nIn the case of Shell, based on its new strategy launched in 2021, the report explained that the company aims to decrease its total oil production by one to two per cent per annum and make no new frontier exploration investment by 2025.\n\nAccording to PwC, Shell, which accounts for about 50 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas production, has the broad theme of its strategy for its upstream petroleum business to generate the cash to fund the growth of its low carbon business.\n\nThe report said, \u201cThe PIA by its very essence is hydrocarbon-centred. While the PIA is expected to attract investment into the Nigerian oil and gas sector and serve as a catalyst for the development of the sector, the PIA doesn\u2019t say much on the energy transition and its likely impact on the sector and its outlook.\n\n\u201cIn recent times, clean energy has accounted for the majority of global investments in the energy sector. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) investments in new power generation are expected to account for 70 per cent of $530 billion to be spent on all new generation capacity in 2021.\n\n\u201cIn 2017, the World Bank announced that it would no longer finance upstream oil and gas projects. In exceptional circumstances in the poorest countries where there is a benefit to energy access and this is consistent with the countries commitments.\n\n\u201cThe foregoing puts to question how much investment Nigeria will be able to attract into the oil and gas sector with the signing of the PIA amidst the energy transition.\u201d\n\nIt emphasised that conversations on energy transition had continued to gain ground, accelerated by climate change and the renewed focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues.\n\nThe PwC report added that the European Union (EU), which includes some of the biggest buyers of Nigeria s crude oil, had pledged to cut carbon emissions by at least 55 per cent by 2030, while the UK had also pledged to cut carbon emissions by 78 per cent in 2035.\n\nFurthermore, it pointed out that Canada had pledged to cut carbon emissions by 40-45 per cent by 2030, while in June 2019, the UK became the first major economy to set a legally binding commitment to reach Net Zero emissions by 2050, in addition to countries like Ukraine and China that have unveiled plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2060.\n\nThese, the report noted, put Nigeria among the countries that must redouble national sustainability efforts along all fronts, pointing out that the low scores indicate the need for greater attention to the spectrum of sustainability requirements.\n\nHowever, the report noted that the silver lining of the PIA on the energy transition was that it appeared to focus on gas as the transition fuel for the country and provided improved regulations and incentives for gas investment with tax holidays of up to 10 years and expansion of incentives to cover midstream gas operations.\n\nBut while Section 64 of the Act stipulates that NNPC Limited was to engage in the development of renewable resources in competition with private investors, the firm noted that Nigeria needed to do more in providing the enabling infrastructure, regulatory framework and the right level of investment for the energy transition.\n\nOn the lean sum contributed by the oil industry, the report said despite being a major source of revenue, the oil sector lagged behind other sectors in terms of GDP contribution, which declined to seven per cent in the last seven years.\n\n\u201cThe relative importance of the oil and gas sector in Nigeria appears to be declining, from 13 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s GDP in 2013 to about seven per cent in 2020, while those of other sectors continue to increase,\u201d the report said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Exonerates Babalakin of wrongdoing in vice chancellor\u2019s removal\n\n\u2022Says Ogundipe was given fair hearing before sack by former council\n\n\u2022University accounting system abysmally poor, fraudulent, report reveals\n\nObinna Chima\n\nThe visitation panel set up by Visitor to the University of Lagos (UNILAG), President Muhammed Buhari, following a fierce disagreement between the then Governing Council of the institution and the management finally submitted its report on September 7 to the Federal Government, with an indictment of the Vice Chancellor (VC), Professor Oluwatoyin Ogundipe.\n\nAlthough yet to be officially released, THISDAY was able to obtain a copy of the 241-page report from the Federal Ministry of Education. The report examined the affairs of the university and issues that led to the crisis and concluded that all the allegations made by the then Dr. Wale Babalakin-led Governing Council against Ogundipe were substantiated by the panel, contrary to the position held by the special panel, which was set up then after the removal of the VC.\n\nConstituted on March 29, 2021, the seven-member Presidential Visitation Panel was asked to look into the affairs of the institution between 2016 and 2020, which incidentally fell within the period that the Babalakin-led Governing Council removed Ogundipe as VC, over alleged financial malpractices.\n\nThe VC was alleged to have misappropriated the university\u2019s funds.\n\nBabalakin had explained then regarding Ogundipe\u2019s removal, \u201cWe agreed to have a secret ballot that we have always had when there are contentious issues. The votes were counted, they were not just votes, everybody wrote their own comments and I read it out to everybody.\u201d\n\nBut few months after the removal of the VC, Buhari approved the report of a Special Panel to the university, which had then recommended, among other things, the reinstatement of Ogundipe and also dissolved the Governing Council headed by Babalakin, who had earlier resigned his chairmanship. Following the special panel\u2019s report, Ogundipe was reinstated to his position, which he currently occupies.\n\nHowever, the visitation panel, in its final report, revealed that Ogundipe could not provide any defence for his actions. It alleged that the UNILAG VC was involved in splitting of contracts.\n\nAccording to the panel, \u201cThe explanations given were mere justifications to the breached contract tender processes that resulted in contract splitting, not out of ignorance of the requirements of the rules and regulations that have been substantively enacted.\u201d\n\nThe report highlighted many contracts that were illegally awarded by the Ogundipe-led management. It alleged that in violation of the Procurement Act, the management of UNILAG under Ogundipe regularly diverted, by way of Virement, the sum of N1.800 billion from the university\u2019s recurrent expenditure to fund award of contracts, which were clearly illegal.\n\nThe visitation panel stated, \u201cThe university operates a structured budget processing system. The budget process seems complete except that a bulk allocation of funds was made to each department, and they are each at liberty to allocate amount available as they deem fit. This is totally inconsistent with the structured process and needs to be revisited.\n\n\u201cThe format of the periodic budget performance report presented to the Governing Council has major deficiencies. It lacks the critical aspect of good management information, performance review criteria and presentation. There is no section for the statement of financial positions that could have disclosed the fixed asset and all financial assets and liabilities of the university.\n\n\u201cIt is half-baked reporting template used over the years for the quarterly financial reporting, however, it might not have been intentionally generated with the view towards hiding useful financial information from the Governing Council and the management of the university.\n\n\u201cWe also noticed some inconsistency between the figures of the approved budget and that of the budget performance report. It points to the fact that subordinates are not being supervised as required. With a staff strength of 120, such errors should not be continuous and mistakes are not expected from the Bursary Department.\n\n\u201cThe budget performance reports concentrated on the monetary aspect of operations and also failed to determine the variance between the budget and the actual performance of each critical areas of the university, which include direct teaching, research and human resource development.\u201d\n\nAccording to the panel findings, even the monthly donation of N500,000 to the Law Faculty by Babalakin for the purchase of law reports was diverted by the university management or the Faculty of Law by paying the sum into an unofficial account. This enabled the indicted officers to spend the money in a manner not authorised by the donor, it stated.\n\nThe visitation panel came to the conclusion that the Bursary of the University was characterised by concealment, fraud, misappropriation, misrepresentation, and incompetence.\n\nFurthermore, the report revealed that the management under Ogundipe concealed the accounts of the university for over three years from the Governing Council, which under Section 7 of the University of Lagos Act, was statutorily conferred with the power of superintendence of the accounts of the university.\n\nIt said it was the insistence of the Governing Council to know the accounts of the university that led to the commissioning of the Professor Omolehinwa Committee, which unravelled the true state of affairs of the university.\n\n\u201cThe decision arose from the findings of the Chairman of Council that the budget estimates submitted to the National Assembly and the one presented to the Finance and General-Purpose Committee was at variance and irreconcilable,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe report also revealed that there were 29 income-generating units in the university, but for several years only 10 of these companies were reported in the books of UNILAG. The others were concealed and whatever these companies generated were not accounted for.\n\nThe panel also found that the books of the university were so poorly prepared and full of non-disclosures that it did not represent the true state of affairs of the university.\n\nThe panel report revealed that the bursar was not able to produce the ledger of the university for the entire duration of the panel sitting, even though they had requested same from the bursar at several times.\n\nSimilarly, the bursar was not even able to produce an approved budget for 2020, implying that all the expenditure made for the said 2020 were extra-budgetary payments.\n\nIn addition, the visitation panel said, \u201cThe Bursar was found to be very incompetent and did not demonstrate any capacity to handle the portfolio. The Vice Chancellor and the Bursar regularly diverted money of the university as shown in the consistent diversion of about N1.8 billion from recurrent expenditure to capital expenditure without approval.\n\n\u201cVirements of a total sum of N1, 858,458,137 were consistently made from recurrent votes to finance capital projects during the period under review. This is a major breach in budgetary control and has been consistent year to year.\n\n\u201cThe practice is totally out of place in the budgetary system of financing operations, it results in killing activities that could have qualitative benefits in favour of capital projects that were not initially budgeted and consequently culminating in the sinking of scarce resources over a long period of time with low financial returns.\u201d\n\nThe visitation panel in their findings noted that management did not play its conventional role of scrutinising the operation of the accounts of the university, alleging that the internal audit only functioned at the will of Ogundipe.\n\nIt said, \u201cThe internal audit section exists in the University of Lagos but does not seem to be functionally effective. There are summary reports on findings of the Internal Audit Department for the years 2016 to 2020 addressed to the Vice-Chancellor. The reports covered almost every section of the university.\n\n\u201cBased on our review of the External Auditors\u2019 Management reports and our direct interactions with the Head of the Internal Audit: the internal audit does not cover final accounts; implementation of the internal audit recommendations is at the discretion of the Vice Chancellor; purview is limited to post transaction audit work on procurement, payment and payroll.\n\n\u201cCorrections are unilaterally done by internal audit without reverting to the originating unit; internal audit report to the Provost of the College of Medicine and Vice-Chancellor; there is no proof that the Audit Department has access to accounting software; and no evidence of existence of audit plan for year 2016.\u201d\n\nThe visitation panel also found the internal auditors of the company incompetent.\n\nThe Babalakin-led council had appointed a seasoned accountant, Olutola Senbore and Co., to examine the books of the university. The Governing Council adopted the Senbore report but the university\u2019s management refrained from utilising the report.\n\nIn this regard, the visitation panel advised that an international accounting firm should be appointed to straighten-out the books of the university.\n\nThe panel exonerated the Babalakin-led Governing Council of wrong doing in the removal of Ogundipe, and stated that the Council of the University properly indicted the VC and the principles of fair hearing were adhered to during his indictment.\n\nThe visitation panel also found that the removal of Ogundipe by the then council was consistent with the University Act, stating that the interpretation placed on the statutes by Babalakin is plausible. Even the management led by Ogundpe was aware that the interpretation was convincing and sought an amendment of the law, the panel noted.\n\nIt added, \u201cThe current wording of S3(8) seems to suggest that it is Council that determines or could determine the identity of the two senate members of the Joint Committee of Council and Senate. There is arguably an imprecision of language which does not augur well for good governance.\u201d\n\nThe visitation panel further stated that it did not know the rationale for the conclusion of the Federal Ministry of Education that the appointment of an acting Vice Chancellor by the Babalakin-led Council was wrong.\n\nThe panel said it was at a loss as to how anyone could have come to the conclusion that Ogundipe was not given fair hearing or that the Babalakin-led Council breached any provisions of the law.\n\nIn the words of the panel, \u201cThis panel has not seen the report of the previous panel and, therefore, does not know the basis for the conclusion that \u2018the process adopted by the Council in the appointment of Professor Omololu Soyombo as Acting Vice Chancellor of the university was inconsistent with the provisions of law relating to the appointment of the Acting Vice- Chancellor.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022State government takes a swipe at opposition\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nContrary to insinuations doing the rounds, the Presidency, yesterday, declared that the visit by President Muhammadu Buhari to Imo State was a pleasant experience as he was overwhelmed by the reception accorded him by South East leaders during his official visit to the heartland of the east last week.\n\nThe presidency, therefore, clarified a statement credited to the President in Owerri, the Imo State capital, where he was quoted to have told Governor Hope Uzodimma that \u201cI\u2019ll be careful with your future invitations.\u201d\n\nThe statement has since generated controversy in the state as the opposition had interpreted the statement to mean that the president was not satisfied with the visit.\n\nTo that extent, the state government has said the opposition in the state would continue to fail in their desperate bid to undermine the government of Senator Hope Uzodimma and by extension, that of Buhari.\n\nPresident Buhari was in Owerri on a one-day working visit last Thursday during which he commissioned some projects and met with stakeholders, including Ndigbo leaders in the South East zone.\n\nThe Presidency, in a statement titled: \u201cWhat President Buhari said (didn\u2019t say) in Imo State\u201d issued by the Media Adviser to the President, Femi Adesina, maintained that President Buhari\u2019s working visit to the state was successful.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cWe have observed that President Buhari\u2019s concluding remarks at the meeting with South East Leaders during his one day visit to Imo State is being deliberately contorted and twisted out of context.\n\n\u201cThe purveyors of disinformation want Nigerians to believe that the President bluntly told Governor Uzodinma, \u2018I\u2019ll be careful with your future invitations.\u2019 They have adduced different meanings to the phrase, contrary to the context wherein the President spoke during his successful dialogue with leaders of thought from Igboland.\n\n\u201cWhen he arrived at the banquet hall of Imo State Government House for his last assignment in Owerri, the President was welcomed by over 50 leaders from the South East, who had waited patiently for him for a Town Hall engagement, after commissioning strategic projects in the State.\n\n\u201cThe President began his extempore speech by acknowledging the caliber of personalities present at the dialogue, including the President-General of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Prof George Obiozor; former Chief of General Staff, Commodore Ebitu Ukiwe (Rtd); former Senate President, Ken Nnamani; former Military Governor in old Imo State, Senator Ike Nwachukwu; the Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Alfred Achebe; Chairman of the South East Governors Forum and Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi; Deputy Governors of Abia, Anambra and the SSG of Enugu State, who represented the Governor, the Anglican Archbishop of Owerri Province, Most Rev David Onouha and his brother Bishop of Enugu, Archbishop Emmanuel Chukwuma; and Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, Ahaejiagamba Ndigbo, just to mention but a few.\n\n\u201cAn elated President Buhari made it clear that he was expressly overwhelmed by the reception and galaxy of personalities that travelled from the five South Eastern States to have a heart-to-heart discussion with him in Owerri, the Imo State capital.\n\n\u201cHis words were clear: \u2018I am overwhelmed by this reception, overwhelmed in the sense that when I accepted the invitation by the Imo State Governor, who wants to justify investments the government has done to the people of Imo State, I thought I would see the bridges, the roads and a few renovations.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me he was going to get the whole Igbo leadership here. So, in the future when he invites me, I\u2019ll know what to do. But I think he has done what the military didn\u2019t like. He has achieved surprise. He has surprised me beyond description.\n\n\u201cLater, in his concluding statement at the same event, the President made reference to his earlier remarks on the \u2018surprise\u2019 action pulled by the Governor. On a lighter note, he quipped: \u2018Governor of Imo State, I cannot thank you enough, but I will be careful with your future invitations.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s historic visit to Imo State was very successful and the Igbo leaders, who met him shared the same enthusiasm that his coming to the Eastern heartland would bring peace, foster unity, encourage good and better understanding among the citizenry,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nThe statement further noted that, \u201cArchbishop David Onuoha, who is the Anglican Archbishop of Owerri Ecclesiastical Province, must have summed up the mood in the words of the prayer offered at the event: Thank You, dear Lord for our nation Nigeria and her people with diverse backgrounds, nationalities and cultures. Surely, you did not make any mistakes in bringing us together.\n\n\u201cYour purpose is for us to harness our potentials/strength to build a strong and virile nation. May this purpose never be defeated. Glory be unto You for bringing Your servant and our dear President, His Excellency Muhammadu Buhari, safely to this state. Blessed be Your name for his life and the giant strides he is taking for the wellbeing of our nation. Thank you for the huge infrastructural development that is taking place in various parts of the country.\n\n\u201cLord, Nigeria is a great nation with numerous challenges. We pray that you endue our President with heavenly wisdom, grace and strength. In his resolve to serve this nation, he will not fail, fall or falter. He will end his tenure strong and well to the glory and honour of your name and the good of our people.\n\n\u201cMay his visit today bring peace, foster unity, encourage good and better understanding among the citizens of this great nation; may it bring prosperity and restoration.\u2019\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the Imo State government, in a statement by Oguwike Nwachuku, Chief Press Secretary and Media Adviser to Governor, said the miniscule opposition in the state has been looking for a way to discredit the visit and embarrass Mr. President.\n\n\u201cIn their desperation, they doctored and proceeded to post on social media platforms, a misleading video on President Buhari\u2019s remarks during his Town Hall Meeting with highly respected Igbo leaders, who were in audience at the exclusive meeting, in total disregard for the good intention of Mr. President\u2019s remarks,\u201d the statement noted.\n\nSharing the view of the opposition, the statement added: \u201cBecause the opposition in Imo State are too bitter with hate to notice even the smallest of humours, nobody would have been surprised if they also lost their sense of understanding when President Buhari went humorous in his remarks.\n\n\u201cLet me explain to them what Mr. President meant in the language they will understand if at all they would be ready to learn. Pronto, President Buhari in appreciating Governor Uzodimma and the good people of Imo State for the superlative host would want to be as prepared as the Governor and the State next time he is visiting so as not to be \u2018surprised\u2019 again.\n\n\u201cOnly those who do not mean well for Imo State will travel this lane that the opposition chose to travel to tweak Mr. President\u2019s comment they know is absolute lie. Governor Uzodimma has done what no Igbo Governor, dead or living has been able to do with a sitting President\u2019s invitation.\n\n\u201cI thought the opposition in Imo should be grateful for this rare feat, swallow their pride and commend him rather than destroying what is left of opposition politics. The earlier they realise that what they are doing is not about Governor Uzodimma the better for them.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

There is federal character, but not that parties must zone positions for presidency during election,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYes, somebody is saying the east has not had a president. I agree and I sympathise. But the constitution says you can only become president through the ballot box.\n\n\u201cWe have been saying it during elections that every vote must count.

          "title": "Meet the startup transforming informal recycling in Nigeria",
          "text": "Being the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria faces a number of urban challenges and uncollected trash is high on the list. Waste collection methods driven by local authorities remain inadequate, particularly in rural areas. Furthermore, most Nigerians are not inclined to collect and dispose of their waste properly.\n\nIn Lagos, for instance, where trash volume grows by 15,000 tons daily, only 40% of waste generated is collected and just 13% is recycled each year. The rest \u2013 including materials that could feed the local recycling industry \u2013 litters the streets and clogs open drains.\n\nOver the past few years, trash-for-cash initiatives have emerged in Nigeria, looking to tackle the widespread waste problems by incentivising Nigerians while supplying recycling plants with much-needed materials for processing. One such is Scrapays, founded by Boluwatife Arewa, Tope Sulaimon, and Olumide Ogunleye, all graduates of the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA).\n\n\u201cIt all started as a project when Tope, Olumide, and I were still undergraduates at FUTA,\u201d Arewa told TechCabal. \u201cAs geoscience students, we understood the environmental impact of waste and thought up a solution. It was called Panti (Yoruba term for waste) initially and during our final year in school, we got into a national program.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe undergraduate project evolved and became Scrapays, a startup using technology to facilitate a decentralised ecosystem for recovering recyclable waste in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe company has changed but the ideology remains the same; we see waste as a commodity or even better, currency,\u201d Arewa said.\n\nHow does Scrapays work?\n\nScrapays\u2019 decentralised model fuses technology, finance, and recycling. It serves two broad sets of users \u2013 waste producers and recycling businesses.\n\nWaste producers are categorized as individuals, SMEs, and enterprises that churn out recyclable waste daily and accumulate them for lengthy periods before requesting for pickup through Scrapays\u2019 online or offline channels; including the USSD shortcode (*347*477#), mobile app, and website.\n\nOn the business side are mobile collectors \u2013 typically young, low-income Nigerians \u2013 that fulfill on-demand recovery requests from waste producers within an area. The group, mostly composed of existing informal waste pickers but open to interested individuals, are equipped with portable IoT-enabled scales, customised carts (which they get upon registration and pay for over a nine-month period), and a designated app.\n\nAfter a waste producer requests a pick-up, the nearest Scrapays collector receives and accepts the request via the app. At the point of collection, sorted waste items are weighed using the digital scales, which communicate the weight (in kilogram) and monetary value on the mobile app.\n\nThe Scrapays workflow. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\nThen there are agents who provide temporary storage facilities for recyclable materials retrieved by collectors. Scrapays allows existing or new businesses and individuals to sign up as agents and make money off their empty spaces for every kilogram of material stored on it. Arewa refers to this model as \u201cAirBnB for recyclables.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like Uber made driving a profession or side hustle for some, even though you weren\u2019t a driver before, Scrapays provides a platform for people currently in recycling businesses or want to go into the business,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBoth collectors and agents manage their operations through our designated apps, with features like Wallet transfer, collector and agent mapping, account funding, and more.\u201d\n\nFrom the agents\u2019 facilities, logistics partners transport the recyclable waste categories collected to a centralised processing space and sell them off to several local companies that convert the material into finished products. Some manufacturers make tissue paper from waste paper; others use plastics to make fiber for the clothing and textile market; and a few companies recycle glass, metal, copper, and aluminum.\n\nThe financial reward of recycling waste\n\nUsing a wallet-based system, Scrapays operates a revenue-sharing model that allows all stakeholders in the value chain \u2013 from producers to all its partners \u2013 to earn commission per kilogram recovered.\n\nWaste producers get paid directly in mobile wallets and funds can be redeemed in cash or directly transferred to the individual\u2019s account. They can also be used to buy airtime or make purchases on Scrapays\u2019 partner marts.\n\nFor every kilogram of recovered recyclables, collectors get paid a 19% commission. The commission rate for agents is set at 11% for every kg of waste received and verified.\n\nThe newly launched Scrapays USSD version 2.0. Image Credit: Supplied\n\nFormalising recycling in Nigeria\n\nIn Nigeria, the bulk of recyclable waste collection and processing is carried out by informal waste pickers and processors, with unregistered SMEs dominating the billion-dollar recycling sector.\n\nScrapays\u2019 platform helps these informal players manage their funds and operations; improve the waste material collection process by minimising human interference; and mitigate typical losses involved in the supply chain.\n\n\u201cIn Lagos alone, over two million of these businesses exist,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we do is provide them with the infrastructure and tools to help them control recyclable material recovery while creating sustainable self-managed businesses from it.\u201d\n\nThe web platform also has a list feature, which serves as an online marketplace for industrial listing and trade of recyclables (plastic, metal, lead, copper, aluminum, paper) and \u201cout of use\u201d machinery, cars, trucks, and equipment.\n\nA collector with the customised Scrapays cart. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\n\u201cThe informal guys account for 99% of whatever is recovered and recycled. Their model is what works, they reach the nook and cranny of the country and do recycling effectively. Why not create a system around that and make it scalable?\u201d Arewa said. \u201cOur platform has simply formalised and created a structure around informal recycling.\u201d\n\nScaling the solution\n\nScrapays has been in operation for about ten months, after an initial test period of six months. It currently has 3,000 registered waste producers (households and enterprises) across Lagos and Ogun State, and has recovered about 270,000 kilograms of recyclable materials.\n\nThe startup\u2019s operations have been financed through an internal convertible fund from an angel investor, loans, and founders\u2019 capital. But Arewa has grander plans for the startup, which will require raising significant capital over the next couple of years.\n\nScrapays aims to be in not less than 22 cities in Nigeria over the next 18 months; 10 countries in Africa in 24 months; and five countries in Southeast Asia in 36 months.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re solving isn\u2019t just a Nigerian or African challenge. The same problem is faced in Southeast Asia and Latin America. The per capita municipal solid waste (MSW) generation in the ASEAN region is one of the highest in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAt scale, our solution cuts across every developing nation and we\u2019re building in a way that it can be implemented everywhere.\u201d\n\nArewa is also looking to promote a recycling culture among Nigerians, which would significantly increase the amount of waste collected, as the current volume recovered falls short of the demand for recyclables. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re not able to meet the demand for recyclables, which is why expanding the collection network and producer sensitisation are extremely important over the next few months.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s population is estimated to double by 2050; that\u2019s most likely to result in more solid waste hanging around and more items for recycling. As Scrapays\u2019 collectors move around streets fulfilling pick-up requests, the startup\u2019s low-tech, high-impact solution is addressing health, poverty, and urban resilience issues in Africa\u2019s largest country, one city at a time.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Why Nigeria\u2019s vehicle financing culture is struggling to take flight",
          "text": "Owning a personal vehicle is of economic importance. Next to housing, transportation is often the second largest expenditure for the majority of urban households anywhere in the world. But insufficient purchasing power among middle-class Nigerians coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing puts cars out of reach for over 90% of the population.\n\nIn developed economies, car loans and vehicle financing schemes help people spread out vehicle payments over several months or even years. However, the auto financing space is still very nascent in Nigeria, with available car loans significantly costly and inaccessible.\n\nTwo major factors that influence the access and affordability of vehicle financing in Nigeria are interest rates and the value of the vehicle being financed, according to Gbenro Dara.\n\nOver the past decade, Dara has led four online marketplaces with significant interests in the automotive sector and also pioneered an automated process for used car loans as CEO of Cheki (which was recently acquired by Autochek).\n\nExpensive interest rates\n\nA number of banks and startups currently provide car loans but they aren\u2019t exactly cheap, and accessing them can be difficult due to prohibitive credit criteria and high-interest rates. According to Dara, the latter factor is the biggest drawback when it comes to vehicle financing in Nigeria. \u201cThe interest rates available in the auto financing market is the main challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nFor car loans, banks in Nigeria lend at rates between 18% to 30% per annum compared to an average interest rate of less than 5% available for a 72-month vehicle financing scheme in the United States.\n\nGetting a loan from commercial banks in Nigeria also comes with a lot of paperwork and processes, making their approval rate very low, at about 20%.\n\nMicrofinance banks, on the other hand, are less strict with requirements, as opposed to larger banks which are more focused on mid-to-large corporate clients. Several microlenders have developed vehicle financing programs, which take the asset as collateral. However, they are still not able to offer car loans at significantly lower interest rates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken out a vehicle loan for 4% per month for a 2-year tenor, and ended up paying almost two times the amount of the invoice value of the vehicle,\u201d Dara said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not entirely the fault of the banks as they derive their interest rates from the prime lending rate of the Central bank of Nigeria.\u201d He however called on banks to do better by innovating more for the growth of the automotive sector in Nigeria.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe tokunbo problem\n\nThe vehicle market in Nigeria remains heavily dominated by imported second-hand cars (popularly referred to as tokunbo), primarily due to the inability of most Nigerians to afford brand new cars, including those assembled locally. According to Dara, the predominance of used vehicles discourages banks from providing car loans.\n\nThere are approximately 15 million vehicles on Nigerian roads with most of them older than 20 years. The average age of private cars in major cities in the country is 14 years, most of which are likely to have been resold to more than five owners. For light commercial vehicles such as danfos and molues, the average age is estimated at 24 years.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, total new vehicle registrations annually in Nigeria are estimated at 400,000 (excluding motorcycles), but only 5% of which are brand new vehicles. The rest are mostly shipped in from North America, Europe, and Dubai.\n\nThese vehicles, which have often suffered accidents, been repossessed, are out of warranty, and with little or no history about prior usage and service, are referred to as \u201cgrey imports\u201d. That is, they are traded outside authorised channels and since they\u2019re not purchased from official manufacturers or accredited dealers, do not come with the service support of the producer.\n\nTo minimise the risks associated with providing credit for imported second-hand vehicles, most banks that finance used cars do so through partnerships with car dealers, and not directly. For example, Tokunbocars.ng is backed by Guaranty Trust Bank, UBA, Zenith, and Sterling Bank.\n\nA drag on the local auto industry\n\nThe lack of proper vehicle financing schemes in the country not only deprives the average Nigerian of a chance of getting a personal vehicle but also has implications on the local automotive industry.\n\nDespite being the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria\u2019s new passenger vehicle sales are far behind sales in countries such as South Africa, Egypt, and Morocco.\n\nGlobally, about 80 to 95% of purchases of cars are done through loans and leasing by government or private entities. In the United States, it is estimated that 85% of all new car purchases are financed.\n\nWithout such financing mechanisms available to buy cars in Nigeria, locally-made brand new vehicles are out of the financial reach of most Nigerians, the majority of whom have seen their purchasing power dwindle over the years.\n\nIn 2020, less than 10,000 brand new cars were sold in Nigeria, compared to over 247,000 in South Africa. According to unofficial figures from auto dealers cited by Dara, up to 80% of the purchases in Nigeria were made by the government and large corporations, mostly with bank credit and at non-retail rates.\n\nBeyond the direct impact on how Nigerians commute, the current state of vehicle financing in Nigeria leaves the country\u2019s auto industry facing challenges that stall its growth potential.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

A writedown of MTN\u2019s Afghanistan business without any proceeds from disposal is estimated to cost about R700 million ($49 million) according to undisclosed sources familiar with the negotiations.\n\nThis move is in line with MTN\u2019s announcement just over a year ago to exit countries in the Middle East over the next three to five years, in order to focus on African markets.

I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "Nigerian states have grown increasingly dependent on the Federal Government for revenue since the economic crisis of 1979\u20131980, not minding it contradicted true fiscal federalism.\n\nThat is however only one part of the problem, the more contentious issue is that the revenue allocation system in Nigeria can neither be said to be efficient nor equitable.\n\nStates that contribute the bulk of revenue to the central pool do not get the largest share of revenue under the current sharing system.\n\nLagos, Nigeria\u2019s wealthiest state and economic capital, for instance, is said to contribute 55 percent of Value Added Taxes (VAT), a major contributor to the consolidated revenue fund in the country.\n\nIn 2020, Nigeria generated N1.53 trillion in VAT, about 10 percent of the country\u2019s entire revenue that year.\n\nWith import VAT contributing 51 percent, local VAT in the period was N763 billion. If Lagos state\u2019s 55 percent contribution is factored into local VAT, then it implies the state contributed about N400 billion to the VAT pool last year.\n\nYet, the state\u2019s total federal allocation, which includes VAT, was only N115.93 billion.

This is because some companies with sales across the country will no longer pay all their VAT to Lagos.\n\nTo deliver equity for all states, an economist who spoke with BusinessDay recommends that the taxes are shared based on origination. For instance, sharia states who do not allow consumption of alcohol should not get any share of alcohol taxes while the states where it is allowed keep all the value added taxes that accrue from alcohol consumption.\n\nIf the contentious issue of equity is resolved, the states may be more open to weigh lessons from India, which tried to decentralise VAT but was forced back to the drawing board after the move backfired.\n\nDespite the stiff resistance by the FIRS, which collects taxes on behalf of the Federal Government, the states, particularly Rivers and Lagos, are however not stopping at wanting to collect VAT.\n\nThe battle ground is shifting to the collection of stamp duties after the 36 states instituted legal action against the Federal Government over its continued collection of stamp duties in the country.\n\nThe states in a suit filed last month at the Supreme Court are claiming that the right to collect stamp duties on financial transactions between persons or individuals in a state is the exclusive right of the states; hence the apex court should intervene and restrain the Federal Government from further collection of the money.\n\nThey are asking for a refund of N176 billion as stamp duties collected between 2015 and 2020.\n\n\u201cIt is great to see the states finally pushing for true fiscal federalism,\u201d a development economist told BusinessDay.\n\nStates, it is argued, need some financial autonomy if they are to contribute to national development and reduce their decades-old dependence on federal handouts.\n\n\u201cIt also forces the states that contribute little to the federal purse but are very dependent on federal allocations to raise their game,\u201d the development economist, who did not want to be named, said.",

Hon. Comr.

          "text": "Black marketers in Nigeria\u2019s Southeast are making brisk business selling premium motor spirit (PMS), popularly called fuel, for as much as N500 and N600 per litre as scarcity of the product persist in the zone.\n\nThis even as few independent marketers that have products sell between N220 to N250 per litre.\n\nSoutheast residents woke up last week to notice that fuel stations were not selling products, while few that sold had raised their prices to between N200 and N250 per litre, a situation that has persisted for about a week.\n\nThe scarcity, Business Hallmark learnt, was caused by an industrial action by the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN). The association, since last week, shut down the supply of petroleum products in the zone over an issue between one of its members and the Imo State government.\n\nThis started when the Imo State Government, under former governor, Rochas Okorocha, in it\u2019s urban renewal and expansion programme, embarked on the demolition of some properties to allow for expansion of major roads. One of the properties destroyed was a fuel station and the proprietor approached the courts claiming damages against the Imo State Government.\n\nThe fuel marketer is reported to have won the case he instituted with N100 million compensation ordered to be paid to him. He awaited the ordered compensation from Government which was not forthcoming, Sam Hart, aide to Abia State governor, Okezie Ikpeazu narrated on Sunday.\n\nIPMAN Imo State, consequently intervened on behalf of their Member and sought to have Government resolve the issue. Events were not to their satisfaction and in solidarity with their Member, they decided to stop selling fuel in Imo State.\n\nSubsequently, tanker drivers who supply fuel to Imo State and neighbouring areas also joined in the solidarity protest leading to tankers queuing up in border communities in Imo State awaiting resolution of the impasse before they can resume supplies.\n\nSecurity Agencies waded in and appealed to the Marketers to call off the protest as tankers, laden with fuel, massed at entrances to the State, were a Security risk. The security Chiefs promised to meet with the Governor to have the issue resolved.\n\nIn the midst of the impasse, the Imo State Government was reported to have directed it\u2019s citizens to go to neighbouring states to buy fuel until the Marketers in Imo State have a rethink.\n\nThis directive, according to Mr. Hart, did not go down well with the Members of IPMAN in neighbouring states who in-turn, suspended sale of petroleum products in solidarity with their brethren in Imo State.\n\nThe NNPC Deport supplying the South East have equally stopped supplies to avert crisis.",

          "title": "COVID-19 Third Wave: Anxiety as Nigeria loses eight persons in 24 hours",
          "text": "No fewer than eight people have died in the last 24 hours as the third wave of the COVID-19 continues to take its toll on the country.\n\nMinister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire disclosed this at Monday\u2019s briefing of the Presidential Steering Committee PSC on COVID-19.\n\nHe said; \u201cAs of today, we have recorded a total of 199, 151 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 365 in the past 24hours, from 2,941,438 samples tested so far.\n\n\u201cWe have also sadly altogether lost 2,598 persons, 8 in the past 24hrs, and a case fatality rate of 1.3%, a slight increase over the 1.2% of a few weeks ago.\n\n\u201cThe dreaded 3rd wave of COVID-19 may appear to be leveling out, because there has been no catastrophic increases in infections and fatalities, but it is not wise to assume that the threat is gone, especially as cases are fluctuating and have to be identified by genomic sequencing.\n\n\u201cEvidence so far, however, is that the Delta strain is already the dominant in Nigeria. We must keep our protective measures in place and increase testing to determine our situation\u201d, he added.\n\nAccording to him, there are reports of new coronavirus mutations circulating in other countries, a development he said Nigeria shall monitor with all tools available to her to ensure appropriate response.\n\n\u201cWe also remain on alert at Points of Entry, including land and sea borders, to confront importation of Covid-19. Several cases have been indeed been identified by Rapid Diagnostic test and taken care of accordingly.\n\n\u201cRegarding vaccines, all States have received doses of AstraZeneca, Moderna and J&J vaccines for the ongoing 2nd phase of the vaccination exercise in all States. The Federal Government has done due diligence to ensure vaccine quality and safety.\n\n\u201cThe government has secured nearly 40 million doses of J&J vaccines to be arriving at a rate that NPHCDA will set, to align with their utilization strategy. We shall also surely receive donor doses, so that we do not expect to be impacted by the expected shortfall\u201d, he added.\n\nSecretary to the Government of the Federation SGF and Chairman of the PSC, Mr Boss Mustapha on his part appealed to striking resident doctors to sheathe their swords.\n\nHe said Nigeria now has AstraZeneca, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson vaccines that the country expect\u2019s Pfizer to be delivered very soon.\n\n\u201cThere will be enough vaccines to go round soon. By the second quarter of 2022, we would have received about 52 million doses of the vaccines.\n\n\u201cTo ease travels for fully vaccinated Nigerians, we are exploring the principles of reciprocity between Nigeria and other nations. For the time being, Nigerians are advised to always carry their vaccination card details or barcode on their electronic devices for easy access especially for those travelling outside the country.\n\n\u201cThe Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Aviation will continue to dialogue with the representatives of the UAE to resolve the issue of the Emirates flights between Nigeria and the UAE. The protection of the interest of Nigerians remains our primary focus. The Hon. Minister of Aviation will elaborate on this.\n\n\u201cCompliance with protocols laid down for quarantine to ensure control remains a source of worry to the PSC. The need to review the protocol has become expedient to align with existing global protocols and realities. On this note, the PSC will adopt a sustainable model and policy that will be unveiled soon. To begin with, India has been removed from the list of flagged countries in view of improved situation in that country.\n\n\u201cOn the heels of Mr. President\u2019s intervention in the health sector, I want to use this opportunity to appeal to our Health Workers to consider the health situation in our country and call off their strike while Government continues to look into all matters that will improve the system, processes and welfare\u201d, he stated.\n\nExecutive Secretary of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, Dr Faisal Shuaib said as of 12th September 2021, a total of 4,052,756 eligible persons have received their 1st dose of COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cThis is made up of 2,645,020 persons with the first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine and 1,407,736 eligible persons with first dose of Moderna vaccine. A total of 1,692,315 eligible persons are fully vaccinated and we currently have a national average of 70.4% utilization of the 2,000,040 doses of Moderna vaccines we received.\n\n\u201cWith the increasing number of cases of COVID-19 globally, we are beginning to see countries instituting vaccine mandates. Some countries have begun asking workers to either present a proof of vaccination or provide weekly COVID-19 PCR negative results in order to be allowed into public offices. In order to end this pandemic, we must achieve enough level of population immunity, that the virus essentially becomes a nuisance and no longer a threat. The only way to achieve this is if eligible persons come out for vaccination and observe the non-pharmaceutical interventions.\n\n\u201cIn my last press briefing, I addressed the questions raised around the UK insisting on Nigerians who have been fully vaccinated to isolate upon arrival in the UK. As earlier mentioned, in Nigeria we also require fully vaccinated UK citizens to isolate for seven days despite being fully vaccinated. In diplomatic circles, this is often referred to as the principle of reciprocity.\n\n\u201cNigeria alongside countries like France and the Netherlands are categorized as amber countries by the UK Government based on criteria such as the number of populations immunized and incidence rates of COVID-19 infection. Individuals from Countries listed as amber countries are required by the UK Government to take a COVID-19 test upon arrival and be quarantined for a few days. Regardless of a vaccine type or vaccination status, if a Nigerian with a Nigerian passport travels to a Country on their green list and spends 14 days there before going to the UK, they would not be quarantined in the UK because they are coming from a green listed country.\n\n\u201cLikewise, if a German or Australian that is currently from their green listed country travels to a country like France, Ghana or Italy which is on their amber list like Nigeria, and such an individual spends 14 days or more in these countries before departing to the UK, such an individual would be made to do a COVID-19 test and quarantined, regardless of their vaccination status. Just like Nigeria, every Country has its own COVID-19 travel rules, protocols and guidelines for travellers coming from other Countries\u201d.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "By Abujah Racheal\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says 46 new deaths linked to suspected cholera cases were recorded in the country in the past one week.\n\nThe NCDC said this via its officially verified website on Tuesday morning, stating that the situation report was published based on data sent in by the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory, for the respective reporting week.\n\nIt stated that eight states accounted for the new cholera fatalities.\n\nThe public health agency, in its epidemiological report for Aug. 30 to Sept. 5, said a total of 2,323 people had so far died as a result of suspected cholera infections in 25 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), since the beginning of 2021.\n\nIt stated that 1,677 cholera infections were recorded in 12 states within the period of one-week , bringing the total suspected cases to 69,925 as at Sept. 5.\n\n\u201cIn the reporting week, 12 states reported 1,677 suspected cases \u2013 Bauchi (566), Katsina (282), Sokoto (258), Yobe (183), Borno (179), Niger (94), Kaduna (66), Adamawa (34), Gombe (8), Kano (4), Kebbi (2), and Nasarawa (1),\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cThere was a 58% decrease in the number of new suspected cases in week 35 (1,667) compared with week 34 (3,992).\n\n\u201cOf the cases reported, there were 46 deaths from Borno (13), Sokoto (12), Katsina (8), Bauchi (6), Niger (3), Kaduna (2), Adamawa (1) and Kano (1) states with a weekly case fatality ratio (CFR) of 2.7%.\n\n\u201cTwenty-five states and the FCT have reported suspected cholera cases in 2021. These are Adamawa, Bauchi, Bayelsa, Benue, Borno, Cross River, Delta, Ekiti, Enugu, FCT, Gombe, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Kogi, Kwara, Nasarawa, Niger, Osun, Plateau, Sokoto, Taraba, Yobe, and Zamfara.\n\n\u201cAs at Sept. 5, 2021, a total of 69,925 suspected cases, including 2,323 deaths (CFR 3.3%) have been reported from 25 states and FCT in 2021.\n\n\u201cTwo new states (Osun and Ekiti) reported cases, though with dates of onset in weeks prior to week 35,\u201d it explained.\n\nThe NCDC added that the national multi-sectoral EOC activated at level 02 continued to coordinate the national response.\n\nCholera is a waterborne disease with a high risk of transmission where there are poor sanitation and disruption of clean water supply.\n\nThe wrong disposal of refuse and practices, such as open defecation, endanger the safety of water used for drinking and for personal use, thereby leading to the spread of water-borne diseases such as cholera, and without proper WASH, Nigeria remained at risk of cholera cases and deaths.",

          "text": "On Monday, Twitter claimed its conversations with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration to resolve a lingering issue about the reinstatement of its services in Nigeria were respectful and fruitful.\n\n\u201cDiscussions with the Nigerian government have been respectful and productive \u2013 we look forward to seeing the service restored very soon,\u201d a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement to Peoples Gazette on Monday evening. \u201cWe continue to engage with the Nigerian government to discuss why Twitter has been blocked and ways to resolve the matter. We are committed to charting a path forward to the restoration of Twitter for everyone in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe remark came a day after the contentious ban reached its 100-day mark, with rights campaigners fearing that the dictatorship was not in a hurry to reverse its decision and enable Nigerians to exercise their constitutional rights.\n\nIn an announcement made by communications minister Lai Mohammed on June 4, telecom companies were urged to prohibit access to the microblogging network with effect from June 4. The move was initially criticized on Twitter as repressive and out of step with modern times. Other Western diplomatic missions, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Sweden, expressed their displeasure with the decision and demanded its immediate reversal.\n\nMr Buhari, on the other hand, dug in his heels, with several of his political aides alleging that Twitter made a significant error when it deleted the president\u2019s comments, which appeared to incite for violence against Nigeria\u2019s ethnic Igbo inhabitants.\n\nOfficials from the administration also stated that before Twitter\u2019s services could be restored, the company must register in Nigeria, a demand that Twitter sources warned The Gazette would be difficult to meet.\n\nThe government formed a panel of ministers in July, including Mr Mohammed and Attorney-General Abubakar Malami, to deal with Twitter on the issue. Some of the officials went to the United States, but they didn\u2019t say how successful they were.\n\nMr Mohammed stated at one point that Twitter had agreed to register as a business and create offices in Nigeria, but in an email to The Gazette, a Twitter spokeswoman quickly disputed the minister\u2019s assertion.\n\nThe remarks once again cast Mr Mohammed in the role of propagandist, with Nigerians claiming that he made the bogus declaration to buy more time for the government or to maintain a positive public image in the event that the ban was reluctantly withdrawn.\n\nTwitter and other social media outlets should not be permitted to police what Nigerians can do online, according to pro-regime bloggers, and should certainly not be policing the president\u2019s postings, which they regarded as harmless and even reconciliatory toward the Igbos.",

          "text": "Scores of armed bandits fleeing the ongoing military operation in Zamfara and Katsina states weekend met their waterloo in the hands of soldiers at Maganda village, near Allawa in Shiroro local government area of Niger state.\n\nThe bandits were said to be escaping through the notorious Allawa forest in their hundreds before they were caught up at the military camp stationed at Alawa, and engaged the soldiers in a gun battle for several hours.\n\nAt the end of the gun battle, one soldier was said to be missing while scores of the bandits were neutralised with several others escaping into the forest with bullet injuries.\n\nIt was learnt that those who escaped with serious bullet wounds were still being trailed by the soldiers as the entire forest was being combed in search of the criminals.\n\nBlueprint gathered that six machine guns and a number of AK 47 riffles and bags of ammunition were recovered from the bandits.\n\nA resident of Allawa community, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity said, \u201cMost of the bandits killed all looked like foreigners as they have no resemblance of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cIn fact, from the dead bodies that we saw, they are not Nigerians, these are foreigners, all of them are carrying long hairs like women.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have resemblance of Nigerians and they don\u2019t know the terrain. This was why they ran into the soldiers because they did not know that there is military camp there.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that though one soldier was killed by the bandits, the soldiers recorded a huge success by killing several of them.\n\n\u201cAs I speak with you, the bodies of the bandits killed are still littered in the bush. This is one of the major breakthroughs recorded by the military in its war against armed bandits in the state in recent time,\u201d the source said.\n\nIt was learnt that the same military camp was April this year attacked by bandits during which it was razed, and later reactivated by the military authorities.\n\nZango Kataf\n\nAnd from Kaduna state, a pastor of ECWA Church Kibori-Asha Awuce in Zangon Kataf local government area of the state, Rev. Silas Yakubu Ali, was reportedly murdered by unknown assailants between Saturday and Sunday.\n\nHis corpse was said to have been discovered Sunday by a search party at Kibori after he left home Saturday.\n\nA statement by the Kaduna state government Sunday said Governor Nasir el-Rufai condoled with the family of the slain cleric and ECWA Church over the gruesome murder.\n\nIn the statement, Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan said the governor also urged security agencies to apprehend the perpetrators of the act to book, while appealing for calm among residents.\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies have reported to the Kaduna state government the killing of Reverend Silas Yakubu Ali, Pastor of ECWA Church, Kibori-Asha Awuce, in Zangon Kataf LGA, by unknown assailants.\n\n\u201cThe report stated that Reverend Ali departed for Kafanchan on Saturday, and was not heard until his corpse was found by a search party early on Sunday at Kibori community, near Asha-Awuce, where he was apparently attacked and macheted to death.\n\n\u201cThe Governor of Kaduna state, Malam Nasir el-Rufai expressed deep sadness at the report of the killing, which he described as horrifying and cruel. The Governor offered prayers for the repose of the soul of the cleric.\n\n\u201cGoing further, Governor el-Rufai sent his condolences to the family of Reverend Silas Yakubu Ali, and to the ECWA Church in Kibori-Asha Awuce, as he prayed for God to grant them fortitude and comfort over this sudden and painful loss.\n\n\u201cThe Governor urged security agencies to intensify efforts towards apprehending the perpetrators of the heinous killing, while appealing to members of the community to maintain calm. Security agencies are conducting investigations in the general area,\u201d Aruwan said.\n\nSchool resumption\n\nAnd ahead of school resumption in Kaduna, Monday, the state government has directed administrators and proprietors of public and private conventional and Islamiyya schools to establish security committee to ensure safety of students.\n\nCommissioner for Education, Dr Shehu Usman Mohammed, gave the directive in a statement issued Sunday in Kaduna.\n\nHe urged the schools, including learning centres such as Islamiya and Madrasas to set up school-based security committees for the safeguarding and protection of the students and pupils.\n\nThe state government tasked the school managements to inculcate safe school learning initiatives as directed by the Federal Ministry of Education, adding that members of the school security committee are to ensure proper monitoring of security apparatuses in place and prompt security alertness.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry appreciated the support of all stakeholders in the education sector, security agencies, parents and guardians and the media, and calls on them not to relent in ensuring a safer learning environment for all learners at all levels in the state.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry also expresses its profound gratitude to the general public for their resilience, understanding and continuous support during this trying period.\n\n\u201cWhilst 1st phase of the resumption is already in school writing exams, the Ministry of Education is directing all principals to make arrangements to receive JSS1, JSS2, SS1 and SS2 boarding students on Sunday, September 12th, 2021 and day students on Monday September 13th, 2021 for a period of 14 weeks for the term.\n\n\u201cPrimary 1-6 are to resume on September 27th, 2021 for a period of 12 weeks for the term,\u201d he said\n\nBenue border attack\n\nIn a related development, gunmen suspected to be bandits attacked a border community between Benue and Taraba states, killing one person and abducting many.\n\nThe gunmen, it was gathered, stormed the community and forced residents to flee to Koffai Ahmadu in Takum local government area for safety.\n\nConfirming the incident, the council chairman, Mr Shoban Tikari, said security had been beefed up in the neighbouring communities to avert further breakdown of law and order.\n\n\u201cOne person was killed in the attack and I recovered the corpse and many others were also said to have been kidnapped. Where the bandits invaded, residents there all ran to Koffai Ahmadu for safety, but they were people from Benue state.\n\n\u201cPeople were also alleging that houses were burnt, but I can also confirm to you that no house was set ablaze as I went to the scene.\n\n\u201cActually, what really happened is that people are referring to Koffai Ahmadu as the centre for the hostilities, but precisely where it took place was at the border between Taraba and Benue states.\n\n\u201cWe have put security in place to restore normalcy in the border communities, especially the operation whirl stroke (whose members) are now camping close to the affected community to avert any further breakdown of law and order,\u201d he added.\n\nOn efforts made to identify the culprits, the council boss added that no arrest had been made by security agencies so far.\n\nThe incident was yet to be confirmed by the state Police command as at the time of this report.\n\nAbuja\n\nMeanwhile, a group of kidnappers is demanding N50 million ransom as precondition for releasing the three persons abducted eight days ago in Pegi Resettlement Area, Kuje in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja.\n\nThe kidnappers had stormed the hilltop area of Zone A of the quiet community, scaled the fence, breached the security lock of the home of Pastor Gabriel Oladapo and kidnapped his wife and two teenage daughters.\n\nBut eight days after, the abductors contacted a distressed Pastor Oladapo, demanding a N50 million ransom and gave a payment deadline.\n\nThey threatened to be hard on one of the victims if the deadline was not met and also deal with the cleric.\n\nThose in the kidnappers\u2019 den are 45-year-old Mrs Bukola Oladapo, 17-year-old Glory Oladapo and 14-year-old Moyo Oladapo.\n\nGlory, the senior daughter and student of Government Secondary School, Pegi, Abuja, was to write her Senior Secondary School Certificate examinations before her kidnap.\n\nSo far, Glory has missed three papers including the English language examination which holds today (Monday).\n\nThough, for obvious reasons, Pastor Oladapo could not be reached for his reaction, the chairman of Pegi Community Development Association (PCDA), Mr Taiwo Addribigbe, lamented incessant incidences of kidnapping in the Resettlement Area, stressing that efforts of security agencies were inadequate to arrest the menace.\n\n\u201cThe residents of this community are poor Nigerians, who, for lack of means to secure decent accommodation elsewhere, came here to sort out their lives, but are living in perpetual fear because of kidnappers.\n\n\u201cIt is quite worrisome that Pegi Community is being targeted for repeated incidences of kidnapping. Ever more worrisome is the fact the security agencies are not doing much to deter the kidnappers.\n\n\u201cIt beats one\u2019s imagination that the kidnap incidences ravaging Pegi is yet to be crushed by our professional security personnel,\u201d he said adding that perhaps had Pegi been the abode of the rich and powerful the kidnap incidences would long have been contained.\n\nHe appealed to the FCT Police Command, the Nigerian Navy, the civil defence corps and the FCT minister to come to the rescue of the community by stepping up its presence in the area.",

          "text": "Smarting from the flu of herders, farmers\u2019 clashes and sundry security challenges, the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) Sunday demanded for power rotation among the North, South and Middle Belt regions to assuage the people\u2019s concerns.\n\nThe umbrella body encompassing the states within the Middle Belt region of the country took the stand at the end of a two-day National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting held in Akwanga, Nasarawa state, Thursday-Friday, September 9-10, 2021.\n\nThe Forum also passed a vote of confidence on the Bitrus-led National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 issued by MBF National President Dr Pogu Bitrus and made available to Blueprint in Abuja, the Forum described as unfair the current power arrangement between the North and the South that failed to recognise the Middle Belt geopolitical block.\n\nThey stated that, \u201cAfter extensive deliberations by the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) National Executive Committee (NEC) on a wide range of issues affecting the Middle Belt Region and the nation at large, it was resolved as follows:\n\n\u201cThat, Nigeria has been plunged into a critical situation of insecurity occasioned by the activities of Boko Haram terrorists, armed Fulani militia, kidnappers/bandits and other related criminal elements. This spate of insecurity has pushed the nation to the precipice. NEC calls on the Federal Government to take urgent steps to arrest the situation and save the nation from another civil war.\n\n\u201cThat, the incessant invasions by Fulani militia on several communities across the Middle Belt Region in particular, and other parts of the country in general, have assumed genocide/ethnic cleansing scale. These attacks have left in their wake mind-boggling massacres and devastations in our communities and displacement of indigenous Peoples to various Internally Displaced Person (IDP) camps.\n\n\u201cNEC calls on the Federal Government to take urgent steps to return displaced communities to their ancestral lands, given the fact that territory can no longer be acquired in the 21st century by the use of force. NEC also calls on the government to identify all IDPs in the Middle Belt Region and provide relief materials for them.\n\n\u201cNEC calls on the Federal Government to identify apprehend and bring the perpetrators of these heinous crimes against humanity to justice so as to serve as a deterrent to others. Consequently, NEC calls on the government to set up an agency to be called the Middle Belt Development Commission (MBDC) to serve as an intervention agency in addressing the challenges caused by the activities of these terrorists\n\n\u201cThat many schools and places of worship in the Middle Belt Region have remained closed due to the criminal activities of these Fulani kidnappers and bandits. NEC regrets that many school children and other hapless citizens are still languishing in the dens of kidnappers. NEC further appeals to the government to take urgent steps to rescue those in captivity.\n\n\u201cThe MBF insists that the Federal Government must come clean and yield to the demand by the Nigerian public to unveil the identities of the sponsors of Boko Haram, especially the 400 Bureau de change operators as identified by the UAE authorities.\n\n\u201cNEC finds worrisome, given the report by the UN that the Federal government is secretly engaged in negotiations tagged \u2018Sulhu\u2019 with Boko Haram terrorists through which the Federal Government is allegedly offering monetary rewards to insurgents and other criminals.\n\n\u201cConsequently, NEC is totally opposed to this project and also opposed to any form of amnesty to insurgents and other terror groups who have their hands dripping with blood. NEC is also vehemently opposed to any planned recruitment of these so called repentant terrorists into the national security architecture.\n\n\u201cSince democracy is about the wishes and aspirations of the people, NEC calls on both the National Assembly and the Presidency to reconsider their position on electronic transmission of election results and yield to the wishes of the Nigerian people who are demanding 100 percent implementation of electronic transmission of electoral results in order to ensure credibility and transparency in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cNEC commends the Southern Governors and some Governors in the Middle Belt and their State Assemblies for their courage in passing Anti-Open Grazing Laws in their states. NEC condemns in very strong terms the call by Miyetti Allah on its members not to obey the Anti-Open Grazing Laws duly passed in their states, threatening to make states that attempt to implement such a law ungovernable. NEC views this as a clear threat to National Security, and demands that Miyetti Allah officials should be arrested, investigated and prosecuted under our anti-terrorism laws.\n\n\u201cNEC reviews the zoning arrangement as it relates to the Presidency in Nigeria and considers the current arrangement of power rotation between the North and the South as unfair as it has failed to recognize the Middle Belt geopolitical block.\n\n\u201cNEC, therefore, calls on the political actors in Nigeria particularly political parties to henceforth reflect the zoning arrangements for power to rotate between North, South and the Middle Belt.\n\n\u201cNEC acknowledges and commends Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state for his resilient stance in the defence of the rights of the Benue people and for his courage and foresight in making the anti-open grazing law even in the face of threats by Miyetti Allah and those other forces,\u201d it said.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 further said: \u201cBy the same token, NEC commends Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State for his consistent struggle for the Rule of Law and true Federalism, particularly the recent judgment of the Federal High Court on the Value Added Tax (VAT) which has opened the door for the commencement of the struggle for Restructuring of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWhile noting with concerns the attack by suspected Fulani herders, \u201cNEC resolves that people of the Middle Belt Region should rise up and defend themselves in the face of governments abandoning their Constitutional responsibility of defending them or seeming complicity. \u201cFurthermore, NEC resolves that an attack on any of our communities is henceforth, considered as an attack on all Communities in the Middle Belt Region with the attendant responses and consequences.\u201d",

Hon. Aminu Bello Masari, please forgive and forget those utterances because we are law-abiding citizens of this country. Miyetti Allah cattle Hore is a registered and law-abiding association.\n\n\u201cThe National Chairman of Miyetti Allah Hore is coming to Katsina personally with his Executives to plead with His Excellency to forgive and forget those negative utterances for us to continue to forge ahead, to continue to make some progress.\n\n\u201cWe cannot complete this press briefing without noticing some contribution made by His Excellency. Already you are aware that there\u2019s a standing committee for the relationship between herders and farmers in Katsina State, which is making a very comprehensive and very successful negotiation with the farmers where we have some cattle routes being encroached, and already they have been demarcated by the standing committee with the support of Katsina State Government.\n\nIn a nutshell, we are here to say that the utterances made by our national secretary are not good.\n\nAt least by the age of His Excellency and the position he is occupying, he deserves some respect so that the successes we have been recording, from the inception of this administration will continue to thrive.\n\nRecalled Alhassan Saleh recently granted an interview to Sahara Reporters to elicit his reactions on a recent interview Governor Masari granted to Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today\u2019 programme where the Governor stated that many of the bandits terrorizing the North are from Fulani extraction involved in cattle rearing,\n\nIn his response, Saleh painted the Katsina Governor in derogatory terms for daring to label the Fulani as being primarily responsible for banditry in the North.\n\nThe National Secretary, while urging Nigerians to ignore Masari\u2019s statement, throwing caution into the air, described Governor Masari as a confused drunkard.\n\n\u201cDid you take that drunkard serious? My governor, do you take him seriously? Can\u2019t you see that he is already tired? Records should come from security operatives, not confused human beings.\n\n\u201cAll of them talking, they are stealing security votes, they should find solutions, create ranches for these herders and accommodate them.\n\n\u201cWhich people do you find along the Sahel Sahara desert? They are many tribes, is it by a physique that you now identify a Fulani man? The bandits are criminals, why should you attach a tribe to it? That\u2019s why we are not happy. You don\u2019t need to attach a tribe because it will affect an innocent person.\n\n\u201cForget that man, that man is the worst Governor Katsina has had; we are just praying for his time to lapse.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Katsina State chapter Chairman of Miyetti Allah, Alh. Hassan Kuraye said that the National Secretary has since regretted his actions.",
