          "title": "How poor generation, metering gap, financial crisis shackled power sector in 2021",
          "text": "\u2022Generation stunted at 50% capacity\n\n\u20224,200 mega watts stranded\n\n\u2022Increase tariff, remove non-performing DisCos \u2014 Don\n\n\u2022No improvement, no tariff hike \u2014 Consumer group\n\nBy Obas Esiedesa, Abuja\n\nFor electricity consumers in Nigeria, 2021 was not a particularly good year, as poor generation, lack of meters and other infrastructure deficiencies ensured that homes and businesses remained largely without public power supply most part of the year.\n\nAccording data released by the Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) power generation in 2021 averaged 4,094.09 mega watts as at September, despite having available generation capacity of about 8,000MW.\n\nREAD ALSO:Police lose 3 officer\u2019s to fatal motor accident in Abuja\n\nWhile poor transmission and distribution infrastructures were largely blamed for limiting generation, gas supply difficulties remained the biggest hurdle for gas powered plants.\n\nIn May 2021, low pressure on the Escravos-Lagos Pipeline System, ELPS, left several power plants without gas supply leaving about 4,200 mega watts of power stranded.\n\nThe 439Km ELPS which was commissioned in 1989 is owned and operated by the Nigerian Gas Company, a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC. It was built to connect Egbin Power plant with the abundance of gas at Escravos in the Niger Delta.\n\nLow gas supply from gas producers left the ELPS with little gas leaving power plants at Sapele, Ihovbor in Benin, Omoku, Omotosho and Egbin without supply.\n\n6.7 milion customers unmetered\n\nThe NERC data also showed that 6.68 million customers were still without electricity meters as at September 2021. The Federal Government had at the beginning of 2021 began the implementation of the National Mass Metering Progrmamme that was expected to provide one million meters to consumers.\n\nNERC in a public notice in November 2021 disclosed that over 900,000 meters had been distributed. The Commission however raised the cost of meters under the Meter Asset Programme (MAP).\n\nThe cost of a single phase meter was raised from N44,896.17 to N58,661.69 while the three phase meter was also raised from N82,855.19 to N109,684.36.\n\nSpeaking on the performance of the sector, the National President of Electricity Consumers Association of Nigeria, Barrister Chijioke James, rated the industry below average.\n\nJames pointed out that there has not been any remarkable change from what the sector was in the past several years.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe performance has been below average and below expectation. This is because there has not been any remarkable improvement in the power sector.\n\n\u201cThe investment made in the power sector ought to have shown some remarkable improvement since when the sector was unbundled and we had the distribution companies created from the oil NEPA. The expectations were high that with the metering system been ramped up that power supply would improve.\n\n\u201cThere may be minor improvement but it is not sufficient and it is below our expectation. We had expected something better than what we have now\u201d, he added.\n\nMr. James noted that majority of consumers were still without meters, leaving them with estimated bills and at the mercy of electricity distribution companies.\n\n\u201cI am in the village now and you cannot talk about metering. Majority of consumers are largely unmetered. I just came into Aba and majority of the consumers are without meters. Even in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital, large number of consumers is without meters.\n\n\u201cYes the level meter penetration is higher in Abuja than most parts of the country but you still have consumers without meters. You can say that in Abuja there is improvement but that cannot be said of other parts of the country\u201d, he added.\n\nHe urged the Federal Government to do more to ensure that more customers are provided with meters, saying \u201cthat is the only way they can control their consumption and the amount they have to pay for electricity\u201d.\n\nHe stated that electricity tariff increase cannot be justified until services improved, pointing out that the last service based tariff increase was not followed by the DisCos.\n\nEligible Customer controversy\n\nThe Eligible Customer regulation was released by the Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission, NERC, in November 2017, following a declaration by then Minister of Power, Babatunde Fashola.\n\nThe regulation allowed power generation companies (GenCos) to sell electricity directly to customers with capacity to consume at least two Mega Watts of power monthly.\n\nSince then, GenCos and large customers had entered into contracts using the provisions contained in the regulation. But in a controversial turn around, NERC ordered the suspension of the contracts in July 2021 following pressure from DisCos.\n\nThe DisCos argued that the policy was depriving them of revenue since the large consumers were moving to buy power directly from the GenCos.\n\nSpeaking to Vanguard on the policy, the Executive Secretary of the Association of Power Generation Companies (APGC), Dr. Joy Ogaji said the Eligible Customer policy was win-win situation for the operators, consumers and the economy.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cEligibility introduced competition on the demand side and completed the liberalization of NESI and improved efficiency. It brought greater pressure for efficiency on the suppliers too\u201d.\n\nShe pointed out that the \u201cpresence of retailers, or the mere possibility of future competition, would force existing distributors to establish appropriate customer services and commercial divisions.\n\n\u201cIt will promote national economic development through supplying electricity to the productive sector of the economy and support economies of scale through bulk purchase of electricity\u201d.\n\nWhile admitting that the sector has not lived up to the expectations of the consumers, she added that \u201csadly, over 8-years post-privatisation, the sector continues to grapple with several low hanging fruits impeding the objectives of the privatisation exercise\u201d.\n\nDr. Ogaji noted that the market situation was not only crippling the GenCos but also the economy \u201cas it is halting their desire to recover or expand capacity.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry requires major intervention if the gains of the Power Sector Reforms are to be realised. The liquidity crisis is not the problem, but a key symptom of the problem and can be solved. If we get the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry right; we will get the Nigerian Economy right\u201d, she added.\n\nImpact on Economy\n\nAccording to a report by the Power Sector Recovery Programme of the World Bank, Nigeria has the largest number of people without electricity in the world with every one in ten people without electricity globally now residing in the country.\n\nAnother report by the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency (SMEDAN), stated that SMEs were the most vulnerable to losses from lack of power supply with majority of them receiving between just one to five hours of electricity daily.\n\nThe agency added that power cost component of manufacturers overhead represented about 36 percent of the total production cost.\n\n\u201cIn the last 5 years, SMEs have contributed about 48 percent to GDP. However, this would have grown by over 50 percent if there was constant power supply. Bridging the stranded power gap could save the closure of 2,877 Micro enterprises with the capacity of employing an average of 28,770 Nigerians\u201d, it added.\n\nExpert views\n\nAlso speaking to Vanguard, the Director, Centre for Petroleum, Energy Economics and Law, University of Ibadan, Prof. Adeola Adenikinju, noted that the sector performance was a big disappointment as Nigerians had expected much more.\n\nProf. Adinikinju said the sector was expected to provide strong support for economic growth and for SMEs and households across the country who were working very hard to overcome the challenges of poverty and Covid-19.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the investments that have been made, the power sector has continued to be a challenge to development. In terms of generation, the performance was not significantly different from what was generated in 2019, if you take out the Covid year 2020.\n\n\u201cIn transmission, yes, there was a lot of investment but the old challenges are still there. In distribution, the situation got worse with millions of Nigerians without electricity.\n\n\u201cThe power sector is one sector that the government needs to urgently find a way solving the problems facing it because it will go a long way to achieve sustained development of the economy\u201d, he stated.\n\nHe expressed concerned over poor power generation in the country, adding: \u201cI have been closely involved in the sector for many years now. In 2005 when we were doing the power sector development plan for Nigeria, we projected that by 2020 we will be looking at 40,000MW but unfortunately we are still talking about 4,000MW.\n\n\u201c4,000MW is not enough to power a very big city in a developed country but that is what we have for a whole country and by the time you take out the losses both in terms of transmission and distribution what we actually consume is far less than that.\n\n\u201cIt is a big shame because we have gas in the country that could help us generate much more\u201d, he stated.\n\nOn metering, Prof. Adenikinju observed that the DisCos were reluctant to deploy meters because they use estimated billing system to boost their revenues.\n\nIncrease tariff, remove non-performing DisCos\n\nProf Adenikinju who advocated for market driven tariff, noted that it was one of the ways to attract investment and improve services for consumers.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe government has to do something about the tariff. When you pay more and the sector becomes liquid and attractive, then you can get out the DisCos that are not performing by getting other investors to buy into them\u201d.\n\nHe pointed out that the indices that make up the tariff have all gone up, explaining that \u201cexchange rate, price of gas, inflation rate are way higher than what it used to be. Definitely without apologies we have to do something about the tariff.\n\n\u201cWhen we do that and there is liquidity in the system and if they don\u2019t then deliver we can start taking action against them or can hold them to some agreement. The government can also sell some of its shares to other investors\u201d.\n\nHe added that low tariff can only provide low quality of service and \u201cthat is what we are getting. Let us have the tariff at a level that is economically good for the operators or commercially viable and then we can demand for quality. Although they are not mutually exclusive, we can do both, but it has to be balanced\u201d.",

          "text": "\u2026A peek at Bridge Academies\u2019 impact in Nigeria\n\nBridge pupils in the classroom\n\nNot everyone is born with a silver spoon. Some are not even born with a wooden spoon, let alone a silver or gold spoon.\n\nThose who are privileged to come from rich or middleclass families oftentimes have access to the basic amenities of life and have their needs provided without any level of struggle. On the other hand, a child that is born into a poor or struggling home environment, finds him or herself faced with tough setbacks and challenges.\n\nFor these children, their hope for a brighter future begins with access to quality education. A network of nursery and primary schools in underserved communities in Lagos and Osun state, Bridge Nigeria provides life changing education and offers the platform that puts children on a pathway to future success, irrespective of their socio-economic background.\n\nTo overcome the unique challenges faced by the Nigerian school children, Bridge uses a teaching and learning approach that involves age-appropriate learning, by adapting to a child\u2019s level of understanding, identifying the readiness of a child to learn, and then following the best-suited method of teaching. Consequently, this personable approach has led many pupils from low-income families to earn grades that mark highly even on a national standard.\n\nAs a matter of fact, some brilliant Bridge pupils from less privileged backgrounds have scored top marks that have led to further educational opportunities. These include scoring near-perfect scores at the National Common Entrance Examination, and receiving scholarships to aspirational secondary schools.\n\nA visit to a typical Bridge community shows children who are faced with unique but related difficulties and whose lives are being transformed by the education at Bridge, giving them hope to look beyond their prevailing socio-economic circumstances and dream of a better and brighter future.\n\nBridge pupil, Pwaakadi Sebastian, joined Bridge Rahimi Oyo Academy in Morogbo Badagry, after relocating to Lagos from Borno, in the north east part of the country. Unfortunately for Pwaakadi and her sister, Divine, their education was affected due to the insurgency, and so, they were out of school. A church member, Mrs. Veronica Okwolo, whose children attend the same school, introduced Pwaakadi\u2019s parents to Bridge and enrolled them at the school, having witnessed the transformational education provided by the school to her children. According to Mrs Okwolo, the Pwaakadi and Divine\u2019s potential was wasting away and she had to support the family in her own little way before it became too late. She recounted how her daughter who is now in secondary school lacked self confidence and needed support before she joined Bridge and how she saw immediate impact within a year of enrolling her at Bridge.\n\nAccording to the parent, Mr Sebastian, \u201cPwaakadi could not communicate effectively in English before she came to Lagos, even though she understands it. Now, her numeracy and literacy skills have really improved, she reads all by herself and does her homework herself. All thanks to Bridge teaching techniques.\u201d He said.\n\nAnother pupil, Bernice Daniel, a seven-year old primary 2 pupil whose mother is a petty trader had the opportunity to enrol Bernice at a Bridge Awelewa school in Obadore Akesan with the help of a church member after seeing her with the mother selling during a Bridge organised outreach programme. Now, Bernice is in school learning and hopes to become a doctor in future. Her mother had always wanted her children to be part of the life changing opportunity that bridge offers to the community and can never be grateful enough for the opportunity given to her daughter. The once timid Bernice is now one of the top performers in her class, she oozes confidence and looks forward to going to school everyday and learning with her friends. With the team of qualified teachers and a supportive Bridge academy at her disposal, Bernice has been placed on the pathway of achieving her dreams and changing the narrative of her family.\n\nBridge provides all round support to the 46 Bridge nursery and primary schools located across Lagos and Osun state through a full-fledged support office team. Examples of the support range from the curriculum development and instructional design through learning innovation and interventions by the Academics team, to the oversight management of all the Bridge academies by the School team to drive learning outcomes while the Learning and Development team provides coaching support and continuous training for teachers to develop new skills to aid effective teaching and learning.\n\nBridge Nigeria\u2019s support team\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Operations team ensures that there are learning materials in the classrooms and pupils are learning in a conducive environment, the IT team also ensures the wireless technology being utilised at Bridge continues to deliver great results. For instance, the Bridge teacher guides don\u2019t just display lessons, they also record attendance and assessment scores and track lesson pacing and pupil comprehension in near real time. While the smartphone application allows Academy Managers to seamlessly sync their academy\u2019s tablets, pupil and teacher attendance, tuition payments, instructional monitoring, and more.\n\nQuality education helps individuals transcend their limitations. Opportunities that they never imagined before would now become possible. It is through education that one can withstand the rigour of facing the challenges of life. As a result of the accelerated learning at Bridge, these children can now aspire to become doctors, engineers, scientists etc and look beyond their socio economic limitations. And this is only possible because of the life changing education at Bridge.",

Indeed Dr. Jonathan briefed President Buhari on the matter recently.\n\nProf. Osinbajo was accompanied by the Minister of State Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Zubairu Dada.\n\nThe junta led by Col. Assimi Goita initially had agreed to hold a new election in late February, 18 months after it first seized power.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately known whether the West African leaders gathering in Ghana\u2019s capital would further toughen existing sanctions against Mali\u2019s coup leadership. The bloc already has put in place travel bans and a freeze on financial assets of all members of the transitional authority and their families.\n\nIn his remarks Sunday, Burkinabe President Roch Marc Christian Kabore said the proposed extension of the junta\u2019s time in power \u201cis of concern to the entire West African region\u201d.",

          "title": "2023 presidency: Anxiety over Jonathan\u2019s rumoured interest",
          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nThe rumoured plot to draft former President Goodluck Jonathan into the 2023 presidential race by the All Progressives Congress (APC) is causing disquiet and panic in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nIn recent times, there have been reports of alleged moves by some leaders of the APC to convince the former president to throw his hat into the ring for the 2023 presidential election on the party\u2019s its platform.\n\nLast week, Jonathan campaign posters surfaced on some social media platforms, but his media aide, Ikechukwu Eze, dismissed the posters.\n\nEze described Jonathan\u2019s alleged presidential bid on APC platform as rumour, saying it had no basis.\n\nHowever, Daily Sun learnt at the weekend that, despite the PDP\u2019s dismissal of the alleged romance between Jonathan and APC as a \u2018non-issue,\u2019 some leaders of the opposition party are actually worried about the development. Some members loyal to Jonathan have also vowed not to move with the former president to the APC if the rumour tuned out to be true, even as they threaten to revolt against him. Some others fear it would amount to losing one of its big fish to the APC.\n\nA senior party source said though the bid to draft Jonathan into the APC was still seen by many as being in the realm of speculations, members were worried losing him to the APC.\n\n\u201cSome of us are worried of its implications for the PDP, if it turns out to be true. We are worried. But the man has said it is not true. But when you hear these sort of talks, you cannot but be worried. We are watching.\u201d\n\nAlso, a former member of the PDP National Working Committee ( NWC), who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak on the matter, dismissed talks of Jonathan contesting on APC platform in 2023.\n\nHe, however, said the party would not \u201cmiss the former president, in the event that talks about his romance with the APC are true.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe said: \u201cBecause president Jonathan, since he left office, has not been participating actively in the affairs of the PDP. But for us in PDP, if he goes there, we will revolt against him. We will not go with him. That is truth. The thing is that Jonathan has never been an active participant in the PDP since he lost election in 2015. For us, Jonathan has never been an active member of the PDP. Whatever decision he takes, it is at his peril. He has not provided any purposeful leadership for the PDP since 2015.\u201d\n\nA former member of the PDP Board of Trustees (BoT) and former Minister of Transport, Chief Ebenezer Babatope, advised Jonathan not to contemplate going to the APC.\n\nBabatope told Daily Sun, at the weekend, that Jonathan would be diminished if he contests in 2023 on APC platform.\n\n\u201cI hope he does not tarnish his good image by going to contest. He is not a member of APC. He is a former president of the country on the platform of the PDP. And to now go and contest as an APC man will send wrong signals entirely. But I want to advice him because he is an adult, he should think it deeply and come to very reasonable conclusion. I want to advice him, because it is something that will bring him down within seconds,\u201dhe said.\n\nWhen contacted, PDP National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said talks about Jonathan\u2019s alleged romance with the APC is a publicity stunt by the ruling party to divert attention from its internal crises.\n\nOlogbunagba said the APC was not bothered about the news, as it was concerned about rallying Nigerians to rescue the country in 2023.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing for us to comment on. It is rumour in the public domain. However, we want to believe that it is part of the stunt of the APC to shift attention from their own confusion within their system.\n\n\u201cWe are not bothered about that.

          "text": "By Kenneth Udeh\n\nResidents of Bende Local Government Area in Abia North were, at the weekend, thrilled with excitement following the commissioning of newly completed roads and a civic centre by the Senate Chief Whip, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, and the facilitator, Benjamin Kalu.\n\nThe roads commissioned include a 1 km road Amaogbu, Agbonmiri, Ndi Okorie Ukwu road, the Okpororenyi Nkalunta road and the Agbamunzu town hall, all situated in Bende town, Bende federal constituency.\n\nAmidst fanfare, Bende people rallied in their large numbers to celebrate and witness the commissioning exercise.\n\nAccording to records, this was the first time in history that the communities will have their roads tarred and well constructed since their existence.\n\nPrior to their construction, the roads were in a deplorable condition, causing untold hardship to the community dwellers. A community stakeholder, the President General Bende, Loveday Kalu, recalled how motorists and road users found it difficult to navigate the roads, most especially during the rainy season.\n\nOverwhelmed with excitement, Loveday expressed his gratitude on behalf of the community to both Senator Kalu and Benjamin Kalu describing their representation at the National Assembly as exceptional stating that Bende Federal constituency never had it this good.\n\nAnother resident in the community, Chinasa Okorie, added that Benjamin Kalu is an answered prayer to the yearnings of Bende, emphasising that the House of Representatives spokesman has proven beyond reasonable doubt that he went to the National Assembly with the interest of the people at heart.\n\nHe extolled both Senator Kalu and Benjamin Kalu for working harmoniously to come to their aid to see that the roads were constructed for their economic benefit.\n\nSpeaking during the commissioning, facilitator of the projects, Benjamin Kalu appreciated the Senate chief whip who also hails from Bende Local Government Area, for his role as a father and mentor through his sojourn in politics.\n\nThe spokesperson of the 9th House of Representatives disclosed that he achieved the completion of the projects as a result of heeding to the advice of Senator Kalu, to hit the ground running from the very first day he assumed office, immediately after he won his election.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe said: \u201cSenator Kalu remains my leader and mentor in politics, what I am doing today is the result of what he taught me in politics and I don\u2019t fail to declare it publicly that he is my leader and big brother. He taught me that I should start working from the first day that I assume office immediately after the conclusion of the election and I was glad that I listened to him. He told me not to delay, not even for one week or a month. It is on that basis that I invited him to commission these projects himself, Since Senator Kalu is the man who taught me the systematics of constructing roads for our community, I invited him to cut the tape himself.\u201d\n\nAccompanied by the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer Nigerian Film Corporation, Chidia Maduekwe, Federal Commissioner, Public Complaints Commission, Maduka Ukaegbu, the chief whip of the Senate, in his address commended Benjamin Kalu for a job well done.\n\nKalu expressed that Benjamin Kalu has performed excellently in delivering the dividends of democracy to the people of Bende, saying he is pleased with him.\n\n\u201cBen Kalu is my representative whom I\u2019m very pleased with, because he has performed excellently well. The beauty of democracy is continuous improvement and Benjamin Kalu has proven that he is a forthright man who loves his people the same way I love them and I told him he must work like me.\n\n\u201cWhen I was governor, I provided infrastructures of this kind but we had minimal funds. Now, we have a president that completes the budget cycle. I served as governor for eight years but never saw a governor who completes the budget cycle, but President Muhammadu Buhari has always completed the budget cycle from 2019 to 2021 by 100 percent.\n\nSpeaking further, Kalu said the various ongoing and completed projects in Bende and Abia North at large was a payback to the people for voting massively for President Buhari and APC during the 2019 general election.\n\nKalu pointed out that Abia North was the zone in the entire South East and South South that President Buhari won convincingly.\n\nHe reiterated that the zone remains the stronghold of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), saying himself and members representing Bende and Isuikwuato/Umuneochi constituency belong to the same party enjoy distinct closeness to the presidency as result of the massive support the party enjoys in the zone.\n\nKalu also urged the people to shun their negative attitude towards President Buhari, saying the president loves the Igbo.\n\nEarlier in his remark, Benjamin Kalu said the ultra modern civic centre was constructed by himself and a fellow kinsman, Chief Acho for the people to have a place to hold events, meetings and other similar official and social gatherings.",

          "text": "*Zulum always offers logistics support without prompting, Says GOC\n\nChuks Okocha, Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja and Michael Olugbode in Maiduguri\n\nA former vice president and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has decried the continued killings in the northwest zone, particularly the recent attack in Zamfara State, which left over 200 dead, and therefore appealed to the federal government to ramp up security in the zone to stem further waste of lives.\n\nIn the same vein, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq, has also described the recent killings in Zamfara by bandits as nothing short of horrific.\n\nAlso in a related development, the acting General Officer Commanding 7 Division of the Nigerian Army, Major General Abdulwahab Eyitayo, has hinted that the Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, always offered logistics and other supports to the Nigerian Army in the ongoing war against Boko Haram insurgents without being asked by the military authorities.\n\nOver 500 fleeing bandits on motorcycles had reportedly attacked five villages and razed their homes, after killing over 200 of the people, recently.\n\nReacting to the development, Atiku in a statement, said, \u201cI expect that security be ramped up to stem this waste of precious human lives.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president explained that, \u201cWhen I expressed my deepest condolences to the people and government of Zamfara State on the 6th of January over the senseless killing of innocent citizens in Bukkuyum and Anka Local Government Areas of the state, little did I know that the tragedy that befell the people was far worse than envisaged.\u201d\n\nHe said it was heartbreaking to have dozens of innocent citizens killed in just one day, lamenting: \u201cIt is a traumatic experience to imagine. Even as I sympathise with people in the affected families and the affected communities, yet again, as they bury their dead, I expect that security be ramped up to stem this waste of precious human lives.\u201d\n\nFarouq, in a statement, condemned the atrocity that followed the invasion of five communities and killing of over 200 people in Anka and Bukkuyum local government areas of the state as horrific and tragic.\n\nOver 200 persons were buried today (Saturday) due to the invasion by bandits. We are very saddened by this incessant invasion and killings by bandits and we also worry about the displaced persons, who are fleeing in their hundreds from their communities, especially, the women and children.\n\n\u201cWe sympathise with the government and people of Zamfara State in this trying period and condole with the families of the dead. We pray for the repose of their souls and that peace returns to the state and soon as possible,\u201d she said.\n\nShe, however, directed that relief materials be sent to the Internally Displaced Persons in the state to cushion the effects of the sudden displacement.\n\nReports say more than 10,000 victims had been rendered homeless after their homes were razed by the bandits while scores were still missing.\n\nMeanwhile, Eyitayo, spoke glowingly yesterday about Zulum, where he noted that his support had gone a long way in enhancing the military operation in the Northeast.\n\nEyitayo, speaking during Zulum\u2019s visit to the headquarters of the 7th Division of the Nigerian Army in Maiduguri during a social gathering organised by the army to celebrate the acting GOC\u2019s recent promotion to the rank of a Major General, said the governor had always come to their aid.\n\n\u201cSeverally, without being prompted, you (Governor Zulum) come to our aide to support us (the army) even logistics wise. Through your persistence and unrelenting cooperation and assistance, you have one way or the other, turned the spirit of the soldiers into fighting machines,\u201d he said.\n\nThe GOC, therefore, requested Zulum to convey the gratitude of his officers to President Muhammadu Buhari and the Chief of Army Staff for identifying and promoting deserving soldiers involved with the fight against Boko Haram in Borno State, which he indicated, was highly encouraging.\n\nIn his response, Zulum congratulated the acting GOC and other recently promoted military officers, saying the people of Borno shared the good moment and were happy with it\n\nThe governor said officers and personnel of the military and other security establishment deserve to be supported and encouraged, even as he described their duties as tough, hence, the need for not only support by states, for increase in their entitlements, when the economy permits such considerations by the federal government.\n\nZulum credited his administration\u2019s numerous efforts to the peace-building role of the military, which he said, had led to the safe resettlement of about 18 communities across Borno.\n\nHe said with continued peace-building, more communities would be safely resettled, while some major roads, such as Maiduguri-Damboa road would be opened for the safe use of motorists.\n\nZulum was accompanied to the function by commissioners of Agriculture, Bukar Talba; his sports and youths empowerment counterpart, Sainna Buba and that of transport, Abubakar Tijjani.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*May worsen inflationary pains by major consumers\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nAlthough still early in the year, oil prices has started off 2022 on a positive note, defying experts\u2019 prediction of a ballooning surplus, instead surpassing $80 a barrel at the weekend.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude in New York climbed five per cent during the week, despite closing lower by 0.7 per cent on Friday as it sold at about $80, while Brent, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark oil, sold for around $82 per barrel\n\nThis is as global demand shrugs off the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, while a host of supply constraints hit producers from Canada to Russia.\n\nWith investment banks calling for higher prices and options contracts invoking the prospect of crude spiralling above $100, the commodity is threatening to intensify the inflationary pain felt by major consumers.\n\nBut the rally was bad news for fuel-hungry countries like Nigeria with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) now paying more in petrol subsidy and negatively impacting its contribution to the federation account.\n\nNigeria, a key OPEC member has also struggled to meet its oil allocation from the producers\u2019 group, with flows of the once-key export grade Bonny Light now trickling out with significant delays.\n\nNigeria is pumping roughly 1.35 million barrels , the lowest figure in years.\n\nLikewise, Libya \u2013 which managed to pump more than one million barrels a day every month last year but is now producing about 25 per cent less than that.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group\u2019s head of Global Research, said that only two countries in the world \u2013 Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 can pump more today than they did in January 2020 before the pandemic really hit demand.\n\n\u201cThat could see the oil market tighten over the next three to six months,\u201d he said.\n\nMorgan Stanley expects Brent to climb to $90 a barrel by the third quarter and estimates that observable stockpiles fell by about 690 million barrels last year.\n\n\u201cWe suspect that further strength lies ahead,\u201d analysts at the bank said.\n\n\u201cWith the prospect of low inventories and spare capacity by the second half, further demand recovery into 2023, and still limited investments being made, the oil market appears to be heading for a period with little margin of safety,\u201d he added.\n\nInternationally, rising prices would also be a big blow to US President Joe Biden, who invested a lot of time and effort in orchestrating a global release of strategic petroleum reserves, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\u201cThe bullish sentiment has regained the narrative,\u201d said Mr Michael Tran, a commodities strategist at RBC Capital Markets.\n\n\u201cWith improving demand, tightening inventories, and questions of OPEC\u2019s ability to ramp further, the directional arrows of progress point to further optimism,\u201d he added.\n\nMovements in the price of oil are felt more keenly and quickly than that of any other commodity because they pass almost immediately into the cost of end-products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel.\n\nWhile Nigerians wait with apprehension for the planned removal of subsidy in the New Year, this month, there were riots across Kazakhstan after the government there allowed the price of liquefied petroleum gas \u2013 a key road fuel \u2013 to surge.\n\nThe dynamic means prices will be monitored closely by central banks that are trying to keep a lid on inflation while at the same time fostering economic growth as nations emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn terms of petroleum demand, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its producer-nation allies have signalled that they are confident the virus will not derail the recovery, and will continue with their strategy of gradually restoring output halted during the pandemic.\n\nWhile the group still says it believes markets are tipping back into oversupply, its forecasts for this quarter have turned markedly less pessimistic as supply growth from its rivals disappoints.\n\nThe alliance sees an excess of 1.4 million barrels a day in the first quarter, 25 per cent less than its projection a month ago. It anticipates a rebound of 4.2 million barrels a day in global consumption this year, and demand topping 100 million barrels a day by June.\n\nBut a deep freeze in Canada and the northern US is disrupting oil flows, boosting prices just as American stockpiles decline even as Russia failed to boost oil output last month despite a generous ramp-up in its OPEC+ quota.\n\nAs well as headline prices, the forward curve for oil has turned more bullish too, with more-immediate contracts commanding larger premiums to later months, an indication that buyers are willing to pay higher to secure barrels more quickly.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

you recall that we have been very eager to see the use of the Tucano helicopters so that we can have massive engagement with all the bandits.\n\n\u201cPart of the problem was also the status of the bandits and already, you can see that the Nigerian government has declared them as a terrorist group.\n\n\u201cSo, the military is now going to do full engagement and we are also getting prepared in the North for such actions.\n\n\u201cThat is what we are expecting so if we are going to take action, let it be massive and such that will ensure that within the first quarter of this year, people will have hope of their security and peaceful living in all parts of the North.\u201d\n\nThe governor stressed the need for drastic measures against the bandits and other criminals, saying such actions had become imperative to ensure a conducive environment for farmers to boost food production across the states.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting this action before the next rainy season. You recall we mentioned that we are an agrarian society so, we want our people to go back to farm and, in most cases, it is this insecurity that is keeping them away from the farms,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reiterated that the governors would continue to collaborate with traditional rulers and local vigilantes to safeguard their domains.\n\nMeanwhile, troops of 5 Brigade, Sector 3 Joint Task Force (JTF) of Operation Hadin Kai have killed three terrorists in a market in Damasak, Borno State.\n\nA statement issued yesterday by the Nigerian Army said troops clashed with the terrorists in an illegal market operated by the terrorists in Gallo Malawari Village.\n\nThe statement signed by Army Spokesman, Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu, said three fighters of the Islamic State for West African Province (ISWAP) were neutralised in the market during a gun duel.\n\n\u201cTroops, while consolidating on their dogged push to deplete Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province Terrorists (ISWAP) in Borno State, recorded a decisive victory against the terrorists in Damask on Friday, January 7, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe gallant troops, while conducting clearance operations, code-named Operation Dominance I, came in contact with the terrorists at an illegal market operated by the terrorists in Gallo Malawari Village\u201d, it said.\n\n\u201cIn the fierce encounter, three BH/ISWAP terrorists were neutralised, while others, bowing to superior firepower retreated in disarray,\u201d it said.\n\nThe statement further stated that troops recovered one AK-47 rifle, a truck, two motorcycles, four empty magazines and rounds of 7.62mm ammunition among others.\n\nFG Seeks Divine Intervention to End Security Challenges\n\nIn a related development, the federal government has said that the fight against insecurity and other challenges would need divine intervention.\n\nThe Minister of State for Agriculture, Mr. Mustapha Babai, who represented President Muhammadu Buhari at the National Prayer Session for Nigeria, organised yesterday by the Kano State Government, said the current administration has been up and doing to overcome the security challenges bedevilling the country.\n\nAccording to him, the federal government had not rested on its oars in supporting security personnel with needed equipment and welfare in a bid to bring the insecurity to an end.\n\n\u201cDespite the support, there is a need to seek divine intervention for the Almighty to bring an end to the challenges.\u201d\n\nHe also commended the Kano State Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, for taking the giant spiritual commitment towards making Nigeria peaceful.\n\n\u201cI am very happy with this initiative. Indeed Ganduje is doing well in securing Kano and in giving his quota to achieving peace in the country at large.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, Nigeria is facing security challenges and we are doing our best to support the security personnel. That does not mean we should not seek divine intervention. This prayer session is part of the interventions and I commend the state governor for this,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso in his remarks, Ganduje thanked President Buhari for his efforts to ensure Kano remains peaceful by deploying security agents to secure the state.\n\nSaraki Condemns Killing of over 200 in Zamfara\n\nIn another development, former President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, has condemned the carnage perpetrated by terrorists in Zamfara State, where over 200 people were massacred.\n\nSaraki disclosed that during the #SaveBagega lead poisoning crisis in 2013, he visited the people of Anka Local Government Area of the state, where he met a determined and resilient community that worked hard to build a buoyant local economy.\n\nHe lamented that the same vibrant community has become a place of carnage and called for long-lasting solutions to the security challenges in the country.\n\n\u201cMy heart goes out to the families and communities that have experienced the tragic loss and injury of loved ones, the destruction of their property, and the interruption of their livelihoods.\n\n\u201cToday, as we all mourn these terrible attacks in both Anka and Bukkuyum LGAs in Zamfara State, we owe the families and all other affected communities across the nation a brighter future.\n\n\u201cIn January 2013, during the #SaveBagega lead poisoning crisis, I spent some time with the people of Anka LGA, Zamfara. There I met a determined and resilient community that worked hard to build a buoyant local economy.\n\n\u201cToday, that same vibrant community has become a place of carnage. My heart is heavy, and truly there\u2019s anger too because we cannot continue like this. We must find long-lasting solutions to this insecurity.

          "text": "All appears not to be well with the administration of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos as his government continues to score low in terms of public perception following the poor handling of certain issues in the state in recent times.\n\nSince taking over office in 2019 from Akinwunmi Ambode, former governor of Lagos, Sanwo-Olu and his government had struggled to carve out a glittering image in the public space, moving from one embarrassment to another over this period.\n\nThe latest episode of this uninspiring trend came last Wednesday following the issuance of a controversial legal advice to the police in Lagos by the Director, Directorate of Public Prosecutions, Ms Adetutu Oshinusi, which exonerated five students and officials of Dowen College, Lekki, suspected to be linked to the death of a student, Sylvester Oromoni.\n\nSee Also Politics Lagos Government Replaces Justice Ministry Official Who Exonerated Dowen College Staff, Students Over Sylvester Oromoni\u2019s Death\n\nOromoni died on November 30, 2021 following ill-health said to have been caused by bullying by senior students.\n\nThe 12-year-old boy\u2019s father had claimed that his child was beaten and forced to drink a chemical that eventually claimed his life.\n\nBut management of Dowen College had dismissed the claim, alleging that the boy sustained injuries while playing football with colleagues.\n\nThe position of the school attracted stiff criticisms from Nigerians and forced the police to arrest the five students and officials while it carried out an investigation into the matter.\n\nThe Lagos Government also announced the indefinite closure of the school pending the outcome of the findings.\n\nHowever, the release of the students and staff of Dowen College following Oshinusi's legal advice further escalated issues on Wednesday as Nigerians not only condemned the exoneration of the 10 persons but also accused the Lagos Government of trying to sweep the matter under the carpet in a bid to protect the influential cronies.\n\nTop sources within the state government confirmed to SaharaReporters that the development not only caused Governor Sanwo-Olu's administration great embarrassment but further dented its perception in the eyes of the public.\n\nAdetutu Oshinusi\n\nIn response, the state government immediately moved Oshinusi out of the Ministry of Justice as Director of the DPP to Directorate of Citizens Rights.\n\nA former Head, Office of the Public Defender, Dr Babajide Martins, was named as an immediate replacement for that position.\n\nTo further exorcise the ghost of that move considered as a huge blunder by the state government, Oshinusi was not mentioned as the outgoing DPP in a memo by the administration.\n\nInstead, a former occupant of the role, who had since been made a judge of the Lagos High Court, Adenrera Olayinka Adeyemi, was named as Martins' predecessor as DPP director.\n\nThe state government, SaharaReporters further gathered, was doing everything possible to distance Sanwo-Olu's administration from the controversial legal advice in order to improve the public image of the government.\n\n\u201cHer (Oshinusi) role was so despicable that the government had to deny that she was never the Director, Directorate of Public Prosecutions.\n\n\"If you check the memo signed by Solicitor-General and Permanent Secretary of the state, Ms Titilayo Shitta-Bey, one Adenrera Olayinka Adeyemi, who is now a judge of the High Court of Lagos State, was named as the DPP.\n\n\"She (Oshinusi) was quickly redeployed to the Directorate of Citizens Rights after the report.\n\n\"The entire development greatly embarrassed the Lagos State Government and that was why they reacted quickly and are looking for every means to distance the administration from the legal advice from Oshinusi,\u201d a source told SaharaReporters.\n\nIt was further gathered that the sanctioning of a coroner's inquest into Oromoni's death as demanded by lawyer to the victim's family, Femi Falana, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, was part of moves by the Lagos Government to correct the 'error' by Oshinusi and appear non-partisan in the entire saga.\n\nIndeed, the latest embarrassment for Sanwo-Olu's administration comes a little over a year after his government faced heavy backlash for deploying soldiers from Bonny Camp in Lagos to massacre young Nigerians demanding an end to police brutality and improved governance in the country at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020.\n\nBrig. Gen. Ahmed Ibrahim Taiwo of 81 Division Intelligence Brigade while appearing before the Lagos Judicial Panel in November 2020 alleged that Sanwo-Olu called on the military for support that fateful day after the #EndSARS crisis degenerated into chaos.\n\nTestifying before the panel, General Taiwo had said, \"On October 20, 2020, Lagos State descended into anarchy.\n\n\"Sanwo-Olu asked the army to intervene and that was the correct thing to do since the police had been overrun.\"\n\nMore than 10 persons were killed while scores more remain unaccounted for following the attack on the peaceful protesters by the soldiers.\n\nSanwo-Olu and his government denied any involvement in the massacre till date despite the testimony of the military.\n\nOne year after that mass killing, Governor Sanwo-Olu in a desperate bid to repair his government's public image called for a 'peace walk' in commemoration of the Lekki incident.\n\nThe Lagos governor had invited some prominent young entertainers and activists including musician Folarin 'Falz' Falana, comedian Debo Adebayo widely known as Mr Marcaroni, another musician Seun Kuti, among others to join him on the walk.\n\nBut the invited youth all turned down the request by Sanwo-Olu, forcing him to cancel the planned 'peace walk'.\n\nThe Lagos governor and his administration further suffered embarrassment last week when the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, and Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, deployed a team of policemen from Abuja to lay siege to the disputed Magodo Phase 2 Estate in Lagos without consulting with him.\n\nResidents had prevented entry into the estate after some persons in company with policemen tried to enforce a Supreme Court judgment giving them authorisation over the land the estate now sits on.\n\nThe situation had generated much controversy that residents staged a protest in front of the estate to draw government's attention to the situation.\n\nVisiting the estate to intervene in the crisis and dismiss the policemen from Abuja from the area, Governor Sanwo-Olu and his officials were 'splashed with mud' in the face when leader of the police team, Abimbola Oyewole, a Chief Superintendent of Police, refused to obey his order to leave the place.\n\nAfter attempting several times to have Oyewole and his men disengage and leave the area, the Lagos governor left the scene in disappointment.\n\nInside sources told SaharaReporters that the Lagos governor was greatly worried that these embarrassing incidents could further dent his chances of returning to office for a second term.\n\n\"His administration is suffering serious image crisis at the moment and there is concern that this could affect his chances of returning for a second term in office.\n\n\"Already, many Lagos residents have a poor perception of his administration, they think he is not sensitive to the plight of ordinary people, this could work against him.\n\n\"That is why his government is avoiding any type of scandal. This explains why the legal advice by the DPP angered the administration a lot,\" the source added.",

          "title": "On the making of King of Boys, Netflix\u2019s first original Nigerian series",
          "text": "2021 was a year that came with many pleasant surprises, top of which was the release of the sequel to the 2018 thriller, King of Boys.\n\nUnlike the first movie, which was released in the cinemas and raked in a whopping \u20a6245 million at the box office (second highest-grossing Nollywood movie in 2018), the sequel\u2013King of Boys: The return of the King\u2014was released on Netflix as its first original Nigerian series.\n\nThe King of Boys sequel (KOB 2) picks up five years after the events of the first film, with the protagonist, Eniola Salami, returning to Nigeria after a five-year exile and diving straight into fierce competition for the seat of the Governor of Lagos State. Directed by Kemi Adetiba, the sequel retained some lead acts from the first King of Boys movie, with refreshing additions like musician Charly Boy, and veteran actor Richard Mofe-Damijo.\n\nKOB 2 was well received by movie lovers as it topped Netflix\u2019s top-ten movie charts for many weeks. Considered by many as a great addition to Netflix\u2019s expansive library of TV series and films, it helped the streaming giant gain more subscribers in the African region.\n\nAhead of the release of a documentary about the making of the King of Boys franchise, TechCabal spoke to Michael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde, the director of the documentary, who was also the production coordinator and one of the second unit directors of KOB 2. Akinrogunde is notably the director of Ghost and the Tout 2, one of Nollywood\u2019s highest-grossing movies in 2021, and a 2018 Africa Magic Viewers Choice Award (AMVCA) winner.\n\nMichael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: So, I\u2019m going to start with a plot-related question that everyone\u2019s been asking. When did Makanaki and Eniola Salami meet to settle their differences?\n\nMichael Akinrogunde: Well, it depends on how you watched the movie.\n\nDA: But I watched it more than twice.\n\nMA: I can only say what has been shown. (laughs)\n\nDA: Okay, fair enough. What was different about creating this movie in partnership with Netflix?\n\nMA: Interestingly, as at the time we started shooting KOB 2, I don\u2019t think it was confirmed as a Netflix original. However, it didn\u2019t affect the way we shot it or how professional it was, as that\u2019s always been Kemi Adetiba\u2019s style. The production was already set to be a world-class one, whether Netflix was going to be on board or not.\n\nDA: Considering that this was Netflix\u2019s first Nigerian original series, how much technical support did Netflix bring in?\n\nMA: I wouldn\u2019t say there was much of that because Kemi already approached the movie with the mindset that she\u2019s making it to international standards. So, we were using the best cameras and lenses available to achieve the shots we needed. We also worked with some of the most talented crew and cast.\n\nDA: What was the difference between shooting a regular movie and a 7-part series?\n\nMA: Another thing that\u2019s noteworthy is that, when we finished shooting King of Boys, nobody knew we had shot a series. On the script, it was a regular movie and, as you will see in the documentary, it was converted into a series because the movie was too long and there was no part we felt we could cut. Even after it was converted to a series, at the end of the first cut edit, the whole series, according to the editor, was about nine hours long, not the seven hours that was released.\n\nDA: Wow! Nine hours. Maybe that\u2019s where you cut out Makani and Eniola Salami settling their differences?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t know. (laughs)\n\nDA: Fair enough. What\u2019s something that was subtle in the movie but impacted its perception by the audience?\n\nMA: Personally, it was the brilliant lacing of drama with action. The movie was structured in a way that gave an action movie feel, with few stunts and fighting scenes. Having a lot of guards, guns, and machetes shown in different scenes made viewers feel like they were watching an action movie.\n\nDA: Looking at the action scenes, how did the crew achieve the sequences?\n\nMA: I saw first-hand how incredible Kemi is with blocking. I also think the crew found creative ways to make it work. If there\u2019s anything Hollywood has, it\u2019s probably more stuntmen who can do more flips; and more robotic equipment, which we didn\u2019t necessarily \u201cneed\u201d in this movie. The explosion scene was computer-generated imagery. In the scene where young and old Eniola were speaking at the same time after the elders had been shot, we used a welding machine to create the sparks-of-light effect which we fine-tuned in post-production. The explosion on the table was done with a type of safe bomb that explodes with colours. The stunt experts marked out safe areas; we would do a few rehearsals, and then shoot the scenes.\n\nDA: Were there other scenes where you had to improvise?\n\nMA: Yes, sure. Shooting in the middle of the pandemic meant we had to improvise. For example, the scene where Makanaki goes to meet the babalawo, that wasn\u2019t shot in a forest; it was in a hotel hall. Also, the snake that was on Odogwu Malay\u2019s car wasn\u2019t real.\n\nDA: What was it like shooting around Lagos?\n\nMA: It almost felt like a Lagos tour, which isn\u2019t typical for a Nollywood movie because you\u2019d usually try to keep the production cost low by limiting movement. With KOB, it was whatever was needed to make the scene happen. We shot for about 63 days, with the exception of a few days when we couldn\u2019t shoot because of the #EndSARs protests and the weather.\n\nWe shot on the mainland and the island\u2014Lekki, Ajah, Ijora. We shot in places I didn\u2019t even know people were allowed to shoot, but the team, being resilient, got the necessary permit to shoot.\n\nDA: How did technology help in the coordination and production of the movie?\n\nMA: The KOB 2 set was a large set. We had about 60\u201390 crew members, depending on the production needs on a particular day. On some days we needed more people because of the scenes we were shooting. Most of the communication was done via walkie-talkie because of the need to communicate changes and general updates to team leads. For example, say we planned to shoot set scenes 1, 3, 4, 5, and then there\u2019s a traffic delay for the cast coming in, or there\u2019s a wardrobe malfunction, you can\u2019t just keep production waiting. You might need to shoot a scene that wasn\u2019t planned before. We also used WhatsApp and Cloud storage. We had to do a lot of collaborative work across different time zones, because one of the key producers, Remi Adetiba, wasn\u2019t in the country. So, we had to share the videos shot via Google Drive and do some video calls to keep the show running smoothly.\n\nDA: What was surprising about the response from the audience to KOB 2?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t think there was anything that was necessarily surprising. I was more blown away when we started topping the charts on Netflix before it was released. That blew me away; it meant that people were waiting for this.\n\nPersonally, I had a small fear that people might not open their hearts to it because there\u2019s a general fear that people have about movie sequels that come with a different storyline or characters. Fans tend to personalise things that they love. They say things like, \u201cDon\u2019t spoil our movie; leave it the way it is.\u201d\n\nI was skeptical that people might not understand some things I saw in the private screening with other crew members, but then to see people go even deeper into analysing the movie is exciting to see.\n\nDA: Are we getting another KOB sequel?\n\nMA: This is entirely up to the creators of the show! However, I think most people are anticipating a sequel because of how KOB 2 ended. Just like the first part, the movie ends in a way that hints at a follow-up. However, for now, let\u2019s all just enjoy the magic of the moment!\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Cameroon risks stunting mobile money growth with new transaction levy",
          "text": "Among Cameroonians, new year celebrations have so far coincided with pushback against a new tax on mobile money transactions introduced by the Paul Biya administration.\n\nFrom January 1, 2022, a 0.2% tax on the transfer and withdrawal of money via mobile wallets came into force, as required by the newly enacted 2022 Finance Bill signed by President Biya last November.\n\nThe tax applies to all transactions made through traceable platforms, including mobile telephony and the internet, with the exception of bank transfers and electronic transactions carried out to pay tax and customs duties.\n\nIn other words, people using money transfer platforms will incur additional fees of 0.2% when sending and 0.2% when withdrawing. That means a total of 4,000 XAF ($7) will be charged in taxes on the transfer of 1 million XAF ($1,725) between two Cameroonians.\n\nThese taxes, expected to add more liquidity to state coffers, are in addition to existing charges on mobile money transactions in Cameroon which users already complain about.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMobile money is hugely popular among Cameroon\u2019s 26.5 million people, particularly used by the unbanked, middle- and lower-class citizens as well as small business owners.\n\nIn Cameroon, only a third, or 35%, of adults are estimated to have bank accounts whereas mobile phone penetration has increased over the years. Network operators, led by MTN and Orange, have thus tapped into the existing mobile infrastructure to offer financial services to their subscribers.\n\nAs of 2020, Cameroon accounted for 65% (19.5 million) of the overall active mobile wallets in the CEMAC regional zone, per data from the Bank of Central African States (BEAC).\n\nIn line with growing adoption, transaction costs have increased over the past few years. To send or withdraw 100,000 XAF ($172), for instance, a user has to pay close to 2% (1,800 XAF, $3) in fees to the operator, which in turn remits part of that to the government as value-added tax.\n\nMany Cameroonians thus consider yet another mobile money tax unfair, especially to the poorest, unbanked segments of the population, and have taken to social media to express their discontent. A trendy hashtag #endmobilemoneytax has been making the rounds on Twitter over the past week.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine being charged a tax to withdraw your own cash out of your account?\u201d Rebecca Enonchong, a leader in the African tech ecosystem and one of the key voices against the new tax wrote in a tweet on January 2. \u201cThis tax is regressive and will slow financial inclusion. #EndMobileMoneyTax. #WeSayNo.\u201d\n\nThe new mobile money tax will especially hit the poorest, unbanked segments of Cameroon society. There is no such tax on wire transfers through banks. And it's paid twice. Once to send. Once to receive.\n\n\n\nAnd all for what? To pay for government excesses and corruption. \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) January 1, 2022\n\nI want to send 100,000 F (+ withdrawal fees); that's 101,800 F.\n\n\n\nA. Sender\n\nMTN fees = 300 F\n\nTax = 0.2% = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nTOT = 102,303.6 F\n\n\n\nB. Receiver\n\nGets 101,800 F and is taxed 0.2% AGAIN.\n\n\n\nMTN Fees = 1,800 F\n\nTax = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nWithdrawable = 99,796.4 F#EndMobileMoneyTax \u2014 Sahyuo BAD (@Sahyuo_) January 1, 2022\n\nA Douala-based entrepreneur, who asked to be anonymous, considers the tax an additional cost burden on the ordinary person in Cameroon and thinks it could discourage the use of mobile money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially double taxation and means the average person will incur more cost when sending and/or withdrawing money,\u201d she said. \u201cThe impact will be even more severe on business owners like me. I might just have to seek other options.\u201d\n\nAcross Africa, the success of mobile money services has attracted the attention of authorities looking to expand their revenue base and new taxes are often imposed without assessing their full impact.\n\nIn countries where such taxes have been implemented, a GSMA report found that taxation was harming the uptake of mobile money services and businesses. A later study also points out that many mobile money users belong to \u201cmarginalised societal groups\u201d hence the negative impact on financial inclusion and broader development goals of mobile money taxes is significant.\n\nFor the wider economy and government coffers, these taxes cause a contraction in mobile money transaction values and their growth trajectory reduces, with negative implications for wider corporate income and value-added taxes.\n\nWithin the region, a plan by Ghana\u2019s finance ministry to introduce a 1.75% levy on electronic transactions in the 2022 budget is still being debated by lawmakers. That\u2019s in addition to an earlier move to increase taxes on mobile money agents. Similarly, a 1% tax on mobile money transactions in Uganda was cut in half after protests.\n\nUnlike Ghana\u2019s case, however, citizens were barely informed of the details before Cameroon\u2019s government implemented the new mobile money tax in November, according to local media reports.\n\nThe government has so far ignored the outrage, but some Cameroonians hope authorities will hear their complaints and review the decision, similar to Tanzania, where the state slashed a new mobile money tax by 30% after protests by citizens. \u201cKnowing our government, a review of the law is all we can hope for now,\u201d the entrepreneur said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How mobile phones and digital tools have helped Togo tackle COVID-19",
          "text": "Globally, the COVID-19 disease has infected more than 290 million people, claimed well over 5 million lives, and plunged millions into extreme poverty. The pandemic has been devastating in every sense of the word, and its impact felt in Africa, too, where over 9.7 million cases and 228,000 deaths have been recorded.\n\nBut, within the continent, the magnitude of the crisis has been uneven by country. One of the lesser affected countries is Togo. The French-speaking country has, so far, recorded 31,500 infections and 250 deaths from COVID, per data from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)\u2014relatively lenient nominal figures compared to Nigeria\u2019s or South Africa\u2019s.\n\nIn the small West African country of about 8 million people and a gross domestic product of around $7.5 billion, locally-led digital solutions have been crucial to authorities\u2019 efforts to curb the pandemic\u2019s reach.\n\nLast month, Togo\u2019s Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation, led by Havard graduate and former World Bank analyst Cina Lawson, unveiled the latest in an expanding list of mobile-based solutions to help Togolese tide over the pandemic.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA new mobile application, PassCovid19TG, allows the population to easily upload, access, and present their COVID-19-related health information. Documents such as vaccination certificates, PCR tests, and the Togolese or European Union COVID Pass, whether in digital or paper format, can be uploaded on the app via scanning their QR codes.\n\nBy using smartphones to present COVID digital certificates, the new application is expected to facilitate and improve the control and checking of health passes in Togo, where people have to present passes before they\u2019re allowed into public spaces, from airports and worship centres to restaurants and bars.\n\n\u201cThe PassCovid19TG can also be used when travelling, to check in advance the validity of the Pass in the country of destination, particularly in the European Union area,\u201d said Lawson, who\u2019s overseen the creation of several technological solutions that have helped Togo effectively handle the COVID-19 crisis better than its wealthier, larger, and supposedly more tech-savvy regional neighbours, Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nLike much of the rest of Africa, COVID lockdowns and restrictions threatened livelihoods in Togo, a country where pre-pandemic per capita GDP was less than $700 in 2019 and average income below $2 a day. Per World Bank estimates, about 62% of jobs in the country were affected by the crisis, particularly in the informal sector, which employs the majority of Togo\u2019s labour force outside of the agricultural sector.\n\nFaced with the threat of worsened poverty amid rising unemployment and dwindling income, the government in April 2020 launched a program called Novissi (meaning \u201csolidarity\u201d in the local Ewe language)\u2014a mobile money-based cash transfer scheme to help those most economically affected by the pandemic.\n\nMore than 1.6 million Togolese registered for the monetary support through their mobile phones, according to data on the Novissi website. Led by Lawson, the digital ministry then used voter identification data to select beneficiaries by targeting some 600,000 people who listed themselves as \u201cinformal workers\u201d in urban areas, an indication they were likely to be poor.\n\nBut with the government unable to support every one of the millions of informal workers, identifying the poorest citizens in the rural parts of the country required more sophisticated solutions. Togo turned to satellite imagery and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe TogoSafe app.\n\nWith the help of researchers at the University of California and the US-based NGO GiveDirectly, the government was able to identify the poorest 100 cantons in the country through satellite imagery data. It then analysed mobile phone data from primary network providers to identify users in those areas with patterns that suggested they were living under the poverty line.\n\n\u201cWe chose a fully digital approach, which makes it possible to directly reach beneficiaries through mobile payments while guaranteeing traceability and transparency,\u201d Lawson\u2019s statement on the Novissi website reads. \u201cThe solution represents a real methodological break with the past and foreshadows the way in which social safety nets and cash transfer programs will henceforth be implemented in our country.\u201d\n\nLom\u00e9 has so far distributed around CFA13.3 billion (over $22 million) directly into the mobile wallets of more than 800,000 people in different communities suffering from the crisis, according to official data. Women make up the majority of beneficiaries\u2014over 500,000\u2014and received more ($22) in single 3\u20135 monthly cash transfers than men ($20).\n\n\u201cPeople should not have to choose between death by COVID-19 or by hunger,\u201d President Faure Gnassingbe said on the Novissi programme. \u201cOther African leaders could also use a similar mobile-based, cash transfer scheme.\u201d Anit Mukherjee, a policy fellow at the Centre for Global Development, in this Bloomberg article claims Novissi makes even America\u2019s COVID cash transfer programme look like a \u201cdinosaur\u201d.\n\nAround three months after launching the Novissi scheme and as reported COVID cases surged in Togo with the emergence of the more contentious and deadly Delta variant, the government launched a COVID contact-tracing application, Togo Safe, to initiate, in real-time, the health protocol needed to contain the virus\u2019s spread.\n\nThe web and mobile-based platform relies on digital geolocation to track infected individuals and immediately issues notifications to others whenever they come in contact with those who\u2019d tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn the app, Togolese can also view the number of COVID cases in their area as well as get access to health advice and a directory of useful pandemic-related hotlines.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people registered for COVID-19 vaccination through Togo\u2019s digital platforms.\n\nTogo\u2019s tech-savvy approach to handling the pandemic extends to vaccination efforts. Within a week of receiving 156,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX facility last March, the country was able to vaccinate 98% of its health workers with the help of a system that relied on digital channels to reach people across the country.\n\nAuthorities launched a mobile and web-based service that allows Togolese to register for vaccination using their phones. An individual just has to dial the shortcode *844# from a local number and complete necessary steps, after which they receive a 14-digit code to be shown at the health centre for vaccination.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people had registered for vaccination through SMS and the website. Togo currently has the second-highest vaccination rate in West Africa, after Cape Verde.\n\nThe digital-driven response appears to be effective, keeping COVID infection rates in Togo at low levels so far while the poverty rate only rose marginally in 2020. It\u2019s also attracted international attention and recognition. On the COVID Performance Index developed by the Australian think tank, Lowy Institute, the West African country was ranked the 2nd to best handle the crisis in Africa, and the 15th globally. Many African countries have shown interest in replicating Novissi, Lawson told Bloomberg.\n\nTogo may not be known for tech startups with global appeal and recognition or billions in venture funding, but the country has ambitions to become a digital hub by 2025, riding on the penetration of mobile connections. As of January 2021, more than 80% of the population had a mobile phone.\n\nConsidering the manner in which the government has been able to leverage ICTs in its COVID response, Damien Mama, who was United Nations Resident Coordinator in Togo until September 2021, believes the small West African nation is on track to improving its economy with digital technologies.\n\n\u201cThe digital sector is without a doubt one of the most promising means to achieve the sustainable development goals in a small country with big ambitions like Togo,\u201d the UN official said in a post.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Five North African countries\u2014Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya\u2014make up the Maghreb region, a historic island between seas of water and sand at the far end of the Arab world.\n\nLeaving out Libya, which continues to battle with consistent civil unrest and hasn\u2019t really broken ground in the startup world, and Mauritania, which is relatively small and mostly underdeveloped, startups across the other three nations raised an estimated $72 million in 2021. Algerian startups raised $30 million; Morocco recorded an all-time high of $29 million; and Tunisia closed north of $23 million.\n\nThis is a landmark growth from the $20.1 million raised across 19 deals in 2020. But when you break these numbers down into deals and compare them to Egypt\u2019s over $600 million funding in 2021, the conversation on how disturbingly small the funding is comes up. When it comes to venture funding, Egypt has always been North Africa\u2019s leader, capturing up to 80% of investment flows into the region from 2015 to 2021, per Baobab.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, this is not a question of why Egypt dominates with such a huge margin but why the combined startup funding secured by five nations couldn\u2019t match up with at least a quarter of what their neighbour did. What\u2019s the problem of the Maghreb region, and how can the ecosystem rise to its full potential?\n\nTo set the context, the region has several problems that, if not resolved soon, may not only continue to shrink the potential of its burgeoning startup sector but could bury it completely. But here are five reasons funding is low in this region.\n\nIntra-regional conflict\n\nThe Maghreb countries don\u2019t see eye-to-eye; they are archenemies or, as they are popularly called, \u201cenemy brothers\u201d. It\u2019s gradually becoming clearer that these nations are incapable of cooperatively forgoing their cat-and-rat history and assembling their social and cultural similarities to achieve greater economic progress.\n\nThis enmity continues to subdue the economic potential of the region because each of the countries practices a closed-border policy, which hinders seamless intra-regional trade, especially between Morocco and Algeria. These two nations arguably hold the key to the region\u2019s prosperity but have instead contributed the most to its misfortune.\n\nDue to the hostile intra-regional trade culture, it\u2019s difficult for startups to project growth in terms of expansion across the Maghreb. That means it\u2019ll be difficult for a Moroccan company to expand into the Algerian market.\n\nA 100-kilometer fence along the Morocco-Algeria border built by the Moroccan government\n\nFor example, when Chari, a Moroccan startup that helps retailers access consumer products faster and cheaper, wanted to expand into Tunisia, it had to set up an entirely new company that has no ties with the mother company apart from the name and business model.\n\n\u201cWe had to start another company in Tunisia, with all the paperwork. We had to also hire a new general manager and local team, and basically duplicate the company in Tunisia,\u201d said Ismael Belkhayat, co-founder and CEO at Chari. \u201cSo we don\u2019t handle Tunisia from Morocco; our Tunisia operation is independent.\u201d\n\nThis shows that there is no business exchange between the countries; there is no unified environment, which means there are no real regional markets. How do you then pitch an investor to back a venture that operates in a broken market like the Maghreb?\n\nHostile bureaucracy\n\nSurprisingly, countries in the Maghreb region aren\u2019t completely in disagreement with one other. They all have something in common: a heavy and killer administrative process. Across the region, there\u2019s an administrative office called Office des Changes, a bureau that regulates all monetary transactions. The body monitors money that comes in and goes out of each country.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: as a startup, you can\u2019t do as little as spend on Google or Facebook Ads without consulting the bureau. If you want to advertise on Google or Facebook, you either need to pay a local tax or get special authorisation to spend money outside Morocco or Algeria or Tunisia. This isn\u2019t only applicable outside of the Maghreb but also within it.\n\nHence, local companies mostly consume local services and not foreign. Therefore, it is more difficult to leverage sophisticated tools to drive growth or even maintain operations across the board\u2014the bureau has made sure of that. Imagine not being able to use Trello or Slack because your country won\u2019t allow you to subscribe to them without charging your purse dry.\n\nThis same principle is applicable to investors. It\u2019s a tad difficult and expensive to pull out your funds after investing in the Maghreb region; you must pay a great chunk of tax to the bureau. All of this rigid bureaucracy makes it difficult for startups in the region to pull foreign investment.\n\nThe big don\u2019t trust the small\n\nThe Maghreb tech ecosystem is an unusual one, and startups are literally on their own. In Nigeria, for instance, big conventional banks back fintech startups, and FMCGs invest in e-commerce and logistic upstarts.\n\nIt\u2019s not like that in the North African region.\n\nBig local companies mistrust startups, mostly because of how easy it is for startups to shut down in the region. For them to trust, back and also, maybe, provide seed \u201cmarket\u201d (goods supplies), you must have at least a two-years track record.\n\nThe irony is, if nobody is ready to back a green early-stage company, how will it survive and be around for the two-year mark? It\u2019s a vicious cycle that puts startups in a very tight corner because it seems everything is designed to kill them. How can foreign investors trust a brand or product that potential local investors won\u2019t back?\n\nLack of fintech innovation\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been a reason if Africa had not experienced the power of fintech. Startups that play in this space attract big-cheque investors. Across the four biggest African tech hubs\u2014Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt\u2014fintech attracts the biggest funding. Even in Egypt, where logistics and e-commerce attracted more funding, the $120 million investment secured by MNT-Halan, a fintech company, remains its biggest single deal till today.\n\nWhen you move up west, the absence of fintech starts to show. Noureddine Tayebi, founder and CEO of Yassir, an Algeria-originated Maghreb-focused logistic company that raised all the $30 million for Algeria, confirmed to TechCabal over a call that \u2014 even though his company is active towards building a fintech product that will support their business\u2014 there are currently no fintech solutions in Algeria. Belkhayat also said the same about Morocco, though he mentioned that Tunisia has a few like Paymee, which he was sure will likely survive because of the supportive startup act the country enacted in 2018.\n\nBoth local and foreign investors are bullish on fintech startups, especially in Africa, and going by trends from the last five years, it\u2019s expected that entrepreneurs in the Maghreb countries will double down on fintech and court investors for more investments.\n\nHowever, Belkhayat thinks for a fintech to actually scale, it needs enough capital that is mostly not available to their startups at the early stage. This may be another reason why these countries will be stuck with cash going forward.\n\nLanguage barrier\n\nThe Maghreb region speaks French and that makes it a francophone region. According to Belkhayat, most of the available foreign investors communicate in English, so a founder who can\u2019t speak English talking to an investor who doesn\u2019t understand nor speaks French is already disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cMost VC funds are based in countries where people speak English, compared to French-speaking countries. Therefore, it\u2019s more complicated for us to raise money than the anglophones,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nBefore 2021, venture funding in francophone African countries was extremely low, with Morocco and Tunisia being the leaders per investment. But this year, Senegal took the lead after fintech startup Wave raised a record $200 million Series A. Apart from this deal, VC funding activity remained pretty much subdued in the region last year.\n\nAlso, both Belkhayat, his co-founder Sophia Alj and Tayebi are American-trained businessmen who have worked with top American organisations and understand the languages of the investors. Niama El Bassunie\u2014the founder/CEO at Waystocap, another Morrocan e-commerce business that was acquired by Egypt-based Fawry\u2014is also a UK-trained and based expert. So when you zoom in, it becomes clearer why their companies were able to raise enough capital, unlike others.\n\nThese are the struggles every Maghrebian startup faces while trying to raise foreign investment. Most importantly, the intra-region conflict that has led to lack of business exchange has to be fixed. Once that\u2019s solved, just like a domino effect, every other thing should gradually fall in place.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "2023: Dave Umahi and his politics of pettiness",
          "text": "By Obi Nwa Uballa\n\nHaving eaten too much while the rest of Ebonyi people \u2013 including civil servants who are poorly remunerated \u2013 almost starved, Dave Umahi, governor of the state, will leave office in 2023 with protruding stomach as one of the legacies of his eight-year stewardship in the state. Umahi, today, has a big stomach, and already sees himself as a very big man. Back in the day when we were kids, a big man was a man who had a very big tummy. It was for us, the only clear evidence that a man had arrived. And Umahi who, perhaps, still has such idea that a man\u2019s \u2018bigness\u2018 can be measured by the size of his belly, apparently looks himself, every now and then, in the mirror, and concludes that, \u2018Yes, I have to be the biggest man around now in Igbo land,\u2019 which could be why he has also developed a very fragile ego.\n\nNo doubt, a governor is as big as it gets, and of course, big men often have big ego, especially those who stumbled on wealth. It\u2019s not strange, therefore, that Umahi has become very touchy. In Ebonyi where he reigns much like an emperor, he brooks no opposition, and not even criticisms are allowed. And if anyone is unwise to sing what is not music to his ears, they should be ready to receive the police as guests and made to face some very ridiculous charges in court. A certain Chief Abia Onyike, a former commissioner for information in the state, knows this too well, and so do journalists who have dared to write what he considers unfavorable report.\n\nWhen in late 2020, Umahi decided that in the interest of his presidential ambition, he should defect to the ruling APC, having perhaps realised that with people like his Rivers State counterpart, Nyesom Wike, he may not have his way in the PDP, he expected every Ebonyi stakeholder to scurry up to him in his new party and quickly pledge allegiance. So, when this did not happen, Umahi declared war on everyone, including former senate president, Anyim Pius Anyim. Talk about nza, the tiny bird who forgot himself after a heavy meal and challenged his chi to a fight.\n\nUmahi imagines that he must have everything his way, and that everyone must queue behind him and defer to him or he raises hell. He must dictate to everyone, even to Ohanaeze Ndigbo, and if the apex Igbo sociocultural group is rash enough to suspend his man for gross indiscretion, Umahi will throw tantrums, for how can Ohanaeze not bow at the feet of a man who is now so big that there cannot be any doubt about his position as the supreme leader of Ndigbo?\n\nBut it\u2019s obvious that Umahi is deluded. No doubt, he has built infrastructure in Ebonyi \u2013 even if there are controversies about whether he uses his companies or whether he is claiming ownership of structures built with state resources \u2013 but building infrastructure in Ebonyi cannot automatically make one a presidential material. One has to have pedigree, and that cannot be gotten by developing a fragile ego and turning oneself into an emperor in the little space one governs. Unfortunately, Umahi has a very exaggerated idea about his self worth and this is becoming a big problem, not just to him, but to Ndigbo and their quest to produce the country\u2019s president in 2023.\n\nHistorically, the greatest challenge Ndigbo have faced in their quest for relevance in national politics, is that everyone wants to be number one, even when they have no chance of getting anywhere. And if they cannot be, then nobody else should. We\u2019ve seen the \u2018pull him down syndrome\u2019 play out time and time again, and clearly that\u2019s what Umahi has resorted as it\u2019s becoming clear that Pius Anyim will be the candidate to beat in 2023.\n\nThe Ebonyi governor, having seen the amount of support the former senate president is getting among the Igbo in his quest to be president, has gone extreme with his childish tantrums. It\u2019s amazing how an individual will grow into an adult, but his brain still functions like that of an infant. After Igbo PDP stakeholders met in Enugu on Thursday and endorsed Anyim\u2019s presidential bid, Umahi\u2019s hireling who run a Facebook page, Ebonyi Online, through which they pour invective on Anyim, posted a press release issued by one faceless group probably working at his behest asking that the likes Adolphus Wabara, former senate president and Enyinnaya Abaribe, senate minority leader, who had at different fora endorsed him, withdraw such endorsement.\n\nThe group which identified itself as South East Democratic Civil Society Coalition (SEDSOC), in the press statement signed by a certain Chief Willy Ezugwu \u2013 apparently the new chief of fifth columnist in the Southeast \u2013 had argued rather unintelligently, that Anyim\u2019s endorsement is \u201chasty and self serving,\u201d as according to them, \u201cThe South East has eminently qualified persons capable of transforming Nigeria if given the chance by the electorate to serve as President in 2023.\u201d\n\nThe eminently qualified persons spoken about by the group of jobbers must, of course, include the likes of Umahi. Such a laughable display of lunacy. But they would soon take the insanity notches higher. Late last week, hired thugs went to destroy a statue of Anyim in his hometown, an insane action gleefully shared by handlers of the same pro Umahi facebook page, Ebonyi Online, as evidence that the former SGF has been rejected in his own homeland. Ebonyi, by the way, has become a volatile state, with armed thugs unleashing mayhem on both perceived and real opponents of the powers that be. Indeed, the whole show would have been hilarious, if not that it has continued to manifest, sometimes, in very brutal attacks on such opponents, even as it has the potential to constitute a serious dent on the quest for Igbo president in 2023.\n\nSadly, it\u2019s been the case in the past and Umahi is not attempting anything new. Time and time again, when there is need for the Igbo to rally and demand for power, little minds will emerge from everywhere to throw spanner in the works. In 2003, when the quest for Igbo president of Nigeria was crystallising, many wanted to contest, even when it was obvious that the late former vice president, Dr. Alex Ekwueme, was clearly the best candidate and the only person with enough political clout to win. It didn\u2019t matter, they simply wanted to run against him, spurred on by their ego and pettiness, and some perhaps to injure his chances for a mess of pottage. Of course, a combination factors ultimately ensured that Ekwueme lost out, once again, to Olusegun Obasanjo, the then president who had emerged PDP candidate and eventually president after Ekwueme was outmanoeuvred at the Jos convention in 1998. 2003, the last time Ekwueme contested, would be the last the Igbo credibly challenged for power at the centre. Subsequently, others, mostly flyweights, contested as \u2018also runs.\u2019\n\nAgain, ahead of 2023, easily the most critical year in the modern political history of Ndigbo, when their quest for power will be both a quest for equity and justice, as well as a moral responsibility on Nigeria, the trait is emerging even before the real battle starts. While it is clear to everyone that Senator Anyim, and perhaps, former Anambra State governor, Peter Obi, are the two individuals with the necessary reach and political leverage to credibly challenge for power in Abuja, particularly within the PDP, every Tom, Dick, and Harry wants to run. But this is not the problem. There is nothing wrong with anyone from anywhere wanting to be president. Indeed, competition for power is the hallmark of democracy, and in every zone of Nigeria, people have competed and continues compete with one another. In the Southwest for instance, the likes of Bola Tinubu, Yemi Osinbajo, Kayode Fayemi, among others, are working hard to garner the support of their people and the rest of the country.\n\nHowever, apart from the fact that the Southeast, given its historical disadvantage, can ill-afford this sort of \u2018sibling rivalry,\u2019 what is remarkably different is that as opposed to promoting themselves, the clowns that dot the political landscape of the zone, resort to pulling down those ahead of them, which is what makes the Umahi scenario in Ebonyi particularly painful. Granted that the Ebonyi governor has the right to seek to be president, even if he has no chance of winning, but every sane Igbo person who wants power should focus on promoting himself at this stage, and not dwell on attacking another who is doing so.\n\nIt is particularly surprising that people who are not in the PDP want to poke their noses into the affairs of the party in the Southeast, and dictate to stakeholders who to endorse and who not to endorse. The obsession is simply incomprehensible. Sadly, while the little minds are focused on pulling their own champions down, they are travelling to Abuja with bags of money to feed others hoping that they\u2019d be favoured by those who presumably hold the levers of power in the country. But they have no idea. A man who helps to destroy his own warrior on account of petty envy or just utter myopia, has only made himself weak and vulnerable, and cannot be trusted by his rival. Umahi should be reminded that where he is headed there is no road. At the end day, he would make mockery of himself and destroy his own political career.\n\nObi Nwa Uballa, a concerned South Easterner wrote from Lagos State.

          "text": "The regent of Oshodi land, Alhaji Biliaminu Adisa Akinola, has made it clear that the chairman of the Lagos State chapter of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, Musiliu Akinsanya, popularly called MC Oluomo is neither an indigene of the community nor belongs to any of the 11 ruling houses.\n\nAkinola said this in an interview with Nigerian Tribune on Sunday. The regent was reacting to claims that the union leader is seeking the obaship of Oshodi.\n\nThe regent, who has been managing the affairs of the community for years, while waiting for the installation of a monarch said, \u201cLet me state clearly that Musiliu Akinsanya is on his own in his campaign for the royal stool in Oshodi land and he cannot be crowned the king.\n\n\u201cIt is glaring that Akinsanya family is not from Oshodi land neither does he belong to any of the ruling houses in Oshodi. They are tenants. And how can a tenant become king over the real landowners? They are not part of us in Oshodi. I heard he is claiming to be from the Awori extraction but I don\u2019t know which of the Aworis he belongs to.\u201d\n\nIn a warning to the Lagos State governor, the regent said, \u201cIf he is allowed to do that, it will amount to desecrating the Yoruba royal tradition. Royal stool is not what you can wake up one morning and decide to buy with money, no. There are procedures to becoming a king.\n\n\u201cI totally frown at it and I trust the Lagos State government will not want to impose Musiliu Akinsanya on the people of Oshodi land because he does not belong to any ruling house in Oshodi. He is a tenant in Oshodi. I have searched our history; I couldn\u2019t find any link of Akinsanya family to the Oshodi royal stool.\u201d",

          "text": "Zamfara state Governor Bello Mohammed (Matawallen Maradun) has said political bandits and yellow journalism were threatening to pull down his administration.\n\nThe governor stated this weekend during his visit to Anka and Bukkuyum local government areas to commiserate and assess damages done to victims of recent attacks by bandits in the areas.\n\nHe condemned the \u2018misinformation\u2019 in the media reportage that variously quoted scary figures of the number of deaths arising from the attacks.\n\nArmed bandits reportedly killed at least 58 people in Zamfara state after raiding several villages Thursday.\n\nLike other North-west states of Nigeria, Zamfara has consistently come under attack by bandits since 2020 during which victims were abducted in their numbers.\n\nBut the government has also been making frantic efforts to ward off the hoodlums.\n\nAs one of the moves, an Abuja-based Federal High Court declared the bandits, cattle rustlers and others as terrorists, a decision that was so gazetted last week.\n\nMonarchs lament killings\n\nBut statistics available on Anka and Bukkuyum emirates indicated that 58 people were killed during the attacks by bandits in eight communities last Thursday.\n\nEmir of Anka and chairman of the state\u2019s council of chiefs and the Emir of Bukkuyum, Alhaji Attahiru Ahmad and Alhaji Muhammad Usman respectively confirmed that 22 people were killed in seven communities in Anka while 36 were also killed in Kurfar Danya village in Bukkuyum emirate by the group of armed bandits during the incidents.\n\nThe monarchs spoke to journalists during the governor\u2019s sympathy visits to their domains.\n\nThey described the attack by bandits as barbaric and disheartening, calling on their subjects to go back to Almighty Allah with constant supplications to end the trend.\n\nThey also equally called on the federal government to deploy more troops to the areas to mitigate the activities of bandits who terrorised the areas.\n\nThe emir of Anka told the visiting governor that out of the seven affected communities in his emirate, four were set ablaze by the bandits.\n\nMatawallen speaks\n\nSpeaking during the visit, the governor said he was in the two local government areas to condole with the bereaved families and emirates over the incident and find out modalities on how to assist the victims to reduce their hardship.\n\nHe said his administration had directed the state ministry of humanitarian affairs, disaster management and social development and Zamfara state emergency management agency to provide adequate assorted relief items to the victims.\n\nGovernor Matawallen commiserated with the two monarchs and their entire subjects over the unfortunate incident and promised to address the humanitarian crisis arising from the attacks.\n\nThe governor specifically called on the online and social media to always verify the facts instead of scaring the public for whatever reason.\n\n\u201cIt is also obvious that my administration is not only threatened by bandits in the bush but also political bandits in our towns and villages,\u201d he said.\n\nMatawallen accused some politicians of manipulating the crisis for political gains and condemned the informants aiding the terrorists in their nefarious activities.\n\n\u201cWe shall conquer all by the strength of the Almighty Allah,\u201d Governor Matawallen assured.\n\nHe then announced that the government would henceforth treat those who report deliberate lies on bandits\u2019 escapades as terrorists as well.\n\nThe governor further said: \u201cWe cannot fold our arms and allow people to always create panic and paint gorier picture of actual happenings in the state. We are faced with a big trial which we are doing our best to address.\u201d\n\nHe assured his administration would partner the federal government in its efforts to end banditry in the state.\n\nMatawallen commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his steadfastness in tackling insecurity in the country.\n\nOrders reconstruction of villages\n\nHe also announced the plan by his administration to reconstruct the villages burnt by bandits in Anka local government area of the state.\n\nThe governor stated this Sunday in a state wide broadcast on the rising spate of insecurity in the state.\n\nHe said the affected communities would be relocated to their villages as soon as the reconstruction of the villages were completed.\n\nGovernor Matawallen also said the military would be stationed in the area to protect lives and property of the affected communities pending the return of normalcy.\n\n\u201cI have ordered for the total reconstruction of the four villages burnt by the bandits in Anka local government during an attack last Thursday and as soon as the work is completed, the affected communities will be back to their ancestral home and the security forces will be stationed in the area,\u201d Matawallen said.\n\nHe assured the carnage would soon be tackled by security operatives, urging the good people of the state to remain calm, law abiding and also report any suspicious movement by any person or group of people to security agencies for urgent response.\n\nYari commiserates\n\nIn a similar message, the immediate past governor of the state, Alhaji Abdulaziz Yari Abubakar-led faction of All Progressives Congress (APC) also commiserated with the families of the victims of the massacre.\n\nPublicity secretary of the APC faction in the state, Ibrahim Muhammad said this in a statement made available to Blueprint in Gusau Sunday.\n\nHe equally said the chairman of the faction, Hon. Lawal M. Liman Gabdon Kaura expressed \u201cthe deepest condolences of its leader, his lieutenants, major stakeholders and members of the party in the polling Unit, Ward, Local Government and State levels to the affected families, communities and survivors of the unfortunate attack.\u201d\n\nHe described as regrettable the massacre of innocent citizens at this point in time when people in other parts of the globe were busy developing themselves into more socio-economic empowered entities.\n\n\u2026Northern CAN slams FG\n\nIn yet another reaction, the northern chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) slammed President Buhari over the Zamfara killing.\n\nBuhari had while condemning the massacre on Saturday at a national prayer session organised by the Kano state Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, said the government was unrelenting in its efforts at tackling the challenges.\n\nHe admitted Nigeria needed a divine intervention to end the Boko Haram insurgency, banditry and other social vices plaguing the country.\n\n\u201cThere is a need to seek divine intervention for the Almighty to bring an end to the challenges,\u201d the President said.\n\nBut in a statement issued Sunday by CAN Vice-President for the northern region, Rev. Joseph Hayab, the body said Buhari had failed to live by his promises and wondered if such promises were only made to please Nigerians with no hopes of keeping them.\n\nThe group said: \u201cBetween January and December 2021, about 9,196 people were killed, 3, 857 Nigerians were kidnapped. Of these, about 70 per cent of the victims are from the North including the President\u2019s home state of Katsina where the governor has asked citizens to buy arms to protect themselves. This is an admission of failure.\n\n\u201cIt is sad that this is what Nigerians now face daily. We commiserate with the victims. The Buhari government lacks the capacity to do anything. There are terror apologists in the APC and the government knows them. In 2015, they imported foreign terrorists into the country for the purpose of gaining power.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernance has fallen in many states today in northern Nigeria and the Federal Government needs to do something urgently before the worst will happen,\u201d the statement further said.\n\nCAN also joined prominent Nigerians who had called for a state of emergency in the North so as to curb the menace of insecurity in the region.\n\n\u201cThe call for a state of emergency in the North-East cannot be over emphasized. But sadly, the body language of Mr. President and those surrounding him does(sic) not show they care and expecting them to declare a state of emergency is a wasted appeal because nothing about them shows they care,\u201d the statement said.",

          "title": "Oil Defies 2022 Surplus Forecast, Continues Bullish Run on Fading Virus Fears",
          "text": "Although still early in the year, oil prices has started off 2022 on a positive note, defying experts\u2019 prediction of a ballooning surplus, instead surpassing $80 a barrel at the weekend. West Texas Intermediate crude in New York climbed five per cent during the week, despite closing lower by 0.7 per cent on Friday as it sold at about $80, while Brent, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark oil, sold for around $82 per barrel\n\nThis is as global demand shrugs off the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, while a host of supply constraints hit producers from Canada to Russia.\n\nWith investment banks calling for higher prices and options contracts invoking the prospect of crude spiralling above $100, the commodity is threatening to intensify the inflationary pain felt by major consumers.\n\nBut the rally was bad news for fuel-hungry countries like Nigeria with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) now paying more in petrol subsidy and negatively impacting its contribution to the federation account.\n\nNigeria, a key OPEC member has also struggled to meet its oil allocation from the producers\u2019 group, with flows of the once-key export grade Bonny Light now trickling out with significant delays.\n\nNigeria is pumping roughly 1.35 million barrels , the lowest figure in years.\n\nLikewise, Libya \u2013 which managed to pump more than one million barrels a day every month last year but is now producing about 25 per cent less than that.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group\u2019s head of Global Research, said that only two countries in the world \u2013 Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 can pump more today than they did in January 2020 before the pandemic really hit demand.\n\n\u201cThat could see the oil market tighten over the next three to six months,\u201d he said.\n\nMorgan Stanley expects Brent to climb to $90 a barrel by the third quarter and estimates that observable stockpiles fell by about 690 million barrels last year.\n\n\u201cWe suspect that further strength lies ahead,\u201d analysts at the bank said.\n\n\u201cWith the prospect of low inventories and spare capacity by the second half, further demand recovery into 2023, and still limited investments being made, the oil market appears to be heading for a period with little margin of safety,\u201d he added.\n\nInternationally, rising prices would also be a big blow to US President Joe Biden, who invested a lot of time and effort in orchestrating a global release of strategic petroleum reserves, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\u201cThe bullish sentiment has regained the narrative,\u201d said Mr Michael Tran, a commodities strategist at RBC Capital Markets.\n\n\u201cWith improving demand, tightening inventories, and questions of OPEC\u2019s ability to ramp further, the directional arrows of progress point to further optimism,\u201d he added.\n\nMovements in the price of oil are felt more keenly and quickly than that of any other commodity because they pass almost immediately into the cost of end-products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel.\n\nWhile Nigerians wait with apprehension for the planned removal of subsidy in the New Year, this month, there were riots across Kazakhstan after the government there allowed the price of liquefied petroleum gas \u2013 a key road fuel \u2013 to surge.\n\nThe dynamic means prices will be monitored closely by central banks that are trying to keep a lid on inflation while at the same time fostering economic growth as nations emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn terms of petroleum demand, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its producer-nation allies have signalled that they are confident the virus will not derail the recovery, and will continue with their strategy of gradually restoring output halted during the pandemic.\n\nWhile the group still says it believes markets are tipping back into oversupply, its forecasts for this quarter have turned markedly less pessimistic as supply growth from its rivals disappoints.\n\nThe alliance sees an excess of 1.4 million barrels a day in the first quarter, 25 per cent less than its projection a month ago. It anticipates a rebound of 4.2 million barrels a day in global consumption this year, and demand topping 100 million barrels a day by June.\n\nBut a deep freeze in Canada and the northern US is disrupting oil flows, boosting prices just as American stockpiles decline even as Russia failed to boost oil output last month despite a generous ramp-up in its OPEC+ quota.\n\nAs well as headline prices, the forward curve for oil has turned more bullish too, with more-immediate contracts commanding larger premiums to later months, an indication that buyers are willing to pay higher to secure barrels more quickly.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "A former vice president p9f Nigeria and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has decried the continued killings in the northwest zone, particularly the recent attack in Zamfara State, which left over 200 dead, and therefore appealed to the federal government to ramp up security in the zone to stem further waste of lives.\n\nIn the same vein, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq, has also described the recent killings in Zamfara by bandits as nothing short of horrific.\n\nAlso in a related development, the acting General Officer Commanding 7 Division of the Nigerian Army, Major General Abdulwahab Eyitayo, has hinted that the Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, always offered logistics and other supports to the Nigerian Army in the ongoing war against Boko Haram insurgents without being asked by the military authorities.\n\nOver 500 fleeing bandits on motorcycles had reportedly attacked five villages and razed their homes, after killing over 200 of the people, recently.\n\nReacting to the development, Atiku in a statement, said, \u201cI expect that security be ramped up to stem this waste of precious human lives.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president explained that, \u201cWhen I expressed my deepest condolences to the people and government of Zamfara State on the 6th of January over the senseless killing of innocent citizens in Bukkuyum and Anka Local Government Areas of the state, little did I know that the tragedy that befell the people was far worse than envisaged.\u201d\n\nHe said it was heartbreaking to have dozens of innocent citizens killed in just one day, lamenting: \u201cIt is a traumatic experience to imagine. Even as I sympathise with people in the affected families and the affected communities, yet again, as they bury their dead, I expect that security be ramped up to stem this waste of precious human lives.\u201d\n\nFarouq, in a statement, condemned the atrocity that followed the invasion of five communities and killing of over 200 people in Anka and Bukkuyum local government areas of the state as horrific and tragic.\n\nOver 200 persons were buried today (Saturday) due to the invasion by bandits. We are very saddened by this incessant invasion and killings by bandits and we also worry about the displaced persons, who are fleeing in their hundreds from their communities, especially, the women and children.\n\n\u201cWe sympathise with the government and people of Zamfara State in this trying period and condole with the families of the dead. We pray for the repose of their souls and that peace returns to the state and soon as possible,\u201d she said.\n\nShe, however, directed that relief materials be sent to the Internally Displaced Persons in the state to cushion the effects of the sudden displacement.\n\nReports say more than 10,000 victims had been rendered homeless after their homes were razed by the bandits while scores were still missing.\n\nMeanwhile, Eyitayo, spoke glowingly yesterday about Zulum, where he noted that his support had gone a long way in enhancing the military operation in the Northeast.\n\nEyitayo, speaking during Zulum\u2019s visit to the headquarters of the 7th Division of the Nigerian Army in Maiduguri during a social gathering organised by the army to celebrate the acting GOC\u2019s recent promotion to the rank of a Major General, said the governor had always come to their aid.\n\n\u201cSeverally, without being prompted, you (Governor Zulum) come to our aide to support us (the army) even logistics wise. Through your persistence and unrelenting cooperation and assistance, you have one way or the other, turned the spirit of the soldiers into fighting machines,\u201d he said.\n\nThe GOC, therefore, requested Zulum to convey the gratitude of his officers to President Muhammadu Buhari and the Chief of Army Staff for identifying and promoting deserving soldiers involved with the fight against Boko Haram in Borno State, which he indicated, was highly encouraging.\n\nIn his response, Zulum congratulated the acting GOC and other recently promoted military officers, saying the people of Borno shared the good moment and were happy with it\n\nThe governor said officers and personnel of the military and other security establishment deserve to be supported and encouraged, even as he described their duties as tough, hence, the need for not only support by states, for increase in their entitlements, when the economy permits such considerations by the federal government.\n\nZulum credited his administration\u2019s numerous efforts to the peace-building role of the military, which he said, had led to the safe resettlement of about 18 communities across Borno.\n\nHe said with continued peace-building, more communities would be safely resettled, while some major roads, such as Maiduguri-Damboa road would be opened for the safe use of motorists.\n\nZulum was accompanied to the function by commissioners of Agriculture, Bukar Talba; his sports and youths empowerment counterpart, Sainna Buba and that of transport, Abubakar Tijjani.",
