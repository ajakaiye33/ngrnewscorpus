          "title": "Ban On Open Grazing: Miyetti Allah patron backs southern governors stand",
          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Ibrahim HassanWuyo\n\nThe National Patron of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Senator Walid Jibrin has said that a ban on open grazing will help to address the farmers-herders crisis in the country.\n\nHe commended the position of Nigerian Governors on the ban on open grazing and called on the various Fulani organizations to unite as one.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Kaduna on Thursday, Senator Jibrin, the Sarkin Fulani Nasarawa, said; \u201cmost importantly the various Fulani associations with membership up to 50 must come together and talk with one voice on this tradition of open grazing and not necessarily allow any group to come out to do it for them\u201d\n\nAccording to him, cattle rearing has been on in Africa for over 100 years without any consideration to the free movement of cattle (Open Grazing) or any Grazing Reserve.\n\n\u201cThis was carried out because at that time there were few herders, farmers, and cattle, especially in Nigeria. Today the population of both has increased with the modern technique of farming consuming land tremendously,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that with the current International concern on cattle rearing in Africa especially Nigeria, there is a need to look at how best this practice will be carried out successfully.\n\nALSO READ: Reps tell NERC to suspend new electricity tariff\n\n\u201cWe must note that land in Nigeria is being owned by individuals, federal, and State Governments.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a full-blooded Fulani man, Sarkin Fulani, and Patron Miyatti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), and concerned Fulani Leader in Nigeria, I have a free mind on anyone recommending a ban on open grazing, free movement of herders, and cattle in Nigeria because the practice is getting outdated internationally and is, therefore, necessary for Nigeria especially Fulani race to study critically the traditional open grazing believing that the 21st century may never accommodate it.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the practice of open grazing in Nigeria compared with what is happening Internationally, Nigeria can never continue with traditional open grazing practice. In order to effect a change, the Fulani elites should be bold enough to come out with alternatives to open grazing and advise the Fulanis in Nigeria accordingly.\n\n\u201cFederal and State Governments should come to the rescue by providing Grazing reserve centres equipped with hospitals, nomadic schools, electricity, boreholes, cattle markets with modern slaughtering centres, open market to our Fulani women to enable them to remain in one place to sell milk instead of their house to house roaming about exposing our rich culture and religion.\n\n\u201cI have fully observed the feeling of many groups and individuals in Nigeria about open grazing. There is so much condemnation from Nigerian Governors, Northern Governors, Southern Governors, etc.\n\n\u201cThese groups and individuals should never be condemned and must be praised for their bold comments trying to modernize and improve cattle rearing in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnother reason why we should shun away from open grazing is the way old methods of settlements of crises between Herdsmen and Farmers have been abandoned.\n\n\u201cThe role of the traditional rulers especially the Village Heads, District Heads are daily being neglected by both Herdsmen and Farmers leaving it on the hands of the Police, Courts and other law-abiding agencies.\n\n\u201cBecause of poverty and lack of full education, some Fulani children are involved in some unholy acts which will surely be remedied by provision of Grazing reserves.\n\n\u2018May I seize this opportunity to congratulate all the Governors for the bold steps they are taking to curve the menace of open grazing, kidnapping, and banditry.\n\n\u201cIn the S/W the recent action by the Governor of Oyo State Chief Makinde is very commendable and also commend him for shunning away the call asking all Hausas and Fulanis to leave the SW.\n\n\u201cI also condemn any call from the North that all Hausas and Fulanis should leave the South West.\n\n\u201cNigeria must remain one entity and one Nigeria as against what is happening now. We should rely more on dialogue, and mediation with herders, Fulani Leaders, Traditional rulers, and our Governors in order to end this feud.\n\n\u201cOur Traditional Rulers must also be encouraged to participate in dialogue between Fulani Herdsmen and Farmers, for now, the traditional rulers are kept off from handling of Herdsmen and Farmers problems.\n\n\u201cOf course our traditional rulers must be given a proper role in the Nigerian Constitution. May I strongly advise that the Federal and State Governments should assist tremendously in providing inputs into the recommended grazing reserve land in all the States of the Federation and they should continue to be Herdsmen/Farmer Friendly.\n\n\u201cIn order to discourage open grazing, Federal Government should stop the entry of Cattle to Nigeria from ECOWAS countries by amending the Article 3 of ECOWAS Protocol especially referring to free movement of cattle and other livestock without any special undertaking.\n\n\u201cFinally I strongly appeal to the Federal and State Governments to maintain all existing Grazing reserves by providing special amenities mentioned in my earlier suggestions.\n\n\u201cIt is also necessary that Government uses the services of World Bank to archive all plans that will come out of well modernized Grazing Reserves in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

He, however, admitted that in every organization, there must be miscreants.\n\nOn his part, representative of the Executive Secretary of the National Human Rights Commission, Anthony Ojukwu said the Commission as an advisory body that performs oversight function had concluded an investigation on the recent EndSars protests and made detailed recommendations to the government.\n\nHe also said that the Commission was instrumental to the disbandment of SARS by the federal government and is at the Vanguard of ongoing statewide investigation on human rights abuse by SARS in the 36 states of the federation, including the FCT.\n\nThe Executive Coordinator of CLEEN Foundation, Dr. Benson Olugbuo blamed the collapse of the citizen and police relation on lack of inter-agency relation.\n\nIt will be recalled that early last year, President Muhammadu Buhari approved the implementation of Nigeria\u2019s second National Action Plan which made extensive commitments around citizens\u2019 engagement in governance as well as recommendations on #EndSARS protest.\n\nSome of the recommendations include: Passage of the Bill for an Act to repeal the Police Service Commission Act and Enact the Police Service Commission Bill, 2020; National Human Rights Commission (NHRC); National Orientation Agency (NOA) and their Non-State Actors partners to hold a quarterly zonal \u2018Citizen-Police Dialogue; joint PSC/CSO led quarterly select police station visitation to ascertain the condition of the station, adherence to Standard Operating Procedure and conditions of suspects held in the station among others.\n\nFollowing the approval, the National Steering Committee also approved the extension of the implementation period of Nigeria\u2019s second National Action Plan by one year, to allow stakeholders to review existing commitments with a view to revising earlier commitments to reflect the government\u2019s responses to COVID-19, the #EndSARS Protests and other governance issues.\n\nThe approval followed the extension of the implementation period of existing action plans by the OGP global community which took cognizance of the devastating effect of the pandemic on economies and allowed member countries to as well as revising existing commitments to reflect governments\u2019 responses to issues necessitated by the pandemic and other current issues.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

Emmanuel Ositadimma Edeh, disclosed that the theme, \u201cMy Peace I Give Unto You\u201d, was occasioned by \u201cthe prevailing circumstances of the day\u201d, stating that \u201cas Christians, we quickly remembered the words of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in John 14:27, which says \u201cMy Peace I Give Unto You\u201d.\n\nThe CAN chairman stressed that \u201cwe need peace in our hearts, peace in our homes, peace in our communities, peace in all our seventeen (17) local government areas, peace in Enugu State, peace in the South East Zone, peace in our nation Nigeria and the whole world\u201d.\n\nRev. Edeh appreciated Gov. Ugwuanyi for his commitment to God, peace and all the support his administration has been giving the religious institutions in the state, including the successful hosting of the prayer rally.\n\nIn his congregational prayer, the Chaplain of Upper Room Ministries, Enugu, Rev. Fr. Dr. Tony Nnaji, called on the people of God to unite and rise to the prevailing challenges in the country by praying fervently and speaking with one voice, declaring that \u201cGod has given us victory\u201d.\n\nIn their separate intercessory prayer sessions, the representatives of the five blocs of CAN in Enugu State prayed for \u201cgratitude to God, forgiveness of sins, and against bloodshed and insecurity in Nigeria\u201d. They also prayed for peace in Enugu State and Nigeria, the leaders of the country, and youths.\n\nThe CAN leadership unanimously commended Gov. Ugwuanyi for entrusting Enugu State to the hands of God, maintaining that the state has remained peaceful and secure because of the governor\u2019s faith in God, commitment to the people\u2019s wellbeing as well as his uncommon leadership style.\n\nIn his prayer session, Bishop Godwin Madu of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) thanked God for giving Gov. Ugwuanyi, \u201cwho trusts his faith in you\u201d, the wisdom, character and leadership qualities to lead Enugu State on the path of peace and good governance.\n\nBishop Madu prayed for God\u2019s protection on the people of Nigeria and called on Him to come and rescue Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur supernatural God, please rescue us from this bad situation of violence, killings, banditry and armed robbery in our dear country. We have faith that you will rescue and deliver Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is no longer in the hands of the President, Governors, Army or other security agencies; it is you, God that will bring peace and security to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn Enugu State, we thank you for our God fearing, peaceful and CAN loving Governor, His Excellency, Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Lawrence Ugwuanyi, who is here today, for giving him the wisdom to worship you.\n\n\u201cHe entrusted Enugu State to your hands and such a wise decision has brought peace and good governance to our dear state.\n\n\u201cWe also thank you, God, that our governor has always been the first to implement South East Governors\u2019 noble decisions on peace and security, among others\u201d.\n\nIn their remarks, the Archbishop of Enugu Ecclesiastical Province (Anglican Communion), Most Rev. Dr. Emmanuel Chukwuma and the State Vice Chairman of CAN/Auxiliary Bishop of Enugu Catholic Diocese, Most Rev. Dr. Ernest Obodo equally prayed for peace and security in the Enugu State, South East region and Nigeria, and beseeched God to give Gov. Ugwuanyi more wisdom and strength to continue to discharge his onerous responsibilities diligently, stressing that Enugu State will continue to be in the hands of God.\n\nAccording to Bishop Obodo, \u201cI wish to thank the Executive Governor of Enugu State, Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Lawrence Ugwuanyi (Gburugburu), a man of peace, who since the inception of his administration has put Enugu State in the hands of God.\n\n\u201cOur governor is such a patient and God fearing leader. He left everything he was doing to be here to pray with us. We sincerely appreciate him\u201d.\n\nIn his goodwill message, Gov. Ugwuanyi, through the State Commissioner for Information, Nnanyelugo Chidi Aroh, endorsed the prayer rally, pointing out that the peace and security being enjoyed in Enugu State were among the cardinal policies of the present administration.\n\nAroh noted that it was because of the peace entrenched by Ugwuanyi that all the past governors of the state have and can come together to chart a new course for the progress of the state, stressing that \u201cit has never happened before\u201d.\n\nThe Commissioner added that the governor\u2019s commitment to peace also led to the massive infrastructural transformation in the Judiciary for effective dispensation of justice, \u201cbecause peace and justice connect\u201d.\n\nAroh who highlighted some of the remarkable achievements of the Ugwuanyi administration in other spheres of development such as health, roads construction, security, workers\u2019 welfare, etc, in spite of the nation\u2019s economic challenges, said that \u201cthese things happened because of God and the existing peace in Enugu State\u201d.",

          "text": "By Christopher Oji\n\nMany people were injured while many others were robbed at Oshodi area of Lagos when Soldiers from the Nigeria Air Force clashed with Motorpark touts and some hoodlums.\n\nMany people believed to be touts were taken away by the Soldiers at Capa Motor Park Mosafejo area of Oshodi.\n\nTrouble started when the Soldiers heard about the death of one of their colleagues who was allegedly murdered on Monday by hoodlums on top of the Oshodi Bridge.\n\nA source told Daily Sun that the personnel of the Nigerian Air Force, was allegedly murdered by hoodlums on Monday; his body was seen on top of the bridge on Tuesday and some government officials who were alerted evacuated the body to the morgue .\n\nVery early morning, Thursday Military personnel stormed the popular Capa Motor Park to question the Chairman on what he knew about the death of the Soldier, but the touts who thought their chairman was being arrested by the Soldiers, started throwing stones, bottles and other cudgels at the soldiers who threw caution to the winds and started shooting sporadically into the air.\n\nThe touts were said to have burnt the patrol vehicles belonging to the Soldiers.\n\nIt was gathered that there was pandemonium as residents; traders and road users ran for cover. Motorists and their passengers also abandoned their vehicles while many passengers were stranded as no commercial vehicle driver had the courage to pass through the road for fear of the unknown as the Military men had taken over the entire area.\n\nIt was gathered further that the Soldiers succeeded in taking unspecified numbers of suspected hoodlums and touts away and some dangerous weapons recovered at the scene.\n\nA witness, Felicia Madu, told Daily Sun that:\u201d The Air Force personnel was on mufti when he ran into a group of hoodlums who were robbing people of their belongings on top of Oshodi bridge . He resisted the hoodlums and was overpowered and killed by the robbers. After killing him, they dumped his remains into a ditch.\n\n\u201cWe knew there would be trouble when a team of Soldiers from OP MESA stormed Oshodi today to interrogate the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) Chairman. His boys and other hoodlums started throwing stones at the soldiers. That was the cause of today\u2019s crisis.\n\n\u201cIn the process of the crisis, hoodlums cashed in on the opportunity and started vandalising and looting properties from stranded passengers and commercial vehicles drivers within the vicinity\u201d.\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, relative calm has returned to the scene as a combined team of Military, Police and Para- Military personnel were on the ground to maintain law and order.\n\nSpokesman of Nigerian Army, 9Brigade, Major A.K. Bello, said the Army was not directly involved in the incident, \u201cbased on the situation on ground, we had to wade into the crisis and bring the situation under control because of the sensitivity of the environment,\u201d\n\nLagos State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, said the Commissioner of Police Lagos State Command Mr Hakeem Odumosu,has ordered investigations into the incident.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Lagos State Police Command was aware of the conflict that occurred at (Capa Park/Mosafejo Osodi) at about 7am. Normalcy has been restored to the area, as the matter is under investigation. We urge Lagosians to go about their lawful businesses in the area and the state in general. No cause for alarm. The CP has ordered that intensive patrol be emplaced in the area.",

A youth leader, Abashe Dauda, told Daily Sun that 11 bodies were discovered at Gaida Kaso and five others missing when gunmen launched an offensive on Gaida Kaso and Wako Kaso villages, Kakau Ward in Chikun local government area of Kaduna State, on Tuesday. He added that two other persons were shot at Wako Kaso village, but survived the attack that lasted for hours.\n\nHe said the killings in the adjoining agrarian communities were becoming tensed up daily with no tangible help from the government to salvage the situation.\n\nHe said: \u201cA community called Gaida Kaso village, Kakau ward, Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna state, was attacked on 18/5/2021 by unknown gunmen.\n\n\u201cThe attack was carried out at about 3am, houses were set ablaze, 11 persons confirmed dead and five are nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cThe gunmen also attacked a nearby community called Wako in Kaso Village, two were shot and sustained gunshot injury and are receiving treatment.\n\n\u201cAssemblies of God Church and one mission house were burnt down in the process,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth Kaduna State Police Command and the State\u2019s Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs are yet to make any official statement about the development as the time of filing this report.\n\nAlso, on Tuesday night, armed bandits reportedly attacked Batsari town in Batsari Local Government Area in Katsina State, killing one person and abducted 21 others.\n\nAn eyewitness said that the armed bandits stormed into Batsari community at about 10:20pm and started shooting sporadically before they abducted 21 persons, mostly women and children, while a man simply identified as Alhaji Hassan was shot dead.\n\nEfforts to get the police authorities in Katsina State to comment on the incident proved abortive as the spokesperson, Gambo Isah, did not respond to calls to his phone.\n\nThe police command had, earlier on Tuesday night, confirmed the abduction of a judge, Alhaji Husaini Sama\u2019ila, by gunmen at a Shari\u2019a Court at Baure Zaka village in Safana Local Government Area of the State. The judge was said to have been kidnapped around 3:00 pm, on Tuesday, while on a personal visit to the court.\n\nThe police spokesman: \u201cAs you all know, the court has not been on the session since the commencement of the strike action embarked by the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN).\n\n\u201cThe judge took the risk and went to the court.

          "title": "Ayade: Why I Dumped PDP for APC",
          "text": "Says with Buhari\u2019s \u2018commitment to this country, his nationalistic disposition and all the efforts he has made to bring Nigeria to where we are today, it\u2019s obvious that we should join hands with him to build a Nigeria that we can be proud of \u2018\n\nBy Bassey Inyang\n\nThe Governor of Cross River State, Professor Ben Ayade has given reasons why he defected from the Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress.\n\nAyade announced his defection on Thursday morning at the Executive Council Chamber of the Governor\u2019s office while hosting seven governors of the APC; among them Dr. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State; Senator Hope Uzodimma of Imo State; Hon. Simon Lalong of Plateau State; Abubakar Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State; Jigawa State Governor, Mohammed Badaru Abubakar; and the Chairman of APC National Caretaker Committee and Yobe State Governor, Mr. Mai Mala Buni.\n\nAlso present was the Minister of State for Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva.\n\nSome of the governors and the minister had stormed the state since Wednesday to lobby Ayade to join the ruling party in Nigeria.\n\nWhile announcing his decision to dump the PDP, Ayade declared that henceforth, Cross River State has become an APC state, and urged all his supporters and followers to go to their respective wards and register with his new party.\n\nBefore decamping formally to the APC, he held a two-hour meeting with the APC delegation led by the party\u2019s interim chairman and governor of Yobe State.\n\nOthers at the meeting were the state deputy governor, Prof Ivara Esu, Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Eteng Williams Jones and members of the state house of assembly, some National Assembly members, members of the Cross River State Executive Council members, local Government chairmen, councilors and some stakeholders, including Dame Princess Florence Ita-Giwa and High Chief Asuquo Ekpenyong amongst others.\n\nSpeaking on why he was joining the APC, Ayade highlighted the character and attributes of President Muhammadu Buhari and the realisation that Cross River, which has been emasculated economically following the ceding of its oil wells, needed to be in sync with the party at the center, as the main reasons for moving.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201chaving seen and known the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and his commitment to this country, his nationalistic disposition and all the efforts he has made to bring Nigeria to where we are today, it is obvious that at this point we needed to join hands with him to build a Nigeria that we can be proud of .\n\n\u201cWe need all governors to recognize that it is not party that matters. It is character, it is honor, it is commitment to the vision of this great nation. We all need to as a team work ahead of the president by working towards building a prosperous country that the succession worries of 2023 will come without the fears and the worries the international community has for us.\n\n\u201cI believe that if everyone of us as governor joins hands with Mr President, I think we can sit on the same dining table and fashion out a way to govern this country.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the development, an elated Buni said he and his team were in the state to formally welcome Governor Ayade to the APC.\n\nHis words: \u201cI am here on behalf of the APC family to welcome His Excellency the Executive Governor of Cross River State formally to the APC. As from today he is the leader of the party in the state. \u201d\n\nMinutes after his formal defection, Ayade took to the social media where he further explained why he dumped the PDP for the APC.\n\n\u201cThis morning I formally joined the All Progressives Congress. This decision was borne out of the need to bring Cross River State in sync with the policies and programs of the federal government. I believe that if everyone of us as governors joins hands with Mr President, I think we can sit on the same dining table and fashion out a way to govern this country.\n\n\u201cWe need all Governors to recognize that it is not party that matters. It is character, it is honor, it is commitment to the vision of this great nation.\n\n\u201cWe all need to as a team work ahead of the President by working towards building a prosperous country that the succession worries of 2023 will come without the fears and the worries the international community has for us,\u201d Ayade wrote on his Facebook page.\n\nFormer Leader of the 7th Senate of Nigeria, and Secretary, APC 2018 National Convention Planning Committee, Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba, SAN, a chieftain of the APC from the state has joined in welcoming Ayade into the party.\n\nIn a press statement issued by Ndoma-Egba on Thursday, he described Ayade\u2019s entry into the APC as a good development for the state.\n\nThe statement made available to journalists in Calabar read as follows:\n\n\u201cCongratulations Governor Ben Ayade:\n\nOn behalf of myself and political associates, I heartily congratulate Your Excellency, Senator Prof. Ben Ayade, Governor of Cross River State on your well thought out decision to formally defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC) today and join the league of Progressive Governors in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency will recall that Cross River State has always been in the mainstream of Nigeria politics. There is no gainsaying the fact that the past 6 years of being in the opposition has impacted the State negatively, even though you have consciously navigated the ship of governance in sync with the APC-led Federal Government. As a State, we can ill afford to remain in the opposition. I commend you for recognizing this fact and doing the needful for the good of our dear State.\n\n\u201cAs you join us in the Progressives fold, my expectation is that your coming will enrich our internal democracy and I enjoin you to be consultative, inclusive, democratic, transparent and accountable because these are the hallmarks of the All Progressives Congress family. I also expect that your presence in the APC will further strengthen the party and improve our electoral fortunes in Cross River State. I have no doubts that the APC family in the State has received you with open arms and will work with you to reposition our dear State on the path of unprecedented socioeconomic and sociopolitical development.\n\n\u201cOur core objective remains forging a stronger, united and formidable APC that will deliver the dividends of good governance to all Cross Riverians irrespective of political affiliation, ethnicity and religion. I trust that you are well in tandem with this.\n\n\u201cOnce again, congratulations and welcome to the All Progressives Congress.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Nothing can be more disconcerting. This outburst should, ordinarily, not elicit response from reasonable people who know the distinction between a legitimate business that is not in anyway injurious and a certain predilection for anarchy.\n\n\u201cClinging to an anachronistic model of animal husbandry, which is evidently injurious to harmonious relationship between the herders and the farmers as well as the local populace, is wicked and arrogant.\n\n\u201cComparing this anachronism, which has led to loss of lives, farmlands and property, and engendered untold hardship on the host communities, with buying and selling of auto parts is not only strange. It, annoyingly, betrays a terrible mindset.\n\n\u201cMr Malami is advised to approach the court to challenge the legality of the laws of the respective states banning open grazing and decision of the Southern Governor Forum taken in the interest of their people. We shall be most willing to meet him in court.\n\n\u201cThe decision to ban open grazing stays.

He used variations of a single email address in a manner intended to evade automatic detection by fraud systems.\n\nUsing this practice, Rufai allegedly made it appear that each claim was connected with a different email account.\n\nThe US Department of Justice stated on its website that Rufai caused the fraud proceeds to be paid out to online payment accounts such as 'Green Dot' accounts or wired to bank accounts controlled by 'money mules'. Some of the proceeds were then mailed to the Jamaica, New York address of Rufai's relative.\n\nLaw enforcement determined that more than $288,000 was deposited into an American bank account controlled by Rufai between March and August 2020.\n\n\"Greed is a powerful motivator.

          "title": "Stax wants you to enjoy USSD with better design, without ever dialling codes again",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nMost people who started using mobile phones in the 2000s became familiar with USSD through loading and checking airtime balance. With time, mobile banking became a major use case; again for airtime transactions, but also for buying internet data, sending money and paying bills.\n\nUnlike mobile apps that need to be downloaded and installed, USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, if you insist) is lightweight and straightforward to use.\n\nDial the code for the desired service, follow the instructions e.g. \u201cpress 1 to Check Balance\u201d on each page and, provided there isn\u2019t some \u201cconnection failure\u201d or \u201centry error\u201d, your wishes will come true.\n\nA misconception is that USSD is for people who use basic phones but the feature has become mainstream even among smartphone users in Africa. A study of smartphone users in Bangladesh, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa showed that 87% of all financial-related transactions were conducted via USSD, with only 13% via mobile app.\n\nSo, USSD works well. But it still has its fair share of frustrating glitches that you normally wouldn\u2019t encounter on an app. For one, you need to memorise the code for each service you want to access. You could minimise an app to get information from, say, your notes app. But you mostly can\u2019t minimise a USSD session once it\u2019s started.\n\nUSSD\u2019s original design did not foresee \u201chow the introduction of smartphones would bridge the worlds of computing and telecommunications to form an entirely new industry,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi explains.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say we should throw it away. On the contrary, some companies recognise that USSD is here to stay in Africa. As such, they are merging the best of both worlds: stacking the visual appeal and interactivity of smartphones on top of USSD\u2019s simple and efficient backend.\n\nOne such company is Hover, a US-based company, and their solution is called Stax.\n\nMaking USSD smart\n\nStax is a mobile app currently available only to Android users in 10 countries, including Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. It has three use cases: buy airtime, send money, and request money. All without ever dialling any USSD code.\n\nStax\u2019s main promise is that users never have to dial a code again\u2026 while enjoying USSD.\n\nIt\u2019s not a digital wallet or account, so it doesn\u2019t ask for an email address or phone number. But \u2013 and this is an important but \u2013 Stax needs certain phone permissions.\n\nWhat permissions? Three precisely: to make and manage phone calls; send and view messages; and access your contacts.\n\nWith those enabled, you can input how much airtime you want to buy, choose the bank or fintech-powered account you want to debit and input the phone number to credit or select from your phonebook.\n\nIt would be great if this is where it ends but \u2013 somewhat unfortunately \u2013 Stax asks for two other permissions to complete this task of buying airtime. Permission to display on top of other apps on your phone and another to connect with mobile money and telecom services on your behalf.\n\nThis gave me pause and maybe it is because of the copy: \u201cAllow Stax to have full control of your device?\u201d\n\nThree paragraphs beneath that question describe why the permission is needed. But all the bad news I have absorbed about privacy risks over the past four years flashed before my eyes, discouraging me from clicking \u201cAllow.\u201d\n\nJess Shorland, co-founder of Hover, agrees that some work needs to be done to make users more comfortable with the permissions. But she has an explanation for why they are necessary:\n\n\u201cIt allows us to automate the USSD session on behalf of the user. We\u2019ve basically built a different interface for USSD. The user interacts with that interface in a way that is a lot more screen-reader friendly.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one big permission request\n\nIn other words, the accessibility permission is what enables Stax to do these things on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\nWhen a user gives Stax access, the app activates a screen reading functionality and acts as a web browser. USSD is still happening in the background but instead of presenting those USSD screens, Stax\u2019s SDK reads the USSD dialog, runs the functions and shows the user a familiar app interface.\n\nBut what are the risks? Because there is no way to convince a user that giving up control doesn\u2019t somehow make them a little vulnerable. Shorland says Stax only takes the information needed to enable the user complete their transaction.\n\n\u201cEverything happens client side, not on our servers. It\u2019s also what enables us to be offline,\u201d she says, emphasizing that the app is open-source as a sign of transparency.\n\nWho in Africa needs Stax?\n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of cool that Stax, a fintech app, works offline like regular USSD. But with the internet being more central to the digital and financial services space today, why should we cheer for Stax?\n\nHover CEO and co-founder Ben Lyon says they are \u201cbuilding for the world as it is today so that we can bridge it to where it ought to go.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, there were 159 million monthly active mobile money accounts in Africa, according to the GSM Association. Africa represents more than half of the global mobile money usage.\n\nLyon thinks such numbers and smartphone usage \u2013 expected to double to 678 million by the end of 2025 \u2013 will make USSD even more mainstream. \u201cIt is a standard view of the tech industry that USSD is a bygone thing. It is actually just categorically wrong.\u201d\n\nIf that view is wrong as he insists and if USSD\u2019s user experience needs to be modernised for the smartphone age, then solutions like Stax would seem right on time.\n\nStax wants the app to be under 10MB so that it will work easily on every (Android) phone. Average transaction time is supposed to be 12 seconds.\n\nMy airtime purchase this morning took a bit longer. It showed a transaction failure message at the end and my bank debited me two seconds later. But I got the airtime.\n\nStax is\u2026 a work in progress\n\nAs of today, Stax currently supports transactions for eight banks (Access, First, Guaranty, Keystone, Sterling, UBA, Wema, Zenith), OPay and Paga.\n\nBeing in the USSD business in Nigeria means getting into the CBN (banks) vs NCC (telcos) scuffle around who pays for USSD services. What does Hover think about this debate?\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that USSD is about accessibility and inclusion, I believe strongly that consumers should not pay to access the channel,\u201d Lyon says.\n\n\u201cI hope NCC and other players come around to this view that consumers should not pay.\u201d\n\nOutside of that and other potential headaches, Stax\u2019s focus will be on convincing individuals and businesses that the app is reliable for all seasons and geographies, regardless of internet connection, says Peace Itimi, who leads growth for the product.\n\n\u201cWe are not monetizing Stax yet and it\u2019s not on the near term roadmap to monetize it,\u201d Lyon says. \u201cThere is a WhatsApp sized opportunity here and our first priority is to make sure we can seize the opportunity at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBen also name-drops WeChat as a possible inspiration for monetization. With a large user base, Stax could begin enabling discovery and access to third party services, in what could make Stax a super app of sorts.\n\n\u201cWhen people understand what the product can do, they will fall in love with it,\u201d Itimi says.\n\nThat depends: on how they fix those curious accessibility permissions, and if people really feel the need to switch from basic USSD \u2013 which works okay \u2013 to a shinier, app-enabled life.",

          "title": "Many people have one concern: NITDA warns Nigerians against digital colonialism as Whatsapp\u2019s new privacy policy takes effect",
          "text": "Whatsapp has been more subtle about telling users to sign new terms of service but NITDA says some dangers remain\n\nIn January 2021, users of the popular instant messaging app Whatsapp got notifications about new terms of service and an updated privacy policy. The notification came with the warning that if users did not accept the new terms by February 8, they would lose access to the app.\n\nWhen you\u2019re one of the world\u2019s most popular apps and owned by Facebook, a company many people distrust, that sort of announcement will hog headlines. There\u2019s also the fact that many tech users are becoming concerned about privacy and the kind of data apps collect about them.\n\nSo for a few weeks, we saw articles suggesting that people should switch to apps like Telegram and Signal, which do not collect as much information on their users. As a result, Signal saw a rush of downloads.\n\nAlthough the pushback was intense, Whatsapp did not budge on its terms and privacy policy; instead, it decided to soft-pedal on the new terms of use and be more subtle about getting users to sign it.\n\nWhatsapp still wants you to agree to new terms\n\nIn the weeks leading up to a new deadline of May 15, Whatsapp began sending reminders to users as an in-app notification. While it will no longer block users from using the app if they don\u2019t agree to the new terms, it will restrict some functionalities.\n\nThe company said in a blog post in May, \u201cfor the last several weeks, we\u2019ve displayed a notification in WhatsApp providing more information about the update. After giving everyone time to review, we\u2019re continuing to remind those who haven\u2019t had the chance to do so to review and accept. After several weeks, the reminder people receive will eventually become persistent.\u201d\n\nWhatsapp is swapping its forceful method and wants to send reminders until users agree. Yet, countries are still concerned, and in Nigeria, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NIDTA) issued a statement Tuesday about Whatsapp.\n\n\u201cWhatsApp users are at liberty to decide on giving consent to the processing of their data based on the new privacy policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) recognises; we have consent (a clear, unambiguous expression of privacy terms communicated by the controller and accepted by the Data Subject) as one of the lawful basis for data processing. Acceptance of the new privacy policy and terms of use implies that users\u2019 data would now be shared with Facebook and other third parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsers will now be subject to the terms and policies of Facebook and other receiving entities with or without being direct subscribers to such services.\u201d\n\nNITDA is wary of new policy\n\nAt the heart of the new terms, Whatsapp wants to become a place where businesses directly sell to customers. Small businesses will have virtual storefronts, while bigger businesses will be able to integrate Whatsapp into their existing technology stack.\n\nIn a statement, NITDA published some portions of Whatsapp\u2019s new policy\n\nOne concern many people have is whether Facebook will have access to their Whatsapp chats, but the company insists that messages on the IM platform are encrypted end-to-end. Yet, NITDA says users should \u201climit the sharing of sensitive personal information on private messaging and social media platforms as the initial promise of privacy is being overridden on the basis of business exigencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cNITDA is exploring all options to ensure Nigerians do not become victims of digital colonialism,\u201d the agency added in its statement.\n\nIt is not clear what these options are. For now, the choice ultimately lies with users who will determine how to guard their privacy as WhatsApp\u2019s new rules go into effect.",

I have lost all my gains this year and the last in a few hours.\u201d\n\nIndeed Bitcoin has now lost all of the gains made since February 8, the day Tesla announced it would accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for its highly-demanded cars. In the three months since, BTC rose steadily.\n\nThat rising tide drove up the value of other currencies. The biggest beneficiary of the Elon Musk-fueled bull market was Dogecoin, whose value rose an incredible 12,000% between January and the first week of May. $1,000 (\u20a6380,000) worth of Doge in January was worth $121,000 (\u20a646 million) just a few weeks ago.\n\nBut Musk has caused a different kind of turbulence, 49 days after that boom announcement.\n\nAt 11 pm on May 12, Musk tweeted ominously that Tesla will not be accepting Bitcoin for car payments. The reason given was that because Bitcoin takes a lot of energy to mine, it would be unfitting for a company that sells electric cars to directly encourage activities that potentially harm the environment.\n\nAnd just like that, the Cryptoverse has been in a tailspin.\n\nFrancis, a 21-year-old medical student, says more than half the value of his coins have vanished with Wednesday\u2019s dip. He is taking it cheerfully, mustering some laughter on our call. He suspects some foul play has fueled the dip.\n\n\u201cThis dip is because crypto whales have sold off en masse. After this dip, they will re-buy and make gains. I think this thing is planned.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence at the moment of a coordinated sell-off by BTC holders. Observers and long-time holders believe the cryptocurrency market is merely experiencing a correction, a tendency familiar with veteran stock market traders.\n\n\u201cThe case for Bitcoin hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Eloho Omame, co-founder of FirstCheck Africa, a Nigerian startup investment firm, told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cCrypto markets were always volatile. So honestly it\u2019s not fun, but it\u2019s not unexpected. Long term, I\u2019m bullish. So it doesn\u2019t really matter what happens today.\u201d\n\nThat feeling \u2013 that this dip is not abnormal or catastrophic \u2013 has helped keep heads cool even as crypto exchange apps continue to look bloody. Despite the crash in value, holders only lose when they sell off their assets at the current prices.\n\nThe second part of the Asemota tweet mentioned above projected strength: \u201cStill buying the dip on margin though. Worst case, I lose everything. Best case, I can afford another condo.\u201d (He explained his risk calculus in a follow-up tweet).\n\nOther bruised holders like Francis are confident of a rebound. \u201cThe only thing I can do [is] HODL,\u201d an acronym popular among crypto enthusiasts that could be interpreted as Hold On for Dear Life.\n\nOgechukwu is also holding on, saying he is in the game for the long haul. \u201cI won\u2019t be selling. I know I will still grow but looking at the value still makes my stomach churn.\u201d\n\nWhile it is mainly a consumer affair, Dip Day affects crypto companies who facilitate trades. Binance experienced network congestion on Wednesday (I tried to sign up, unsuccessfully). ETH and ERC20 withdrawals were temporarily disabled for about an hour.\n\nTomiwa Lasebikan, co-founder of Buycoins, a Nigerian crypto exchange, is looking beyond the moment.\n\n\u201cWhat matters is my long term thesis and aggressively improving the tech so it\u2019s tangibly accessible to as many people as possible around the world,\u201d he told TechCabal.\n\nWhat does Musk, the unanimous hero and villain of this story so far, think of all this?\n\nTesla has \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 19, 2021\n\nWhich, in the crypto world, is another code for \u201cHODL!\u201d",

          "text": "ZOLA Electric, one of Africa\u2019s leading renewable energy providers, has launched a robust distribution scheme to drive market penetration and access to its product in its quest to provide clean, effective, and reliable power anywhere.\n\nOlufemi Ashipa, Ag. Managing Director, ZOLA Electric Nigeria\n\nAlready, ZOLA Electric has signed into their distribution network some of the leading distributors of solar and renewable products across Nigeria and has opened its doors to onboard even more. Blue Camel, a leading provider of renewable energy solutions including PV panels, solar streetlights, solar home systems, and a major distributor for global solar brands, was recently signed into the scheme. Blockchain, Black bit Solar, Shokenny Solutions, Enersys Energy, Solarmate Energy, and SOSAI Renewables are already in different stages of the distribution partnership.\n\nAlmost half the population has no access to electricity. The rest of the Nigerian population is grossly underserved by the electricity grid. As a result, diesel generators are the default source of power, with an estimated 100 million people currently relying on diesel generators each day (GTM, 2019). According to Nigeria\u2019s Rural Electrification Agency (REA, 2017), the use of these generators collectively costs Nigeria\u2019s households and businesses nearly USD 14 billion every year, while the Energy to Access Institute (Dalberg, 2019) estimates that fuel subsidies for small gasoline-powered generators cost the government USD 1.6-2.2 billion each year. Besides the economic costs, diesel generators entail significant health risks including lung disorders caused by emissions, as well as environmental risks including air and noise pollution. Diesel generators produce about 29 million metric tonnes of CO2 emissions each year in Nigeria, a total comparable to the annual emissions from 6.3 million passenger vehicles.\n\nSigning on distribution partners will contribute significantly to help bridge the electricity supply deficit by expanding access to ZOLA\u2019s innovative power solutions across the country.\n\nThe move by the brand, which currently serves over one million users across three continents in over ten countries, is part of its efforts to boost its current market operation, as well as provide reliable power solutions to markets that lack energy access and make it possible for homes and businesses across Africa and anywhere in the world to generate, store and consume energy sustainably.\n\nAdebimpe Adebisi, Business Development Manager, ZOLA Electric Nigeria; Olumide Ajayi, Group Director, Technical Operations, ZOLA Electric; Enobong Kennedy, Group Marketing Director, ZOLA Electric; Olufemi Ashipa, Ag. Managing Director, ZOLA Electric Nigeria and Natasha Amaefuna, Business Development Manager, ZOLA Electric during the ZOLA Electric Media Meet at the ZOLA Experience Centre in Lagos on Tuesday, May 18, 2021.\n\nCommenting on the development, the Ag. Managing Director, ZOLA Electric Nigeria, Olufemi Ashipa, said; \u201cThe solar space in Nigeria has come a long way from the days of using dirty and expensive power resources to clean energy sources, offering modular and scalable technology. Since many customers do not have existing appliances, ZOLA is able to offer a closed-loop system that guarantees a certain baseline of performance and runtime. At ZOLA, we are driven by the desire to provide Africa\u2019s most extensive off-grid renewable differentiated power solutions to people anywhere. We understand that power is pivotal to accelerating the overall socio-economic development of the continent, so we have designed the ZOLA Infinity and ZOLA Flex, for this purpose.\u201d\n\nHe added that: \u201cThe ZOLA power solutions help to provide customers with steady electricity supply in any situation. The ZOLA technology-driven solutions backed with superior power storage and dynamic energy charging system were conceived at Oxford University and designed in Silicon Valley. They are easy to install, scalable, and help the average home or business bridge their power deficit.\n\n\u201cWith ZOLA currently powering more than 1 million people; comprising over 200,000 homes and businesses across Tanzania, Rwanda, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, and Nigeria, we are poised to actualise our objective providing 24 hour clean power anywhere and help the continent realise her untapped potentials.\u201d\n\nABOUT ZOLA ELECTRIC\n\nZOLA Electric is the leading renewable energy technology company in Africa and our overarching purpose is to help our end-user and distributor customers power homes and businesses and stay connected with clean, affordable, and reliable Power Anywhere. By providing affordable and accessible distributed smart storage + solar technology, ZOLA helps the average home or business leapfrog the grid.\n\nZOLA designs distributed renewable energy solutions based on the latest in smart storage, solar and power electronics technology. Adaptable to energy needs and income.\n\nStarting out 8 years ago by providing solar home solutions to off-grid rural communities in Tanzania, ZOLA has evolved into a technology company whose products can solve an energy access problem. We partner with leading companies to distribute our products globally.\n\nZOLA powers more than 1 million people each day and more than 200,000 homes and businesses across Sub-Saharan Africa. ZOLA is a recipient of the UNFCCC Momentum for Change Award and the Zayed Future Energy Prize.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTelda raises $5m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "[SPONSORED] ASUS unveils the latest dual-screen laptop series \u2014 ZenBook Duo 14 (UX482)",
          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nThe ASUS range of laptops has shown me that style can meet performance but with the ASUS 2021 ZenBook Duo 14, you can get everything you need in optimum laptop technology. This device comes with a wide range of new features and key upgrades on features we are already familiar with across the board.\n\nExceptional Look and Feel\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a device with a cool and sophisticated finish, ASUS 2021 ZenBook Duo 14 is what you should watch out for. It comes in a distinct interior that creates more efficient functionalities; some of which comprise an ErgoLift, an AAS plus hinge, along with numerous high-performance components.\n\nAnother feature that makes the device a true beauty is the minimalist design and setup. For one, the ASUS 2021 ZenBook Duo 14, though built with more top-end components, is smaller and lighter in size. It weighs only 1.6 kg and is 16.9 mm slim, which is 50gr lighter and 3 mm slimmer than the previous version.\n\nImproved ASUS ScreenPadTM Plus\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the ScreenPadTM Plus. The ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 comes with a screen upgrade; something to really get you curious as to how it was done and how it would work. The engineers keyed into the perception that most laptop users like to multi-task hence why they cracked the code of creating 2 screens in one device \u2013 the Main Display Screen and the ScreenPad Plus. While the Main Display screen can flip to 120 degrees, the ScreenPad Plus is 12.6 inches in size, 400 nits in brightness, and elevates at a 7-degree radius, giving you the chance to view both screens at the same time when working on both displays.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this won\u2019t be possible without the hinge. This laptop comes with a Zinc Alloy Hinge which enables both the Main Screen and the ScreenPad to move seamlessly. That\u2019s made possible through the 3-linked structure that enables the laptop have a better thermal efficiency and unique visual experience. This hinge is 30% smaller than the previous ASUS ZenBook version and this makes this current laptop 3mm smaller.\n\nOne of the best things you will enjoy about the ScreenPad is the ScreenXpertTM Control Center which gives you the ability to minimize tasks on the task bar seamlessly. The Control Center can also be manually adjusted to sit in any position on the screen and can also be customized to include more buttons \u2013 all at your preference. Some of the features you\u2019ll see on this Control Center include Brightness Control, App Navigator, Task Swap, Activate Touchpad, Task Group, Link to MyASUS, Keyboard Lock, and Settings. Did I also mention \u2013 the ScreenPad also comes with a Handwriting feature that recognizes handwritings and transcribes it to typed text.\n\nImproved Ventilation\n\nThe ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 has been designed to increase airflow by 49%; that makes it more than the previous versions. One reason is the hinge which makes the screen better elevated; another reason is the Active Aerodynamic System (AAS+) which makes the touchscreen responsible for the improved cooling system. The improved ventilation system makes it possible for you to use your laptop for as long as you desire without the laptop wearing out.\n\nThe thermal functionality of the ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 is another reason why it can barely ever heat up. When you open your laptop for use, you can see the new thermal design that accommodates 2 blades each with 59 blades and a wider heat pipe at \u00d810mm that improves airflow.\n\nFrameless Display\n\nThe ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 also features a 14-inch FHD display bound by 4mm NanoEdge bezels \u2013 one of the slimmest edges you\u2019ll ever come across which also gives you a screen to body ratio of 93%. It also comes at a maximum brightness level of 400 nits as well as PANTONE validation for colour accuracy. With all of these, your eyes are safe as the device passed the TUV Rheinland Eye Care Certification.\n\nStronger Wi-Fi\n\nThe ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 features the Wi-Fi Master technology as it possesses an in-built Wi-Fi 6 for faster network transmittance and also a Wi-Fi SmartConnect feature which gives you a strong network connection from longer distances, with reduced fluctuations, and seamless work experience.\n\nAIPT \u2013 The Secret to Performance\n\nWhat makes the ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 boost its CPU Power Settings from the standard 15W to 28W? it\u2019s clearly the ASUS Intelligent Performance Technology (AIPT) component which it possesses. This feature adjusts power consumption according to loading status and temperature such that your laptop works effectively given any kind of workload and temperature. The AIPT also comes with smart sensors that not only possesses AAS Plus for heat dissipation but also possesses smart sensors that detect any form of heat within any part of the device real-time and adjusts the power consumption output to prevent any form of overheating.\n\nA Webcam with The Perfect Position\n\nOne other thing that makes the ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 a device worth using is its webcam and that\u2019s obvious as 76% of laptop users use webcams at least once a month. This key component stands at a top bezel position and supported with a bottom-mounted camera to give you the perfect view whenever you use it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSurprisingly, this webcam is ultra-thin but possesses a 4-element lens, giving you sharper images as well as lower noise in the graphics and resolution. It has an Advanced Infrared feature embedded in to enable you to be seen when using the webcam in a dark place. This IR component also possesses a facial recognition technology that enables you login to the device with just your face; even at dark spots.\n\nAmazing Audio\n\nThe audio system of the new ZenBook Duo 14 has been carefully tuned by experts from the ASUS Golden Ear team and certified by audio specialists Harman Kardon to ensure the very best sound for all kinds of content. The dual speakers of the ZenBook Duo 14 are driven by a dual-channel \u201csmart\u201d amplifier that allows the maximum volume possible while preventing long-term damage to the sensitive voice coils of the speakers. It also possesses an AI optimized noise cancelling functionality which works best when you\u2019re having a virtual meeting in a noisy environment. This feature doesn\u2019t allow anyone to hear the noise within your location whenever you stream.\n\nMyASUS \u2013 Your reliable guide\n\nThis device, like any other ASUS spec, gives you unrestricted access to the MyASUS portal where you can ask any questions and access any kind of resources online about how to use your device and achieve the best results from it. MyASUS is accessible 24 hours of the day and the support responds real-time.\n\nCutting-Edge Specifications\n\nThere are a lot of things that speak for the distinctness and functionality of the ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 which also proves that it\u2019s a device you need to have around you. Here are some key facts you must know about the device:\n\nCPU: The laptop comes in 11th Gen Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 processors, particularly at Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i7-1165G7 and Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i5-1135G7 both of which possess AIPT sustained TDP boost to 28W as opposed to other devices which come at 15W. The new processors improve modern creative workflows with Intel\u00ae Deep Learning Boost AI acceleration and AV1 media encoding and decoding technology.\n\nHigh Speed Memory: The ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 supports up to Up to 32 GB LPDDR4X 4266MHz and fast 4266 MHz LPDDR4X clock speeds to provide plenty of processing power.\n\nDisplay: In addition to the NanoEgde functionality, the ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 also possesses a 14-inch FHD anti-glare touchscreen with 100% sRGB colour gamut and 400nits brightness level.\n\nHigh Speed SSD: The device comes with up to 1TB PCle 3.0 x4 NVMe SSD.\n\nGraphics: The NVIDIA GeForce MX450 component of this device gives you a crisp and clear look and feel. In addition, it\u2019s capable of accelerating workloads as well as faster, smoother gaming and content creation. It also works seamlessly with NVIDIA\u00ae Optimus\u00ae technology to give you the perfect balance between long battery life and performance.\n\nPorts: Accessibility is one of the key benefits you get from using the ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 as it comes with 2 x Thunderbolt\u2122 4 USB-C (of up to 40Gbps), 1 x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, 1 x full size HDMI 1.4, 1 x 3.5mm audio jack, 1 x microSD card reader, Intel\u00ae Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.0. This makes it possible for the device to easily output to a projector, monitor or TV, connect to storage devices or expand connections, all without dongles or adapters.\n\nBattery: This device can last you for as long as 17 hours without a power source. Thanks to the 70 Wh lithium-polymer battery it possesses. It has a 70-watt-hour battery and also offers a fast charge function that charges the battery from 0% to 60% in under 49 minutes.\n\nDimensions: Compact and portable, the ASUS ZenBook Duo 14 comes at a dimension of 324 x 222 x 16.9mm and weighs approximately 1.6kg.\n\nLearn More: https://www.asus.com/wa/Laptops/For-Home/ZenBook/ZenBook-Duo-14-UX482/\n\n#ASUSZenbookDuo14 #ZenbookDuo14 #ASUSZenbook #ZenbookDuo\n\nTelda raises $5m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "Why prices of crypto currencies are dropping",
          "text": "In the past few days, many crypto currencies have wiped off significant gains made since the beginning of the year renewing fears of the 2017 burst, where the price of bitcoin crashed from around $20,000 to below $3,500.\n\nBut experts say this time the price decline is different, as the market has stronger fundamentals and is coming into maturity on the back of institutional investments and growth in emerging market consumers.\n\n\u201cThis bitcoin bull run is not just from institutions,\u201d Marcus Swanepoel, CEO/co-founder of Luno, a global crypto currency exchange with a significant presence in emerging markets like Nigeria and other African countries, says in a tweet. \u201cOur (retail) volumes in South Africa, Malaysia, Nigeria, and Indonesia all trebled over last month and at all-time highs. Emerging market consumers are voting with their money and they\u2019re ready for a better financial system,\u201d Swanepoel notes.\n\nMore investors in the market mean renewed scrutiny into the workings of the very infrastructure that powers the market and how it is deployed. There are questions about environmental impact, use cases, illicit activity, and regulation.\n\nBitcoin, the most valuable crypto asset, has been the most affected with the price falling by over 30 percent from as high as $58,000 it recorded last week to around $36,000. It recovered on Wednesday towards $40,000 and settled around $40,229 on Thursday morning.\n\nAccording to Chainalysis, the end-of-day bitcoin price has fallen by over 25 percent over seven days on four other occasions since the start of 2017. These were December 24, 2017, when the price fell from the $20,000 peak of the 2017 bull run; February 5, 2018, when the price fell below $10,000 as the bull run ended; November 25, 2018, when the price went to $4,000 as crypto winter set in, and Mid-March 2020, when the price fell as low as $4,000 as financial markets reacted to COVID-19.\n\nEthereum price, which surged to an all-time high of $4,308 about seven days ago, dropped to $2,200 on Wednesday before recovering above $2,800. As of press time, the price was at $2,684 on Thursday.\n\nWhile the price fall at 30 percent is high, the price level of both Bitcoin and Ethereum is still significantly high at over $40,000 and $2,000 respectively. The price decline\n\nEnvironmental impact\n\nLong before Elon Musk and Tesla came along, there have been debates over the electricity consumption of bitcoin mining and the impact it has had on the environment and climate change.\n\nIt takes 10 minutes to mine one bitcoin. At 600 seconds (10 minutes), all things being equal, it will take 72,000GW (or 72 Terawatts) of power to mine a bitcoin using the average power usage provided by ASIC miners.\n\nIn explaining why it suspended bitcoin payments, Tesla said it was concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.\n\nA report by the BBC in February found that the bitcoin network consumes 121.4TWh of power per year, which means that it would be the 29th highest energy-consuming country in the world, above Argentina and below Norway.\n\nIt is however important to also acknowledge that fiat currency printing and minting, gold mining, and the banking system consume far more energy than bitcoin mining.\n\nHowever, stakeholders in bitcoin mining and operations say the technology is built in such a way that it incentivises the use of clean power. This is because it is currently much cheaper than non-renewables, and in an industry with such significant financial rewards, this matters. Miners will always go wherever they can use the cheapest power, and they will move to those regions where power is cheapest.\n\nA report by payment firm, Square, also explains that renewable sources typically produce excessive supply when demand is low. Conversely, they struggle to provide enough when demand is high. The Square report recommends addressing divergent renewable production and demand for electricity by building an ecosystem \u201cwhere solar/wind, batteries, and bitcoin mining co-exist to form a green grid that runs almost exclusively on renewable energy.\u201d\n\nUse cases\n\nThe use cases of crypto currencies remain a concern of many institutional investors. In the past, the most uses for bitcoin have been as a speculative asset \u2013 investors stake capital in hopes of trading for high capital.\n\nBut crypto currencies like bitcoin have potential for transforming payments and remittance in the financial services sector. This is why the market continues to celebrate the entrance of payment institutions such as PayPal, Mastercard, and Visa in the market. US banks like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have also provided support for their investors in crypto currencies.\n\nData from Chainalysis show that institutional investors have spent $410 billion to acquire their current bitcoin holdings. $300 billion of this has made a loss at a price of $36,000. However, the remaining $110 billion in profit is greater than all that had been spent to acquire all bitcoin held in mid-March 2020, when the last major price fall occurred.\n\nIllicit activities\n\nThis is one sore spot that critics of crypto currencies easily spotlight. In Nigeria where authorities have taken a hard stance on the market, the financial regulator accuses crypto currencies of funding terrorism and kidnappings, two malaise fuelling insecurity in the largest country in Africa.\n\nIronically, long before crypto currencies became a trend in the country, fiat has funded criminal networks wreaking havoc, and also oiled the bank accounts of corrupt politicians. But the anonymity of crypto currencies is making it very attractive for criminals.\n\nCybercrimes are also rising with criminals demanding for payment in crypto currencies. A report on Ransomware 2021 by Chainalysis found that known payments to attackers rose 337 percent from 2019 to 2020, when they reached over $400 million worth of crypto currency. Ransomware is reportedly the fastest growing segment of cryptocurrency-related crime, with victim payments to attackers growing 311 percent to reach nearly $350 million worth of crypto currency.\n\n\u201cAttackers show no signs of slowing down in 2021, and have already taken in more than $81 million from victims so far this year. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that these are low-end estimates, and that the true numbers are almost certainly higher,\u201d the report released in May 2021, noted.\n\nIt is a challenge that many crypto currency operators are still scrambling for answers for. In the absence of regulation, crypto currency exchanges have since taken up the challenge to build their own security firewalls, these efforts have mostly paid off as the number of breaches has reduced significantly.\n\nRegulation\n\nInstitutional investors are also wary of regulatory positions that do not favour the crypto currency market. China, which has since 2017 flirted with the idea of not supporting crypto currency transactions, this week reiterated that financial institutions and payment companies were banned from providing services related to crypto currency transactions, and warned investors against speculative crypto trading.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) toed a similar prohibitive path in February 2021. India is also planning a review of regulation for the crypto currency market. The Indian government is reportedly looking at the possibility of regulating crypto currency. Unlike China and Nigeria, Indian authorities think a blanket ban recommended by former finance secretary Subhash Garg in 2019 has become out-dated.\n\n\u201cThere is a view within the government that the recommendations made by the Subhash Garg committee are data and a fresh look is needed at use of cryptos rather than a total ban,\u201d a source said.\n\nIn Nigeria, the government is not totally aligned with an outright ban of the market. The Vice President and many lawmakers have disagreed with the CBN on the prohibition, recommending regulations for the market instead.",

          "text": "Ondo State Governor and Atedo Peterside have faulted the comment by the attorney-general of the Federation, Abubakar Malami opposing the ban on open grazing. They have said such a view was deceptive.\n\nRecall that the Southern Governors forum took the decision in the meeting in Asaba, the Delta State capital recently; they had complained that the movement of armed herders, bandits into the Southern region had constituted security breaches which had affected the everyday lives of the people.\n\nOpen grazing is the archaic practice of moving ruminant animals in open fields, plains and bushes in search of pasture or foliage, in recent time it had led to clashes between farmers and herders across Nigeria with thousands of lives lost, while thousands have also been displaced from their ancestral homes.\n\nBut speaking in an interview on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today Programme Wednesday, Malami, noted that such a decision would not stand because it violates Nigerians right to free movement, violating the provision of the law of the country.\n\nHowever, in a tweet Thursday, Atedo noted that the constitutional right to movement of people does not correspond to the free movement of cattles and destruction of properties across the country.\n\n\u201cIt is disingenuous to link a ban on open grazing to the constitutional right to the free movement of persons. The later does not extend to the free movement of cattle, goats, sheep etc through farms with the attendant destruction of somebody\u2019s harvest,\u201d Atedo said.\n\nAkeredolu, who is the chairman of Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, spoke in a statement he personally signed on Thursday, titled, \u2018Our decision is irreversible and will be enforced\u2019.\n\nThe Ondo Governor, urged the AGF to challenge the Southern Governor\u2019s position on open grazing in court, stressing that Malami\u2019s view on the issue was wicked considering the problems and damage of open grazing to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI have just read the press statement credited to the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Shehu Malami SAN on the resolution of the Southern Governors Forum to ban open grazing in their respective States.\n\n\u201cIt is most unfortunate that the AGF is unable to distill issues as expected of a Senior Advocate. Nothing can be more disconcerting. This outburst should, ordinarily, not elicit response from reasonable people who know the distinction between a legitimate business that is not in any way injurious and a certain predilection for anarchy.\n\n\u201cClinging to an anachronistic model of animal husbandry, which is evidently injurious to the harmonious relationship between the herders and the farmers as well as the local populace, is wicked and arrogant.\n\n\u201cComparing this anachronism, which has led to loss of lives, farmlands and property, and engendered untold hardship on the host communities, with buying and selling of auto parts is not only strange. It, annoyingly, betrays a terrible mindset,\u201dpart of Akeredolu\u2019s statement read.",

Nothing can be more disconcerting. This outburst should, ordinarily, not elicit a response from reasonable people who know the distinction between a legitimate business that is not in any way injurious and a certain predilection for anarchy.\n\n\u201cClinging to an anachronistic model of animal husbandry, which is evidently injurious to the harmonious relationship between the herders and the farmers as well as the local populace, is wicked and arrogant.\n\n\u201cComparing this anachronism, which has led to the loss of lives, farmlands, and property, and engendered untold hardship on the host communities, with buying and selling of auto parts is not only strange. It, annoyingly, betrays a terrible mindset.\n\n\u201cMr Malami is advised to approach the court to challenge the legality of the Laws of the respective States banning open grazing and decision of the Southern Governor Forum taken in the interest of their people. We shall be most willing to meet him in Court.\n\n\u201cThe decision to ban open grazing stays. It will be enforced with vigour.",

          "text": "Recently, more than 160 calves were born in Honggelbatel\u2019s Modern Joint Family Ecological Ranch, which will bring him an annual income of approximately 2 million yuan ($310,794).\n\nHonggelbatel, a herdsman from Zarut Banner, China\u2019s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, runs a family ecological ranch together with his brother and sister, which was gradually developed into a demonstration base for grassland ecological restoration in Horqin district.\n\nIn 2014, the joint ranch had more than 1,000 sheep and 300 cattle. However, the increase in the number of livestock also led to pressure on the pastures and the severe decline of the grassland ecology. Faced with the dual pressure of protecting the grassland and increasing income, Zarut Banner began to implement a policy of reducing sheep and increasing cattle.\n\nWhile other herders were still waiting to see, Honggelbatel made up his mind to sell all of his sheep. He adopted measures such as scientific livestock breeding, grassland grazing, and breed improvement. He also began to shift toward eco-tourism.\n\n\u201cSheep eat a lot of grass and shave grass roots, but cows eat the tip, which will not affect the growth of the grass. The same grassland, different pressure. I used to raise more sheep, and it took nearly a million yuan to buy forage. Under the guidance of the government and experts, we continue to improve the breeds, to raise fewer but better cattle, which not only improves economic efficiency but also protects the ecological environment,\u201d Honggelbatel said.\n\n\u201cLiving a happy life is the primary human right,\u201d as President Xi Jinping pointed out in his congratulatory letter to the symposium marking the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. China embraces a human rights philosophy that centers on the people, and regards the rights to subsistence and development as the basic human right of paramount importance.\n\nContrary to the unfounded allegations in Western media in recent years, the facts in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region show that the cause of human rights in China has made headway on all fronts. Several measures proved that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been fully committed to implementing China\u2019s Human Rights Action Plan from 2016 to 2020, respecting and safeguarding the rights of ethnic minorities to use and develop their own cultures and languages, and protecting and caring for the rights of disadvantaged groups.\n\nNowadays, the family ecological ranch of Honggelbatel is continuously expanding, with modern facilities readily available. Relying on beautiful natural scenery and transportation advantages, Honggelbatel has built several yurts on the ranch and started a pastoral tourism industry, receiving thousands of tourists every year. He took the initiative to provide stable jobs for the surrounding poor households and lead them to improve their lives together.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Mongolian herder Hein helps out on the ranch from May to October every year during the peak tourist season. With the help of the government\u2019s poverty alleviation policy, he moved from an earthen house to the new building, and now he has a stable job. \u201cThanks to the good policies of CPC and government, there is nothing to worry about in my life,\u201d Hein said.\n\nAt the same time, ethnic Mongolian women are more confident while their living conditions are improved and their own cultural characteristics are vigorously promoted.\n\nSince participating in Mongolian embroidery skills training organized by the Horqin Right Wing Middle Banner government, Liu Menglan\u2019s embroidery had increased the family\u2019s income by about 20,000 yuan per year. In 2017, Liu Menglan started learning Mongolian embroidery, and has now become a first-level embroiderer. She has taught more than 70 apprentices.\n\nIn 2019, Liu\u2019s family has been completely lifted out of poverty. \u201cIn the past, dry days caused poor harvests, life was sad and difficult. In recent years, with the help of the government, we moved into a new house and learned new skills. My husband has been hired as a forest ranger,\u201d Liu said. \u201cI am living a happy life out of my past expectation.. Every day is full of hope. If there is any dissatisfaction, I would say, it will be better to learn embroidery earlier!\u201d\n\nToday, nearly 30,000 women in Xing\u2019an League, North China\u2019s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, have gathered to learn and pass on Inner Mongolia\u2019s intangible cultural heritage like embroidery and paper cutting.\n\n\u201cThe greatest benefit of the promotion of Mongolian intangible cultural heritage by the government is that it has improved production methods in rural areas that have been dominated by male labor for a long time. Now, more women can participate in the economic development and cultural revitalization of their hometown,\u201d said Bai Jingying, director of the Standing Committee of the Horqin Right Wing Middle Banner People\u2019s Congress and leader of a Mongolian embroidery group.",

          "text": "By Kingsley Chukwuka\n\nA group under the agies of Ogoni Libration Initiative, has said Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), will pay for the damages and air pollution done to the Ogoni environment.\n\nPresident of the Group, Dr. Fabeke Douglas stated this on Thursday in a statement while reacting to Shell\u2019s onshore exit from the Niger Delta.\n\nRecall that Shell on Wednesday opened a discussion with the Nigerian government after concluding that its onshore oil position in the Niger Delta is no longer worth the risk.\n\nThe Chief Executive of Shell Nigeria, Mr. Ben Beurden had said its local unit has divested around 50pc of its onshore Nigeria portfolio over the past 10 years as it grapples with long-running and persistent challenges of crude theft and pipeline sabotage, which it blames for oil spills.\n\n\u201cWhen law and order breaks down, when sabotage and theft is rife where you try to operate, no amount of effort that we put in can actually try to compensate for that\u201d Beurden said.\n\nReacting to Shell\u2019s position, Fabeke said the SPDC has just realized that remaining in the Niger Delta does not worth it after they have tapped all their resources and polluted their environment.\n\n\u201cThey must pay for the damages caused on our land: You just need to take a tour to understand the magnitude of the environmental abuse.

          "text": "By KEN EMORDI\n\nNigeria LNG Limited (NLNG) has signed Global Memoranda of Understanding (GMoU) with host communities that enable the communities to take ownership and drive sustainable community development with the active support of NLNG.\n\nThe Company, today in Port Harcourt, announced the first phase of the new agreements with the community stakeholders, comprising Ogbum-nu-Abali, Ubeta and Rumuji in Rivers State.\n\nUnder this framework, 10 clusters will ultimately be created to drive community-initiated projects through a Foundation that will have a Board of Trustees, Steering Committees, and Community Trusts. NLNG will provide funds for these clusters and also encourage them to seek additional funds from other donors to finance development initiatives in the respective communities.\n\nIn her remarks during the signing ceremony, Mrs Eyono Fatayi-Williams, NLNG\u2019s General Manager, External Relations and Sustainable Development, said the Company\u2019s commitment to its vision of \u201cbeing a global LNG Company, helping to build a better Nigeria\u201d is driving its passion for sustainable relationships with its partners in the community.\n\nShe stated that the GMoU would give each community leverage over developmental projects unique to its own needs. She said further that the agreements would contribute to changing the socio-economic terrain of the communities, providing jobs, and creating a conducive business environment for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cWe, at NLNG, are enthusiasts of participatory sustainable development where the community takes on a leadership role to drive its growth, with the support of NLNG. Each community will identify its development needs and work out implementation through partnerships and physical oversight of projects. We intend to mentor the communities through partnerships with non-governmental agencies and international development agencies to build capacity in managing projects and sustaining outcomes.\n\n\u201cThe development of the communities by the communities and for the communities is a win-win strategy for everyone. It will re-build the basic value of shared responsibility and ownership of development initiatives, thereby ensuring that our hearts and minds are involved in the sustainable development of our communities. We need to change the narrative on sustainable development in the Niger-Delta region and Nigeria as a whole,\u201d she said.\n\nMrs Fatayi-Williams stated that the Company would continue to pursue sustainable development within its CSR framework, which hinges on four pillars: education, health, economic empowerment, and infrastructure development.\n\nShe added that the GMoU would create a safe and peaceful environment for all stakeholders to thrive and meet both development and business goals.\n\nSpeaking at the occasion, the Honorable Commissioner of Chieftaincy and Community Affairs, Rivers State, Hon. Sam Ejekwu, represented by the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Mr. Ndu Alawari, commended NLNG and communities for peacefully agreeing to the GMoU. He stated that the GMoU was in the right direction for the development of communities in the state. He described the GMoU as a partnership between the company and the government to drive sustainable development.\n\nThe GMoU shall cover NLNG\u2019s operational-related activities and CSR programmes and projects, except for the NLNG Post Primary, Undergraduate and Post-Graduate Scholarships which are flagship schemes that support the Company\u2019s vision of helping to build a better Nigeria.\n\nPhase two of the GMoU agreements will cover Amadi-Ama, and some communities in Ogba, Ekpeye, Kalabari, Egi, Abua, Okrika and Emohua.\n\nNLNG is owned by four Shareholders; namely, the Federal Government of Nigeria, represented by Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (49%), Shell Gas B.V. (25.6%), Total Gaz Electricite Holdings France (15%), and Eni International N.A. N. V.

          "text": "Public affairs analyst, Barr. Akugbe J. Osayande has described as executive lawlessness and rascality the refusal of State governors to implement executive order 10 on financial autonomy to State judiciary as signed by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nPresident Buhari had on Friday, May 22, 2020, signed the executive order 10 which granted financial autonomy to state assemblies and judiciary but State governors in a swift reaction held a meeting with President Buhari and attorney general of the Federation Abubakar Malami over the interpretation of the order.\n\nThe executive order mandated the state governors to always include the allocations of the legislature and the judiciary in the first-line charge of their budgets but the governors, who met under the aegis of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), rejected the president\u2019s order and described it as an unnecessary distraction.\n\nThis development had forced members of the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN), and the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) to embark on a nationwide indefinite strike forcing the closure of Federal High Courts in different states across the nation.\n\nBut legal expert, Barr. Osayande maintained that the governors by reason of their refusal to honor the dictate of the constitution on judicial independence have violated the oath of their office which they swore to uphold the constitution.\n\nSpeaking on the principle of separation of powers, Barr. Osayande insisted that since the constitution had contemplated that the three arms of government should be separate and independent, financial autonomy remains a very important component of independence and should be respected by the State executives.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way the judiciary can be independent if they are still tied to the apron string of the governors to get the money that belongs to them. I can\u2019t be independent of you when every time I need money you are the one giving me. So the law has given everybody that fraction of independence.\n\n\u201cWhat the governors are doing is contempt of court. The same court that made many of them who lost elections governors has given them an order to follow what the constitution says, yet they refused,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Public affairs analyst, Barr. Akugbe J. Osayande has described as executive lawlessness and rascality the refusal of State governors to implement executive order 10 on financial autonomy to State judiciary as signed by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nPresident Buhari had on Friday, May 22, 2020, signed the executive order 10 which granted financial autonomy to state assemblies and judiciary but State governors in a swift reaction held a meeting with President Buhari and attorney general of the Federation Abubakar Malami over the interpretation of the order.\n\nThe executive order mandated the state governors to always include the allocations of the legislature and the judiciary in the first-line charge of their budgets but the governors, who met under the aegis of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), rejected the president\u2019s order and described it as an unnecessary distraction.\n\nThis development had forced members of the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN), and the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) to embark on a nationwide indefinite strike forcing the closure of Federal High Courts in different states across the nation.\n\nBut legal expert, Barr. Osayande maintained that the governors by reason of their refusal to honor the dictate of the constitution on judicial independence have violated the oath of their office which they swore to uphold the constitution.\n\nSpeaking on the principle of separation of powers, Barr. Osayande insisted that since the constitution had contemplated that the three arms of government should be separate and independent, financial autonomy remains a very important component of independence and should be respected by the State executives.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way the judiciary can be independent if they are still tied to the apron string of the governors to get the money that belongs to them. I can\u2019t be independent of you when every time I need money you are the one giving me. So the law has given everybody that fraction of independence.\n\n\u201cWhat the governors are doing is contempt of court. The same court that made many of them who lost elections governors has given them an order to follow what the constitution says, yet they refused,\u201d he said.",

The AGF is quoted to have said that this reasoned decision, among others, is akin to banning all spare parts dealers in the Northern parts of the country and is unconstitutional.\n\nIt is most unfortunate that the AGF is unable to distill issues as expected of a Senior Advocate. Nothing can be more disconcerting. This outburst should, ordinarily, not elicit a response from reasonable people who know the distinction between a legitimate business that is not in any way injurious and a certain predilection for anarchy.\n\nClinging to an anachronistic model of animal husbandry, which is evidently injurious to harmonious relationship between the herders and the farmers as well as the local populace, is wicked and arrogant.\n\nComparing this anachronism, which has led to the loss of lives, farmlands, and property, and engendered untold hardship on the host communities, with buying and selling of auto parts is not only strange. It, annoyingly, betrays a terrible mindset.\n\nMr Malami is advised to approach the court to challenge the legality of the Laws of the respective States banning open grazing and the decision of the Southern Governor Forum taken in the interest of their people. We shall be most willing to meet him in Court.\n\nThe decision to ban open grazing stays. It will be enforced with vigour.\n\nSIGNED\n\nARAKUNRIN OLUWAROTIMI O AKEREDOLU, SAN\n\nGOVERNOR, ONDO STATE",

          "text": "The Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) on Wednesday said they are working to resolve issues surrounding the implementation of Executive Order 10.\n\nThis was disclosed in a communiqu\u00e9 signed by the Chairman of the forum Kayode Fayemi at the end of the 30th teleconference meeting.\n\nPresident Muhammadu had earlier in May 2020 signed an Executive Order granting financial autonomy to both the judicial and legislative arms of government at the state level.\n\nIn its statement, the NGF said talks on the order had reached an advanced stage with the Ministry of Labour, conference of speakers, and the National Judicial Council.\n\n\u201cOn Executive Order #10, talks have reached an advanced stage with the Ministry of Labour, Conference of Speakers, National Judicial Council, and the NGF. All parties are working earnestly to resolve the issues surrounding the implementation of the order.\n\n\u201cThere are however legal aspects of the order that need to be tied up, but which cannot take place if officials responsible for these final processes are on strike. Governors are happy to implement the demands of the Judiciary and the Legislature,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nThe NGF, however, resolved to call for the immediate dissolution of the presidential implementation committee on autonomy for state legislature and judiciary.\n\nSee below the full communique issued by the governors at the end of their meeting\u2026\n\nISSUED AT THE END OF THE 30th TELECONFERENCE MEETING OF THE NIGERIA GOVERNORS\u2019 FORUM (7th IN 2021) HELD ON WEDNESDAY, 19th MAY 2021.\n\nWe, members of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), at our meeting held today, deliberated on several matters of national concern and concluded as follows:\n\nThe NGF Chairman briefed the Forum on an ongoing consolidation exercise between the Forum and the Budget Office of the Federation to consolidate public finance data of the federal, states, and local governments into a national budget portal. He urged his colleagues to share details of their local government budgets and financial statements in addition to State government data already published. On Executive Order #10, talks have reached an advanced stage with the Ministry of Labour, Conference of Speakers, National Judicial Council, and the NGF. All parties are working earnestly to resolve the issues surrounding the implementation of the order. There are however legal aspects of the order that need to be tied up, but which cannot take place if officials responsible for these final processes are on strike. Governors are happy to implement the demands of the Judiciary and the Legislature. The NGF-NESG Economic Roundtable (NNER) Steering Committee was inaugurated on Wednesday 21st April 2021. The roundtable is a sub-national platform expression of the NGF and NESG, based on a Memorandum of Understanding that was signed between both institutions at the 23rd Nigerian Economic Summit (NES) in October 2017. The goal of the partnership is to promote strategic cooperation between State governments and the private sector to drive investments, economic growth, productivity, and shared economic reform agenda across the 36 States of the federation. Membership of the Steering Committee include governors of the 6 geopolitical zones and 6 captains of industry. The Governor of Delta State, H.E Dr. Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa, who is the Chairman of the NGF Sub-Committee interfacing with the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 provided an update to the Forum on the activities of the PSC, and informed members of the expected commencement of the administration of the second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the country, starting with those who received the first batch of the vaccine. The Governor noted that the PSC is currently working to get additional vaccine doses for the country, and he urged his colleagues to continue to maintain COVID public health guidelines to ensure that the transmission of the virus is kept at the lowest level possible presentations.\n\nThe Forum received a presentation from the Honourable Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mohammed Sabo Nanono, on the second phase of farmer enumeration for the Agric for Food and Jobs Plan (AFJP) which is a component of the Nigerian Economic Sustainability Plan (NESP) approved by Mr. President and the Federal Executive Council (FEC) on June 24, 2020. The programme is designed to help mitigate the impact of COVID 19 on smallholder farmers and the entire agricultural value chain. The 2nd phase enumeration is an extension of the 1st phase targeting the registration of up to 10 million farmers in the AFJP database. 2.4 million smallholder farmers were initially targeted for registration to be provided with input funding to boost food production, with about 30,000 N power (N Agro) graduates engaged and trained to carry out the farmer registration. The Forum also received presentations from the World Bank led by the Country Director for Nigeria, Shubham Chaudhuri, in the company of Prof. Foluso Okunmadewa, Sector Leader of the Human Development Team, and Yue Man Lee, Task Team Leader for the States Fiscal Transparency, Accountability, and Sustainability (SFTAS) \u2013 Program-for-Results (PforR) on the Nigeria Covid-19 Action Recovery and Economic Stimulus \u2013 Program for Results (Nigeria CARES) and SFTAS. The World Bank team commended the commitment and actions of State Governors for establishing and resourcing CARES programme State Coordinating Units under their Ministries of Planning, and requested for their additional support in areas such as the adoption of a Fund Release Policy for improved predictability of resources flows to CARES Delivery MDAs; adoption and institutionalization of protocols for reporting, management and investigation of fraud and corruption in MDAs implementing CARES; and the release of 2021 State budgets to MDAs for the commencement of CARES-related activities. The Bank also urged the support of Governors to ensure that their Ministries of Finance and Ministries of Justice fast track the execution of subsidiary agreements for the CARES programme. Updates on the SFTAS programme showed that targets for results and disbursements on the 2018 and 2019 Annual Performance Assessments (APA) and new COVID-19 2020 Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) have been exceeded. For the SFTAS 2020 APA and new COVID-19 DLIs, all 36 States are on track to fully meet the Eligibility Criteria of having National Chart of Account (NCOA) compliant FY2021 budget published online by 31 January 2021. (33 States have been confirmed as fully compliant while the remaining 3 States are being reviewed). Under the SFTAS Program for Results, 23 States have already passed strong state-level debt legislation which stipulates: 1) responsibilities for contracting state debt; 2) responsibilities for recording/reporting state debt; and 3) state fiscal and debt rules/limits. To help Nigeria successfully meet the World Bank Sustainable Debt Financing Policy (SDFP) by strengthening debt management, debt transparency, and fiscal responsibility at the state level, a strong collective commitment was made for the remaining 13 States to pass such state-level debt legislation by 31 December 2021. The NGF SFTAS Programme Lead, Olanrewaju Ajogbasile provided key lessons that have accounted for the success of performing States in the implementation of the SFTAS programme, including the institutionalization of a steering committee chaired by a very senior government official; high-level monitoring and ownership with regular briefings to the State Governor or State Executive Council; dedicated budget under the Ministry of Finance to support SFTAS operations; an incentivized environment for State government officials working on SFTAS activities; and the provision of basic ICT infrastructure arrangements for focal MDAs to ensure that they are able to access remote technical assistance and meet reform actions in time.\n\nHE Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir el-Rufai gave a briefing on the appropriate pricing of PMS in Nigeria, calling for full deregulation. He noted that between N70billion and N210billion is estimated to be spent every month to keep the PMS price at N162/litre, a situation that is completely unsustainable. Finally, the Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir el-Rufai briefed his colleagues on the Labour situation in Kaduna State Resolutions The NGF agreed on the need for States to meet their SFTAS obligations and resolved to put the necessary legal frameworks and institutions in place. The NGF agreed on the need to continue to maintain COVID public health guidelines and vaccination protocols to ensure that the transmission of the virus is kept at the lowest level possible. The NGF resolved to call for the immediate dissolution of the Presidential Implementation Committee on the Autonomy of State Legislature and Judiciary as this Committee is now acting as a permanent committee basically misguiding and overheating the relationship between State Governments and the other arms of government. On the Labour crisis in Kaduna State, the NGF noted that it stands with the Governor of Kaduna State in his quest to improve the productivity of workers and their rights for a better quality of life.\n\nNGF recognizes that what is happening in Kaduna State, will reverberate in each of the States and encourages the Governor of Kaduna and all other Governors to remain steadfast in the pursuit of human rights protection while ensuring that actions taken do not undermine the safety and security of lives. NGF appeals to both parties in Kaduna State to resolve the issues in the interest of the State as the protection of human rights for the collective good of all citizens and growth of our dear country, Nigeria, is what matters most.",

The BBC offers that today,\u201d Davie said.\n\nBashir has long been alleged to have used forged documents that suggested the palace staff were working against Princess Diana and being paid to spy on her.\n\nMatt Wiessler, a former graphic designer for the BBC, said he mocked up false bank statements after Bashir reached out to him.\n\nThursday\u2019s report found that Bashir also likely created another set of fake bank statements, which he again showed to Spencer.\n\nThe 1995 interview was a seismic moment in British public life. During the event, Diana told Bashir that there were \u201cthree of us\u201d in her marriage to Charles, referring to Camilla Parker Bowles, whom the heir to the throne would later marry.\n\nBuckingham Palace was blindsided by the interview and thrown into crisis by Diana\u2019s comments, which cast a rare light on the inner workings of the royal family.\n\nThe broadcaster launched an internal inquiry in 1996 and concluded that documents had been forged but didn\u2019t play a role in Diana\u2019s decision to participate in the interview.\n\nThe report is critical of both Bashir\u2019s behavior and of the way the 1996 probe was carried out by the BBC.\n\nIt concludes that \u201cwithout justification\u201d the BBC \u201ccovered up\u2026 facts as it had been able to establish about how Mr Bashir secured the interview.\u201d\n\nThe BBC\u2019s former director-general Tony Hall, who was in charge of news and current affairs at the time of the controversy, said Thursday that he was \u201cwrong to give Martin Bashir the benefit of the doubt,\u201d according to PA Media news agency.\n\nLast week Bashir stepped down from his role as the BBC\u2019s religion editor, citing health reasons.\n\nThe BBC\u2019s investigative current affairs show Panorama \u2014 the same program which featured the 1995 interview \u2014 will air a documentary on the controversy on Thursday.\n\nThe program will examine the inside story of how Bashir obtained the interview, and how the BBC responded when it discovered he had faked bank statements and shown them to Earl Spencer.",

So the capacity was not there.\u201d\n\nOne of the main challenges is diversifying vaccine production, which is now 80% concentrated in 10 European, North American and South Asian nations, Okonjo-Iweala said, calling the situation a problem that \u201chas come home to roost.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not normal that Africa, with 1.3 billion people, has 0.17 % of the manufacturing capacity of the world,\u201d she said. \u201cSo this has to change.\u201d She added that Latin America has about 2% of global production capacity.\n\nThe summit set for Friday, co-hosted by the European Union\u2019s executive arm and Italy, is expected to draw Group of 20 industrial and emerging market nations, the heads of international organizations and representatives of global health bodies.\n\nThe European Union is set to raise many of the same points Okonjo-Iweala made, specifically looking to increase manufacturing production in Africa.\n\nEU nations have criticised a call by the United States to waive Covid-19 vaccine patents as a way to increase supplies, arguing the move would yield no short-term or intermediate improvement and could even have a negative impact.\n\nOkonjo-Iweala sought to remain neutral on the issue, but said WTO members could find flexibility to make sure more vaccines are produced in developing nations.",

He said most of 188 survivors and the 37 bodies arrived in Mumbai, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe barge, with more than 260 people on board, sank after the storm caused by Cyclone Tauktae smashed into the Bombay High oilfield near Mumbai, where India\u2019s biggest offshore oil rigs are located.\n\nThe survivors bobbed up and down in life jackets for up to eight hours before they were picked up by the rescuers, a survivor said.\n\nIn another operation, a navy helicopter rescued 35 crew members of another barge, which ran aground north of Mumbai, a government statement said.\n\nBoth barges were working for the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), the largest crude oil and natural gas company in India. The company said the vessels were carrying personnel deployed for offshore drilling.\n\nSeveral other ONGC vessels were stranded in the storm and the government has set up a committee to inquire into the sequence of events.\n\nCyclone Tauktae packed sustained winds of up to 210 kilometres (130 miles) per hour, leaving dozens dead in Gujarat and Maharashtra states as it pummelled India\u2019s western coast late on Monday, leaving a trail of destruction, compounding the misery for a country struggling with a devastating surge in coronavirus cases.\n\nOfficials reported more than 16,000 houses were damaged in Gujarat and thousands of trees and electric poles uprooted.\n\nThe death toll rose to 53 on Wednesday but it could rise further, with local newspapers saying almost 80 people had died in the state, many killed by collapsing houses or walls.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday inspected the damage from the air.
