          "title": "Africa needs more energy sources to tackle climate change \u2013 Buhari",
          "text": "The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has said that for Africa to effectively tackle climate change, the continent would need more energy sources beyond renewable energy.\n\nHe said African leaders must continue to build sustainable power systems to accelerate development and create economic opportunities for the people, according to a statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the Vice President on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande.\n\nBuhari made the call on Wednesday at a meeting of the African Union on the New Partnership for African Development under the auspices of the 39th Session of the NEPAD Heads of State and Government Orientation Committee at the margins of the 35th Ordinary Session of the African Union.\n\nRepresented by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, at the virtual event, the President said the continent needs \u201cto prepare itself more for Intra African collaboration to fight public health challenges, work together to promote vaccine production in Africa, and prompt response to climate change and the zero-emissions targets.\u201d\n\nThe President also called for greater collaboration among Africans to effectively confront challenges such as those in climate change, public health such as local vaccine production among others.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely weakened our economies but it has also left important lessons. One is that Africa needs to prepare itself more for Intra African collaboration to fight public health challenges, especially those of pandemic scale.\n\n\u201cWe must work together to promote vaccine production in Africa. The second issue I would like to raise is Africa\u2019s response to climate change and the zero-emissions targets set in Paris and at subsequent climate change meetings.\n\n\u201cWe must of course contribute our quota in protecting the environment and preventing climate change. But we must also continue to build sustainable power systems to accelerate development and create economic opportunities for our people.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further about climate change, the President said, \u201cwe need far more energy than the renewable sources can immediately provide. Therefore, we cannot but adopt gas as a transition fuel.\n\n\u201cWe must together make clear to the developed world that the current trend of withholding funds for investment in gas development is the wrong thing to do at this time.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "A civic group, the Identify the Right Leader Initiative, says the All Progressives Congress will have a hard time marketing any other candidate for the 2023 Presidency besides Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo (SAN).\n\nThe group also said all political steps and strategies being taken by the APC towards the 2023 presidential election will end up in favour of Osinbajo.\n\nThe group, in a statement on Thursday, said it is convinced that the Vice President will declare his intention to run for the exalted office in Aso Rock and clinch the APC ticket.\n\n\u201cEverything points to the fact that Osinbajo will win the race, all things being equal,\u201d the group\u2019s National Coordinator, Temi Okesanjo, said in the statement.\n\nOkesanjo stated that the Vice President does not need an ultimatum to declare interest to contest for President in the 2023 election, as choosing whether to run or not is no longer his call.\n\nOkesanjo said, \u201cWe are not in doubt as to whether or not Osinbajo will contest in 2023. We\u2019ve since moved past that stage. Groups like ours are out with prescribed arrangements for Prof. Osinbajo\u2019s presidency because he represents everything Nigeria needs at this time in our national life.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany people seem to overlook the fact that Osinbajo is dedicated to his Vice Presidential duties which are critical to our socio-economic development as a nation. He cannot precipitously abandon those tasks to commence an extensive, physically and mentally demanding presidential campaign for 2023 at this time.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, APC will eventually favour Prof. Osinbajo. As a committed party man who wrote the APC\u2019s 2014 manifesto, \u2018The Roadmap\u2019, which led the party to its historic victory at the 2015 presidential election, the elements are clearly aligned in Osinbajo\u2019s favour to win his party\u2019s ticket.\n\n\u201cFor us, we stand to be counted among the numerous socio-civic groups that have declared support for Osinbajo for 2023. The APC will get it right by picking Osinbajo as its flagbearer for 2023 and we expect an easy campaign because it is a case of the product selling itself. APC will have a harder time marketing any other candidate for the election,\u201d she added.\n\nAlready, APC chieftains including former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu; Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi; former governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, have declared interest in running for the 2023 Presidency and participating in the APC presidential primary later this year.",

          "title": "2023: S-West APC govs divided over Tinubu, Osinbajo, Fayemi",
          "text": "By Dapo Akinrefon, Levinus Nwabughiogu, Omeiza Ajayi, Rotimi Ojomoyela & Shina Abubakar\n\nLAGOS \u2014 Governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the South-West zone are divided over the presidential ambitions of former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; and Ekiti State Governor, and Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum, NGF, Dr Kayode Fayemi.\n\nWhile Fayemi is still consulting, three of the five governors from the zone are said to be with Tinubu, and one is undecided whether to back Tinubu or Osinbajo.\n\nGovernor Fayemi, who is eyeing the Presidency, said to be in consultation, is not backing Tinubu or Osinbajo. He has his ambition to pursue.\n\nHis neighbouring colleague from Ondo State, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, is undecided.\n\nHowever, it was gathered that Governors Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State and Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State are solidly behind Tinubu.\n\nThis happened as aggrieved APC governorship aspirants in Ekiti, who lost out in last Thursday\u2019s primaries said they would not leave the party.\n\nAlso, a Federal High Court sitting in Osogbo, Osun State, declined jurisdiction to entertain the case instituted by some aggrieved members of APC loyal to Interior Minister, Rauf Aregbesola, against the ward congresses held in the state.\n\nMeanwhile, a chieftain of the party and former House of Representatives Committee Chairman on National Security and Intelligence, Aminu Sani Jaji, has weighed in on the crisis in the party, declaring that a national chairmanship aspirant and former governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari, is not a registered member of the APC.\n\n\u2018Abiodun is with Tinubu\u2019\n\nA source, who spoke with Vanguard in confidence, said: \u201cThe governor (of Ogun State) is with Tinubu. It was the Tinubu bloc that produced Dapo Abiodun as governor in 2019 and not Osinbajo\u2019s bloc.\u201d\n\nFayemi still consulting\n\nAsked the side of the divide Governor Fayemi belongs, a credible source told Vanguard that Fayemi was still consulting on his presidential ambition.\n\n\u201cIf we are going to come out, we must have crossed the \u2018T\u2019s and dotted the \u2018I\u2019s and we know that we have hope and our chances are bright.\n\n\u201cThere is no point coming out without making an impact. It is important to make due consultations and be sure that if I come out, people will support me. He is not coming out to impress anybody.\n\n\u201cIf it is necessary and the environment is okay, he will come out,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if other APC governors were backing Fayemi, the source said: \u201cYou cannot measure that. However, his colleagues love him, his leadership direction, and the dynamism he has brought to bear, especially on the NGF.\u201d\n\nOsun APC congress: Court strikes out suit filed by Aregbesola\u2019s group\n\nIn Osun, the aggrieved party members had urged the Federal High Court sitting in Osogbo to invalidate the ward congresses held in the state on July 31, 2021.\n\nThe APC National Caretaker Chairman, Governor Mai Mala-Buni, Chairmen of the Congress and Appeal committees, and the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, among others were joined as defendants in the suit.\n\nIn its preliminary objection, counsel to the party, Governor Buni and INEC, argued that the case was a purely party affair, which the court should not dabble into and that Governor Buni by virtue of his position cannot be sued in such matter, among other grounds.\n\nCounsel to the aggrieved party members, Mahmood Adesin, SAN, said the court could hear the matter because it bordered on exclusion of party members.\n\nThe presiding Judge, Justice Emmanuel Ayoola, while giving his ruling, held that the suit brought before the court was strictly a party affair, which the court could not meddle in.\n\n\u201cThe claim of the plaintiffs is to draw the court into the internal affairs of the party, which is not enshrined in the constitution.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has said courts can\u2019t interfere with the internal issue of a party, unless it falls under Section 87(9) of the Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiffs are not qualified to be called aspirants in the said congress. An aspirant is someone who has participated in an election.\n\n\u201cThe fact remains that this matter does relate to the nomination of any candidate. Accordingly, the dispute does not fall under Section 87(8) of Electoral Act and Section 251 of the CFRN. The case of the plaintiffs is not covered by the law and can\u2019t be adjudicated by the court,\u201d he ruled.\n\nWe\u2019re not leaving APC \u2013 Ekiti aggrieved gov aspirants\n\nIn Ekiti, there is no sign of respite yet in the crisis rocking the APC over its just concluded primary as some aggrieved aspirants, including the senator representing Ekiti Central, Opeyemi Bamidele, and a House of Representatives member, Femi Bamisile, talked tough, yesterday.\n\nThey clarified that decamping from the party was not an option but would rather stay inside the party and employ political and legal means to correct the alleged electoral irregularities perpetrated during the primary.\n\nShortly after addressing members of his campaign team across the 16 local government areas, who converged on his office in Ado Ekiti, Bamidele, at a joint press briefing with Bamisile, formally rejected the outcome of the primary that produced Biodun Oyebanji.\n\nThe senator added that all the alleged shenanigans and breach of the party\u2019s constitution perpetrated by the Governor Abubakar Badaru-led Primary Committee would be addressed politically and legally to teach APC a lesson it will never forget.\n\nOn whether the seven aggrieved aspirants that had constituted themselves into a political force with the acronym G7 would defect from APC, Bamidele said: \u201cNone of us is contemplating defecting from APC; this is our party. We have contributed so much to it from the days of the Alliance for Democracy, AD.\n\n\u201cAll we are asking for is justice. We are waiting for the national leadership to take the right step and this must start by them submitting a dummy name to INEC and use the two weeks window available as contained in the Electoral Act to do what is right in this matter. I can be quoted that the name that will be taken to INEC in Abuja will be a dummy name, so those celebrating should do that in moderation.\n\n\u201cIf it is part of their calculation that we will leave the party for them, they are making a mistake. We are still waiting for the national leadership on our collective position. We have filed petitions and if they endorse that impunity they called primary, it will be clear that we have exhausted all the internal mechanisms for crisis resolution and we can return to the court of law.\u201d\n\nReeling out how the election was allegedly manipulated, Bamidele stated that the Badaru-led committee hijacked the process by distributing materials a day before election, changed collation centres, and arbitrarily appointed those that would do Oyebanji\u2019s biddings to compromise the process and subvert the will of the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe process was totally hijacked by the Badaru committee. We saw people who were campaign managers, sponsors and promoters of Biodun Oyebanji being appointed and saddled with the responsibility of being Returning Officers in the 16 local governments.\n\n\u201cThe election materials were to be distributed early on Thursday before the start of the primary in the presence of agents of aspirants, INEC, security chiefs and monitoring teams. But materials, both sensitive and non-sensitive, were distributed the previous night. We got calls that as of 11pm, Governor Badaru had handed over materials to returning officers from the 16 councils.\n\n\u201cOut of the 16 Returning Officers appointed, 11 of them were with Oyebanji when he collected his expression of interest form at the party secretariat in Abuja. In several of our local governments, the venues of our collation centres were changed. At the appropriate time, we will give evidence that will put all of us in public court and that will be useful in the court of law. Available INEC reports shows that there was no voting, no valid primary election in Ekiti.\u201d\n\nIn his submission, Bamisile warned the security agencies against threatening people with arrest over the APC governorship crisis, saying such will not work.\n\n\u201cThis is our state, we are fighting for what we believe in, this is a democracy where everyone has the right to support whoever one likes. The police shouldn\u2019t threaten us with arrest. Nobody can stop this, the only thing they can do to stop us is to allow justice in our party.\n\n\u201cWhatever votes they have allotted to us will reflect on the day of election. We won\u2019t leave this party, but not leaving does not mean that APC will not be taught a lesson. This is not a threat, but a prophecy that will come to pass. We are not going anywhere, but if the party doesn\u2019t do it right, they will be taught a lesson they will never forget\u201d.\n\nEx-Gov Yari not a member of APC \u2014 Jaji\n\nIn Zamfara, Mr. Aminu Sani Jaji said that former Governor Abdulaziz Yari is not a registered member of the APC.\n\nHis declaration comes a few weeks after another chairmanship aspirant and Special Adviser to Zamfara State Governor on Intergovernmental Affairs, Abdullahi Shinkafi, said Yari was unknown to the party.\n\nSpeaking with Vanguard, yesterday, in Abuja, Jaji also dismissed concerns that the request by the Abdullahi Adamu-led APC National Reconciliation Committee for an additional seven days to turn in its final report was meant to postpone the February 26 national convention.\n\nAsked about the prospects of having a rancour-free convention, especially with crises in some state chapters of the party, including Zamfara, Jaji said: \u201cWe are not divided. I don\u2019t know if Yari is a registered member of the party, but for me, he is not an APC member.\u201d\n\nWhen reminded that Yari was instrumental to the formation of the defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party ANPP, one of the legacy parties which led to the formation of the APC, Jaji queried: \u201cWho built the ANPP? How did he build APC? Who is he to build APC? APC is a party and a platform. But before the emergence of APC, there was ANPP. Did Yari build the ANPP?\n\n\u201cDoes that mean all the governors of ANPP owned the party? It is crystal clear that if he wants to contest or partake in the APC process, he needs to go back to his ward and register again.\u201d\n\nYari had earlier dismissed allegations that he does not have a valid APC membership registration card.\n\n\u201cWhy should anybody explain to the public that someone who was a governor did not have a membership registration card of the party he worked so tirelessly to form?\u201d he queried.\n\nOn the possible postponement of the national convention due to the additional days requested by the reconciliation committee, the APC chieftain said there was still time to put in place mechanisms for the conduct of the exercise.\n\n\u201cThe stewardship of the governor of Yobe State for maybe under one year, has revamped and transformed the party. It is yielding results. Recall that more governors have defected to the party but at the same time, there must be internal democracy.\n\n\u201cHowever, what the reconciliation committee is requesting will not in any way tamper with the date of the convention. The reconciliation process is an ongoing development. There is no problem with it. The CECPC can still submit the letter to meet up with the INEC deadline. \u201cIt is not an issue anymore. The most important aspect is for us, the APC members, to start congratulating the Mai Mala Buni-led CECPC for what they did. If we can get a national chairman, who can deliver and be committed like Buni, the APC will prosper,\u201d he stated.\n\nAPC women write Buhari, NEC, ask for postponement of February Convention\n\nMeanwhile, a coalition of APC Women Groups, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to postpone indefinitely the national convention of the party fixed for February 26.\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by Dr. Cecilia Ikechukwu and other members in Abuja yesterday.\n\nThe coalition said there were many contentious and unresolved issues, which might affect the outcome of the convention.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, currently the party has factions in 14 states, which is because the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) under His Excellency, Mai Malam Buni has done a good job in reconciling factions in other states and re-organization of the party.\n\n\u201cThe party is yet to recover from the attendant losses from elections that were ordinarily guaranteed in Rivers and Zamfara state during the 2019 General Elections.\n\n\u201cInstead of learning the hard lessons contained in those avoidable experiences, the state governors and the colluding party leaders are rather adamant on repeating the show of shame on a national scale by fixing a date for the National Convention without first resolving the damaging issues on ground.\n\n\u201cAs it was with Rivers and Zamfara states, there are legal implications for how the party is progressing into a national convention with all the issues surrounding the party.\n\n\u201cWe fear the APC is now firmly placed to lose all the positions our members will contest for, not only at the polls but on legal technicalities as was the case in those two states,\u201d the group stated.\n\nThe women group also appealed \u201cthat the convention be postponed indefinitely to allow the CECPC resolve these issues within the next three days and come up with a comprehensive report on how to navigate the murky waters the APC currently finds itself.\n\n\u201cThat the Abdullahi Adamu committee be disbanded immediately, and a new committee set up, since this committee has serially failed in its mandate.\n\n\u201cThat Mr. President unites the APC stakeholders and lead them to counter the influence of the cabals that want to destroy the party from within at all costs.\n\n\u201cIt is our firm belief that these steps, if urgently taken, can pull the APC from the brink, although the window for saving the party is fast closing. Please Mr. President, save the APC from implosion,\u201d the statement added.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Trouble in Labour as TUC declares \u2018war\u2019 on NLC",
          "text": "\u2022Accuses NLC of lording it over TUC; NLC reacts\n\nBy Victor Ahiuma-Young\n\nBUT for January 24 announcement by the Federal Government that it was shelving the planned subsidy removal on petrol and its attendant petrol pump price increase, Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, and its affiliates would have held last week\u2019s suspended nationwide protest alongside their Civil Society Organisations, CSOs, allies without the second Labour Centre in the country, the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria, TUC, and its affiliates.\n\nReason is that the leaders of TUC have declared \u201cwar\u201d on NLC, accusing NLC of \u2018lording it over\u2019 TUC especially on issues of national importance such as the suspended nationwide strike.\n\nRecall that NLC and its leaders had late last year declared Thursday, January 27, as a day for nationwide protest against subsidy removal ahead of national strike should government go ahead to remove subsidy on petrol and consequently hike the pump price of petrol in February as earlier contemplated, and mobilised members and CSOs allies, among others.\n\nHowever, TUC and its affiliates had, a week earlier, dissociated themselves from the January 27 planned protest and given indication that they would organise theirs at a later date.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nVanguard investigation revealed that TUC\u2019s quarrel with NLC has been on for a long time over alleged NLC penchant for taking unilateral and sweeping decisions on behalf of Organised Labour without consulting TUC. Things came to a head when NLC announced plans to organise a nationwide protest without intimating or carrying TUC along as Labour Centre.\n\nOne of the leaders of TUC who spoke to Vanguard on condition of anonymity, said one needed to be present at last week\u2019s meeting of TUC Central Working Committee, CWC, and National Executive Council, NEC, to see the anger and bitterness members exhibited against NLC\u2019s perceived arrogance and disregard for TUC.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cMost of the speakers at both meetings detailed what they considered the many sins of NLC and the fact that NLC does not see TUC as a social partner that needs to be carried along on national issues.\n\n\u201cNLC sees TUC as its servant and expects TUC to fall in and work along with it once it takes a decision, NLC sees itself as the voice of Organised Labour in the country and once it takes decisions, TUC must follow.\n\n\u201cWe are a registered Labour Centre of equal value in the eyes of the law like the NLC. But NLC sees us as inconsequential body that should not be carried along on national issues affecting workers of this country.\n\n\u201cWe represent very senior and if I may add, intelligent crop of workers in this country that know their onions and have stake in the scheme of things in this country.\n\n\u201cIf you do not know, the government through the Ministry of Finance and Petroleum Resources, before now and in fact, for a very long time, has been trying to woo workers in Oil and Gas sector including our affiliate, Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, PENGASSAN, to support the full deregulation of the downstream sector of the Petroleum Industry.\n\n\u201cThe government officials tried and persuaded the oil workers to accept the total deregulation because it will favour them. But for their patriotism and loyalty, they insisted that what their umbrella body decides, is what they will abide by.\n\n\u201dIf NLC thinks it will continue to lord it over us or that it can fight alone, no problem. We also have the capacity to fight alone.\n\n\u201cThat is what we have decided. In other words, until NLC decides to take us into confidence and work with us in deciding joint response to national issues, then \u2018to your tent o Israel.\u2019 We will do our thing in our own way and let NLC do its thing in its own way.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, we can assure our members, the suffering masses of this country and other social partners that we will never compromise in fighting, defending and agitating for things that will improve their living conditions and make life better for them.\u201d\n\nWe can organise protest without notifying TUC \u2014 NLC\n\nReacting, one of the senior leaders of NLC, who spoke to Vanguard in confidence, dismissed the TUC position as mere misunderstanding between issue of protest and strike.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWe see TUC as our partners and we will continue to see it so. But let me make it clear that once it is about protest, we can organise and hold protest without getting TUC notified officially if you like.\n\n\u201cBut if it is a national strike, where we want to shutdown the system, everybody has to be involved especially TUC and other social partners including the CSOs, traders, informal sector workers, artisans and so on.\n\n\u201cIn protest, we may not need most of these allies because we are not intending to shut down operations, cripple businesses among others.\n\n\u201cGo back to history maybe from 2010; we have been organising nationwide protests on national issues. We don\u2019t necessarily carry TUC along, but if they join, all well and good.\n\n\u201cBut if it is a national strike, we have to get everybody involved from inception to conclusion because the aims and objectives of protest are different from that of national strike.\n\n\u201cWe do not have any issue with our sister Labour Centre. They are our social partners and we will continue to work with them to better the lots of Nigerians especially workers and the suffering masses.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that we have no problem with TUC leaders, affiliates and members.

I didn\u2019t inform my dad.\n\n\u201cI went to one of the filling stations at Zaria road where I met a truck driver. I begged him to please take me to Lagos, that was in 1980.\n\n\u201cThe driver agreed to take me to Lagos. He bought food for me because I had no single Kobo by then.\n\n\u201cThe driver took me to Lagos. On dropping me I enquired about where the Hausa community is and I was told to go to Alaba.\n\n\u201cI went to Alaba but I knew nobody then at Lagos. I met somebody who agreed to make me his errands boy at the place he was selling tea and bread with egg.\n\nI worked there as an errands boy, washing cups and plates and also fetching water.\n\n\u201cI realised that I left Kano to Lagos to make money. But become an errands boy of the tea seller will not bring that money to me so I decided to change my line of business.\n\n\u201cI started hawking with my N20 from Alaba to Mile 2 everyday including Saturday and Sunday\u201d he said.\n\nWhen I came back to the north, here in Kano, I decided to try my hands on small scale industry where I started a groundnut oil producing industry.\n\n\u201cAt that time I left my house and family and used to sleep with the security guard at the sight for fear of the machines and other implements being stolen.\n\n\u201cI started with two engines used for grinding of groundnut for the production of oil. I was one of those loading and off loading the machine. It is with the blessing of Almighty God that we reached this level.\n\n\u201cI was able to establish other companies thereafter and later moved to rice milling and farming as suggested by our president Muhammadu Buhari\u201d he added.",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu\n\nThe Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has formed a national action committee to actualise a President of South East extraction in next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nHeaded by President General of the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, George Obiozor, with its Secretary General, Amb. Okey Emuchay as secretary, the committee would deploy persuasion in reaching out to key political actors across the country as well as other critical stakeholders and leaders.\n\nThis formed part of the communique of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of Ohanaeze issued in Enugu on Wednesday night.\n\nPresenting the communique to newsmen, Obiozor said they would soon announce the composition of the \u201cpersuasion team that would recognise those that are critical in Nigeria including our own people. They will also talk to our people here that are aspiring for the Presidency. The team is nonpartisan and none political. We will try to reach everybody on the need for the South East to produce the next president.\u201d\n\nHe described President of South East origin as an idea whose time has come, and reminded Nigerians and Nigeria that at its present age of about 62, the country needed introspective and retrospective thinking in order to reassess the journey so far as a nation or as a country.\n\nObiozor warned that Nigeria is facing synchronized national crisis which could lead to its eventual collapse or dismemberment. He restated that the Igbo were not secessionists or separatists, adding that they were prepared and deserved the Presidency because it was politically defensible and morally justifiable.\n\n\u201cIf the truth must be told, the nation has made two consistent mistakes that have worsened the nation\u2019s other problems; leading the nation to near breaking points.\n\n\u201cThose two devils in Nigerian politics are power sharing and social injustice. In all we drifted into these two problems with nonchalance or with ease, and sometimes oblivious of their consequences until what we think is a simple or easy problem develops into a national disaster or catastrophe. For those who can remember, how did we get into the western region crisis in the 1960s? How did we get to the civil war (1967-1970)? How did we get to NADECO (Abiola crisis) and even South-South Avengers?\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cToday, the situation of the country is not totally different but even more complicated. Today indeed, the way things are, with communication and modern technology, our country is set not only at the usual breaking points which were more easily controlled and contained in the past to preserve Nigerian unity, but a point of synchronized national crisis which will be more difficult to be controlled or contained today.\n\n\u201cNigeria was a country negotiated and amalgamated under some agreements that balanced sensitive issues of power-sharing and balancing of power regardless of any other conditions. It was a system where every person had an equal chance in life regardless of their tribe, race or religion. In 1960 at independence, our Founding Fathers \u2013 Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe, Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Tafawa Balewa, joyfully embraced both independence and all existing institutions establishing Nigerian unity. Those founding fathers later found out that our country Nigeria, had inherent measures of historic conflict of ideas and ideals.\n\n\u201cConsequently, all Nigerian leaders even today have utilized Nigeria\u2019s \u2018Doctrine of creative use of conflicts and crises\u2019. This old doctrine can be used once more to save the country and control the present crisis. But today also and in terms of nationalism, only few countries in the world have fallen so fast as Nigeria in recent years, Nigerians must recognize that something went wrong.\n\n\u201cNigerian nationalism is receding as ethno- regional nationalism is growing astronomically. It is time to rebuild and restore Nigerian nationalism and national spirit. As the national situation is today, it will require Pan Nigerians like Igbo to reinvigorate the nation\u2019s path to unity. And a South East Igbo president of Nigeria in 2023 will be one of the most critical but positive decisions of the nation\u2019s history because, it is the right decision and an idea whose time has come.\n\n\u201cFor those in doubt, please be assured that he/she will focus on what can be done instead of arguing over what is impossible.\u201d",

The military is getting better funding from the government and what we expect is to see an improvement in output. I know the resources are not enough, but recently, for one and a half years, government has upscaled the level of funding for our military. Secondly, when we declared the bandits as terrorists, my understanding was they are going to be dealt with ruthlessly. I wonder whether that is the case. The military, like some of our colleagues have said, needs to wake up. We want to see a difference because we have made a difference in terms of funding. I know funding alone will not be enough but funding can make a difference and we expect a difference in outcome.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, the Senate urged the security agencies to comb all known hideouts of the kidnappers in a bid to rescue the 38 persons abducted in Ruwan Godiya. It also called on the Federal Government to send enough military personnel and fighter jets to apprehend the bandits and restore normalcy in the affected areas.",

          "text": "\u2022Approves N115bn to dualise Katsina road\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved contracts worth $328.87 million in consultancy services for the supervision of the various railway projects in the country. FEC also approved N115.4 billion for the dualisation of Kano-Kazaure-Kongolam highway in Katsina State.\n\nThese were disclosed to newsmen yesterday in Abuja by Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Amaechi, after the weekly virtual FEC meeting, which was presided by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House.\n\nGiving a breakdown of his ministry\u2019s presentations at the meeting, Amaechi said he presented two memoranda, one of which was in respect of the consultancy services, adding that the second one was for the concessioning of the Onitsha River Port.\n\nThe minister said, \u201cMinistry of Transportation presented two memos and the first one has to do with the contract for consultancy services for the supervision of the various railway projects. Remember that we have about three railway projects that are yet to start construction and they include the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri, Kano-Maradi and then the Abuja-Warri.\n\n\u201cFor the consultancy services, the following contractors were approved, with the total cost of $183.7 million: GIX Engineers Infrastructure Excellence/Yaroso & Partnership Ltd, Core Consulting Engineering Plc. That\u2019s for Abuja to Warri.\n\n\u201cFor the consultancy services for supervision of Port Harcourt-Maiduguri railway, with branch lines to Bonny Deep Seaport and Port Harcourt Industrial Park, and, then, to Owerri, we have Kyari Consults SDMBHD/Jamood Global Services Limited at $97.5 million. The first one is $38.4 million.\n\n\u201cThe last one is consultancy services for the supervision of Kano-Katsina-Jibia-Maradi Rail-line to TEAM (Technics Engineering Architecture Marketing Nigeria Limited) and that is for $47,670,000 million. All of them are for a period of 36 months. That\u2019s the first.\n\n\u201cThe second one is that the cabinet approved a concession agreement for the Ministry of Transportation to concession the Onitsha River Port to a company, called Inversal Elysium Consortium. They are to manage the river port for 30 years.\u201d\n\nOn why the federal government was abandoning the agreements signed with China on construction of railway in the country, Amaechi explained, \u201cActually, that is why there is a delay. We were waiting on the Chinese to give us the loans we applied for and till today they\u2019ve not replied. They kept delaying us \u2013 will the delay extend our tenure? The answer is no.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone to Standard Chartered Bank and while they\u2019ve done financial closure, they\u2019ve approved some level of funding. We are also pursuing Port Harcourt-Maiduguri line with Standard Chartered Bank. The Lagos-Kano, part of it will come from Standard Chartered Bank, and part of it will come from some commercial banks in China.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the briefing, Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola, said the council approved a contract for the dualisation of the Kano-Kazaure-Kongolam Road at the cost of N115.4 billion. Fashola explained that the project, which covers 131.4 kilometres, was expected to be completed within a period of 48 months.\n\nFashola said, \u201cMinistry of Works and Housing presented one memo for the dualisation of the Kano-Kazaure-Kongoland highway, 131.4 kilometres, from a single carriage way to dual carriage way. So, council approved that proposal at a cost of N115,425, 896,907.15 kobo (in billion) over 48months.\n\n\u201cThe instructive thing is that the financing will be done by the Tax Credit Scheme of Bua International Limited. And they will use Messrs PW Construction Nigeria limited, a company in which they have acquired some interest, to undertake the construction.\u201d\n\nBriefing newsmen also, Minister of State for Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, said FEC approved an Energy Transition Plan for the country.\n\n\u201cThis memo was presented as a plan for Nigeria to achieve net zero carbon emission,\u201d the minister said, noting, \u201cthis will clearly set out the pathway for Nigeria in achieving this.\u201d\n\nIkeazor further said FEC also approved a second memo to aid the Waste Battery Management Policy for Nigeria.\n\nThis policy, according to her, \u201cWill create a lot of jobs in the circular economy for Nigeria and at the same time protect the health of Nigerians to make sure that hazardous waste, like waste batteries, are properly disposed of with regulations, including recycling in Nigeria as well.\u201d\n\nShe said her ministry also presented to the council a report on the last COP 26 (the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference), which Nigeria attended, and the country\u2019s plans for COP 27 going forward.\n\nOn his part, Minister of State for Health, Dr. Olorunimbe Mamora, said council, during a closed-door session, also approved the award of contract for consultancy services to facilitate the building of the corporate headquarters of National Health Insurance Scheme in Abuja.\n\nMamora said, \u201cThe need has become inevitable to expand what is on ground to improve the operational efficiency of that agency, which is the National Health Insurance Scheme and happily, the council considered the memo approved same.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Insists no zone will be denied opportunity to contest\n\n\u2022Northern group reechoes party\u2019s position\n\nChuks Okocha and\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nUnmoved by loud agitation for a presidential candidate from the southern part of Nigeria, the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, said unequivocally that its presidential ticket was open to all the six geopolitical zones of the country. The party stated this position when it received a letter from a group, Northern Advocate for Good Governance (NAFGG), which advocated a presidential candidate of northern Nigeria origin in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nIt was the first time the main opposition party would be stating its position on the presidency clearly ahead of the next general election.\n\nPDP maintained that no zone would be denied the opportunity of contesting in the election.\n\nNAFGG echoed PDP\u2019s position, saying all the geopolitical zones, including those that had produced the president before, should be eligible to vie for the presidential ticket.\n\nReceiving the report from the group on behalf of the national chairman, Deputy National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Abdullahi Ibrahim, commended NAFGG for taking the initiative to support equal opportunity for all the geopolitical zones.\n\nIbrahim stated, \u201cThis is a commendable initiative. We are doing the best we can in that regard, if Nigerians like you find it pertinent to assist us in achieving that objective.\n\n\u201cThe new National Working Committee (NWC) under the leadership of Senator Iyorchia Ayu has already resolved this is exactly what it would pursue as an objective in ensuring that the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria were given equal opportunity to bid for the available offices to rescue and rebuild Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIbrahim further expatiated the party\u2019s position while speaking with THISDAY. He said, \u201cFor the opportunities that are available, you heard the convener talking about providing equal opportunity for Nigerians to bid for the available political offices. Those who are interested in pursuing the presidency, we are opening it for every Nigerian to pursue and many other offices that are national in outlook, Nigerians are free to pursue.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he meant that the presidency should be thrown open, he responded, \u201cOf course!\u201d, adding, \u201cYes, that is what it implies. As we speak, every Nigerian is bidding from the South-east, from the South-west, and from the North. No section of Nigeria will be denied an opportunity to contest or aspire. It is left for Nigerians to decide where they want to allow the presidency go.\u201d\n\nIbrahim insisted the opposition party believed in equity and fairness.\n\nAsked if PDP might zone its presidential ticket to the South-east, in deference to former vice presidential candidate and ex-governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi\u2019s demand, Ibrahim stated, \u201cWhat Peter Obi said was, if it favours the South-east and as one Nigeria, who comes from that zone, he will contest. But it\u2019s a question of allowing everyone to bid; it\u2019s a platform that is opened to all Nigerians on equal and justifiable process. If you think you are suitable, come and throw your cap in the ring and the remaining will be story.\n\n\u201cWe will not condone twisted and half-baked conclusions. From 1999 to 2023, the south would have ruled Nigeria for 14 years, while the north for 10 years. Why should we then prioritise the south to take over when the north has a shortfall?\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Ibrahim has deliberately left out the fact that, of Nigeria\u2019s 62 years since independence, the north has ruled cumulatively for 41 years and six months, while the south has only been in power for 20 years and six months, thus making his argument disingenuous.\n\nThe list below on power sharing since 1960 suffices:\n\nAbubakar Tafawa Balewa: 1960-1966; Azikwe Nnamdi: October 1, 1963-January 16, 1966; Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi: January 16, 1966-July 29, 1966; Yakubu Gowon: August 1, 1966-July 29, 1975; Murtala Mohammed: July 29, 1975-February 13, 1976; Olusegun Obasanjo: February 13, 1976-October 1, 1979; Shehu Shagari: October 1, 1979-December 31, 1983 and Muhammadu Buhari: December 31, 1983-August 27, 1985.\n\nAlso, Ibrahim Babangida: August 27, 1985-August 26, 1993; Earnest Shonekan: August 26, 1993-November 17, 1993; Sani Abacha: November 17, 1993-June 8, 1998; Abdusalami Abubakar: June 8, 1998-May 29, 1999; Olusegun Obasanjo: May 29, 1999-May 29, 2007; Umar Yar\u2019Adua: May 29, 2007-May 5, 2010; Goodluck Jonathan: May 29, 2010-May 29, 2015; and Muhammadu Buhari: May 29, 2015 till date.\n\nHowever, in the letter to National Chairman of PDP, National Coordinator of the northern group, Mallam Mahmoud Mohammed Katun, called for priority to be given to zones in the north that had not had the opportunity to govern Nigeria to guarantee equity, fairness, and justice.\n\nHowever Katun said, \u201cBut, even more importantly, it is our considered position that political parties should prioritise experience, competence, and capacity in choosing or zoning their presidential tickets.\n\n\u201cBoth the North-east and North-central parts of the country have very distinguished and eminently qualified people to run for the president of Nigeria in their various political affiliations. In fact, we dare any group to suggest a candidate that can rival the likes of Atiku Abubakar, Bukola Abubakar Saraki, and Bala Mohammed, all eminent and qualified aspirants from the aforementioned zones.\n\n\u201cWe are of the view that if the principle of zoning is to be observed to the latter, both the North-east and North-central should be considered, as they represent two out of three zones that have not produced the president of Nigeria as things stand.\n\n\u201cWe further call on political actors in Nigeria across party divides to look deeply and come up with a more holistic approach to zoning, in order to produce the best hands, who can rescue Nigeria from its current abyss.\n\n\u201cWe wish to state unequivocally that as a group, the Northern Advocates for Good Governance seeks equity, fairness and justice in zoning the presidency of Nigeria in 2023, so that this can bring about good governance to Nigerians at all levels.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Elumelu raises concerns over $4bn oil theft, insists its national disgrace\n\nJames Emejo and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, yesterday expressed doubts over Nigeria\u2019s daily petrol consumption figures, describing them as crazy and opaque.\n\nThe minister who appeared on the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), a government-owned broadcast station, in apparent frustration, noted that there\u2019s nothing that needed to be interrogated that had not been questioned on the subsidy matter.\n\nAlso, the Founder/Chairman of Heirs Holdings Limited, Mr. Tony Elumelu, yesterday said incessant oil theft in the Niger Delta region remained a major national challenge requiring urgent attention by the country\u2019s leadership. Elumelu, while delivering the National Defence College, Course 30 Lecture titled: \u201cStrategic Leadership: My Business Experience,\u201d further described the activities of oil thieves as a national disgrace which requires national seminar and dialogue to address.\n\nSylva agreed that figures released by concerned authorities were questionable, stressing that the best solution to the issue would have been to completely remove the subsidy.\n\nNigeria\u2019s subsidy regime has for decades remained a subject of controversy, with the figures from the authorities ranging from between 50 million litres per day to around 103 million litres.\n\nAs at today, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) is the sole importer of the product, since private businessmen exited the scene due to non-availability of foreign exchange years ago.\n\nHaving backtracked on its plan to remove fuel subsidy as dictated by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the executive arm of government is set to approach the National Assembly to approve the N3 trillion for the payment of subsidies in 2022. The government last week extended the implementation by 18 months.\n\nThe minister alleged that a few persons were holding the rest of the country to ransom, explaining that the rich rather than the most vulnerable in the country gain more from the payment of subsidies than the poor.\n\nSpeaking on the dynamics of rising consumption figures and increasing subsidy payment, Sylva explained that although there was something fishy about the data, there\u2019s nothing that hadn\u2019t been done in the past to muscle those bleeding the country without success.\n\n\u201cThere have been efforts at controlling some of the smuggling. And then something dramatic happened. When we had the deregulation discussions, and the price moved up to N162 from N145 where I met it, we realised that the consumption dropped to less than 50 million litres or to the 40 million.\n\n\u201cSo, later on, once the exchange rate also now moved up a little bit and swallowed the gains we made from the N162 move, the figures increased again.\n\n\u201cAnd sometimes, the figures you hear are crazy. I mean, when they tell you 90 million litres a day, I mean, they\u2019re crazy figures. So I mean, so for me what is the sum total of all this? We\u2019ve been interrogating these numbers for 20 years.\n\n\u201cWe continue to interrogate these figures because we all know that there is a problem here, it\u2019s opaque . The opportunity, the premium is not coming to government and it is not going to the poor people. It is going to a select people who are feeding fat on these things.\n\n\u201cSo why don\u2019t we just get rid of this thing? Okay, we should interrogate this thing, but I mean, to me that is not the solution. Why don\u2019t we get just get rid of this whole subsidy so that we know that this problem is over once and for all.\n\n\u201cI know when people say the figures are\u2026 I mean, we agree that the figures are all opaque. We agree. That\u2019s why we are saying look, let\u2019s stop all the shenanigans. Let\u2019s stop all this discussion.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s leave all this opaqueness, all this corruption in the subsidy, let us move away from subsidy and go on higher ground. And then they say no, no, no. There\u2019s been trial of subsidy thieves. Oh, we\u2019ve gone on television to say okay, these are the template, these are the components of the templates,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe minister was reacting to the insistence by a co-guest, Prof. Yinka Omorogbe, an energy law expert and President Nigerian Association of Energy Economists (NAEE), that Nigeria must investigate how many litres it consumes, among others.\n\nThe minister maintained that even labour which is against the removal of the subsidy knows the issues, adding that Nigeria continues to hemorrhage because the subsidy regime persists.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just get out of it? Okay, there has been some corruption. So we can always deal with the corruption issues. We can always deal with all the opaque issues. But should we allow Nigerians who are not benefiting from this thing as you agree with me, to continue to be hemorrhaging?\n\n\u201cBecause we need to get out of this, because look at it, N3 trillion budgeted. You can imagine if this N3 trillion were to be budgeted for something else. Who\u2019s going to be benefit from it? I\u2019m not into the downstream, I\u2019m not going to benefit,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe argued that even the Dangote refinery would not survive in a subsidised environment, reason the businessman carefully planned it as an export facility around the Export Free Zone (EFZ) in Lagos.\n\n\u201cIt is by his port, because he was not refining to sell at a loss as the other refineries were designed to do. He designed his to sell at a profit internationally. If we are to buy from him, we will also buy at the international market. The only saving we will make as a government in that case, is the cost of freight,\u201d he argued.\n\n\u201cSo, you find that that it was his own model, it is still not going to function under a subsidy regime, even Dangote refinery will not function. So, it is agreed that no refinery in the world can survive in a subsidy regime,\u201d Sylva added.\n\nOn the issue of pipeline maintenance and repairs, the minister stressed that under the PIA, the refineries will be managed distinctly from the crude oil pipelines.\n\nDescribing it as a very thorny issue, he expressed the view that the PIA will be the solution to some of the current problems with managing the pipelines.\n\nHe pointed out that before now, the midstream in the industry was grossly under-developed because the fiscals were not there.\n\n\u201cIf you have a situation where somebody owns a refinery and then at the same time is expected to run a pipeline that is 600 kilometres long, then it becomes difficult for him to run.\n\n\u201cHe should focus on running a refinery if it\u2019s a refinery operator, then you must have somebody who also focuses on running the pipeline and it becomes his business.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, in Nigeria, we never saw the pipeline as a business. So the pipeline was always an attachment to a refinery. It was becoming very sub-optimally managed because the refinery operators could not manage the pipelines.\n\n\u201cSo what we are now doing is to decouple the pipelines from the refineries, outsource those pipelines to people who can now focus on managing the pipelines. So it will be a different ballgame after the fixing of the refineries, he assured\u201d\n\nOmorogbe had in her comments, said that the reforms in the industry were unnecessarily slow, with the PIA taking over 20 years to bring to fruition.\n\n\u201cThe downstream has been in a mess for a long time. Any downstream operator will tell you that off the record, and will tell you that it\u2019s worsening.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just in pains to know how we can implement the petroleum industry act. But I think a lot of the problem is that Nigerians have never really interrogated what this subsidy is, if it\u2019s there to cushion us against the different price effects of importing petroleum products.\n\n\u201cWhat are the components of what is being paid for subsidy? When you look at landing cost, what are the components of that landing costs? How much of it is the demurrage for example?\n\n\u201cWhy are we paying for the incompetence of the system? If the government would get out of this area, I can see that many things would be wiped out, even though one is talking about temporarily having the price shoot up, it\u2019ll come down.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s competition. No private person will pay for some of the things that are happening right now. That\u2019s why I say I really don\u2019t know where to start. But we should just sit down and interrogate that subsidy, subsidy price and see what we are paying for it and what\u2019s in the landing costs.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s interrogate and say, how many litres do we use in Nigeria every day? Statistics in the downstream is incredibly opaque,\u201d she argued\n\nElumelu Raises Concerns over $4bn Oil Theft, Says Its National Disgrace\n\nAccording to Elumelu, who is also the Chairman of the United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA), between January and September last year, Nigeria lost over $4 billion to oil thieves\n\nwho don\u2019t pay tax but use their illicit proceeds to acquire more lethal ammunition and continued to pose threats to the country\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nHe expressed worry that the development had put so much money in the hands of those who don\u2019t pay tax and who are not regulated, making the country unsafe.\n\nElumelu said, \u201cWe produce sometimes about 87,000 barrels per day, and thieves take 50,000 per day.\u201d\n\nHe said addressing the sordid situation required strategic as well as resilience of leadership adding that, \u201cthings can\u2019t continue that way. The country should wake up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look forward to men and women of this country to help remove this national disgrace,\u201d Elumelu added.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe theft in the Niger Delta is a national challenge. To me, it requires national seminar and dialogue. It is in my viewpoint, one of the lethal threats to our country, because it is so much money in the hands of people who don\u2019t pay tax, people we don\u2019t regulate and the country is not safe.\n\n\u201cNigeria in the last three quarters of last year from January to September lost over $4 billion to thieves who don\u2019t pay tax and they use it to pile more lethal ammunition and pose threats to our corporate existence.\u201d\n\nHe also attributed the growing youth restiveness in Nigeria and Africa to the absence of strategic leadership principles which he said among others required setting priorities, execution of goals, setting of timelines and milestones as well as clarity of purpose.\n\nHe said these leadership principles had helped shape his focus and eventual successes in the private sector, stressing that they are as well applicable to the public sector if results must be achieved.\n\nElumelu in the course of his lecture also touched on the need for leaders to match words with actions so people don\u2019t lose interest in their leadership.\n\nHe also emphasised the need to pay attention to merit and ensure that the most qualified persons are appointed to positions of authority.\n\nOn the role of private sector in fighting terror and promoting peace in the continent, the founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation said he had been a proponent of African capitalism which he believes would lead to long-term investment to address endemic poverty.\n\nHe argued that people who have economic hope do not take to extremism, saying only jobless persons are susceptible to social vices.\n\nHe said governments must get serious with eradicating poverty and creating economic opportunities for the growing youth population in order to avert a greater catastrophe.\n\n\u201cUnless we get serious on our continent, it\u2019s just starting, \u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere can\u2019t be peace when people are hungry. It\u2019s an imposed peace and it\u2019s only a matter of time before it explodes.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, what African youths need is economic opportunity and not interested in handouts adding that they presently lacked such opportunity.\n\nElumelu said government must wake up and realise that the young ones would someday hold them accountable.\n\nHe said the fact that 60 per cent of the Nigeria\u2019s population lived below the poverty index had more to do about leadership.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe can correct these things. We need to do more. Poverty is the reason we have problems in the world.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

But it was unclear who the casualties were.\n\nIt was also learnt that Sissoco Embalo held an extraordinary cabinet meeting at around 10 a.m., entering the building with a heavy security detail.\n\nImmediately after the incident, the normally busy streets around the palace were deserted in the afternoon, with an unverified video shared on social media appeared to show a man standing outside the compound firing a rocket-propelled grenade.\n\nThe government has however been silent about the incident as no official statement has been made.\n\nThe West Africa region has been mired by military take-over in the last 18 months with military take over in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso.\n\nGuinea-Bissau is not new to coup d\u2019etat as for decades, there has been history of nine coups or attempted coups since independence from Portugal in 1974. This has severely affected her economy which relies heavily on the export of cashew nuts.\n\nThe ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) which some analysts are calling for, was a West African multilateral armed force established by the sub-regional body. ECOMOG was a formal arrangement for separate armies to work together. It was largely supported by personnel and resources of the Nigerian Armed Forces, with sub-battalion strength units contributed by other ECOWAS members which included Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, The Gambia, Liberia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, among others.\n\nWhile the protocol on Mutual Defence Assistance was signed in Freetown, Sierra Leone, on May 29, 1981, Anglophone ECOWAS members were established ECOMOG in 1990 to intervene in the civil war in Liberia (1989 to 1996). ECOMOG had been described as the first credible attempt at a regional security initiative in Africa.. Its establishment was spearheaded by Nigeria\u2019s then military President, Ibrahim Babangida.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "TechCabal is surging ahead in 2022 and beyond \ud83d\ude80",
          "text": "Hello everyone, welcome to February.\n\nYou probably already know this \u2014 because we\u2019ve mentioned it a few times \u2014 but TechCabal started off in a small room in Lagos many years ago. 2013 to be specific. It is safe to say that, nearly 9 years later, TechCabal has grown to become much more than a predictable technology blog or website. We\u2019ve gone from reviewing gadgets to talking to Meta\u2019s VP MEA and Turkey about facebook\u2019s plans to transition into the metaverse. We are still optimistic about Nigerian founders and the Nigerian tech ecosystem. Still, we\u2019ve covered high-impact entrepreneurs from other regions like Sudan, Egypt, Morocco, Senegal, and The Gambia in the last two years.\n\nAnd we have no plans of slowing down. This year, we are hyper-focused on fine-tuning our editorial standards and establishing TechCabal as one of Africa\u2019s most reputable technology and media publication. We will lead compelling conversations on hot-button topics such as decentralized communities, digital nomads, remote work, talent migration, and the new internet. Furthermore, expect us to spotlight more African founders innovating around draconian policies, internet shutdowns, and social media bans. Our coverage will expand into lesser-known regions, cities, and startup hubs.\n\nFor us, 2022 is about executing our goals, delighting our readers, and putting Africa\u2019s technology ecosystem on the global stage. We hope we can count on you to support us along the way.\n\nWhat is new?\n\nAdegoke \u201cGoke\u201d Oyeniyi is no longer TechCabal\u2019s editor-in-chief and has moved on to pursue some personal goals and interests. Goke joined the newsroom in January 2021 and hit the ground running almost immediately. He provided high-level oversight of TechCabal\u2019s objectives, worked closely with our senior reporters, and drove editorial training weekly. He also contributed some well-researched articles to the newsroom; read his insight into rising Nigerian fintech startup, TeamApt.\n\nFollowing Goke\u2019s exit from the newsroom, I am stepping up to become TechCabal\u2019s acting editor-in-chief, reporting directly to Tomiwa Aladekomo, CEO, Big Cabal Media. My new role comes with many responsibilities, but I am motivated by my team and goals this year. I also know I have the full support of Big Cabal Media\u2019s leadership team and the entire organization.\n\nAbraham Augustine is the most recent addition to our newsroom. He resumed on January 17th as a senior reporter. Abraham is a growth marketing specialist and creator who operates at the intersection of growth, marketing & startup enablement in Africa. Abraham manages a Substack newsletter called Money Myths Africa.\n\nWhat has changed?\n\nLast year, we brought in our first East Africa correspondent. Alexandria Williams joined the newsroom as a remote contract reporter. She wrote about Uber\u2019s showdown against Kenya\u2019s high court and a Kenyan comedian\u2019s rise to digital fame during her time with us. Alexandria was accepted into one of DW\u2019s journalism traineeship programs in December, so she will not be continuing as our East Africa reporter this year.\n\nFor your information:\n\nKelechi Njoku joined the newsroom as senior editor in November 2021. He\u2019s an experienced editor with a literary and fine arts background. One of his most significant achievements was fine-tuning TechCabal\u2019s style guide.\n\nMuyiwa Olowogboyega joined Lemonade Finance as their content manager in October 2021. He was a senior staff writer at TechCabal for 1 year and 8 months. Muyiwa co-authored TC Daily with Daniel Adeyemi.\n\nAlexander Onukwue joined Quartz Africa as their West Africa correspondent. He was a staff writer at TechCabal for almost 2 years. He also wrote TechCabal\u2019s Next Wave newsletter for an extended period.\n\nStorytelling and coverage (TechCabal 3.0)\n\nOn storytelling and reporting, TechCabal is still committed to capturing the players, human impact and business of technology on the continent. We are even more dedicated to covering more regions, including North Africa, South Africa, and francophone Africa. TechCabal Insights team will continue to provide up-to-date content, reports, data, events, and context to help the world understand how technology is changing Africa. We will publish deep dives on cryptocurrency, the metaverse, DAOs, decentralization, policy, regulation, and big tech operators in Africa.\n\nWhat is coming soon?\n\nNewsletters\n\nTechCabal has plans to launch some new newsletter products. Sadly, we cannot reveal the details, but keep your eyes peeled for more information in TC Daily or Next Wave.\n\nFlagships\n\nKelechi Njoku will revive My Life in Tech (MLIT) in the coming weeks. MLIT is a flagship launched by Kay Uguwede, a former TechCabal staff writer. After Kay\u2019s exit from the newsroom, Edwin Madu took over MLIT during his time as senior editor in the newsroom. He is currently Zikoko\u2019s editor-in-chief.\n\nSultan Quadri and Timi Odueso will revive Digital Nomads by the end of February this year. Digital Nomads was launched and exclusively written by Olumuyiwa, a former senior staff writer at TechCabal.\n\nExtra hands\n\nIn 2022, we will recruit senior editors, reporters, and regional correspondents. In addition, we will report on more countries outside Nigeria, Ghana, and West Africa. Nigeria has quickly become the poster child for fast-growing startups and the top recipient of foreign investments. But Kenya, Egypt, and South Africa are following closely behind. Egypt is home to the most accelerated startups and founders on the continent. By bringing in analytical thinkers and on-the-ground reporters, we\u2019ll be able to tell more compelling stories about the impact of technology in these newer regions.\n\nThank you!\n\nWell, that\u2019s about it from the newsroom. As always, we are immensely grateful for supporting and betting on us through the years. Thank you for falling in love with our newsletters, reviews, flagships, columns, tweets, and contributions. We hope to delight you even more in 2022 and beyond.\n\nTechCabal is a pan-Africa media and technology publication. We cover the human impact of technology in Africa and how innovation is changing the business landscape on the continent. Our current coverage areas include West, East, and North Africa.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Say hello, and we\u2019ll share a fun article with you \ud83d\ude04\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Adaobi* is a 24-year-old software engineer living with her 49-year-old mother Oge* at Lekki Phase 1, in Lagos, Nigeria. On the morning of January 1 this year, she complained of a sore throat and took some Strepsils for it. By the next morning, however, her sore throat got worse\u2014and her mother began to feel an itch in hers as well.\n\nBoth women went to the hospital and there tested positive for COVID-19. They were then placed on medication and advised to self-isolate. Now, their gateman Bosun*, who must have caught the virus from them, thought he had malaria and got on antimalarial medications. But, after a week, his symptoms persisted, so he decided to switch medicines to honey, ginger, and turmeric mixed in hot water, as advised by a friend.\n\nAccording to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Nigeria entered the 4th wave of COVID-19 in December, reporting 223,887 cases and 2,985 deaths in its 36 states and federal capital Abuja. This is an over-500% increase.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe surge in COVID-19 cases during the December festive period may be attributed to 2 major factors: the mass of unquarantined people that came into Nigeria from abroad, especially into Lagos; and the several crowded gatherings where social distancing practices were not observed.\n\nIn the case of Adaobi and her mother, Adaobi had attended several crowded outdoor activities in December and her mother had just returned from a business trip in Europe, so it\u2019s difficult to determine who infected who.\n\nLike Bosun, many Nigerians are ignorant of the symptoms of COVID-19. On top of that, many people do not see a doctor whenever they feel sick, preferring instead to self-medicate, with the belief that they have \u201cordinary malaria\u201d. This is what\u2019s currently happening in Lagos and, according to Remedial Health, a healthtech startup that improves access to original medicines by creating a direct supply chain between retailers and manufacturers or registered distributors, Lekki Phase 1\u2014one of the highbrow areas of Lagos\u2014is at the center of it all.\n\nRemedial Health founder and CEO, Samuel Okwuada, told TechCabal over a call that their company saw a 250% increase in orders for anti-malarial drugs in December last year from pharmacies and chemists in Lekki Phase 1.\n\n\u201cIt started around November but peaked in December. We noticed that customers in Lekki Phase 1 that would normally order 20 packs of antimalarial drugs for sale within 3\u20134 days were now ordering 60\u201370 packs every 1\u20132 days,\u201d said Okwuada. \u201cWhen we asked the manufacturers for more products and they told us they\u2019d reached their production limit, we realised this is more serious than we thought.\u201d\n\nDrugs like Artemether & Lumefantrine and Vitamin C saw about 250% and 130% increase, respectively, in demand. This continual spike in demand of antimalarial drugs\u2014which is still happening\u2014led Remedial Health to investigate the cause. Their conversations with pharmacists on the frontline suggests that some of the symptoms reported by customers are more consistent with COVID-19 than malaria.\n\n\n\n\n\nA sore throat is not indicative of malaria but it is one of the major symptoms of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe number of COVID-19 cases in Lekki is overwhelming. When these people come to the clinic, they always complain of malaria but test positive for COVID-19,\u201d said a lab scientist who works at a testing centre in Lekki and who spoke to TechCabal anonymously.\n\nAnother resident of Lekki Phase 1 jokingly said he suspects everybody in Lekki has the virus already. \u201cThat\u2019s an old story now. It\u2019s just another malaria symptom,\u201d he said.\n\nThe importance of data in combating the virus\n\nIt\u2019s no more news that healthcare institutions around the globe are using data to design better pandemic responses and train frontline staff. Without appropriate data, misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus will flood the media and undermine efforts to sensitise the public.\n\nThe World Health Organisation\u2019s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, once said, \u201cWe\u2019re not just fighting a pandemic; we\u2019re fighting an infodemic.\u201d\n\nGovernments across the world are using data to drive COVID-19 innovation to mend the economic stress, misinformation, and division the virus has unleashed on the world. In Nigeria, the Global Partnership UNECA worked with the country\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) to create a comprehensive data hub to show where cases of COVID-19 were occurring and what support might be needed.\n\nIn Togo, the government is using artificial intelligence, via GiveDirect-Novissi COVID-19 Aid, to collect and collate data of the poorest communities in order to provide them with contactless financial aid through mobile money.\n\nAccording to a Reuter data, COVID-19 infections are decreasing in Nigeria, with 94 new infections reported on average each day. That\u2019s 5% of the peak\u2014the highest daily average reported on December 27. Okwuada, the lab scientist and some Lekki residents that spoke to TechCabal believes that these numbers are underreported and that is evident from the case of people like Bosun. Where\u2019s their own number? However, even though data is not a direct antidote to the virus and not always correct, Okwuada believes it\u2019s a strong fighting instrument. He said data is essential to curbing the spread of the virus and, possibly, ending the disease altogether.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Founded in 2016 by Niklas Adalberth, one of the founders of Swedish fintech unicorn Klarna, Norrsken Foundation was set up to help entrepreneurs solve the world\u2019s biggest challenges through its Norrsken House, a Stockholm-based co-working space for over 350 impact entrepreneurs, the Norrsken Founders Fund, and Norrsken VC.\n\nIn 2019, the foundation set up a base in Rwanda, through which it planned to invest across the East and Central African region. Last year, it accepted 11 African startups into the inaugural Norrsken Impact Accelerator.\n\nNorrsken is now working with Hans Otterling, partner at Northzone, and an investment team led by Natalie Kolbe, ex global head of private equity at Actis in South Africa; Actis colleague Ngetha Waithaka in Kenya; and Lexi Novitske, founder of Acuity Venture Partners, on the new Norrsken22 Africa Tech Growth Fund.\n\nThe fund, backed by 30 unicorn founders, contributing their skills and $65 million in funding, announced its first close of $110 million on Tuesday. Olugbenga Agboola, co-founder of Flutterwave and Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m, co-founder of Skype are some of these backers. Norrsken22 is managed by a team of general partners involved in the African tech ecosystem, with decades of experience supporting entrepreneurs in Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa.\n\nTechCabal caught up with Novitske to discuss the inspiration behind Norrsken22, its investment criteria, the current venture capital landscape in Africa, and what sectors she thinks the next set of African unicorn startups will emerge from.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMichael: What inspired the move to back growth-stage startups in Africa?\n\nNovitske: Through my firm Acuity (and its predecessor Singularity Investments) we were active investors in early-stage companies across Africa. We co-invested with many other local investors. What we saw was that, as our companies scaled across the continent there was not sufficient local capital to back these growth-stage rounds. Our investee companies like Mono, Flutterwave, mPharma were pushed to take time away from their business on the ground to travel to Silicon Valley and educate international investors about the Africa growth story. These same investors have certainly seized the opportunity, but their capital can only go so far in providing the value these companies need to scale. This was the obvious missing middle to me \u2013 be the partner that these companies can leverage to lock down the best customers, identify the best local talent, and provide regulatory, cultural, and strategy expertise when scaling from one African market to another.\n\nMichael: Norrsken22 has 30 unicorn founders and a local advisory council board comprising leading African business figures. What was it like getting everyone on board?\n\nNovitske: Our Unicorn Board members are an incredible resource for our fund. These successful founders of billion-dollar-plus businesses are all committing capital as investors, but beyond that, they are committing their time and network to unlock the toughest challenges some of our partner companies might face. They\u2019ve been through the experience of scaling similar businesses in other markets, and may even end up being strategic partners for our companies. Likewise, our Advisory Council has built some of the largest businesses traversing the African continent and has insights and connections that are invaluable to our companies. Some of these individuals are excited to share their insights to create the next generation of entrepreneurs. For others, they understand that Africa tech is one of the great investment opportunities of our time and want to play an active role in building value for their investment interests. And for others it\u2019s more strategic: they see Africa as a market that they would like to expand their business into through partnerships or acquisitions, and they want to start building these relationships now.\n\nMichael: What are the investment criteria at Norrsken22? What will make you consider a startup for investment?\n\nNovitske: We have taken a narrow focus on our investment criteria. Not because we don\u2019t believe there are no other attractive investment opportunities outside of our mandate, but because we want to be absolutely the best at what we do. Our resources are dedicated to backing companies from the Series A to C rounds, with real customers, repeatable revenue, attractive unit economics, and in our primary markets and sectors. These primary markets are Nigeria, Ghana, Southern Africa, and Eastern Africa. This is also where we have a team on the ground that can really identify and support our partner companies. It\u2019s important to mention that we have set aside approximately half of our funds to support our portfolio champions throughout their lifecycle. Innovation success stories sometimes take time to unlock, and we are committed to being there for the journey.\n\nMichael: Where (what sectors) do you think the next set of Africa\u2019s unicorn startups will emerge from?\n\nNovitske: We believe the most scalable opportunities today are in fintech, market enablement, healthtech, and edutech. These are also the sectors that we believe are solving some of Africa\u2019s key societal problems. Market enablement includes software, marketplaces, and APIs [Application Programming Interface] that are unlocking more efficient trade, logistics, and customer engagement. We are especially excited about the crossover of these two sectors in areas such as embedded finance. And I do not believe everything has already been done in fintech \u2013 there are many opportunities still to be unlocked!\n\nMichael: What\u2019s your impression of the current VC landscape in Africa?\n\nNovitske: I am very excited by the transformation I have seen in the VC landscape on the continent; but even more excited by the energy of the tech entrepreneurs. There are really great teams building need-to-have products for a very large market opportunity, and frankly not enough capital to support their ambitions. Early-stage investors like Ventures Platform, 4dx, and Rabo (and some successful Africa tech angels) have done an incredible job investing and supporting early-stage companies, but there is still a dearth of capital at the growth stage on the continent. In 2021, there were only 114 deals that had larger than $5 million rounds; compared with the total 818 deals done on the continent above $100k (as per Briter Bridges). That number drops off sharply when you\u2019re looking at deals over $10 million.\n\nLexi Novitske (down-left) in the Norrsken22 team. Image credit: Supplied\n\nMichael: There is still some lethargy on the side of African and Africa-based investors. Are there any implications for the ecosystem?\n\nNovitske: Entrepreneurs are the machine that drives the growth in tech ecosystems, but investors are the oil. An investors\u2019 job is to provide resources behind the top teams to help them realise their company\u2019s potential, and resources is NOT just cash. Local investors have insights from doing businesses on the continent or networks that no international investor can have, even if they have the deepest pockets. We have started to see real exits happen and real money flowing in, and Africa-based investors are getting excited. I think the more local capital and expertise that can be deployed, the faster we will realise the evolution of sustainable ecosystems, wealth creation, and access to scalable services to empower the mass population on the continent.\n\nMichael: How can we drive even more local VC participation in the startup ecosystem?\n\nNovitske: Africa has a population of 1.2 billion, where 60% are below 25 years old. In the next decade, this young, digital-first generation will change the world. Technology is enabling the region to leapfrog legacy industries and is pivoting key sectors. I believe it\u2019s obvious that the emerging tech ecosystem in Africa offers one of the great investment opportunities of our time. If that isn\u2019t reason enough for VC participation, I\u2019m not sure what is.\n\nI also want to applaud the ecosystem builders that are working on initiatives that make doing business easier for startups, including the StartUp Bill in Nigeria, and similar initiatives in Kenya and South Africa. I should also highlight that the Norrsken Foundation will re-invest its portion of the capital generated by Norrsken22 back into supporting entrepreneurship, to further promote the growth of the African tech ecosystem and a new generation of tech founders.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

In September 2021, we got wind of the company\u2019s plan to add an option that enables customers to pay for logistics services with crypto.\n\nWe speculated that the company would create its crypto token to be used as a means of payment and investment in GIGL. We concluded that the company would have its crypto token, which would grow in value because of the practical use case, consequently becoming a huge revenue stream.\n\nWhile our speculations missed the mark, our sources were spot on.\n\nGIGL has integrated a crypto wallet into its proprietary delivery app, GIGGO. Users can now perform basic crypto transactions such as buying, selling, \u2018hodling\u2019, and transferring crypto right on the app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe integration will be done in two initial beta phases before it is available to the public. The first beta phase will see the crypto wallet opened to 2,000 users, with up to 10,000 users having access in the second phase.\n\nThe wallet integration is in partnership with XPAD, a platform that allows users to store, invest, and stake in real-world assets with crypto. XPAD users can import their XPAD wallet into the GIGGO crypto wallet. Those without an XPAD wallet can create one directly on GIGGO.\n\nA ploy to onboard users for XPAD?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Ocholi Etu, Director, Operational Services Hub, integrating a crypto wallet into the GIGGO app \u201caligns with the company\u2019s long-standing strategy to be at the forefront of innovation.\u201d\n\nWhile it might be interesting to see crypto payments on the GIGGO app, the wallet integration only helps to perform basic crypto functions.\n\nThe wallet, an extension of the app, is not directly connected to the services offered on the app; it can only be used for buying, selling, storing, and transferring crypto.\n\nAlthough the company claims the integration gives users more things to do with the app, the onboarding process ensures that users without an XPAD account create one, a way to onboard GIGGO users to XPAD.\n\nEven though the connection between GIGL and XPAD is not clearly defined, GIGL is one of the app\u2019s supporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXPAD supporters\n\nWith several crypto exchanges offering the same services as XPAD, GIGGO, with over 100,000 users on Google Play, presents an innovative way to onboard users to the platform; XPAD, on the other hand, has over 500 users on Google Play.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the creation of Bitcoin, the crypto space has been associated with scams, making crypto users wary of the crypto platforms they use. Connecting XPAD, a new platform with GIGL, a trusted company, creates a sense of security.\n\nWith GIGL entering the crypto space, one can safely speculate that it might be creating its crypto token. The wallet, which currently supports only Bitcoin, USDT and CFX might also be GIGL\u2019s way of preparing its users for crypto payments.\n\nOn why it is important to drive crypto adoption, Etu explained that crypto could make payments easier, and GIGL is only playing its role in accelerating crypto adoption, which could be the next phase of finance globally.\n\nAn innovative way to join the crypto payments race\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Fundera, 15,174 businesses accept Bitcoin as payment globally, including notable companies like US tech company, Microsoft, and American movie theatre chain, AMC.\n\nIn Africa, cryptocurrencies are mostly used for speculative purposes \u2014 trading and hodling. But they are also known to be used because of the ease they bring to cross-border transactions.\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies are growing in popularity as a means of payment, many businesses are yet to accept them. However, GIGL believes this could change with time and wants to prepare its users for it.\n\nThe preparation model, however, might be one of the most innovative yet. While it can be argued that the wallet integration does not directly improve the app, it could be a great way to introduce cryptocurrencies to non-crypto users.\n\nWith only a fraction of the world\u2019s population using crypto, businesses have very little incentive to accept crypto payments. Nevertheless, GIGL is innovatively driving adoption through its platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nAn unconventional investing style\n\nAffordable insurance in Nigeria\n\nAfya Rekod\u2019s $2m raise\n\nAn untapped investment style\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s only logical that most investors and venture capital firms invest in a startup capable of scaling. Their investments should yield the desired results.\n\nTo manage the risk of investing in startups that might not scale, most investors look at assets and balance sheets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Untapped Global knows startups with promising futures might not always have impressive balance sheets or assets. That is why it uses a tech called the Internet of Things (IoT) as its risk management strategy.\n\nInternet of what? This means connecting physical objects to the Internet, for example, a fitness tracker or an air conditioner that can be controlled over the Internet.\n\nUntapped Global could, for example, loan out a bicycle to Chimgozirim (which I doubt knows how to ride a bicycle) to deliver puff puffs. Instead of looking for data that shows Chimgozirim is an expert at delivering puff puffs, they give him the bicycle and track his progress with IoT. Within a few weeks, they can tell if he\u2019s a good investment or not.\n\nBut does this work in all cases?\n\nWell, Chimgozirim had a chat with Jim Chu, Founder of Untapped Global, and he revealed the details of the VC\u2019s unconventional investment style. Please read it here: How Untapped Global backs growth stage African startups by using smart asset financing\n\nInsurance is not a thing in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gap between the rate of insurance penetration in many parts of Africa and most Western countries is probably more expansive than the physical distance between both regions.\n\nPer Statista, as of 2020, 91.4% of Americans have health insurance. This is in sharp contrast to Africa\u2019s insurance penetration rate, which stood at 2.78% in 2019. In Nigeria, over 97% of the population does not have any form of health insurance.\n\nWhy is this the case? According to Dataphyte, a media research and data analytics organisation, health insurance in Nigeria, besides government programmes, is expensive for the average citizen. Nigeria ranked as the third-highest country with the most out-of-pocket health spending in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Bode Pedro, CEO of Casava, a Nigerian insurtech company, told TechCrunch that the reason for low insurance penetration is that people prefer to invest in positive rather than adverse outcomes.\n\nThere\u2019s an opportunity here: With very few people insured in the country, there is an untapped insurance market to take advantage of.\n\nCasava has raised $4 million in pre-seed funding to take advantage of Nigeria\u2019s untapped insurance market.\n\nLed by Target Global with participation from other investors, including Shola Akinlade, Paystack Co-Founder and Olugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, the startup wants to offer Nigerians affordable income and health insurance.\n\nLicensed as Nigeria\u2019s first microinsurance underwriter, Casava offers income protection for as low as $1 per month. Subscribers will get paid monthly for six months if they lose their job or become unable to work.\n\nWith subscriptions available via the website or mobile app, it will be interesting to see Casava\u2019s impact on insurance in Nigeria. Perhaps insurance could become a thing in the country through the startup.\n\nAfya Rekod\u2019s $2m pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by National Cancer Institute on Unsplash\n\nKenyan health data platform Afya Rekod has closed a $2 million seed round led by Mac Venture Capital.\n\nWhat does it do? The startup allows patients and hospitals to access, store, and track a patient\u2019s health data.\n\nLaunched in April 2020, it also performs other functions like hospital management and inventory management.\n\nThe founder, John Kamara, said the startup is \u201cfocused on building a dynamic platform that streamlines health records with analytics and provides access to specialised clinics and experts.\u201d\n\nThe fund will be essential to Afya Rekod\u2019s growth as its goal is to become the leading patient mobility-focused health platform in the world.\n\nHealthtech in Africa: While healthtech is nowhere near fintech for massive funding rounds, it is still a force to be reckoned with in the African tech ecosystem. In 2021, it came in second to fintech.\n\nThe sector is also displaying exciting innovations that could make it even more attractive to investors.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nTeen Who Demanded $50,000 From Elon Musk Is Now Targeting More Billionaire Jets.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring his presidency, Donald Trump aggressively pursued an \u201cAmerica First\u201d strategy as he sought to \u201creturn\u201d the US to its place as the dominant power in the world. Consequently, there was a reduction in aid to developing countries.\n\nIn 2021, the United Kingdom also announced that aid to African countries would be reduced by 66%. This followed a trend of less money in aid flowing to developing countries, including African countries.\n\nFor a long time, discussions about development in Africa usually revolved around aids. That approach has not particularly paid off, with experts believing it has fostered a culture of dependency. However, African tech seems to be changing all that with venture-backed investments increasing due to amazing levels of innovation across the continent.\n\nAs a volunteer in Nigeria with Doctors Without Borders \u2014 a non-profit organisation committed to providing medical personnel to underserved areas \u2014 Jim Chu believed that volunteering with development organisations was his way of impacting the world. However, he soon realised that helping businesses access the funds they need to grow their operations was a better option. That realisation led him to start Untapped Global in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe created Untapped to fill a hole that I saw as an investor and as an entrepreneur over and over again in Haiti, Kenya, South Africa, and other places. Some people call that hole \u2018The valley of death\u2019 or \u2018The missing level\u2019, but it\u2019s the space where you\u2019re no longer a very early startup, but you\u2019re also not a very well established company. You\u2019re in-between, and companies at this stage find it difficult to raise capital; it\u2019s even harder if you\u2019re outside the traditional investment thesis,\u201d Chu says.\n\nDemocratising prosperity using smart asset financing\n\nWith most venture capital going to companies that can scale at astronomical rates, such as fintech, other companies find it challenging to raise funds even though they can create great value. Untapped Global was founded to fill this gap. Unlike typical investment strategies, Untapped Global funds assets that can create economic value.\n\nFor example, imagine a young man, Taiwo, from a village in Southern Nigeria, who has just moved to Lagos. Without an education, he is unable to get a good job. Also, his lack of credit history means he cannot get a loan to start a business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlexClub is one of Untapped Global\u2019s portfolio companies\n\nUsing data from IoT devices, a company backed by Untapped Global could give Taiwo a tricycle for commercial transportation. The tricycle would be monitored to know how well Taiwo utilises this asset. If he does not use it profitably, the company retrieves it and gives it to someone else. Untapped Global invests in these companies and, in return, receives a percentage of the business\u2019 revenue.\n\nChu explains how Untapped Global works.\n\n\u201cThe conventional way of managing risk is, \u2018Show me your balance sheets. Show me the assets you have.\u2019 So you have a house, and you take a loan against the house, and we sign a lot of papers so that if you don\u2019t pay me back, we send a lot of lawyers to make sure you pay me back or I take over your house.\n\n\u201cNot everyone has a house or asset that can be collateralised, but everyone has the energy. So what we do, instead, is we use data to say, \u2018Okay, you don\u2019t have a house, but you can drive a motorcycle. The asset we give you is the motorcycle, and we use IoT to track that motorcycle using the data you generate from it to manage the risk.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the firm does not only use smart asset financing as an investment tool, having made equity investments in startups like Opibus, an electric vehicle company in Kenya; Nigerian fintech startup, Paga; Flexclub, a car financing company in South Africa; Eden Life; OnePipe; Inspira Farms; and Asaak, a company providing financing services for motorbikes in Uganda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow much does Untapped Global invest?\n\nWith a slightly different investment model, Untapped Global has no average ticket size. Instead, it invests between $50,000 and $3 million in its portfolio companies.\n\n\u201cThere is no average ticket size because our due diligence process is tied up in the ticket sizes,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Water ATM in Kenya\n\nTypically, after a company indicates interest in being funded by an investor, the investor carries out a due diligence process to ascertain if the company is worth investing in. Untapped Global does this differently.\n\nInstead of a regular due diligence process, the firm launches a pilot where it finances a business\u2019 assets, starting with $50,000 or more. The pilot could last for a few weeks, and they make an investment decision based on the data gotten from the process.\n\nBiggest mistakes startups make\n\nDeciding to start a business is signing up for uncertainty. As a result, even the most experienced founders could make mistakes. Chu believes that one of the biggest mistakes African founders make is not knowing what type of capital they need for their business.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of startup founders make the mistake of using equity capital when they should be using non-dilutive debt or other kinds of non-equity capital to run their business. If you\u2019re a software startup, you don\u2019t need that much CapEx, but if you\u2019re an asset-heavy company using equity investments, you\u2019re going to run out of cap table at some point.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn bad investments, missed opportunities, and successes\n\nEven with strict adherence to a due diligence process, venture financing can still go wrong. With several businesses not making it to the five-year mark, many businesses funded by venture capitalists are likely to fail. Untapped Global\u2019s unconventional investment methods means that it could detect a bad investment within weeks by testing the waters before making a permanent commitment.\n\n\u201cOur data helps us to detect a bad investment in as little as a few weeks, and because we give out small amounts of money, we can cut off the financing whenever we like,\u201d Chu reveals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, traditional VC firms may have to wait a few months before realising that an investment won\u2019t go according to plan. While Untapped Global has been funding startups for barely two years, Chu lists FlexClub, Paga, and Asaak as some of their biggest successes.\n\nMost investors in Africa invest in various industries, but Chu says Untapped Global is focused on mobility, water infrastructure, and energy. Its investment method also means that its investments are not tied to particular funding rounds.\n\nSo, if you have a business that already generates revenue in any of these industries, you can apply to get funded by sending an email to deals@untappedglobal.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "Africa needs industrialisation-led growth to match Asia\u2019s success",
          "text": "Africa\u2019s quest to achieve significant growth and development can become a near-term reality if the continent, with one of the world\u2019s youngest populations, replicates the industrialisation-led expansion that powered Asia.\n\nAccording to world economists and industry experts at the just concluded Africa Business Convention by BusinessDay, the aggressive adoption of industrialisation can open the door to the continent\u2019s prosperity, especially as it embarks on recovery post-pandemic.\n\n\u201cFor Africa to get the sustainable 6-8 percent growth Asia has had in the last few decades, it requires industrialisation, an educated population, electricity and Morocco\u2019s interest of 2 percent,\u201d Charles Robertson, global chief economist, Renaissance Capital, said.\n\nAbout five decades ago, the Asian Tigers, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan, were in almost similar conditions as most African countries, but they leveraged the impact of industrialisation and evolved from being third world economies to topping the chart.\n\nThe governments of the \u2018tiger\u2019 nations in the early 1960s, when the global economy was just starting to recover after the traumas of the Second World War, took advantage and invested heavily in industrialisation, building major industrial estates, offering tax incentives to foreign investors, and implementing compulsory education for its young population to secure the future of the workforce.\n\n\u201cTransformation of Asia from its status as the most impoverished region to the growth locomotive of the world economy within the past five decades is unprecedented and dramatic. Led by East Asian countries, the industrial transformation and socio-economic progress may have lessons for the latecomers,\u201d the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) said in a report.\n\nThanks to the evolution of technology, Africa\u2019s success story may take a shorter route, industry experts at the Business Convention said on Wednesday.\n\nWith industrialisation as the foundation to economic growth and development, industry experts at the BusinessDay Convention believe Africa can ride on the wings of advanced technology in critical sectors like manufacturing, agriculture, and others to lift millions of its citizens from poverty.\n\nPeter Quartey, a professor in the institution of statistical, social and economic research, University of Ghana, also pointed at the importance of industrialisation for Africa\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cMany African countries have become import-dependent, with less production, less manufacturing and more consumption and have become distribution networks. We need to transform the industries in Africa, that\u2019s where we will find the jobs,\u201d Quartey said.\n\nIf Africa fails to pay attention to industrialisation, Quartey said, it will only be creating jobs for others who have developed their countries.\n\nBloomberg data that tracked 82 countries globally ranked three African countries with the world\u2019s highest unemployment rate in 2021. South Africa, the continent\u2019s most industrialised nation, topped the chart with Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy occupying the third spot after Namibia.\n\nThanks to industrialisation, the \u2018tiger\u2019 nations have some of the world\u2019s highest human capital index, Singapore (0.88), Hong Kong (0.81) and South Korea (0.80) compared to African countries such as Nigeria (0.36), Angola (0.36), Ethiopia (0.38) and Tanzania (0.38). The World Bank said 80 percent of the world\u2019s extreme poor reside in countries with a human capital index under 0.5.\n\nLike Asia did some five decades ago when the continent concentrated its resources on infrastructure development, industry experts believe Africa needs to channel more funds in the things that can benefit it in the nearest future.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure is the bridge Africa needs to economic growth,\u201d Dolapo Ogunmekan, partner/group head, international energy portfolio, Platform Investment.\n\n\u201cApproval, licence delays and funding issues have been the bane of infrastructure, and a robust entrepreneurial class will help develop the continent,\u201d Ogunmekan said.\n\nExperts define industrialisation as the process by which an economy is transformed from a primarily agricultural one to one based on the manufacturing of goods, which involves the large-scale introduction of manufacturing, advanced technical enterprises, and other productive economic activity into an area, society, and country.\n\nThe experts at the Africa Business Convention unanimously agreed that the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) provides an opportunity through a larger market, the drive to develop competitive manufacturing industries, adoption of value addition practices, and enhanced capacity utilisation to achieve Africa\u2019s desired growth.\n\nAffirming that AfCFTA provides an opportunity for the continent, Quartey said, \u201cThere is a need for Africa to embark on transformative activities to properly optimise the opportunity of the agreement through the adoption of value addition practices and industrialised manufacturing.\n\n\u201cWith the trade agreement, we have a larger market but our products need to be differentiated and with a good quality, this is the only way we can benefit from the trade.\u201d\n\nIn driving economic growth, the industry experts at the business gathering said Africa\u2019s prospects in agriculture are largely underutilised, which partly contributes to its growth limitations, especially as major players in the sector are small-scale farmers equipped with little resources.\n\nFor example, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations notes that over 90 percent of the world\u2019s rice is produced in the Asia-Pacific region. This has contributed to providing a dynamic trade and economic activity with a positive impact on growth.\n\n\u201cCommercial agriculture has a significant challenge in sub-Saharan Africa, a very significant percentage of food produced in Africa is done by small-scale farmers. Farming is very profitable but not as a tiny scale,\u201d Dimieari Von Kemedi, CEO, Alluvial Agriculture, said.\n\nRead also: African countries need investment in export-related industries to achieve objectives of AfCFTA\n\nKemedi advised the African continent to effectively utilise its comparative advantage in agriculture, believing it will enhance the capacity and productivity of small-scale farmers.\n\nFollowing its ability to leverage industrialisation, it will help the continent attract significant investments that will rub off on the economy.\n\n\u201cForeign Direct Investment (FDI) goes into the richest countries and drops occasionally into developing countries, this is also the same with trade,\u201d Kemedi said.\n\nThe ability to create opportunities for its young talents to acquire skills and reduce brain drain will also play a role in taking Africa to its desired destination, the industry experts said.\n\nChecks by BusinessDay shows that the leading Asian countries that have some of the World\u2019s powerful economies today did not only invest in infrastructural development but also their education system.\n\nIn search of greener pastures, many of Africa\u2019s talented minds have been fleeing the continent and helping to develop other nations.\n\nFor example, Nigeria saw 805 medical doctors migrate to the UK between July and December 2021, according to the data by the British General Medical Council.\n\nThe continent needs to be healthy to achieve the much-needed development. It should therefore retain its health workers just as much as it needs to retain others in many other professions, industry experts said.\n\nTo boost the health sector and reduce brain drain, medical workers should have tax free incomes, said Akin Oyediran, managing director of Africa\u2019s largest disposable Syringe Company, Jubilee Syringe.\n\n\u201cThere will be no brain drain if there are no brains in the country. We must put in place incentives to retain them,\u201d Oyediran said.",
          "summary": "Thanks to the evolution of technology, Africa\u2019s success story may take a shorter route, industry experts at the Business Convention said on Wednesday.\nPeter Quartey, a professor in the institution of statistical, social and economic research, University of Ghana, also pointed at the importance of industrialisation for Africa\u2019s growth.\n\u201cInfrastructure is the bridge Africa needs to economic growth,\u201d Dolapo Ogunmekan, partner/group head, international energy portfolio, Platform Investment.\n\u201cCommercial agriculture has a significant challenge in sub-Saharan Africa, a very significant percentage of food produced in Africa is done by small-scale farmers.\nIt should therefore retain its health workers just as much as it needs to retain others in many other professions, industry experts said.",

          "title": "How tech firms are growing healthcare business",
          "text": "The disruption that investment by technology companies have brought into Nigeria\u2019s healthcare business has come to stay and continues to drive significant growth in the back and front ends of service delivery.\n\nThese companies are leveraging tech solutions to tweak the supply chain of care \u2013 from manufacturing to distribution, diagnostics, telemedicine, facility management and self-care services, among others.\n\nAs adoption of tech increases, those focused on servicing hospital needs have gained wider reach and are expanding to other segments of healthcare, compared to the slow growth trailing digital care services that target consumers directly.\n\nLifebank\u2019s revenue nearly doubled to over $1 million in 2021 from $600,000 in 2020, after diversifying into two products other than its core base of delivering blood supplies to hospitals.\n\nThe logistics company introduced AirCo, an oxygen plant in Nasarrawa State last year to address the dire demand for oxygen in hospitals. The plant uses predictive technology to generate medical oxygen, with a production capacity of 100 cylinders.\n\nIt also unveiled StockBank, a distribution system that distributes medical consumables across care centres in Africa. Lifebank eyes control of large stakes in the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) on the continent as it builds on the future of StockBank.\n\nLifestores Pharmacy is another tech-driven company that runs an efficient retail drug business, buying directly from manufacturers and importers to supply several hospitals. Its partnership with top local and international suppliers helps it reduce the risk of fake drugs, which remains a scourge in Nigeria\u2019s pharmaceutical industry.\n\nIt makes over $300,000 yearly, running its own chain of pharmacies and supporting affiliate pharmacies with tech solutions in store operations, inventory management and data capturing at points of sale, among other things.\n\nAnalysts are positive that the growth of tech-enabled infrastructure such as this will be sustained as gaps in Nigeria\u2019s healthcare structure offer attractive opportunities for investors to tap. Health indices in Nigeria remain one of the worst in the world and investors are upping efforts to solve these challenges.\n\nOlamide Brown, the founder of Flying Doctors Healthcare Investment Group, tells BusinessDay that the business-to-business segment of healthcare is growing significantly as businesses embrace these technology companies and the work they do.\n\n\u201cTechnological innovation is really transforming healthcare. Tech companies are changing the way that other businesses in healthcare run more efficiently.\n\n\u201cI think the healthcare sector is attractive in Nigeria and we haven\u2019t even scratched the surface. It will remain an area for private investment. There are different sub-sectors and opportunities across the healthcare value chain,\u201d Brown says.\n\nLifestores also integrates consumer products that allow people to speak with pharmacists, book free vital signs checks or order their medications digitally. An additional feature of its services is a programme dedicated to chronic diseases, giving millions of patients more personalised care.\n\nIn terms of healthcare facility management, more than 400 health facilities in three countries, including Nigeria, use Helium Health tech solutions for medical records keeping, telemedicine and multi-channel billing.\n\nIts solution enables healthcare funders such as health maintenance organisations (HMOs) or donor agencies with transparent payment systems and equally helps patients to access personal records, including prescriptions and lab results.\n\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, Helium Health activated its telemedicine platform. The move saw over 20 percent of its existing customers jump on the product as healthcare experts, especially doctors, needed ways to interact with patients outside the hospital walls and patients also were finding new healthcare providers.\n\nIt has also widened its portfolio to include a healthcare financing product that issues health facilities collateral-free loans.\n\nConsumer-targeted services\n\nTech companies are also changing the way consumers of healthcare access services. From the comfort of their phones, patients are able to access doctors, book appointments and get medications.\n\nHealthPlus, one of Nigeria\u2019s leading retail pharmacy chains, launched a mobile application last December, enabling patients to see pharmacists online, order their medications and receive it at home.\n\nThe e-pharmacy has a partnership with Jumia Logistics to ensure the delivery of healthcare products to its customers across the country.\n\nHowever, the growth of consumer-targeted services is still slow at the moment.\n\nThe digital care segment has not seen so much uptake across demographics in Nigeria, except within the upper-middle class where people are slowly becoming more open to telemedicine services and are also using more health monitoring apps, analysts tell BusinessDay.\n\nA 2021 market intelligence report titled \u201cInnovations in Health Product Distribution in Sub-Saharan Africa\u201d showed that user retention seems low among companies that target consumers directly, while provider-facing companies report much higher levels of retention.\n\nCompanies in this segment are banking on the potential of improved internet penetration in rural communities where quality care is scarce and urban areas that are affected by poor internet speed.\n\nThe accessible market is over 35 million Nigerians and could grow further by 25 percent year-on-year, Oluwatobiloba Banwo, Helium Health\u2019s head of private sector strategy, told BusinessDay in a report earlier.\n\n\u201cWe have seen MTN\u2019s announcement that they are doubling down on last-mile internet penetration in Nigeria and that\u2019s exciting because we know that the number of smartphones will continue to increase. We know that data costs will continue to go down and we know that it is going to be more affordable for people to be able to access the internet. So all of these points to the fact that business-to-consumer (BTC) value is coming but it depends on the number of smartphones and data cost,\u201d Brown states.\n\nOverall, analysts agree technology innovation will increasingly play a huge role in healthcare growth as companies jostle to outdo themselves with new initiatives.\n\nRead also: LASHMA partners PharmAccess to expand quality healthcare delivery\n\nBut companies will also have to deal with competition coming from traditional care providers who are now transforming their services into digitally accessible products.\n\nFor instance, Samuel Adekola, national chairman, Association of Community Pharmacists of Nigeria (ACPN), says the association is also seeing growing adoption of technology platforms by members and will continue as no one wants to be left behind in a fast-changing market.\n\n\u201cThere is huge potential in technology platforms because it increases accessibility without much inhibition. As a stakeholder, we approve it. But Nigerians must know that you cannot just go to any online platform to order drugs if it is not certified,\u201d according to Adekola.",

          "title": "Middle-East smart mobility investments a lesson for Africa",
          "text": "When you fly into any of Hamad International Airport, Doha, King Khalid International Airport, Riyadh, or Dubai International Airport, Dubai, it is difficult to believe that these cities were once where most African cities are.\n\nA few years ago, rural to urban migration was a big problem for many Middle Eastern nations, a situation African countries currently find themselves in. It led to congestion, city pollution, pressure on existing transport infrastructure, and drag on low to middle-class growth.\n\nToday, the story is different because of the various countries\u2019 decisions to prioritise investment in smart mobility that will in turn power ambitious smart city projects.\n\nA report from the International Data Corporation (IDC) estimated that the region has invested about $2.3 billion in smart city technologies by the end of 2021.\n\nThe rapid push for smart city technologies is part of measures to address the region\u2019s challenges of population growth and increased consumption while unlocking economic and sustainability benefits.\n\nAnthony Butler, chief technology officer of IBM Middle East, who spoke at the LEAP Technology conference in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, noted that 65 percent of the world will be living in the cities by 2050. This is why it has become imperative for countries to re-imagine how their cities are planned, with particular emphasis on mobility.\n\nNations in the Middles East have become aggressive in pursuing this mandate. The number of people in the Middle East has grown to 456 million as of 2021 from 411 million in 2016. In that same period, Africa\u2019s population grew to 1.37 billion from 1.2 billion.\n\nWhile African countries lag even with an exploding population on their hands, in the Middle East, agencies and governments are racing to adopt smarter, safer, cleaner, and more efficient transportation systems and solutions to improve the mobility of cities or entire countries and to improve the lifestyle of the region\u2019s population.\n\nYou see this as you make your way through the airports to the cities\u2019 multiple transport systems. For instance, while in Lagos, Nigeria, you have to shove your way through a crowd of people, immigration officers, and airport staff to catch a flight. In Doha or Riyadh, you have multiple transport options like a speed train ride within the airport, a special assistance vehicle and other modern means of catching your flight without breaking a sweat.\n\nWhat is smart mobility?\n\nAccording to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), smart mobility uses innovative digital technologies and solutions to create open and connected transportation networks that can move people and freight more efficiently and sustainably than in the past.\n\nSmart mobility has huge benefits for countries like Nigeria with urban mobility and congestion problems in cities like Lagos, Port Harcourt, Onitsha. Lagos, for example, loses over N4 trillion annually to traffic congestion, according to research by the Danne Institute.\n\nThe amount lost is a culmination of the 14.12 million hours lost by Lagosians while commuting to work on a daily basis. With the population of the state set to grow even further from the current estimates of 20 million, the traffic congestion is unlikely to go away if nothing is urgently done to address it.\n\nThe state government has over the years made efforts to address these problems, but as countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have shown, it requires an elaborate and deliberate national effort to achieve. It is not enough to just widen existing roads or build new roads, bridges, and other traditional infrastructure. Experts say governments need to rethink their approach to transportation and focus on smart mobility.\n\nSmart mobility is a national agenda\n\nFor a country like Nigeria, having an efficient technology-driven transport system should be a national mandate. For Saudi Arabia, the journey to smart city and mobility formally kicked off in 2016 with the unveiling of the Saudi Vision 2020, \u201ca strategic framework to reduce Saudi Arabia\u2019s dependence on oil, diversify its economy and develop public service sectors such as transport, health, education, infrastructure, recreation, and tourism,\u201d a statement from LEAP noted. The country is currently hosting over 100,000 delegates from around the world at the global tech conference.\n\nSmart mobility being nationally driven ensures the government can easily bring together all the states to find a sustainable approach to creating a sustainable smart transport infrastructure that links businesses and individuals from one part of the country to another.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, the investments are also driven by a collective agenda of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) for smart mobility offerings, using innovative digital technologies and solutions to create open and connected transportation networks in the region that can move people and freight more efficiently and sustainably than in the past. The kingdom and other GCC countries have since expended billions of dollars to bring this project to fruition.\n\nIn Dubai, which has deployed the most investments in smart cities and mobility, projects such as the Bluewaters Group Transit and the introduction of autonomous aerial vehicles serve as benchmarks for future autonomous vehicle projects throughout the Middle East.\n\nGovernment-led but private-sector driven\n\nIn as much as the governments in the Middle East have committed substantial capital to smart mobility, the private sector drives the actual development.\n\nThis means that contract issuing is not a primary concern of the government, the private sector is very involved in the conceptualisation, building, and delivery processes. That way the entire process is transparent and there is accountability. It also builds the confidence of investors to be part of the vision.\n\nThis approach is responsible for the several mega-city projects being undertaken by several private organisations in the kingdom. One of the projects known as the LINE involves the construction of a 170-kilometre (106 miles) belt of connected communities without the need for cars or roads and will house more than 1 million people.\n\nRead also: FX scarcity, insecurity, declining foreign investments pose threat to Nigeria\u2019s economic prospects \u2013 NESG\n\nThe project will be completely free of cars and streets, with residents given access to nature and all of their daily needs within a walking distance. The private consortium behind the project says that the linear development of hyper-connected artificial intelligence-enabled communities will be powered by 100 percent clean energy.\n\nThe kingdom\u2019s smart cities market size is projected to reach $14.7 billion in 2027 from $3.55 billion in 2019, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.6 percent from 2020 to 2027.\n\nA governance framework and regulations\n\nA viable smart mobility project should be accompanied by a governance framework and thoughtful regulations. These two require legislative action and involvement from multiple jurisdictions.\n\nInnovators in Saudi Arabia can now patent their innovations because of the creation of new regulations for technology innovations. This encourages investors to see value where the opportunities are to deploy their capital.\n\nThe regulations would also improve data governance given that a lot of data can be derived from transport technology systems.\n\nThere is funding for smart mobility\n\nNigeria and many African countries have always used the availability of funding as an excuse to not aggressively pursue technology upgrades of transportation systems. The Middle East in contrast shows it is doable and the government doesn\u2019t have to bear all the financial burden.\n\nBy creating an enabling environment, investors are able to see value in investing in smart mobility.\n\nAlso, there are innovative ways of raising finance. One of them being explored is the use of cryptocurrencies. Smart city developers are leveraging digital assets to fund their projects. Unfortunately, many African countries are not favourably disposed to cryptocurrencies.\n\nButler however said the city of the future would be a city based on data and this could be tokenised.",

          "text": "The Senate, on Wednesday, confirmed seven nominees appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari as National Commissioners and Resident Electoral Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nThis is despite protest by civil society organisations (CSOs) against the confirmation of one of the nominees, Engr. (Prof.) Rhoda H. Gumus from Bayelsa State as National Commissioner representing South-South.\n\nHuman Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) had in a January 26, 2022 petition to the leadership of the National Assembly alleged that Prof. Gumus \u201cis a card carrying member of the All progressives Congress (APC),\u201d saying her nomination was in breach of the 1999 Constitution and the Electoral Act 2010 (both as amended).\n\nSimilarly, Concerned Nigerians Group in another petition signed by its convener, Deji Adeyanju, said: \u201cdespite the criticism that trailed Ms. Onochie\u2019s nomination, we are deeply worried to note that the president, has, once again, nominated another card carrying member of the APC, as INEC commissioner. This is a direct threat to the nation\u2019s electoral process and the ultimate security of Nigeria as a democratic nation.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, the confirmation of the nominees followed the consideration of a report presented by the Senate Committee on INEC chaired by Senator Kabiru Gaya (APC, Kano South).\n\nChairman of the Senate Committee, Senator Gaya, in his presentation, recalled that the confirmation request was made by President Muhammadu Buhari in compliance with the provision of Section 153(1)(f) of the Constitution, and pursuant to the provision of Section 154(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended).\n\nHe, however, acknowledged that the Committee received only one petition from the Taraba Elders Forum against the nomination of Maj. Gen. A. B. Alkali (Rtd.) over \u201cthe seeming inconsistency in the rotation of the nomination\u201d.\n\nAccording to Gaya, the Taraba Elders Forum stated that the nomination started from Taraba (2003 \u2013 2008), Adamawa (2008 \u2013 2015) and Gombe (2015 \u2013 2021).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe added that petitioners observed that it was the turn Taraba State to produce the nominee against the backdrop of the principle of rotation.\n\nGaya, however, explained that the Committee resolved that all the states (Taraba, Adamawa and Gombe) had been nominated between 2003 and 2021, therefore, it was the prerogative of the President to pick his nominee from any of the three states.\n\nOthers nominees confirmed include: Mal. Mohammed Haruna (Niger \u2013 North Central, National Commissioner); Mrs May Agbamuche-Mbu (Delta \u2013 South South, National Commissioner); Ukeagu Kenneth Nnamdi (Abia \u2013 South East, National Commissioner); and Major General A. B. Alkali (Rtd) \u2013 Adamawa (North East, National Commissioner).\n\nAlso confirmed were Mr. Sam Olumekun (Ondo \u2013 South West, National Commissioner); and Olaniyi Olaleye Ijalaye (Ondo \u2013 South West, Resident Commissioner).\n\nLawmakers, including the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege and Senator James Manager, spoke highly of the competence and credibility of the President\u2019s nominees.\n\nThe Senate President, in his remarks after the nominees were confirmed, congratulated them while noting that the 2023 general election would be a \u201cbaptism of fire\u201d to test their efficiency.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe added that the National Assembly would support the electoral body to ensure the conduct of free and transparent elections in 2023.\n\nLawan said, \u201cThey (confirmed nominees) would have a baptism of fire because 2023 is just by the corner.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the process has already started, as INEC may soon announce the dates of elections and then the subsequent process.\n\n\u201cWe expect nothing less than excellence from our electoral body.\n\n\u201cThis Senate has confirmed National Commissioners and Resident Commissioners before.\n\n\u201cWe have done this today, and INEC now has full compliment of the people that need to do the work.\n\n\u201cINEC also gets the support of the National Assembly through appropriations and, therefore, it would have no reason not to perform.\n\n\u201cWe are also expecting that the Electoral Bill amendment will be signed, and if that happens, INEC would have a document to guide it through, even in the off season before the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cTherefore, Nigerians are expectant that INEC will perform creditably well.\n\n\u201c[And] for us in the National Assembly, we will always be there for INEC because we believe that it is in the interest of Nigeria and our citizens to have free and transparent elections to determine the leadership of this country at all levels.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nTwo of the aggrieved All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirants in Ekiti state have vowed that all the alleged shenanigans and breach of party\u2019s constitution by Governor Abubakar Badaru-led Primary Committee of the party would be addressed politically and legally to teach APC a lesson of its life.\n\nThe aggrieved aspirants are the lawmaker representing Ekiti Central Senatorial District, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele and member House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Bamisile.\n\nThe duo spoke at a joint press conference Wednesday in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital.\n\nThey, however, clarified that their grievances over the shadow poll won\u2019t make them defect from the ruling party.\n\nRather, they vowed to stay back and teach the ruling party a bitter lesson over the alleged electoral malfeasance perpetrated during the primary, using political and legal means.\n\nAddressing journalists when he hosted members of his campaign team from across the 16 local government areas in his office in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, Senator Bamidele, like Bamisile, formally rejected the outcome of the primary that produced Mr. Biodun Oyebanji, the immediate past Secretary to the State Government (SSG) as the party\u2019s gubernatorial candidate after due consultations with supporters.\n\nOn whether the seven aggrieved aspirants that constituted themselves into a political force with the acronym G7 would defect from APC, Bamidele said: \u201cNone of us is contemplating defection from APC, this is our party. We have contributed so much to it from the days of Alliance for Democracy (AD).\n\n\u201cAll we are asking for is justice. We are waiting for the national leadership to take the right step and this must start by them submitting a dummy name to INEC and use the two weeks window available as contained in the Electoral Act to do what is right in this matter. I can be quoted that the name that will be taken to INEC in Abuja will be dummy name, so those celebrating should do that in moderation.\n\n\u201cIf it is part of their calculation that we will leave the party for them, they are making a mistake. We are still waiting for the national leadership on our collective position. We have filed petitions and if they endorsed that impunity they called primary, it will be clear that we have exhausted all the internal mechanisms for crisis resolution and we can from there return to the court of law.\u201d\n\nReeling out how the election was allegedly manipulated, Bamidele stated that the Badaru-led committee hijacked the process by distributing materials a day before election, changed collation centres, and arbitrarily appointed those that would do Oyebanji\u2019s biddings to compromise the process and subvert the will of the people.\n\n\u201cThe Ad-hoc staff were to be adopted for the conduct of the poll because it was assumed that every member in Ekiti would have taken position. When you talk of ad-hoc staff, it means those that would be brought from the national secretariat of the party or APC members from other states.\n\n\u201cThe process was totally hijacked by Badaru committee. What we saw was seeing people who were campaign managers, sponsors and promoters of Biodun Oyebanji being appointed and saddled with the responsibility of being Returning Officers in the 16 local governments.\n\n\u201cThe election materials were to be distributed early on Thursday before the start of the primary and to be distributed in the presence of agents of aspirants, INEC, security chiefs and monitoring teams. But materials, both sensitive and non-sensitive, were distributed in previous night. We got calls that as of 11pm, Governor Badaru had handed over materials to Returning Officers from the 16 councils.\n\n\u201cOut of the 16 Returning Officers appointed, 11 of them were with Oyebanji when he collected his expression of interest form at the party secretariat in Abuja.\n\n\u201cIn several of our local governments, the venues of our collation centres were changed. At the appropriate time, we will give evidence that will put all of us in public court and that will be useful in the court of law. Available INEC report shows that there was no voting, no valid primary election in Ekiti.\n\n\u201cOne thing I can assure you is that the last is yet to be heard about the Ekiti governorship primary. We will not stop at anything seeking for justice. We should take every step that will challenge this political misbehaviour from repeating itself in future, so that politicians can learn how to take caution and be civil.\n\n\u201cMajority of Ekiti people are seriously disappointed with the way the election went. I thought\n\nthe election would be free and fair, because I thought Dr. Kayode Fayemi won\u2019t get involved in things that will deprive the party of free and fair process and that he will provide for a level playing ground. Only history will judge me whether I was right or not. I thought I knew him, but I didn\u2019t know that I did not know him quite enough,\u201d the lawmaker said.\n\nBamisile threatens\n\nAlso in his submission, Hon Bamisile warned the security agencies against threatening people with arrest over the APC governorship crisis, saying such would not work.\n\n\u201cThis is our state, we are fighting for what we believe in, this is a democracy where everyone has the right to support whoever he likes. The police shouldn\u2019t threaten us with arrest. Nobody can stop this, the only thing they can do to stop us is to allow justice in our party.\n\n\u201cWhatever votes they have allotted to us will reflect on the day of election. We won\u2019t leave this party, but not leaving does not mean that APC will not be taught a lesson. This is not a threat, but a prophesy that will come to pass. We are not going anywhere, but if the party doesn\u2019t do it right, they will be taught a lesson they will never forget.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has said his administration was embarking on a revised approach to addressing the 13-year conflict and insurgency in the North East.\n\nPresident Buhari, who also said his government would not relent in its efforts towards a return to peace and normalcy, pledged that Nigerians in the region would, in the coming months, witness a change from the protracted insurgency to peace and development in their respective communities.\n\nThe president spoke at the inauguration of the Presidential Committee on the Repatriation, Return, and Resettlement of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the North-east of Nigeria, which preceded the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the Council Chambers, presidential villa, Abuja.\n\nThe reassurance is coming sixteen months to the end of Buhari\u2019s eight-year tenure of two terms of four years each.\n\nThe revised approach\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the advent of this administration in 2015, I pledged to Nigerians that I will restore peace in the North East and return it to the path of development and growth. I remain committed to this promise.\n\n\u201cTo the people of the North-East, particularly the children and future of the North-East, we will never forget you and your courage, sacrifice and endurance has been exemplary.\n\n\u201cI pledge to you that in the coming months you will begin to witness a shift away from a protracted insurgency to peace building, stabilization, and ultimately development in your respective communities as we embark on a revised approach to addressing this conflict- A Return to Normalcy.\u201d\n\nThe president stressed that the committee\u2019s terms of reference entails a shift from managing the situation to activating a permanent solution for effective and practicable restoration.\n\nHe said the committee, among others, is expected to develop a concise three-year action plan by the end of March 2022 that incorporates national and state level plans, providing a clear pathway for the restoration of peace and development in the North East.\n\nPresident Buhari said the committee would also develop and implement a phased plan for the repatriation, returns, resettlement of IDPs and restoration of livelihoods, incorporating global best practices that give dignity to the affected populations..\n\nHe added that it would also be responsible for the development and implementation of a coordinated peace building and reconciliation programme that is culturally appropriate and community driven.\n\nSimilarly, the committee is also saddled with the responsibility of strengthening collaboration with key donors, development partners and private sector organisations that are critical to the mobilisation of resources and implementation of programmes.\n\nHe charged the committee members to adopt the guiding principles of accountability, delineation of duty and community-driven methods to address issues.\n\nHe said: \u201cMembers will dedicate more time to the conduct of field visits to regularly engage with state government, communities and key stakeholders.\n\n\u201cDue to prevailing fiscal constraints, Ministries, Departments and Agencies will utilise existing budgetary resources and repurpose funds to programmes approved under this initiative.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari directed the committee to submit monthly progress report whilst the first progress review meeting would be held in the first week of March 2022.\n\nUnderscoring the enormous task ahead of the Committee, he said: \u201cHistory beckons and Nigeria calls on you to be the team that finally charts this new path to the restoration of sustainable progress in the North East and I strongly believe this could lead to the birthing of a template for addressing insurgency and instability in other parts of our country and across the world. Failure to deliver on this task you have been assigned is not an option.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari also used the occasion to commend Borno state Governor Babagana Zulum, who was present at the inauguration with his Gombe counterpart, Inuwa Yahaya, for his unparalleled commitment to his people and exemplary leadership.\n\nHe also expressed appreciation to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) for support in the area of coordination of humanitarian actors and UNDP regional stabilisation facility, providing support in the area of security and the rule of law.\n\nMembership\n\nThe members of the committee include: the Ministers of Finance, Budget & National Planning; Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice; Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management & Social Development; Interior; Foreign Affairs and Defence.\n\nOthers are the National Security Adviser, Inspector-General of Police, Chief of Defence Staff, Director General, State Security, Director-General, National Intelligence Agency, Director-General, North-East Development Commission, Federal Commissioner, National Commission for Refugees, Migrants & Internally Displaced Persons, Director-General, National Emergency Management Agency and Chief of Defence Intelligence.\n\nZulum speaks\n\nSpeaking to State House correspondents after the inauguration, Governor Zulum expressed delight at the committee\u2019s inauguration, saying the displaced persons would now be repatriated and the issue of repentant Boko Haram insurgents further addressed.\n\nHe said: \u201cIndeed, we are so much happy, especially those of us that are in the North East because thousands of people were displaced, some are taking refuge in the Republic of Chad, in the Republic of Niger, Cameroon. And this is the time that the Federal Government of Nigeria, in collaboration with the state governments of the North East will facilitate the repatriation of the internally displaced persons that are living in our neighbouring countries to Nigeria. The committee is also to look into the management of the repentant Boko Haram members.\n\n\u201cSo, indeed, we are so grateful and the entire north eastern government will give maximum support to this committee. We will provide the necessary support to the federal government under the Distinguished Leadership of Mr. President, we shall provide support to Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and others and the military to ensure that this process yields the desired result.\u201d\n\nSenate urges Buhari\n\nIn a related development, the Senate Wednesday s urged the federal government to, as a matter of urgency, send fighter jets to flush out terrorists (kidnapping and killing innocent Nigerians) from their hideouts.\n\nThe call was made during plenary in resolutions reached following a point of order raised on the \u201cUrgent need for the Federal Government to take drastic actions to bring to an end the act of banditry and kidnapping in Faskari Local Government Area.\u201d\n\nThe point of order was raised by Senator Bello Mandiya (APC Katsina South).\n\nRelying on Orders 42 and 52 of the Senate Rules, Mandiya noted that the act of banditry and kidnapping had become a daily incidence in Katsina with huge consequence of loss of lives, means of livelihood and displacement of communities.\n\nThe lawmaker recalled that, \u201con Sunday, 31st January, 2022, gunmen struck Ruwan Godiya a community in Faskari local government area of Katsina state where Thirty Eight (38) members of the community were kidnapped.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the federal government had made frantic effort at curbing the menace by setting up Operation Sharan Daji and Inter-Agency Task Force to tackle cases of banditry, cattle rustling and kidnapping in Katsina state.\n\n\u201cWorried that the continuous security challenges and related attacks by bandits on towns, villages and communities in Faskari local government area have meted untold hardship on the people and have subjected the affected areas under serious survival threat; and\n\n\u201cFurther worried that if this menace is not drastically and promptly addressed, the consequence is going to be huge on food sufficiency since the affected communities are mostly farmers,\u201d Mandiya said.\n\nContributing, Senator Kabir Abdullahi Barkiya (APC Katsina Central), faulted the inability of the military to contain the situation despite several calls on the troops to act.\n\nIn his remarks, Senate President Ahmad Lawan said the repeated cases of kidnappings and killings made it imperative for the military to \u201cwake up\u201d to protect Nigerians.\n\nHe wondered why full scale action was yet to be carried out by the military in spite of increased funding for security in the 2022 budget by the Executive and National Assembly.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe expectation of the Senate is that there is supposed to be a remarkable difference in success in terms of the fight against insurgence, banditry and militancy in Nigeria\n\n\u201cThe military is getting better funding from the government and what we expect is to see an improvement in output.\n\n\u201cI know the resources are not enough, but recently for one and a half years, government has upscaled the level of funding for our military.\n\n\u201cSecondly, when we declared the bandits as terrorists, my understanding was they are going to be dealt with ruthlessly now. I wonder whether that is the case.\n\n\u201cThe military like some of our colleagues have said need to wake up. We want to see a difference because we have made a difference in terms of funding.\n\n\u201cI know funding alone will not be enough, but funding can make a difference and we expect a difference in outcome.\n\n\u201cThirdly, we need to mobilise our citizens, because when a hundred people are kidnapped and abducted, they are not taken by aircraft, they are taken by motor bikes, pass through the villages and possibly towns. How come do we then say that nobody has seen something?\n\n\u201cWe need our citizens to be part and parcel of our security architecture. In fact, there\u2019s no way we can achieve better security for this country without the participation of the citizens in the fight against Insecurity.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, the Senate urged the Security Agencies to comb all known hide outs of the kidnappers in a bid to rescue the Thirty Eight (38) persons abducted by the gunmen in Ruwan Godiya.\n\nIt also called on the federal government to send enough military personnel and fighter jets to apprehend the bandits and restore normalcy in the affected areas.\n\nRed Cross on missing Nigerians\n\nMeanwhile, 24,000 Nigerians have been reported missing and been traced by their families, International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC).\n\nAlso, a total of 2.2 million persons in the North East were displaced from their original homes at the moment.\n\nVice President of the ICRC Gilles Carbonnier made this known Tuesday when he paid a courtesy call on the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development Sadiya Umar Farouq in Abuja.\n\nThe International aid agency also said it had requested partnership with the federal government through the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development in resolving the 24,000 requests of missing Nigerians.\n\nCarbonnier, who stated that a total of 2.2m displaced persons were domiciled in the North East, also offered the services of its Central Tracing Agency in finding missing persons during disasters as well as the forensic management of the dead during emergencies.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have received 24,000 requests from Nigerian families who came to us to ask for news of their daughters or sons who are unaccounted for.\n\n\u201cWe seek to work with different entities to progress in the resolution of these missing cases. In Africa, this accounts for half of the case load of missing persons on the continent.\n\n\u201cWe also have strong expertise in forensic science on how to deal with what we call dead body management in cases of emergencies, to help in the dignified management of the dead and also ensure that people don\u2019t go missing during emergencies and disasters.\n\n\u201cWe celebrated the 100th anniversary of our Central Tracing Agency that deals with identifying missing persons and reconnecting them with their families. In that framework, I think that it will be good for Nigeria to have an inter-ministerial mechanism where these cases of missing persons can first be registered in a central data base.\n\n\u201cWe also seek the domestication or implementation of traditions of the Kampala convention and see how we can assist in finding feasible solutions that are consistent with the principles of the Kampala Conventions.\u201d\n\nIn her response, the minister appreciated the International Committee of Red Cross for its numerous humanitarian works in Nigeria, especially in the North East and their provision of support and succour for the displaced persons affected by disaster.\n\n\u201cThe main focus here apart from the humanitarian intervention is to provide durable solutions to these vulnerable groups.\n\n\u201cThe Federal government has approved the National Policy on Internally Displaced Persons which also includes working towards the domestication of the Kampala Convention. We are working with the National Assembly and relevant authorities,\u201d Farouq said.\n\n\u201cThe ministry is keen on working with the ICRC on missing persons to learn from your expertise on addressing these issues. There are a lot of issues of unaccompanied minors in the IDP camps who have lost their parents and we don\u2019t even know their identities. This is something the government is working on to see how these unaccompanied minors can be identified. We can collaborate with your Agency to trace their identities and find lasting solutions to missing persons in emergency situations.\n\n\u201cThe forensic science of managing mass fatalities during disasters is very important as well and I am sure that the National Emergency Management Agency will key into this forensic support. These are areas that the ministry is very much interested in,\u201d the minister said.\n\nThe IRCS delegation also included Bruno Raymond, Protection Coordinator ICRC Geneva, Mona Sadek, Deputy Regional Director for Africa and Head of delegation ICRC Abuja Yann Benton.",

          "text": "The Federal Government says it has uncovered 96 financiers of terrorism across the country, especially those backing Boko Haram and the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP).\n\nThis was disclosed by Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, during a press conference on the administration\u2019s fight against corruption in Abuja on Thursday, February 3.\n\nHe said the \u201cNigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU), in 2020-2021, revealed 96 financiers of terrorism in Nigeria,\u201d while 424 associates and supporters of the financiers were also uncovered.\n\nREAD ALSO: [Insurgency] Northeast Will Witness A Change In The Coming Months \u2013 Buhari\n\nAlso, about 123 companies and 33 Bureau de change, were linked to terrorists in addition to 26 suspected bandits/kidnappers and seven co-conspirators who have now been identified.\n\nAccording to the minister, \u201cthe analysis has resulted in the arrest of 45 suspects who will soon face prosecution and seizure of assets\u201d.\n\nStill, on terrorism financing, Lai Mohammed said the NFIU had intelligence exchanges on Boko Haram, ISWAP, banditry, kidnapping, and others with 19 countries.\n\nDuring the same period, 2020-2021, the organization returned fraudulently-obtained funds totaling US$103,722,102.83, 3,000 Pound Sterling; 7,695 Singapore dollar, and 1,091 Euros to 11 countries of victims who came into the country.\n\nREAD FULL TEXT OF MINISTER\u2019S BRIEFING\n\nTEXT OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE ADDRESSED BY THE HONOURABLE MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND CULTURE, ALHAJI LAI MOHAMMED, ON THE ADMINISTRATION\u2019S FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION IN ABUJA ON THURSDAY, FEB. 3RD 2022\n\nGood afternoon gentlemen and happy new year, since this is our first meeting this year. And as always, I thank you for honouring our invitation.\n\n2. As you are aware, one of the three major policy planks of this Administration is the fight against corruption, with the others of course being to tackle insecurity and also to revamp the economy. We will be having a series of thematic press conferences on these issues in the days ahead, with this one \u2013 on the fight against corruption \u2013 being the first one.\n\n3. It is common knowledge that one of the most difficult tasks for any government is to fight corruption, because when you fight corruption, corruption will fight you back! This explains why naysayers have continued to belittle or dismiss the Administration\u2019s anti-corruption efforts. Let me say here that fighting corruption is a marathon, and never a sprint. Also, investigations, arrests, prosecutions and asset forfeiture \u2013 which are the immediate, visible indices by which many measure success in tackling corruption, constitute \u2013 as important as they are \u2013 just a part of the strategies to combat corruption. There is also a more fundamental strategy, which I will describe as structural and governance reforms or, if you like, institutional reforms. Today\u2019s press conference will therefore look at this fundamental strategy and also highlight the successes recorded in recent times by the various anti-corruption agencies, including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) and the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB).\n\n4. Gentlemen, the Buhari Administration has taken bold measures to streamline cumbersome bureaucratic processes in the implementation of government policies, check corrupt practices and ensure accountability in the implementation as well as delivery of these policies. These reforms are all inclusive, cutting across all spheres of governance and not excluding even the private sector. They are the Treasury Single Account (TSA), Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS), Petroleum Industry Act, Financial Autonomy for State Legislature and Judiciary (2020), Whistle-Blower Policy, Assets Recovery, Justice and Law reforms, Nigeria\u2019s membership of the Open Government Partnership as well as the various instruments at the disposal of the Federal Government to track, trace and stop the flow of illicit funds used in financing terrorist activities within Nigeria, among others. For those who may say that some of these reforms, like the TSA, predate this Administration, our response is that what\u2019s the use of a policy that is not implemented? This Administration has implemented these reforms with fidelity, and the reforms have made a huge impact in preventing corruption.\n\n5. For example, upon assuming office in 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari operationalized the TSA, a public accounting system that enables the Government to manage its finances (revenues and payments) using a single/unified account or a series of linked accounts domiciled at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The President issued a directive to all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to close their accounts with Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) and transfer the funds therein to the CBN on or before 15th September 2015. The TSA system was launched in 2012 but failed to gain traction until President Buhari gave it a fillip. The TSA system has now been implemented in more than 90 percent of all Federal MDAs and it has resulted in the consolidation of more than 17,000 bank accounts previously spread across Deposit Money Banks in the country, and monthly savings of an average of N4 billion in bank charges.\n\n6. Also, against stiff opposition, the Buhari Administration has expanded the coverage of IPPIS. TSA and IPPIS remain an unfolding revolution in public finance in Nigeria that have incorporated transparency and accountability into the system. The use of BVN to verify the Federal Government\u2019s payroll on the IPPIS platform has so far led to the detection of 54,000 fraudulent payroll entries. The Federal Government has also utilized the BVN system to verify beneficiaries and vendors in the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP), the N-Power Programme and the Home Grown School Feeding Programme (HGSFP), among others.\n\n7. The Whistle-blower Policy is an initiative of the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning. The policy is meant to encourage the voluntary disclosure of information about fraud, bribery and looted government funds, including financial misconduct and any other form of corruption or theft. The Whistle Blower whose information leads to recovery is entitled to 2.5 to 5% from the recovered funds. Information and tips received are usually referred to the EFCC, ICPC, and NFIU for further painstaking investigation. The policy has helped in the cleansing of IPPIS, led to compliance on TSA and enhanced the Procurement Act 2007. As at 2020, a total sum of N700 billion has been recovered through the Whistle-Blower Policy.\n\n8 Then, there is the Petroleum Industry Act (2021). As you are aware, there has been a dire need for Nigeria to reform the laws of its oil & gas sector, which accounts for 90% of its foreign exchange earnings and about 65% of government\u2019s revenue. While some of the laws had become outdated and unsuited to the 21st century, some were simply non-existent to regulate certain activities, thereby providing loopholes to be exploited by corrupt practitioners. One of such is the P&ID case in which a company registered in a foreign tax haven colluded with corrupt officials over a set-to-fail gas processing project to secure about $10 billion award against the Nigerian government via an arbitration process abroad. Attempts to revamp petroleum laws by successive governments proved futile for over 20 years until President Muhammadu Buhari broke the jinx to push through the Petroleum Industry Act in 2021, through strong will and determination.\n\n9. Gentlemen, President Muhammadu Buhari signed an Executive Order in May 2020 that unequivocally granted financial autonomy to State Houses of Assembly, State Judiciaries as well as the Local Governments, as the third tier of government. The order also mandated the Accountant-General of the Federation to deduct, from source, funds due to state legislatures and judiciaries from the monthly allocation of states that fail to comply. Lack of financial autonomy for the separate arms of government at the state level is a major structural flaw that is in need of reform, and this has been addressed by the Buhari Administration. Also, the financial suffocation of LGs is a major enabler of insecurity and terrorism in the Nigerian countryside.\n\nMost of Nigeria\u2019s 774 LGAs exist in rural areas where effective local governance is an existential issue. To underscore their responsibility to the people, President Buhari recently reminded the LG Chairmen of their burden of accounting for every kobo allocated to their Councils, should they fold their arms and allow the sharing to continue by the state governors.\n\n10 On Assets Recovery, the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC) has assisted anti-corruption agencies in devising clearer strategies for obtaining forfeiture of assets suspected to have been fraudulently acquired from state coffers before prosecuting suspected culprits. Part of this work has involved painstakingly reviewing existing Laws (Money Laundering Act, 2004, EFCC Act, 2004 and ICPC Act, 2000) to identify and highlight sections directly conferring powers of forfeiture on Nigeria\u2019s anti-corruption agencies.\n\nThis advocacy has led to a significant increase in the use of Non-Conviction Based Asset Forfeiture Mechanisms by anti-corruption agencies.\n\n11. To check terrorism financing in Nigeria, the Federal Government has deployed a plethora of tools, including the Money Laundering Act, 2004, the EFCC Act, 2004, the ICPC Act, 2000, Department of State. Services (DSS) and the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) to deal with the issue of corruption, money laundering and terror financing. The ongoing harmonization of Bank Verification Numbers (BVN) with National Identification Numbers (NIN) is also a means of tracking the flow of funds within Nigeria and, by extension, tackling terror financing.\n\n12. Let me now highlight the much more-visible activities of some of the various anti-corruption agencies, all of which have been effectively carrying out their mandates. In 2021 alone, the EFCC secured a total of 2,220 convictions. That represents a 127 percent increase in the number of convictions (976) recorded in 2020, and a far cry from the 195 convictions secured in 2016, the 189 in 2017, the 312 convictions in 2018, and the 1,280 recorded in 2019. The 2021 figure of 2,220 convictions represents a 98.49 per cent success rate, with only 34 cases (representing 1.51 per cent) discharged. On Monetary recoveries, in 2021 alone, the EFCC recovered a total monetary amount of N152,088,698,751.64; 1,182,519.75 Pounds Sterling, 50 Emirati Dirham, 1,723,310 Saudi Riyal, 1,900 South African Rand; US$386,220,202.85; 156,246.76 Euros; 1,400 Canadian Dollars;\n\n5.36957319 Bitcoin and 0.09012 Ethereum. The last two are digital currencies.\n\n13. The ICPC has played a pivotal role in bringing about structural changes in the operations of the government, especially regarding improvements in MDAs budget utilization, better value for money, improved project completion, service delivery and higher level of anti-corruption awareness. Recall, gentlemen, that the Commission established the Constituency and Executive Projects Tracking Initiative in 2019 to ensure value for money for the Nigerian people and full execution of projects. Between 2019 and 2021, ICPC traced\n\n2,000 projects worth over N300 billion. During the same period, 326 contractors of abandoned projects across the six geo-political zones were forced by the Commission to return to site to complete projects worth N32.183 billion. Also, the ICPC\u2019s Assets Tracing, Recovery and Management (ATRM) project led to the recovery of cash totalling N34.346 billion and US$1.62 million between 2019 and 2021. Also, the Commission\u2019s System Study and Review of personnel and capital votes of MDAs resulted in savings of N261 billion to the government between 2019 and 2021. ICPC has also secured 66 convictions from the 243 cases it filed in court during the same three-year period.\n\n14. For its part, the analysis by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU), in 2020-2021, revealed 96 financiers of terrorism in Nigeria, 424 associates/supporters of the financiers, involvement of about 123 companies and 33 bureaux de change, in addition to identifying 26 suspected bandits/kidnappers and 7 co-conspirators. The analysis has resulted in the arrest of 45 suspects who will soon face prosecution and seizure of assets. Also, from its analysis of tax evasion and tax avoidance linked to corruption, NFIU has identified N3,909,707,678,112.43 in VAT and N3,737,918,335,785.82 in Withholding\n\nTax due to the Government. NFIU has also sent 1,165 intelligence reports on cases of corruption, money laundering and other serious offences to 27 domestic agencies for investigation, prosecution and asset recovery. On terrorism financing, NFIU had intelligence exchanges on Boko Haram, ISWAP, banditry, kidnapping and others with 19 countries. During the same period, 2020-2021, the organization returned fraudulently-obtained funds totalling US$103,722,102.83, 3,000 Pound Sterling; 7,695 Singapore Dollar and 1,091 Euros to 11 countries of victims who came into the country.\n\n15. There is also the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB), which was established as an institutional response to the observed deterioration in the conduct of Public Officers, especially because these behavioural changes manifested greatly in the abuse of public office for private gains. The Bureau handles, among others, issues of asset declaration by Public Officials as well as the verification of their assets. In 2021, CCB issued 125,000 Assets Declaration Forms, out of which 97,201 forms were returned. These figures represent a 48% increase in the number of Assets Declaration forms issued and an 81% increase in submission compliance, when compared with the previous year. As part of its reforms, the CCB is ready to deploy an Online Assets Declaration Portal that will allow for enhanced storage and retrieval of data, reduce delays caused by incomplete and incorrect declarations and reduced errors, among others. In 2021, the Bureau investigated several cases involving illicit enrichment, conflicts of interest, abuse of office and ethical breaches, resulting in the filing of over 200 cases before the Code of Conduct Tribunal.\n\n16. Gentlemen, we have gone to this length to let you know that the Buhari Administration\u2019s fight against corruption is unwavering and on course. This Administration has put in place structures that will not only check corrupt tendencies but will also make corruption unattractive and costly to those who may want to engage in it. Even the World Bank says when approaching anti-corruption at the country level, it is important to put in place \u201dinstitutional systems and incentives to prevent corruption from occurring in the first place\u201d, and that is exactly what we are doing with the structural and governance reforms that I have enumerated above. I want to most sincerely commend the efforts of the various anti-corruption agencies for their unwavering commitment to the fight against corruption. I also want to implore all Nigerians to join in this fight, as it is not a fight for the government alone.\n\nWith the support of all citizens, I can assure you that we will defeat this monster that stunts development and impedes investment.\n\n17. I thank you all for your kind attention.",
          "summary": "The Federal Government says it has uncovered 96 financiers of terrorism across the country, especially those backing Boko Haram and the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP).\nStill, on terrorism financing, Lai Mohammed said the NFIU had intelligence exchanges on Boko Haram, ISWAP, banditry, kidnapping, and others with 19 countries.\nIt is common knowledge that one of the most difficult tasks for any government is to fight corruption, because when you fight corruption, corruption will fight you back!\nAlso, from its analysis of tax evasion and tax avoidance linked to corruption, NFIU has identified N3,909,707,678,112.43 in VAT and N3,737,918,335,785.82 in WithholdingTax due to the Government.\nOn terrorism financing, NFIU had intelligence exchanges on Boko Haram, ISWAP, banditry, kidnapping and others with 19 countries.",

For us it\u2019s a good sign,\u201d Botchwey told reporters after meeting with strongman Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba and other junta members.\n\nThe talks were attended by the UN\u2019s special representative for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), Mahamat Saleh Annadif, who described a \u201cvery frank exchange\u201d.\n\nThe delegation notably met Kabore, whose wellbeing and demands for release from house arrest are major issues.\n\nDuring the visit, the junta declared it had restored the constitution, which it had swiftly suspended following the coup, and named Damiba as president and head of the armed forces during a transition period.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Damiba met with political party chiefs, many of whom said they were keen to take part in the restoration of civilian rule.\n\nBut major questions remain unanswered, including the key issue of a date for elections. On January 24, the junta vowed to re-establish \u201cconstitutional order\u201d within a \u201creasonable time\u201d.\n\nIn deciding whether to impose sanctions, ECOWAS leaders have to balance the credibility of their organisation against the fragility of some of their states, especially in the Sahel.\n\nMali and Burkina Faso are in the throes of a nearly decade-old jihadist emergency that has claimed thousands of lives and forced at least one and a half million people from their homes.\n\nEscalating political friction with the junta in Mali has driven Bamako closer to the Kremlin and cast a shadow over France\u2019s anti-jihadist mission in the country.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "U.S. special forces carried out what the Pentagon said was a successful, large-scale counterterrorism raid in northwestern Syria early Thursday. First responders at the scene reported 13 people had been killed, including six children and four women.\n\nThe operation, which residents say lasted about two hours, jolted the sleepy village of Atmeh near the Turkish border \u2014 an area dotted with camps for internally displaced people from Syria\u2019s civil war. The target of the raid was not immediately clear.\n\nPentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a brief statement that the mission was a success. \u201cThere were no U.S. casualties. More information will be provided as it becomes available.\u201d\n\nSeveral residents told The Associated Press they saw body parts scattered near the site of the raid, a house in Syria\u2019s rebel-held Idlib province. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, and said the raid involved helicopters, explosions and machine-gun fire.\n\nIt was the largest raid in the province since the 2019 U.S. assault targeting the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Idlib is is broadly controlled by Turkey-backed fighters, but is also an Al-Qaida stronghold and home to several of its top operatives. Other militants have also found refuge in the region.\n\nReports on the number of dead varied. A journalist on assignment for the AP saw body parts around the house, whose upper story was almost completely leveled leaving rubble in the surrounding olive grove.\n\nBlood could be seen on the walls and floor of the remaining structure, which contained a wrecked bedroom with a child\u2019s wooden crib on the floor. On one damaged wall, a blue plastic swing for children was still hanging. The kitchen was blackened with fire damage.\n\nThe opposition-run Syrian Civil Defense, first responders also known as the White Helmets, said 13 people were killed in shelling and clashes that ensued after U.S. the commando raid. They included six children and four women, it said.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said the strike killed nine people, including two children and a woman. Ahmad Rahhal, a citizen journalist who visited the site, reported seeing 12 bodies.\n\nThe Pentagon provided no details on who was the target of the raid, or if any combatants or civilians on the ground were killed or injured.\n\nResidents and activists described witnessing a large ground assault, with U.S. forces using loudspeakers urging women and children to leave the area.\n\nThere was at least one major explosion. A U.S. official said that one of the helicopters in the raid suffered a mechanical problem and had to be blown up on the ground. The U.S. official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the military operation.\n\nThe Observatory said troops for the U.S.-led coalition using helicopters landed in the area and attacked a house. It said the force clashed with fighters on the ground. Taher al-Omar, an Idlib-based activist, also said he witnessed clashes between fighters and the U.S. force.\n\nThe military operation got attention on social media, with tweets from the region describing helicopters firing around the building near Atmeh. Flight-tracking data also suggested that multiple drones were circling the city of Sarmada and the village of Salwah, just north of the raid\u2019s location.\n\nThe clandestine operation came as the Islamic State group was reasserting itself, carrying out some of its biggest attacks since it was defeated in 2019. In recent weeks and months, the group has launched a series of operations in the region, including a 10-day assault late last month to seize a prison in northeastern Syria.\n\nA U.S.-backed Kurdish-led force said more than 120 of their fighters and prison workers died in the effort to thwart the IS plot, whose goal appeared to free senior IS operatives from the prison. The prison houses at least 3,000 Islamic State group detainees.\n\nThe attempted prison break was the biggest military operation by the extremist group since IS was defeated and members scattered to havens in 2019. The U.S.-led coalition carried out airstrikes and deployed American personnel in Bradley Fighting Vehicles to the prison area to help the Kurdish forces.\n\nAt a news conference Monday, an SDF senior official Nowruz Ahmad said the prison assault was part of a broader plot that IS had been preparing for a long time, including attacks on other neighborhoods in Hassakeh, Shaddada and areas of Deir el-Zour in eastern Syria and on the al-Hol camp in the south, which houses thousands of families of IS members.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition has targeted high-profile militants on several occasions in recent years, aiming to disrupt what U.S. officials say is a secretive cell known as the Khorasan group that is planning external attacks. A U.S. airstrike killed al-Qaida\u2019s second in command, former bin Laden aide Abu al-Kheir al-Masri, in Syria earlier this year.",

          "title": "Biden Orders 3,000 Troops to Eastern Europe Amid Stalled Ukraine Talks",
          "text": "President Joe Biden is ordering 2,000 U.S.-based troops to Poland and Germany and shifting 1,000 more from Germany to Romania, demonstrating to both allies and foes America\u2019s commitment to NATO\u2019s eastern flank amid fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Pentagon said Wednesday.\n\nRussia fired back with a sharply worded objection, calling the deployments unfounded and \u201cdestructive.\u201d\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin also had a new telephone exchange with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. But readouts from both governments showed no progress, with Putin saying the West was giving no ground on Russia\u2019s security concerns and Johnson expressing deep concern about Russia\u2019s \u201chostile activity\u201d on the Ukrainian border, referring to Putin\u2019s buildup of 100,000 troops there.\n\nThe Biden administration is aiming to demonstrate U.S. resolve without undermining efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis. Biden notably has not sent military reinforcements to the three Baltic countries on NATO\u2019s eastern flank \u2014 Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 that are former states of the Soviet Union.\n\nNo U.S. troops are being sent to Ukraine, and White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Wednesday said the administration has stopped calling a Russian invasion \u201cimminent,\u201d because that word implies Washington knows Putin has made a decision to invade. Officials say Putin\u2019s intentions remain unclear.\n\nHowever, increasing U.S. troop levels in Eastern Europe is exactly what Putin has said he finds intolerable, along with the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO. The U.S. already has several thousand troops in Poland, and Romania is host to a NATO missile defense system that Russia considers a threat. The U.S. presence in the region has increased since 2014 when Russia made its first invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPentagon press secretary John Kirby said the soon-to-deploy U.S. forces are intended to temporarily bolster U.S. and allied defensive positions.\n\n\u201cThese are not permanent moves,\u201d he said, stressing that the purpose is to reassure allies. Kirby said Russia had continued its buildup, even in the previous 24 hours, despite U.S. urgings that it deescalate.\n\nIn Moscow, a senior official said the U.S. movements will complicate the crisis.\n\n\u201cThe unfounded destructive steps will only fuel military tensions and narrow the field for political decisions,\u201d Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said in remarks carried by the Interfax news agency.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba again played down fears of a Russian attack in a call with reporters but said that if Russia makes moves that could signal an imminent invasion Ukraine would react as necessary.\n\nOf the 2,000 U.S. troops newly deploying from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, about 1,700 are members of the 82nd Airborne Division infantry brigade, who will go to Poland. The other 300 are with the 18th Airborne Corps and will go to Germany as what the Pentagon called a \u201cjoint task force-capable headquarters.\u201d\n\nPoland\u2019s Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak wrote on Twitter that the deployment to his country is \u201ca strong signal of solidarity in response to the situation in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe 1,000 U.S. troops going to Romania are members of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment based at Vilseck, Germany. They will augment about 900 already in Romania, Kirby said.\n\nThe cavalry deployment\u2019s purpose is to \u201cdeter aggression and enhance our defensive capabilities in frontline allied states during this period of elevated risk,\u201d the Pentagon said in a separate written statement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we send a strong signal to Mr. Putin and to the world\u201d of the U.S commitment to NATO, Kirby said.\n\nHe said France has decided it, too, will send troop reinforcements to Romania under NATO command, and he noted that a number of other European NATO countries are considering adding forces on NATO\u2019s eastern flank. Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron touched base in a phone call Wednesday night.\n\nNATO has been beefing up its defenses around allies in Eastern Europe since late last year. Denmark, for example, said it was sending a frigate and F-16 warplanes to Lithuania, and Spain was sending four fighter jets to Bulgaria and three ships to the Black Sea to join NATO naval forces. The Netherlands plans to send two F-35 fighter aircraft to Bulgaria in April and is putting a ship and land-based units on standby for NATO\u2019s Response Force.\n\nBiden has said he will not put American troops in Ukraine to fight any Russian incursion, although the United States is supplying Ukraine with weapons to defend itself and seeking to reassure allies in Eastern Europe that Washington will fulfill its treaty obligation to defend them in the event they are attacked.\n\nUkraine is not a NATO member, and therefore the U.S. has no treaty obligation to come to its defense.\n\nThe military moves come amid stalled talks with Russia over its buildup at Ukraine\u2019s borders. And they underscore growing fears across Europe that Russian President Putin is poised to invade Ukraine. Smaller NATO countries on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank worry they could be next.\n\nThe Pentagon also has put about 8,500 U.S.-based troops on higher alert for possible deployment to Europe as additional reassurance to allies, and officials have indicated the possibility that additional units could be placed on higher alert soon. The U.S. already has between 75,000 and 80,000 troops in Europe as permanently stationed forces and as part of regular rotations in places such as Poland.\n\nWashington and Moscow have been at loggerheads over Ukraine, with little sign of a diplomatic path forward. However, Kirby on Wednesday confirmed the validity of a document reported by a Spanish newspaper that indicated the United States could be willing to enter into an agreement with Russia to ease tensions over missile deployments in Europe if Moscow steps back from the brink in Ukraine.\n\nThe daily El Pais published two documents that Kirby confirmed were written replies from the United States and NATO last week to Russia\u2019s proposals for a new security arrangement in Europe. The U.S. State department declined to comment on them.\n\nIn reference to the second document, NATO said that it never comments on \u201calleged leaks.\u201d But the text closely reflects statements made to the media last week by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg as he laid out the 30-nation military organization\u2019s position on Russia\u2019s demands.\n\nThe U.S. document, marked as a confidential \u201cnon-paper,\u201d said the United States would be willing to discuss in consultation with its NATO partners \u201ca transparency mechanism to confirm the absences of Tomahawk cruise missiles at Aegis Ashore sites in Romania and Poland.\u201d\n\nThat would happen on condition that Russia \u201coffers reciprocal transparency measures on two ground-launched missiles bases of our choosing in Russia.\u201d\n\nAegis Ashore is a system for defending against short- or intermediate-range missiles. Russia argues the site in Romania could be easily adapted to fire cruise missiles instead of interceptors, a claim that Washington has denied.\n\nIn his first public remarks on the standoff in more than a month, Putin on Tuesday accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia\u2019s central security demands but said that Moscow is willing to keep talking.\n\nRussia invaded Georgia in 2008, and in 2014 annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and provided military support for a pro-Russian separatist movement in eastern Ukraine. Around 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict in eastern Ukraine.",

          "text": "A new report by the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) has disclosed that the federal government spent a total of N3.64 trillion on fuel subsidies between 2015 and 2021.\n\nThe report also stated that the amount spent by the government on payment for petrol subsidy grew from N307 billion in 2015, to N1.77 trillion in 2021. This represented a 477 per cent increase within seven years.\n\nThese were contained in the 2022 NESG Macroeconomic Outlook titled \u201cThe Last Mile: Reforms toward Significant Improvement in National Economic Outcomes,\u201d which stated categorically that the burden of fuel subsidy cost on public finance would increase substantially in 2022 with the current upward trend being experienced in the crude oil price.\n\nThe federal government last week approved N3 trillion for subsidy payment between July and December 2022. Implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which stipulates the removal of petrol subsidy, was initially meant to commence in February 2022, but it was later shifted to July 2022. However, due to pressure and threat of protest by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC), subsidy removal was deferred by 18 months.\n\nBut the NESG noted in the report that many of the challenges encountered in 2021, would become amplified in 2022 and have telling adverse impact on business productivity and citizens\u2019 welfare if the federal government failed to initiate critical reforms that would achieve a paradigm shift in governance and policy design in Nigeria. It however projected that the economy might grow by 3.2 per cent this year under the best scenerio.\n\nIt said: \u201cFrom the government fiscal position, between 2015 and 2021, Nigeria has spent a cumulative sum of N3.64 trillion on fuel subsidies, rising from N307 billion in 2015 to N1.77 trillion in 2021 \u2013 representing a whopping increase of 477 per cent.\n\n\u201cHowever, with the current rebound in the crude oil price, the burden of fuel subsidy cost will increase. On the other hand, the private sector argued that without a fair pricing system that comes with deregulation, expected inflows of investments would be hard to achieve; meanwhile, the average citizens considered the inflationary pressure that would come with subsidy removal and the impacts on the cost of living and welfare.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer of the NESG, Laoye Jaiyeola, stated in the report that, \u201cthe year 2022 presents opportunities to initialise critical reforms to achieve a paradigm shift in governance and policy design in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf we miss these opportunities for critical reforms, many of the challenges encountered in 2021 will become amplified, leading to an adverse impact on business productivity and citizens\u2019 welfare.\n\n\u201cIn the NESG Macroeconomic Outlook for 2022, we highlight the need for reforms that will sustain the recovery of output and ensure improved social inclusion in Nigeria. We believe that the role of government is to ensure reforms translate to a friendly business environment and better welfare conditions for households in the country.\u201d\n\nThe NESG acknowledged that the country was faced with daunting challenges, but insisted that 2022 presented the government with a unique opportunity to initiate tough economic reforms that would propel sustainable economic growth and inclusive development.\n\nThe reforms required, according to the NESG, would address the long-standing issues of deregulation of the downstream sector, foreign exchange scarcity and lower investment into key sectors must be given the utmost attention in 2022.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe deregulation of the downstream oil and gas sector, for example, is needed at this critical time when massive investments are required to fix the deteriorating state of the existing refineries.\n\n\u201cThis will address the predicament of huge importation of refined fuel products that deprive the country of the foreign exchange required to meet other important obligations.\n\n\u201cImplementing these reforms will undoubtedly come at a cost to the government, businesses and citizens. However, the herculean task before the government is to ensure that these costs are minimised in order to create a win-win situation for every stakeholder and, in turn, advance the country on the path of development.\u201d\n\nIt urged President Muhammadu Buhari to utilise the remaining part of his administration to intensify the pace of reforms, especially given the impact of the twin challenges of poverty and unemployment on insecurity and social cohesion of the nation.\n\n\u201cIn order to secure the future of Nigeria, the government must recognise the urgency of now. Economic and social reforms that will create jobs and improve the lives of Nigerians should be non-negotiable in 2022.\n\n\u201cWhile there is considerable improvement in some areas, such as the mobilisation of nonoil revenue in the last few years, one thing is clear: Nigeria cannot afford to continue with its business-as-usual approach in policymaking and execution.\n\n\u201cThe challenges associated with insecurity, rising prices, unemployment, and lower investments intensify the need for reforms that will lead the country to substantial economic progress and improved social inclusion,\u201d the NESG said.\n\nDike Onwuamaeze",
          "summary": "A new report by the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) has disclosed that the federal government spent a total of N3.64 trillion on fuel subsidies between 2015 and 2021.\nThe report also stated that the amount spent by the government on payment for petrol subsidy grew from N307 billion in 2015, to N1.77 trillion in 2021.\nThe federal government last week approved N3 trillion for subsidy payment between July and December 2022.\n\u201cHowever, with the current rebound in the crude oil price, the burden of fuel subsidy cost will increase.\nEconomic and social reforms that will create jobs and improve the lives of Nigerians should be non-negotiable in 2022.",
