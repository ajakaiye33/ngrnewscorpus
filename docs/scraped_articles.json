          "text": "Some students of the University of Jos have appealed to the Federal Government and the Academic Staff Union of Universities to find a common ground toward ending the incessant strikes in the universities.\n\nThey made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Friday in Jos.\n\nNAN reports that ASUU had on Monday declared a one-month warning strike to drive home their demands, just after it suspended its nine-month-old strike in December last year.\n\nASUU had claimed that the Federal Government was yet to honour the agreement it reached with it since 2009.\n\nThe students called on the duo to return to the negotiating table with a view to finding a lasting solution to the issue.\n\nMiss Edlyn Pam, a 400-level student of Mass Communication in the institution, decried that the incessant strikes had constituted a stumbling block to her academic journey.\n\nPam, who said that the strikes by ASUU had delayed her graduation, added that it had affected the academic calendar of public universities in the country.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, by now I should have graduated, but for the numerous strikes by ASUU, I\u2019m still here.\n\n\u201cI have spent six years pursuing a course I should have completed in four years; I\u2019m not even sure when I\u2019m going to graduate.\n\n\u201cBy the time I will be graduating, I may be above 30 years old and will not be eligible to go for the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC).\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m pleading with the Federal Government and ASUU to reach a sincere agreement so as to safe the future of university education in the country,\u201d she appealed.\n\nAnother student, Kwaptoe Fred, said that both the ASUU and the Federal Government should be sensitive to the plights of students.\n\nHe called on both parties to sheathe their swords for the interest of future generations, which he said is currently bleak because of frequent strikes by lecturers.\n\n\u201cTo me, the demands of ASUU are genuine, but their approach to the whole thing sometimes looks wrong.\n\n\u201cIf truly an agreement is reached between it and ASUU, such an agreement should be honoured to the letter.\n\n\u201cThey say that when two elephants fight, the ground becomes the victims; the students, in this case, are the victims.\n\n\u201cSo, we are appealing to both the ASUU and the Federal Government to return to the negotiating table and find a common ground for the sake of future generations,\u201d Fred appealed.\n\n(NAN)",

          "title": "Nigeria,5 other African countries to get WHO technology to produce mRNA vaccines",
          "text": "By Joseph Erunke\n\nABUJA- THE World Health Organisation, WHO,has name Nigeria among five other African countries that will receive its needed technology to establish mRNA vaccine production in Africa.\n\nThe global health body named five others as Egypt, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia.\n\nREAD ALSO:Vaccines production: 3 Nigerian varsities get WHO certification to next stage of research- TETFund\n\nAn mRNA vaccine is a type of vaccine that uses a copy of a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) to produce an immune response.\n\nThe vaccine delivers molecules of antigen-encoding mRNA into immune cells, which use the designed mRNA as a blueprint to build foreign protein that would normally be produced by a pathogen (such as a virus) or by a cancer cell.\n\nThese protein molecules stimulate an adaptive immune response that teaches the body to identify and destroy the corresponding pathogen or cancer cells.\n\nThe mRNA is delivered by a co-formulation of the RNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles that protect the RNA strands and help their absorption into the cells\n\nAt the European Union \u2013 African Union summit in Brussels, Friday, WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced the first six countries that will receive the technology needed to produce mRNA vaccines on the African continent.\n\nEgypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia all applied and have been selected as recipients.\n\nThe announcement was made at a ceremony hosted by the European Council, France, South Africa and WHO in the presence of President Macron, President Ramaphosa, the President of the European Council, Charles Michel and the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nThe global mRNA technology transfer hub was established in 2021 to support manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines, ensuring that they have all the necessary operating procedures and know-how to manufacture mRNA vaccines at scale and according to international standards.\n\nPrimarily set up to address the COVID-19 emergency, the hub has the potential to expand manufacturing capacity for other products as well, putting countries in the driver\u2019s seat when it comes to the kinds of vaccines and other products they need to address their health priorities.\n\nDepending on the infrastructure, workforce and clinical research and regulatory capacity in place, WHO and partners will work with the beneficiary countries to develop a roadmap and put in place the necessary training and support so that they can start producing vaccines as soon as possible.\n\nWHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \u201cNo other event like the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that reliance on a few companies to supply global public goods is limiting, and dangerous. In the mid- to long-term, the best way to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage is to significantly increase the capacity of all regions to manufacture the health products they need, with equitable access as their primary endpoint.\u201d\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa, of South Africa said: \u201cThis is an initiative that will allow us to make our own vaccines and that, to us, is very important. It means mutual respect, mutual recognition of what we can all bring to the party, investment in our economies, infrastructure investment and, in many ways, giving back to the continent.\u201d\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron, of France said: \u201cImproved public health benefits, supporting African health sovereignty and economic development are the principal goals of strengthening local production in Africa. In an interconnected world, we need stronger and new partnerships between countries, development partners and other stakeholders to empower regions and countries to fend for themselves, during crises, and in peace time.\u201d\n\nPresident Charles Michel, European Council said: \u201cWe need to create an environment where every scientist, health worker, and government can band together for a common cause. Working together to build new solutions to protect what is most precious \u2013 our health and our lives.\u201d\n\nTo ensure that all countries build the necessary capacity to produce their own vaccines and other health technologies, WHO has been working to establish a biomanufacturing workforce training hub that will train people from all interested countries in scientific and clinical research and production capacity. The training hub will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nIn addition, WHO\u2019s current regulatory strengthening activities in low- and middle-income countries will expand through a global benchmarking tool that assesses countries\u2019 ability to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of health products and provides training where improvements are needed to build regulatory authorities that are agile and fit-for-purpose for the future.\n\nThe WHO mRNA technology transfer hub is part of a larger effort aimed at empowering low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines, medicines and diagnostics to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage.\n\nThe initial effort is centred on mRNA technologies and biologicals, which are important for vaccine manufacturing and can also be used for other products, such as insulin to treat diabetes, cancer medicines and, potentially, vaccines for other priority diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. The ultimate goal is to extend capacity building for national and regional production to all health technologies.",

This has also made some of our exporters to move to Calabar port and they have gotten the necessary approval which has also led to massive shipment of cocoa beans through the Calabar.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly what is happening in the meeting with signed contracts between exporters and their clients abroad.\u201d\n\nImports chart\n\nMeanwhile, the cargo movement data, otherwise known as shipping position, obtained, from the Nigerian Ports Authority, NPA, also shows that wheat, (a raw material for production of flour and other staple foods) has continue to lead Lagos ports import chart as a total of 176,646 metric tons have been scheduled to arrive within this month as against 178,358 metric tons in January representing a drop of 0.9 percent.\n\nOther commodities that made the top import chart include sugar which recorded a total of 67,000 metric tons against 49,000 metric tons in January.\n\nRecall that the confectionary industry experienced a boom in the first quarter of 2021 as wheat, the major condiment for bread and other confectionaries, led leading the import chart with a total of 178,358 metric tonnes.",

At bus stops, scores of commuters were stranded as fewer commercial vehicles plied the roads.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nThe scarcity also forced Bolt and Uber hailing cabs to cancel their booking even as transport fares rose significantly due to demand outpacing supply. Cost of transport from Kubwa to Wuse jumped from N200 to N350.\n\nA taxi driver, David Adams, told Daily Sun that most filling stations preferred to sell between midnight and 4am to enable them sell at black market rates.\n\n\u201cI bought petrol somewhere in Zone 4 around 3am. I slept there actually. The situation is worse than last week,\u201d he said.\n\nMarcus Anaga, another taxi driver said: \u201cRight now, we call each other to know the filling station to go and sleep to get petrol.\u201d\n\nOther residents who spoke with Daily Sun regretted that the scarcity has disrupted economic and social activities and made the FCT chaotic. They queried why the scarcity has persisted despite assurances from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), oil marketers and other stakeholders that the trend would ease.\n\nThey also queried the veracity of NNPC\u2019s claims of injecting 3.2 billion litres of petrol into the domestic market saying rather than have petrol to buy, filling stations in the FCT were either empty or flooded with thousands of frustrated consumers queuing endlessly to buy petrol.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

I\u2019m making good sales. The scarcity is good.\u201d\n\nMohammed, another black market operator, said products were available as from midnight.\n\n\u201cI buy at night, around 2am. When day breaks, I sell to rich men and women who don\u2019t have time to queue at filling stations. I sell 10 litres for N6,500.\u201d\n\nDaily Sun observed that most of the petrol tankers have been parked at various filling stations for days without product to discharge.\n\nThe scarcity has badly impacted small and medium enterprises who rely on petrol generators to run their businesses.\n\nSome supermarket owners in Abuja lamented that frozen foods in their freezers were defrosting and losing freshness due to lack of petrol to power their generators.\n\n\u201cDiesel is now N400 per litre, petrol price is worse, electricity is not stable.

          "text": "Obinna Chima and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nToday makes it exactly a year to the 2023 presidential election and aspirants in the two main political parties \u2013 the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2013 as well as some other parties, are positioning for the most coveted office in the land. They have started to throw their hats in the ring to indicate their interest.\n\nEven though the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has yet to blow the whistle to signal the start of electioneering, the political space is buzzing with the activities of potential aspirants who have started doing the leg work early \u2013 meeting critical stakeholders in an effort to sell their aspiration and win critical endorsement.\n\nAlthough about 11 individuals from diverse backgrounds have formally declared their intentions to vie for their party\u2019s ticket, many of the big names being touted as nursing presidential ambitions are yet to make a formal announcement even though their footprints are all over the political space. Every occasion, official or unofficial is now a rally of sort with political undertone.\n\nIn the next few months the political space is expected to be crowded with the big names currently holding consultations in secret and in not so secret places \u2013 finally coming out to formally make their pitch.\n\nHere are those who have declared so far.\n\nBola Tinubu\n\nSince the former Lagos State Governor, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his desire to succeed him, he has been busy moving round the country and consulting with different interest groups and individuals. Already, groups such as SWAGA, the acronym for \u201cSouth-West Agenda for Asiwaju,\u201d populated by Tinubu\u2019s acolytes and yes men, are already touring the length and breadth of the country to sell his candidature.\n\nSam Ohuabunwa\n\nThe immediate past president of the Nigerian Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, Sam Ohuabunwa, has declared to contest the position of the President in the 2023 general elections on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Ohuabunwa who had lamented worsening socio-economic and political conditions in the country, strongly believes he has what it takes to transform Nigeria. He said the greatest challenge that propelled his presidential ambition was the need to produce a new Nigeria where injustice is ruled out.\n\nAnyim Pius Anyim\n\nThe former Senate President, and one time Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Ayim Pius Anyim has declared his interest in the presidential race. He feels it was time for someone from the South-east to lead the country and has vowed to contest, whether the presidential slot is zoned to his zone or not. He strongly believes the next president should be able to rebuild, protect lives and property, revive the economy, create jobs and rehabilitate the collapsed educational system. According to him, the task ahead called for a candidate who possesses the political pedigree, vision and credentials to lead the PDP to accomplish the tasks. He believes he has what it takes to govern the country, particularly in these trying times.\n\nDele Momodu\n\nDele Momodu last month declared his presidential ambition in his hometown, Ihevbe, Owan East Local Government Area of Edo State. According to the journalist and publisher of Ovation International magazine, he remains the most qualified among those aspiring to take over from Buhari next year. He insists that he might not have been a governor, senator, minister but he has sat with the high and mighty, adding that he\u2019s qualified to become the president of the country.\n\nKingsley Moghalu\n\nA former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Kingsley Moghalu has also declared his intention to contest for president in 2023. Moghalu had said his decision to contest again for president was driven by concern for suffering Nigerians who seek an alternative to the status quo. The former CBN deputy governor contested the presidential candidate of the Young Progressive Party (YPP) in 2019 and has since moved to the African Democratic Congress (ADC).\n\nChukwuka Monye\n\n43-year-old technocrat, Chukwuka Monye, in January, said the time to take over the governance from the older generation is now. To this end, the Delta State-born social innovator has declared his intention to contest for the president in the 2023 general elections. Monye whose slogan is \u201cour future is now\u201d wondered how the founding fathers would be content with Nigeria\u2019s current state. Monye, is however, yet to state the party platform which he intends to contest.\n\nRochas Okorocha\n\nThe Imo West senator, Rochas Okorocha, recently made known his interest to contest for the office of the president in the 2023 general elections. In a letter to the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, dated January 25, the former Imo State governor said what Nigeria needs right now is someone who is \u201cdetribalised\u201d and can unite the country. This would be the third consecutive time the politician who claims to have built several schools for under-privileged Nigerians across the country would be throwing his hat in the ring.\n\nAminu Tambuwal\n\nAminu Tambuwal, is the current Sokoto state governor. The politician would be seeking to realise his ambition under the Peoples Democratic Party. The former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who declared his intention after a high-level stakeholder meeting in Sokoto, recently, said that he is not only well prepared but also ready to fix the numerous problems of the country. Generally perceived as urbane, Tambuwal will face off against other contenders in the opposition party during the party\u2019s convention.\n\nDavid Umahi\n\nThe present Ebonyi State Governor , David Umahi, declared his 2023 presidential ambition at the State House, in Abuja, coming about 24 hours after former Governor of Lagos State, Tinubu, also indicated an interest in the race. Both men are members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Umahi, speaking at a press briefing after meeting with Buhari, said his presidency will replicate his \u201cprogressive efforts\u201d in Ebonyi at the national level. The Chairman of the South-east Governors\u2019 Forum said he intends to bring a business-like spirit to governance, claiming that Buhari responded to his interest by asking him to seek the support of the people when he met with him to intimate the president of his intention.\n\nYahaya Bello\n\nThe Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, was one of the earliest Nigerians to have shown interest to aspire for the 2023 presidency under the banner of the ruling APC. Bello, however opened up in Bauchi, while addressing APC legislators as well as women groups from the North-east during an extraordinary meeting held in Bauchi at Hazibal hotel sometime ago.\n\nThe Kogi governor who has always touted his youthful age as an advantage, has described the task ahead as an enormous one.\n\nSani Yerima\n\nThe ex-Zamfara governor, Sani Yerima, has also declared his intention to govern the country. The politician while speaking during a BBC Hausa Service programme \u201cGane Mani Hanya\u201d monitored in Gusau, said since Buhari is ending his second term, he (Yerima) would continue to pursue his presidential ambition.\n\n\u201cIf God spares my life, by 2023 I would go into the contest for the post of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria \u201d Yerima said.\n\nKhadijah Okunnu-Lamidi\n\nAn entrepreneur and youth development advocate, the young Khadijah Okunnu-Lamidi, has promised to make Nigeria work for its diverse populace if given the platform to do so. She promised to harness the power of Nigerian teeming youths to unleash the country\u2019s latent potential, which she described as a force to be reckoned with globally. She is the daughter of former Federal Commissioner of Works and Housing, Lateef Femi Okunnu (SAN).\n\nSome of Those Yet to Declare\u2026\n\nYemi Osinbajo\n\nWith the increasing number of groups expressing support for the vice president, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, and urging him to join the 2023 presidential race, there are expectations that he would declare his interest in the coming days. Osinbajo clearly comes across as someone, who wants to run for president, but appears to be keeping his cards close to his chest for now. His body language says as much. However, Nigerians are watching to see how Osinbajo would go toe-to-toe with his mentor, Tinubu, to actualise his ambition.\n\nAtiku Abubakar\n\nDespite the seeming opposition against his candidature, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar wants to run again for the presidency in 2023. Atiku\u2019s son, Adamu, had disclosed that his father would contest for president in 2023. While some interest groups recently advised the former vice president not to contest and have labelled him the serial presidential aspirant, Atiku does not seem to care. He is simply interested in becoming the president of Nigeria.\n\nGodwin Emefiele\n\nThere has been an increasing call for the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, to join the presidential race. A technocrat with alluring pedigree \u2013 No doubt a breath of fresh in the political arena. Although Emefiele has not confirmed to anyone that he is running for president even as he is constitutionally qualified to so do, he has said he remains focused on his job and would continue supporting the Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government\u2019s economic recovery drive. Emefiele also believes it\u2019s the prerogative of President Buhari to plan his succession for the continuing peace and progress of Nigeria.\n\nBukola Saraki\n\nThe former Governor of Kwara State has not held any elaborate event to declare his ambition, but he has hinted on several occasions on his active Twitter and Facebook accounts, that he would likely be running for the most-sought-after position. On one occasion recently, the former President of the Senate, relayed an encounter with a follower on Twitter, who charged him to run and in his response, hinted at the possibility.\n\n\u201cEarlier, I replied to a follower of mine on Twitter, who like thousands of you, has been clamouring for a united front to #RescueNigeria. As we prepare for the journey ahead, I hope we can all join hands to get the ticket of our great party, PDP, and build a nation that works for all of us,\u201d he had said.\n\nRotimi Amaechi\n\nEven though former Rivers State Governor, Rotimi Amaechi has not declared his intention, some interest groups in the country have been nudging him to throw his hat in the battle to succeed the president. Some believe that at 56, Amaechi does not have the burden of old age-related health challenges associated with some aspirants. Many people have linked the 2023 presidency to his recent coronation as: Dan Amanah Daura, which translates to mean the \u2018Trusted son of Daura.\u2019\n\nBala Mohammed\n\nBauchi State governor, Bala Mohammed has said he is likely to run for president in the 2023 election under the PDP. Presently, he is consulting with stakeholders across the country and recently met with former president Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022NCC to licence operators after February 27\n\nEmma Okonji in Lagos and Oghenevwede Ohwovoriole in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday in Abuja, officially handed over Spectrum Allocation for 5G deployment to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).\n\nThe Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, who doubles as the Chairman of the National Frequency Management Council (NFMC), did the official handover of the Spectrum Allocation for 5G licence to the NCC during a workshop on the National Policy on 5G Networks and handover of Spectrum Allocation for deployment, in Abuja.\n\nAside the official handover of the 5G spectrum to the NCC, the Minister also did an official public handover of the National Policy on 5G Network for Nigeria\u2019s Digital Economy to the NCC.\n\nBased on the official handover of the 5G spectrum, the NCC was expected to licence winners of the 5G spectrum after February 27, when it must have given full update of the payment of the licence fees by the winners, to enable 5G network rollout in the country.\n\nNCC was expected to make formal announcement on the update of payment for 5G licence on February 27, 2022, in line with the Information Memorandum for 3.5GHz spectrum, which is the 5G licence spectrum.\n\nThe Commission had on December 13, 2021, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, successfully auctioned two slots in the 3.5GHz spectrum band to MTN Nigeria Plc and Mafab Communications Limited, at a bid price of $273.6 million for each operator.\n\nThe successful auction of the 3.5GHz spectrum band would pave way for the issuance of a fifth generation (5G) licence that would facilitate the deployment of 5G network across Nigeria.\n\nAfter the successful auction of the spectrum, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, had announced that the winners were expected to make payment for the spectrum license, on or before February 24, 2022, to enable them roll out the 5G network across the country.\n\nBefore the successful spectrum auction in December last year, the Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited (NIGCOMSAT), was occupying five slots in the 3.5GHz spectrum, but vacated two slots, which were handed over to the National Frequency Management Council, chaired by the Minister.\n\nPantami advised state governors to look beyond the money they would collect from network operators who will deploy the 5G in their states, but see the gain that its deployment would bring to their respective states and the Nigerian economy in general.\n\nPantami said, \u201cThe issue of right of way becomes a challenge from time to time. The government has addressed the issue more than ninety per cent but from time to time issues may come. I do hope that they will understand the economic benefit. The security benefits and many more of these technological advancement.\n\n\u201cIt is beyond right of way charges. It goes beyond that. So let us try to make the process very easy for operators so that they will be able to deploy 5G.\u201d\n\nHe added that the adoption of 5G technologies and its roll out would support in the development of Nigeria\u2019s digital economy\n\n\u201c5G will provide very fast and reliable communication for our security personnel and allow then to swiftly access relevant data required to carry out their duties. The time required to access data for records from hours minutes.\n\n\u201c5G will allow for real time high quality and data intensive surveillance of relevant areas using high definition cameras.\n\n\u201cEmerging technologies like Blockchain can significantly improve transparency to the delivery of government services at all levels.\n\n\u201cThe World Economic Forum attests to the potential of Blockchain to increase the efficiency and fairness of government system and by extension limit opportunities for corruption.\n\nIt can significantly improve transparency in procurement procedures enhance land and registry system, ensure that government documents are not accessed by unauthorised personal,\u201d he stressed\n\nThe minister also spoke on the national policy on 5G deployment in the country, saying, \u201cthe National Policy for 5G diploma in Nigeria for our country\u2019s digital economy is also going to be distributed after the luncheon we use the occasion for the public presentation of the policy and we encourage our stakeholders to look into it and ensure a very successful implementation of the policy on what we had been doing.\n\n\u201cAccording to February 2021 report by Accentuate, 5G-enabled factories can see up to 2O-30 per cent in overall productivity gains including improvement of 50 per cent in assemble time.\n\nThese are only a few examples to show how 5G can have a positive impact on our economy,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his contribution, Danbatta said: \u201cOn the 25th January, 2022, President Muhammadu Buhari, unveiled the National Policy on 5G Networks at the Presidential Villa.\n\n\u201cThis singular action triggered today\u2019s event \u2013 the presentation of the 5G policy to the general public and for our critical stakeholders to officially witness the National Frequency Management Council presenting the Spectrum allocated for 5G technology to the Nigerian Communications Commission. To all members of the National Frequency Management Council, your efforts are truly appreciated and your recommendations have been immensely helpful.\u201d\n\nFormer Secretary General and Chief Executive of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation (CTO) and CEO of Tetconsult, UK and Nigeria, Shola Taylor, who presented the lead paper on the benefits of 5G deployment in Nigeria, said: \u201c5G is a reality and the impact on our lives is real and the benefits are endless. Nigeria is already in it. We have started well and must be prepared for the disruption that will come in spite of the challenges. We cannot go back. We cannot remain where we are so the only option is to move forward and move quickly.\u201d\n\nGiving details about 5G network, Taylor said 5G would continue to be attractive and revolutionary in nation building because it offers lower latency, higher capacity, and increased bandwidth. \u201cThis means higher data speeds, faster connections for use by individuals and businesses,\u201d Taylor added.\n\nThe Director General, National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), Aliyu Aziz, said the success of the implementation of the policy would largely depend of good collaboration between all stakeholders in the country.\n\nAlso, the Director General Galaxy Back Bone, Prof. Mohammed Abubarka, said the deployment of 5G and the implementation of the nation\u2019s digital policy would help to achieve President Buhari\u2019s government\u2019s transparency and boost the economy.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba\n\nGovernor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has expressed commitment to various programmes targeted at youth empowerment and restructuring of the Nigerian economy in order to move it away from its over-dependence on oil revenue.\n\nThe CBN governor who made the remarks at a two-day CBN Fair, which opened in Asaba yesterday, said he was passionate about empowering youths, especially young graduates through various initiatives to support small and medium scale enterprises as well as agricultural support schemes.\n\nHe noted that the unprecedented rice pyramid witnessed in Abuja, recently and the over 160 per cent rise in the number of rice mills in the country was an evidence that the CBN\u2019s intervention in agriculture sector was yielding fruits.\n\nSimilarly, he said the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP) of the apex bank and other development finance interventions greatly helped in mitigating the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria through the various palliatives that Nigerians benefited from.\n\nHe stressed the need for all hands to be on the deck to tackle the economic challenges facing Nigeria.\n\nThe Corporate Communications Director, CBN, Mr. Osita Nwanisoba, who represented Emiefele, at the fair, noted that growing a diversified economy that would meet contemporary challenges in a sustainable manner underscored the intervention programmes of the apex bank.\n\nHe stressed the need for Nigerians to understand the history of their economy and to know how they could key into the numerous intervention programmes and schemes designed to restructure the country\u2019s economic base from its monoculture status.\n\nHe assured that the CBN has been consistently proactive in ensuring that its initiatives were in tune with global trends, including digitalisation and smart internet innovations in the financial world.\n\nHe said the fact that Nigeria was the first country in Africa to launch a digital currency, the e-Naira on October 26, 2021, testified to the proactive state of the CBN.\n\nHe said, \u201cFirst and foremost, it is important for us to know where we are coming from and where we are going, because the understanding of the past will help us to understand why the CBN is doing what it is doing. Like I said, Nigeria is a mono-product economy; mono-product because 90 per cent of our foreign exchange (FX) revenue come from oil and about 60 per cent of our expenditure also comes from oil. What this means is that whenever there is a shock out there it immediately translates to our economy.\n\n\u201cSo, it becomes even more problematic for the CBN to be able to deal with its mandate. And, we have a clear mandate, which we understand, but we feel that to be able to actualise this mandate, there are other things we need to do, and that is, to stimulate growth, to grow the economy in a sustainable manner.\n\n\u201cWhat the CBN is doing is to diversify the economic base of this country. We are saying that there are so many and so much that we can do. We have agriculture, we have manufacturing. So, why can we deal with these things so that we will be able to produce what we eat and eat what we produce?\n\n\u201cBasically, that is why the CBN is intervening in the critical sectors of the economy. These are sectors that would grow the economy, create jobs, ensure that there is export so that we will be able to moderate our exchange rate and earn even more FX and grow our external reserves.\u201d\n\nOn the significance of the e-Naira to the central bank\u2019s efforts to restructure the economy, the representative of the CBN governor said there was need to move the country in the direction other economies were going.\n\n\u201cI think the first thing we have to understand is that we are gradually moving into what I will call the knowledge economy. We have also seen what digitalisation is doing across the world. Like I said earlier, as countries begin to move away from more fossil fuel to digital economy, it becomes imperative that you need to be at pace with what is going on.\n\n\u201cToday, we to talk about a web economy, we talk about internet economy, we talk about quantum computing and the rest of them.\n\n\u201cSo, Nigeria felt that we needed to deal with this, leveraging on the sophisticated payment infrastructure that we have and launched its own digital currency. It is the first in Africa. It\u2019s quite phenomenal. I think it is the sixth in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecently, we launched the TIES \u2013 the Tertiary Institution Entrepreneurship Scheme \u2013 the whole essence is to empower the youths so that they will unleash their productive potentials.\n\n\u201cTherefore, some of the takeaways from this fair is that the CBN is a listening institution. Like the CBN Governor always say, that he wants a people-centred central bank. Two, to understand that there are interventions of the CBN and to know how to leverage these interventions.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has signed an Interconnected Mini-grid Acceleration Scheme (IMAS) deal with eight indigenous solar mini-grid developers for the establishment of 23 mini-grids across 11 states of the country.\n\nExpected to generate a 5.4-kilowatt peak to connect about 27,600 households, and impact over 138,000 Nigerians in two years, the \u20ac9.3 million project is being coordinated by the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) with support from the European Union and the German government.\n\nAt the award signing ceremony, the Minister of State, Power, Goddy Jedy-Agba, said the programme was geared towards achieving the country\u2019s vision of generating at least 30, 000 megawatts of electricity by 2030.\n\nJedy-Agba noted that the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari was always open to opportunities that would achieve the acceleration of electricity in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, the national renewable energy and energy efficiency policy, vision 30:30:30 aim at achieving 30,000 megawatts of electricity by the year 2030, with renewable energy contributing 30 per cent of the energy mix. To achieve this, the minister stated that Nigeria would have to construct over a thousand mini-grids of 100 kilowatts.\n\nThe minister added that it was important to continue to find creative and innovative ways to achieve the objective, and one of which was through collaborating with development partners and the private sector.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe understand that one of the major bottlenecks for the private sector\u2019s involvement is financing, hence, the reason the NESP and REA have worked closely to develop and implement the scheme.\u201d\n\nThe eight local solar mini-grid developers include Acob Lighting Technology Limited, Gve Projects, Nayo Tropical Technology Limited, Rubitec Nigeria Limited and Darway Coast Nigeria Limited, Synergy Limited, Sosa-Protergia Joint Development Company Limited, and A4&T Power Solutions Limited.\n\nThey would receive in-kind grants through the REA with support of the European Union and the German Government within the framework of the Nigerian Energy Support Programme (NESP).\n\nThe indigenous developers are expected to establish 23 mini-grids across 11 states, which include, Zamfara, Niger, Plateau, Kwara, Kogi, Osun, Ogun, Lagos, Delta, Anambra, and Cross River.\n\nEarlier, the Managing Director of REA, Ahmad Salihijo said the scheme was aimed at bridging the funding gap affecting indigenous developers in the renewable energy sector.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope that the signatures we put down today in these documents set a precedent for the new and improved power and energy sector in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs an agency, we encourage investors to explore the solar mini-grid sector. However, one major constraint to this is usually financing. This is why the REA, with the support of NESP, is working together to alleviate this bottleneck.\n\n\u201cWe do this by providing in-kind grants to selected mini-grid developers on favourable and encouraging terms as contained in the grant agreement,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to him, the main objective of the intervention is to design and test a tender model for interconnected solar mini-grids, leading to the foundation of the scheme.\n\n\u201cThe wonderful thing about the IMAS project is that we have ensured that all the developers are Nigerians. This is to say that the Nigerian energy sector has come a long way from what it used to be and we are proud of this,\u201d he explained.\n\nHead of programme, NESP, Benjamin Duke, assured that his team would continue to work to build investors\u2019 confidence in the sector by developing an accurate electricity market intelligence that will provide investors with accurate data about the country\u2019s electricity needs.\n\nAlso speaking at the ceremony, the Executive Director, Rural Electrification Fund (REF), Sanusi Ohiare, said while investors were being encouraged to explore the solar mini-grid sector, one major constraint to their project development was finance.\n\n\u201cHence, the REA with the support of NESP was able to alleviate this major burden by providing capital in-kind grant to selected mini-grid developers on favourable and encouraging terms as contained in the grant agreement,\u201d he noted.\n\nHead of Section, Green Economy at the European Union Delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Ms. Inga Stefanowicz, noted that the EU\u2019s financial support for the programme represents the EU\u2019s commitment to support Nigeria in the efforts to enable more investments in the solar mini-grid sector.\n\n\u201cWe hope that our contribution will help improve access to reliable and affordable electricity in Nigeria, especially in the disadvantaged areas of the country, hence advancing the living standard of the rural and peri-urban dwellers using renewable sources of energy,\u201d she stated.\n\nCountry Director of GIZ Nigeria & ECOWAS, Ina Hommers, said the provision of capital in-kind grants to the developers in the solar mini-grid sector through the IMAS aimed to ensure higher investments in the sector.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the grants contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Nigeria, in particular SDG 7 on access to affordable and clean energy and SDG 13 on climate action. These represent one of the focal areas of GIZ\u2019s support to Nigeria,\u201d Hommers stressed.\n\nDepending on the ability of the private sector, between 18 to 24 solar mini-grid projects will be deployed in 2022 under the project, serving clean electricity to around 138,000 people in Nigeria.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Assures petrol supply will be restored next week\n\nUdora Orizu in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nGroup Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mr. Mele Kyari, yesterday apologised to Nigerians for damages caused by the importation of substandard fuel into the country. Kyari assured Nigerians that normalcy would return to petrol stations by next week, saying the national oil company has taken necessary steps to restore supply in the country.\n\nKyari spoke this in Abuja while addressing the House of Representatives Committee on Downstream, during an investigative hearing on the importation of methanol-blended petrol.\n\nHowever, in a bid to end the fuel scarcity and clear the long queues at filling station in many parts of the country, petroleum products marketing companies, under the umbrella of Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), have extended their opening hours in their jetties, depots and filling stations to a minimum of 18 hours.\n\nKyari said with at least 2.1 billion litres of petrol in stock, the fuel queues would end by next week.\n\nThe NNPC boss disclosed that given the current situation, five other vessels conveying their next supply had been rejected and were not allowed to sail into the country\u2019s waters because they were coming from the same shipping terminal that sent the four substandard cargos. He stressed that the current challenge was because Nigeria imported all gasoline.\n\nKyari said, \u201cNot a single litre of petrol is generated in the country, that means 100 per cent of petrol you see in this country is imported. Those imports are done on the basis of existing contractual arrangements that we have. It is called the direct sale- direct purchase process, which is simply with the best of practice to enable our suppliers supply products to us on agreed terms and conditions.\n\n\u201cWe have been doing this since I came on board and its part of our supply mechanism. Even if all our refineries come up today, except Dangote Refinery, we will still be in short supply of premium motor spirit (PMS), because all of our refineries can only make 18 million litres of gasoline. Consumption is certainly above 18million litres.\u201d\n\nKyari further explained that the four cargoes that in question met all the criteria on arrival and that was why they were allowed to discharge into terminals and convey into ship.\n\nWhile noting that there was no way, based on the current specifications, that they would know that the PMS contained methanol, as it was not part of their requirements at the load port, Kyari assured that they have been able to trace all the volumes and quarantine them accordingly.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cBy law, NNPC is required to ensure energy security. Therefore, it is our responsibility to ensure that we provide energy security for this country. This company must operate within the laws of this country and this is what we have always done, and this is what we will continue to do.\n\n\u201cFor this current situation, I assure you that we have taken every necessary step to restore supply into this country. We have placed orders significant enough for us to cross into March, with at least 2.1 billion litres of PMS in our custody. The situation you are seeing today I can assure you that by next week, it will vanish.\n\n\u201cAll things being equal, because of distribution issues that we may not have control over, including the movement of trucks, otherwise, we have robust supply arrangement to make sure that we exit this issue.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of those contracts, our suppliers bring products to us and we reconcile with them regularly. Part of those supply arrangements is to give specification to your suppliers. These specifications are bound by regulation and the latest that we are using is the one that is in place since 2006.\n\n\u201cThe current specifications we have is what is the subject of all our import arrangement. So all our partners were given those specifications and on the basis of this, those imports were made. Before a vessel leaves the load port, they have to declare that those vessels meet our specification; they will send it to the importer and confirm that it is the specification. On the basis of that, you allow the sail away of the vessel.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said, \u201cNow, once it comes to the country, two things happen. We have NNPC surveyors, who are now also required to validate that this product that we have meets the Nigerian specification.\n\n\u201cAlso we have the regulatory authority who has to conduct an independent assessment to confirm that this product meets the specification that is in consonance with the existing regulation in the country.\n\n\u201cIn case of all the problems we have seen, four of the cargoes that are particularly in question today met all the criteria on arrival and that was why they were allowed to discharge into terminals and conveyed into ship.\n\n\u201cThere is simply no way, based on the current specification, that you will know these PMS contains methanol. It is not part of their requirements at the load port. So we did not ask them to declare whether it contains methanol because it is not part of our specification.\n\n\u201cLet me make it clear that methanol is not contamination, it is a regular addictive to PMS. In China, up to 15 per cent PMS contain methanol. On its own it is not a contamination, the key issue is handling methanol. If we knew we will not accept this. Anytime methanol comes in contact with water it emulsifies, it turns into a different chemical.\u201d\n\nKyari lamented that one of the challenges NNPC faced was lack of tracking mechanism to track trucks leaving the depot. He said this had aided smuggling, as some of the fuel was transported to places that might not be in this country.\n\nThe GMD disclosed that NNPC had filed litigation against importers of the methanol-blended PMS considering the effect of the withdrawing the products across the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat did we do? We have put all our suppliers who are our contacts or commercial angle on notice that there would be liquidated damages that will come from this. And also it is typical practice that we compile liquidated damages that the direct supplier did not cost, he will transfer that to the next person until it gets to the originating supplier, so it is a back-to-back arrangement.\n\n\u201cThat is always done so that once you file, it will get to the last one. I do not know how many people are in the chain because this PMS supply business in one cargo you can have three sellers, you can have two, and you may have only one.\u201d\n\nHowever, a member of the House committee, Hon. Adediji Olamide, in his submission, said ignorance was not an excuse in law. Olamide said the committee would need a lot of documentation that NNPC.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Chairman, House Committee on Petroleum Resources Downstream, Hon. Abdullahi Gaya, noted that the investigative hearing was to ensure that the culprits were brought to book as well as make recommendations towards curbing a reoccurrence of the incident.\n\nHe stated that the task ahead was challenging, including examining the lessons, proffering solutions and way forward, and rejigging supply and regulating the system to make them more effective and efficient.\n\nOil Marketers Move to Clear Fuel Queues, Extend Opening Period to 24 hours\n\nMeanwhile, MOMAN said where possible, its members would extend their opening hours up to 24 hours a day in high density and flagship locations where the security situation permitted. The association stated that its members \u201cshall operate these extended hours until the excessive queues subside.\u201d\n\nThe association made this known yesterday in a statement signed by its Chairman and Managing Director of Ardova Plc, Mr. Olumide Adeosun. The statement added that it was working with the regulatory authorities and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited towards a resolution of the current fuel crisis.\n\nAdeosun said MOMAN\u2019s subject matter experts were active contributors to the technical and commercial committees\u2019 set up by the regulatory authorities to re-stock fuel supplies, resolve the blending of contaminated product and identify losses suffered by customers, operators and third parties.\n\nHe said MOMAN members were also working with designated laboratories to double-check the quality of product (re-blended or new) before they are released into the fuels supply chain.\n\nMost importantly, Adeosun maintained that MOMAN members had committed resources towards enhanced operations and associated activities to reduce the burden of the current fuel scarcity to customers.\n\nThe association urged its customers not to engage in panic buying, as it might take a few days for normalcy to return, stressing that panic buying increases the pressure on the supply chain.\n\nNANS Condemn Attempts to Instigate Crisis, Attack NNPC\n\n,The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has condemned an alleged attempt by some unscrupulous elements to hijack the adulterated fuel saga and resultant fuel scarcity to engage in a protest aimed to instigate crisis in the country and damage the reputation of the NNPC Limited.\n\nNANS also bemoaned the serious fuel supply disruption across the country occasioned by the importation of bad petrol, allegedly, by some approved dealers of the NNPC.\n\nThe students\u2019 body, in a statement issued yesterday and jointly signed by its National President, Asefon Sunday, and Secretary General, Adekitan Lukman, said it was in receipt of credible intelligence that certain individuals had mobilised civil society organisations (CSOs) to embark on protests to paint the NNPC leadership in bad light.\n\nWhile acknowledging the avoidable situation the country had been plunged into as a result of the fuel supply disruption, NANS frowned on those it claimed wanted to make political gain out of a purely operational issue, urging them to have a rethink.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWhile we acknowledge the avoidable situation we are in as a country after almost six years of no queues and scarcity, we frown on those who want to make political gain out of a purely operational issue and urge those behind the attempt to put a spanner in the smooth administrative structure of President Muhammadu Buhari at the NNPC to desist forthwith.\n\nNANS was in receipt of credible intelligence that certain enemies of the Kyari leadership wanted to use the petrol scarcity as a excuse to embark on protests to paint the NNPC leadership in bad light.\n\nThe association demanded a speedy resolution of all issues and the normalisation of fuel supply across the country to ameliorate the hardship being experienced by Nigerians.\n\nNANS, however, commended the directive of President Muhammadu Buhari for an inquiry into the dire fuel importation mishap, which has put a strain on the supply chain and on Nigerians, saying it hoped the inquiry would be decisive and far-reaching.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "On February 8, the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) broke the news that petrol with methanol quantities above Nigeria\u2019s specification, was discovered in the supply chain. As a result of this, the regulator isolated and withdrew the affected product from the market.\n\nAs events unfolded, fuel scarcity set in and queues surfaced in filling stations in Lagos and Abuja. But as more tanks ran dry, more filling stations shut down services and the queues dramatically multiplied and even trickled down to other states including Rivers, Enugu and Ondo.\n\nSubsequently, Simon Harry, the statistician-general of the federation, said the petrol crisis experienced across Nigeria may have an adverse effect on macro-economic variables such as the inflation rate, gross domestic product (GDP) and even the unemployment rate. And just like a prophet, it did.\n\nNIGERIANS HIT HARD AMID UNDIVERSIFIED ENERGY SOURCES\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a matter of days as it is expected, the prices of everything from transportation to food skyrocketed. Filling stations cashed in on the situation, taking N500, N1000 as gate fees before motorists could be allowed to buy fuel. Black market sales also ballooned going for as high as N500 to N700 for a litre.\n\nIn the midst of this, the country was also hit by electricity outages in several cities including Lagos and Abuja, affecting the daily activities and businesses of millions. And with the epileptic power supply evident in the country over the years, Nigerians who rely on generating sets to power their homes have also been affected. A situation that could have been helped with renewable sources like solar energy.\n\nNnimo Bassey, director, Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF), believes the country is being greatly affected by the petrol problem because of its heavy dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said it is time Nigeria realised the need for energy transition without which some of these issues will linger.\n\n\u201cThe country\u2019s continued dependence on fossil fuel for energy counters any dream of energy transition to renewable sources. It is that dependence that puts the nation on the line for importation of toxic fuels. It doesn\u2019t appear that the nation is ready to seriously invest in plans to move to clean energy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is underscored by the fact that at a time the world is heavily investing in renewable energy, the government is planning to take up 20 percent shares in the Dangote refinery.\u201d\n\n\u2018FOSSIL FUELS HAVE REACHED A DEAD END\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBassey said Nigeria has to wake up to the realisation that \u201cfossil fuels have reached a dead end\u201d and should be left to stay in the ground. He said the government should rather invest in research and deployment of renewables.\n\nHe also said the country risks a poisoned population and environment after foreign companies currently polluting the Nigerian environment abandons the country with the mess they (the oil companies) created.\n\n\u201cTo accelerate the transition we have to wake up to the fact that fossil fuels have reached a dead end. It is time to stop gas flaring, invest in the clean up of the Niger Delta and all polluted areas, and pump resources into research and development and deployment of renewable energy options,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe nation is also facing dire consequences that may arise from Shell and Exxon gearing to abandon their decrepit and toxic infrastructure and ship out of there. Nigeria is heading to a period of stranded assets, destroyed environments and a poisoned population in the oil belt.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn his part, Joe Nwakwue, an oil and gas consultant partner with Zera Advisory and Consulting, believes that while the country might not be able to immediately do away with the use of fossil fuels such as petrol, it can speed up the use of autogas, a safe alternative that is non-toxic.\n\nHe said the adoption of autogas will help diversify the energy mix especially as it relates to transportation and would have prevented the petrol crisis in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we had only 10 percent adoption at this time, we would not have the queues we see today. We need to work hard to implement this (the autogas programme) as soon as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nWHAT ALTERNATIVE CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES CAN BE EXPLORED?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe situation Nigeria has found itself begs the question \u2013 what other sustainable energy sources can the country explore to power vehicles?\n\nAccording to the US Department of Energy, some clean energy sources that can power vehicles while helping to reduce emissions include but are not limited to:\n\ni) Electricity: Electricity can be used to power plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), including both all-electric vehicles, as well as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. These vehicles can charge their batteries by drawing electricity directly from the grid and other off-board electrical power sources. Using electricity to power vehicles can have significant energy security and emissions benefits.\n\nii) Biodiesel: A renewable fuel that can be manufactured from vegetable oils, animal fats, or recycled cooking grease for use in diesel vehicles or any equipment that operates on diesel fuel. Biodiesel\u2019s physical properties are similar to those of petroleum diesel.\n\niii) Ethanol: A renewable fuel made from corn and other plant materials. However, it dependent on vehicle model, geography and season. It can be recommended for use in different vehicle types.\n\nENERGY ADVOCATES CALL FOR AN ACCELERATED JUST TRANSITION\n\nAccording to Lande Abudu, a renewable energy expert, the importation of off-spec petrol and the resultant fuel scarcity \u201cis a clarion call for Nigeria to ramp up activities to have viable alternatives\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis scarcity has laid bare what renewable energy advocates have long known.

          "title": "Inside Ckrowd\u2019s plan to help African creators monetise their content",
          "text": "The term \u201ccreator economy\u201d became popular throughout 2021 when venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and independent creators not only threw the phrase around but also invested heavily in the content industry\u2014an industry that would leapfrog into becoming a $100 billion industry.\n\nContent creators\u2014writers, artists, social media influencers, videographers, gamers, podcasters\u2014are raking in millions of dollars annually by monetising their craft. But only a tiny fraction of these creators are Africans. This means African creators are still struggling to earn much from their craft, compared to their global counterparts.\n\nTwo things may have caused this: one is, global payment networks like Paypal that should connect African creators with the rest of the world have shut Africans out of their network; secondly, lack or shortage of efficient local creator platforms that connect the rest of the world directly to African creators.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile there are some companies already building to solve the first problem, Ckrowd, a content streaming platform and marketplace, is solving the second problem at scale.\n\nCkrowd is positioning itself as the platform that bridges the gap between African content creators or suppliers and their global content consumers by providing creators with the opportunity to earn income while giving \u201cunique, exclusive, and engaging content experiences to their consumers\u201d.\n\nCkrowd was founded out of a will to do more\n\nCkrowd was founded by Olukayode Adebayo in November 2020. But before then, Adebayo, who was freshly back to Nigeria after a stint with the Nigerian embassy in China, had founded a real estate company that morphed into a hospitality business. He then started a media outfit in September 2016, called KAM Africa.\n\nAt KAM Africa, Adebayo started an initiative that would help creative professionals like musicians and actors understand the business part of their craft. But as he continued with the initiative, he realised that there was a need to bring all these promising enterprises together. Nobody builds in isolation, especially in the entertainment scene. So KAM Africa started Amfest, a festival-like event that brings together African creative businesses.\n\nAdebayo\u2019s cross-continental experience helped Amfest to quickly scale out of its founding country Nigeria into Ghana, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, and even Dubai.\n\n\u201cWe started building business partnerships with other platforms and scaled very fast. It was in the process of supporting the sector that we found out that many of these talents that are now enterprises had a problem with anything that doesn\u2019t involve physical human interaction,\u201d Adebayo told TechCabal. \u201cAt the point of this discovery, COVID-19 happened and it became even clearer as most of them were left without income. So, there was a need to bring them online.\u201d\n\nThe next thing to build became apparent; Ckrowd\u2014the solution to these persistent problems. After doing a lot of research and consultations throughout 2020, Adebayo launched the beta version of Ckrowd early last year and then launched publicly in August.\n\nHow Ckrowd works\n\nThe platform is a direct-to-consumer platform where original and exclusive African content in education, information, and entertainment is distributed directly to local and global consumers in short videos and live stream format. Think of a marriage between OnlyFans, Patreon, and YouTube\u2014in fact, a combination of all the streaming platforms out there\u2014but now for African content.\n\nLast year in December, uduX, a Nigerian streaming platform, partnered with telecoms giant MTN to live stream Wizkid\u2019s \u201cMade in Lagos\u201d concert from London\u2019s 02 Arena to over 238,000 Africans. But the event was quickly moved to YouTube after the day one of the three-days concert. Regardless of what might have caused the relocation, it\u2019s, however, an indication that Africa needs more efficient indigenous platforms that can aggregate content and put more money in the pocket of local creators while providing a seamless experience for local and global consumers.\n\nFor Adebayo, Ckrowd is taking an all-encompassing approach to building for the African creator economy, one that\u2019s a win-win for all the stakeholders.\n\nTo better understand CKrowd\u2019s advantage, let\u2019s look at how existing streaming platforms work: On YouTube, for instance, creators make money according to their view numbers and sometimes from ads. This means, if YouTube pays $0.0001 per view, you\u2019ll need 10,000 views to make $10. In the case of Netflix, let\u2019s say you subscribe at $10 per month, what happens if you are too busy for Netflix that month? Will you be refunded? No!\n\nFrom the creator\u2019s end, 10,000 views for $10 is not sustainable. How many African creators hit hundreds of thousands of views or millions? A small number. For consumers, the subscription model is not good if you can\u2019t flip unused subscriptions.\n\nOn Ckrowd, creators can livestream their content like uduX live and upload on-demand contents like on Netflix. Creators also control their spaces and how they want to be paid\u2014per view or by subscription. Unlike on social media platforms where creators, after creating content and amassing views and followers, would have to go outside the platform to market their views and followers to brands, Ckrowd lets creators set their prices and make their money as they go. It also allows viewers to select how they wish to pay for content\u2014all inside the platform.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to deliver economic value to African creators. The platform pays 70% of total income on content to creators, which we believe is the highest pay-out on digital content to African creators,\u201d said Adebayo.\n\nCkrowd is not only for music and film content; educational, culinary, sports, and other forms of content are allowed on the platform.\n\n\u201cThe Ckrowd platform is similar to a large arena in the cloud where you can broadcast live & short on-demand video content and charge access fees on behalf of the creators of that content. This allows the platform to uniquely function as an edtech, mediatech and adtech hybrid,\u201d said Adebayo.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nCkrowd, from 4 users at its beta launch, has grown to have over 2,000 users on its platform. Last year in October, it raised $160,000 in pre-seed funding; $60,000 of equity funding, and $100,000 export grant investment from an international angel investor group, as well as backing from the Export Expansion Facility Programme from Nigerian Energy Support Programme (NESP).\n\nCkrowd plans to use the new capital to expand with new innovative technologies and strategies to get more customers, accelerate growth and promote intra-African creative industries. In addition to that, the company plans to hire more talent, especially in product, Research and Development (R&D) and engineering.\n\nAccording to Adebayo, the startup has already made headway in some of these plans. It acquired a marketing agency last year to power the ads sector of its business. The company said the agency\u2019s channels had access to about 50 million people across Africa, which means Ckrowd can now reach these people through email, SMS, and other channels available. This sounds like a transfer of data without the consent of the owners; however, if these people opted in with the marketing agency, which has now been acquired, then, by extension, they have opted in with Ckrowd.\n\nThe startup also recently announced the appointment of the founder and director of Music Works International Katherine McVicker and co-founder of Cultural Connections of Africa (CCA) Adeleye Fabusoro as executive members to its advisory board. Adebayo also said the company has built its own production studio and is currently partnering with other media houses across the continent, He hinted that they [Ckrowd] will soon start rolling out the results of the partnerships.\n\nCkrowd is taking on big players like Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, ShowMax, uduX and even cable television channel who\u2019ve got their claws deep in the streaming market. Will it curve, niche down, or dominate? This is not an easy one to predict but from Adebayo\u2019s confidence in the product and their pan-African play, there\u2019s something to root for in Ckrowd.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This article is contributed to TechCabal by Conrad Onyango/bird story agency\n\nFrom consoles to smartphones, Africa\u2019s growing, tech-savvy population is driving significant growth in the multi-million dollar gaming industry as increased adoption of digital currencies and blockchain technology takes African gaming to the next level.\n\nJust over five years ago, African gamers were mostly playing games on consoles and personal computers at either cyber cafes or gaming joints, with very few people enjoying the games \u2013 most of which were foreign creations \u2013 at home.\n\nFast forward to 2022 and smartphones are the new primary platform and you can play your favorite game anywhere, with most characters, assets and even languages adopting African characteristics.\n\nThe number of gamers on the continent has also more than doubled over the past five years and the growth of the gaming industry in all aspects is taking an upward trajectory.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nDevelopers customising game to fit the African narrative\n\nDevelopers are fast adding new elements, with ownership being the latest addition allowing gamers to own characters and assets within the games- leveraging on block chain technology.\n\nUsiku Games Africa, a Kenyan based Social Impact gaming company is pioneering the new era of blockchain gaming in the country where the rising number of tech-savvy youth could soon start earning from the industry boom.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at ways of having financial mechanisms built into the games where people can either earn or spend in a more transparent manner,\u201d Usiku Games Founder and CEO, Jay Shapiro told bird in an interview.\n\nUnder this new model, while gamers will still enjoy the thrill in gaming, they will not be able to directly cash-out earnings like in gambling.\n\nInstead an enforced savings mechanism has been developed to redirect the earnings towards long-term saving instruments like pension schemes, health, and education insurance- helping to shore up low savings culture among youth in Africa and build up their financial resilience.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that even if you have a job or an income, a little bit of savings maybe, all that may be washed away by say a pandemic, climate change or injury in the family,\u201d said Shapiro.\n\nSouth Africa takes the lead\n\nA 2021 study commissioned by Newzoo, a games analytics company and Carry1st, a South African gaming platform, shows the number of gamers has risen to 186 million people from 77 million in 2015 in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nWith 24 million gamers, South Africa tops the continent having 40 percent of its population playing followed by Ghana (27 percent) and Nigeria (23 percent) in second and third places respectively.\n\nKenya and Ethiopia finish fourth and fifth largest gaming markets in the continent with 22 percent and 13 percent of their population into gaming respectively.\n\nMajority of the playing population (95 percent) are mobile gamers with Covid-19 pandemic and increasing digitization across the continent said to be the biggest drivers to the numbers.\n\n\u201cGaming in Africa is exploding. Crucially, this applies not only to people playing games, but also those willing to pay as well,\u201d said Carry1st CEO and Co-founder, Cordel Robbin-Coker.\n\nCrypto adoption and gaming in Africa\n\nAlready, 63 million of the 186 million gamers, pay for games with these African figures projected to be the fastest-growing in the world as the continent also begins adoption of digital currencies.\n\nAnother research by Newswagg\u2019s points to a growing appetite for trading in gaming assets using digital currencies with 38 percent of 41.9 million gamers owning crypto across the world being millennials aged 21-38 years old.\n\nAfrica and the Middle East have a combined 5.9 million gamers owning Crypto, with a potential to shore up these numbers in Africa given that the continent will have one of the largest youthful populations by 2050.\n\nAccording to Newswagg\u2019s, 80 percent gamers with crypto accounts are interested in using digital currency for gaming purchases, with 67 percent yearning for an opportunity to use cryptocurrency in gaming.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an immense potential for crypto to be more involved in the gaming industry,\u201d says the report.\n\nGlobal crypto gaming was valued at 321 million US dollars in 2020.\n\nNigeria has leaped ahead of its African peers in adoption of cryptocurrencies following the launch of Africa\u2019s first Central Bank-backed digital currency- the e-Naira in 2021.\n\nWhile Kenya is yet to launch its own regulated digital currency, it tops the world in peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trade.\n\nSouth Africa is currently in the piloting stage of its project, Dunbar- that will support cross border payments with Mauritius getting closer to piloting now in the development stage.\n\nSix other African countries including Tunisia, Ghana and Morocco are still conducting research on regulated digital currencies.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service).

Please, leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nSolving critical bankend freight industry challenges\n\nEarnipay\u2019s plans to reach 200,000 employees\n\nSolving critical backend freight industry challenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all know Africa lags in terms of modern technology adoption. For example, some freight companies in Africa still manage their shipments using outdated methods like spreadsheets, phone calls, and emails.\n\nFor most of them, multiple software platforms are used to complete various tasks. However, some platforms combine these software to make their work easier, faster, and more effective.\n\nOne of such companies is Freterium, a Moroccan startup that offers a single software that serves multiple functions. And this company has announced $4 million in seed funding to expand across the country and into neighbouring regions.\n\nPartech, a San Francisco-based investor, led the round. CDG Invest, Y Combinator, Flexport, Swiss Founders Fund, Outlierz Ventures, and a few angel investors from the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa were among those who took part.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Mehdi Cherif Alami (CEO) and Omar El Kouhene (CPO), the company creates a comprehensive approach to addressing critical backend challenges in the freight industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Alami, Freterium onboarded more than 20 enterprise customers in its first full year of operation, growing 35% month over month. Over 3,000 people also use its software.\n\nHe also said that the funds would be used to invest in the company\u2019s research & development activities, hire more talent to double the current size of its team within the next 12 months, market its software, and expand across Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.\n\nEarnipay\u2019s plans to reach 200,000 employees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarnipay, a fintech solution startup that provides income-earners with flexible and on-demand salary access, has raised $4 million in a seed round to provide on-demand salaries to African employees.\n\nThe round was led by VC, Canaan. It also saw participation from XYZ Ventures, Village Global, Musha Ventures, Ventures Platform, Voltron Capital, and Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade.\n\nNonso Onwuzulike officially launched the company in January 2022 to improve employees\u2019 financial well-being. It accomplishes this by utilising technology to allow employees to deposit their paychecks into their accounts in a flexible, real-time, and interest-free manner.\n\nEarnipay collaborates with employers and integrates seamlessly with their payroll systems to provide its services to employees, who can then track and withdraw their accrued salaries via the app.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the company will use the seed funding to speed up the development of its platform to serve large enterprise employers. It will also provide employees with the tools to make better financial decisions and improve their quality of life.\n\nBy the end of 2022, the company plans to offer its on-demand salary solution to 200,000 employees.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nMost people with EUPD/BPD aren\u2019t manipulative \u2013 but often those around us can be.

But Meta says it has to process data across continents because it is crucial for ad targeting.\n\nAd targeting or not, the European leaders are very adamant about the new rule. Germany\u2019s new economy minister Robert Habeck said, \u201cAfter I was hacked, I have lived without Facebook and Twitter for four years, and life has been fantastic.\u201d\n\nMeta could be on the receiving end of its threat to the EU as it closed with a market cap below $600 billion on February 8, 2022, losing daily active users for the first time in its 18 year existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWhy female founders should learn the venture capital game\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s $3bn valuation\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\nWomen should play the VC game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, women got less than 1% of startup funding. Sadly, the statistics have been quite similar in previous years.\n\nWhy is it this way? \u201cGetting funded is a bit of a game.\u201d \u2014 the words of Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures.\n\nAccording to her, women need to learn the rules of the VC game and know what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nEnygma Ventures has spent two years teaching women what venture funding requires. Dusek started the firm when she realised how difficult it was for women to access capital.\n\nIn her chat with Chimgozirim, she detailed the rules and tactics that could mean better odds for women in winning the venture capital game. Read all about it here: Female founders need to learn how to play the venture capital game\u2013 Sarah Dusek\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s $3bn valuation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlutterwave has come a long way since it was founded in 2016. The San Francisco-headquartered fintech startup broke into unicorn status last year after a $170 million raise led by New York-based private investment firm Avenir Growth Capital and US hedge fund and investment firm Tiger Global.\n\nIn just 12 months, Flutterwave has tripled that valuation after a $250 million Series D raise announced yesterday, February 16, 2022. The raise was led by global investment firm, B Capital. Leader of its $170 million Series C. Avenir Growth also participated in the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTripling its valuation isn\u2019t the only thing the fintech company has achieved since attaining unicorn status 12 months ago. Businesses using its platform have increased by 610,000 \u2014 290,000 to 900,000.\n\nIts total transaction, valued at $9 billion last year, has grown to $16 billion with 200 million transactions processed.\n\nAlthough Flutterwave started out as an enterprise payment fintech startup, it has detoured into creating fintech products for small and medium businesses and remittance products over the years.\n\nIn 2020 we saw the launch of Flutterwave Store revamped to Flutterwave Market in 2021. The platform now boasts 30,000 merchants according to TechCrunch. Flutterwave\u2019s remittance service, Send, also launched recently to help customers send money within and outside Africa.\n\nAway from fintech: Flutterwave also displayed interest in the creator economy with the acquisition of Disha, a platform that allows creators to curate content and receive payment. However, the payments feature still falls within Flutterwave\u2019s court.\n\nIPO insight? If you\u2019re planning on investing in Flutterwave via stocks the CEO and Co-Founder, Olugbenga Agboola, told TechCrunch that the startup has no plan to IPO anytime soon. The funding will be geared towards its ambitious expansion plans and rapid customer acquisition.\n\nIf you want to go down memory lane before Flutterwave became a mammoth in the African tech space, you can start with the story of Agboola\u2019s first day as CEO.\n\nPlease read here: In conversation with Olugbenga Agboola on his first day as Flutterwave CEO\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions to financial inclusion most times comes in two ways online or offline. However, some people, like Twitter user, Mudia, are of the opinion that the former isn\u2019t true financial inclusion. Mudia sums up his opinion up in a tweet that reads,\n\n\u201cBanking the un-banked, but your solution na app wey dey work from Android 11 upwards.\u201d\n\nMost people with a similar stance believe a solution to financial inclusion that requires a smartphone isn\u2019t practical as most smartphone users are already banked. According to Dataphyte, a media research and data analytics organisation, 38 million Nigerians were financially excluded in 2020.\n\nFintech startups like OPay and TeamApt are tackling the problem with agent banking, taking physical banking services to hard-to-reach locations.\n\nHowever, these agents still need banks to get cash, and that\u2019s where CrowdForce, which announced its $3.6 million pre-Series A yesterday comes in.\n\nThe startup offers agency banking services like OPay and TeamApt, but agents do not need to visit banks to get cash. It solves this problem by partnering with cash-heavy small businesses like fuel stations, converts them to mobile bank branches and stores their cash on PayForce digital wallet, its flagship product.\n\nCrowdForce has partnered with 19,000 fuel stations to broaden its network. It plans to grow its 7,000 agent network by three times a year.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nScientists Created a Cyborg Fish Powered by Beating Human Heart Cells.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA cursory look at the venture capital landscape in Africa will reveal an impressive number of deals and the triumph of innovation over regulation. Yet, a closer look at the numbers will show a wide gulf between the amount of money raised by men and women.\n\nWhile funding for female founders globally is minimal, African women have seen significantly less money than their male counterparts, receiving less than 1% of startup funding in 2021. One reason for this is that most female-led businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa are small businesses with little capacity for scale.\n\nAccording to Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures, who spoke to Techpoint Africa on Zoom, a second reason is that most women don\u2019t know how to play the venture capital game.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest components that we\u2019ve been working on for the last couple of years has been not knowing how you play this game, and getting funded is a bit of a game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are very specific rules to it; there are specific metrics that people like me are looking for. There are specific types of businesses that work and those that don\u2019t, particularly with this type of funding. Women are more familiar with taking debt and grants, and I think there are a lot of unfamiliarities in the space that disadvantages women.\u201d\n\nDue to this, Dusek, an entrepreneur, revealed that a huge part of Enygma Ventures\u2019 work in the last two years has been teaching women what venture funding requires. She also added that the presence of a few role models makes it harder for women to raise money.\n\nWith venture capital a novel concept in Africa, not too many people, regardless of gender, understand how it works. Therefore, the lack of knowledge plays a role in how women access funding. \u201cIf you know, you can build it,\u201d she said.\n\nHelping women build scalable businesses\n\nBuilding a business is a daunting task for anyone, but it can often seem like an impossible task when you\u2019re a woman. Centuries of restricting the participation of women in the economy to the informal sector have led to a small number of women in the workforce. Dusek knows this all too well, having built and sold Under Canvas, an American hospitality company.\n\nAfter selling Under Canvas, Dusek, who started her career working with non-governmental organisations in Africa, decided to invest in female founders. That decision birthed Enygma Ventures, a sector-agnostic firm providing women with the capital required to scale and grow their businesses.\n\n\u201cMy experience of being a female founder made me realise how hard it is for women founders to get access to capital, and so it\u2019s a natural progression from being an entrepreneur to being a guide to helping other women do the same thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Dusek, Managing General Partner, Enygma Ventures\n\nEnygma Ventures invests in early-stage women-led or women-founded startups across the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East Africa. The ticket sizes for startups the firm invests in vary from $100,000 to as much as $1 million. While the firm is sector-agnostic in its approach to investment, Dusek disclosed that it would not invest in startups that cannot scale.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we look at is the size of the addressable market. So how big is the problem you\u2019re trying to address, and how big could you be?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe quality of the team is another factor that Enygma Ventures considers, with Dusek revealing that they like to see proof that founders have created value. Since opening its doors in 2019, the firm has invested in over 12 women-led startups, including Adbot, Koa Academy, Candor, Premier Credit, Play Sense, and Lupiya.\n\nBiggest mistakes entrepreneurs make\n\nAn entrepreneur\u2019s path is filled with uncertainty. Many of the problems they face are unanticipated or not taught in schools. Consequently, they are likely to make quite a few mistakes. Dusek shared a few that she has seen in her time.\n\nBuilding a venture-backed business means working to meet certain milestones, and Dusek revealed that many early-stage founders are not clear on what these milestones should be.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge with early-stage founders is recognising what your major milestones are. We talk a lot about the valley of death, which is this early-stage era in a startup\u2019s life where it\u2019s very easy for startups to crash and burn and die, or they make it to the next level.\n\n\u201cThe big challenge for startups is how to manage their available cash and get to the next level because if you\u2019re a company that\u2019s taking on venture capital in the early stages, the likelihood is that you\u2019re going to raise more capital to keep growing,\u201d she noted.\n\nThe next frontiers in Africa\n\nWhile there are quite a few factors responsible for the low level of funding that women get, my conversations with various founders and investors suggest that one major factor is that there are not enough women building scalable businesses. Venture capital is, in many ways, a numbers game, and the more women there are building companies that investors like, the higher the chances of women receiving investments.\n\nSo, what industries does Dusek want to see more women play in? Pretty much every industry that can drive economic development in Africa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see more women building any kind of business. I think we\u2019ve got a few frontiers to move the continent forward, and I\u2019d love to see more women pioneering. I think we have huge opportunities in education, healthcare, financial services, and almost anything where we are trying to raise the standard of living for millions.\u201d\n\nIn the early 2000s, the growth of the African middle class and mobile phone penetration, amongst other developments, gave birth to the term \u201cAfrica rising.\u201d Yet, most African countries have failed to live up to the hype. However, a few people still hold out hope that the new crop of entrepreneurs can spearhead the development of Africa.\n\nDusek believes that African economies have a distinct advantage as they do not have to make bite-sized changes but could leapfrog certain developments.\n\n\u201cI am super passionate about Africa\u2019s ability to lead. I feel like so often, we wait for the world to allow us to come to their party, and Africa is at this moment where she has to lead and build her own future, and that\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nVenture capital can be complicated, but Enygma Ventures wants to demystify it. Prospective founders can head over to the website, where an eligibility quiz helps both parties to determine if they\u2019re a good fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "For the first time in six years, activity in Nigeria\u2019s wholesale and retail trade sector grew in 2021, according to data by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nAccording to the GDP report released Thursday by the NBS, the trade sector grew 8.62 percent.\n\nBefore now, it had contracted by 8.49 percent, 0.38 percent, 0.63 percent, 1.05 percent, and 0.24 percent in 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\n\nAlso, the growth rate in 2021 is the highest since 2012 (9.61%).\n\n\u201cThe positive growth can be attributed to the low base effect, full reopening of the economy and the removal of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, which has made activities in the trade sector to be much easier leading to its recovery,\u201d Ayorinde Akinloye, a consumer analyst at United Capital plc, says.\n\nCommenting in the same vein, Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, notes that the recovery shows that businesses and economic activities have improved in the sector\n\n\u201cBut despite the recovery, I am still bothered because the structural challenges such as high cost of foreign exchanges, weak demand, logistics issues, etc. still linger in the sector,\u201d Adewale states.\n\nThe report also highlights that the country\u2019s overall GDP grew by 3.98 percent (year-on-year) in Q4 \u20182021, showing a sustained positive growth for the fifth quarter since the recession witnessed in 2020 when output contracted by -6.10 percent and -3.62 percent in Q2 and Q3 of 2020 under the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe fourth quarter growth indicates a steady economic recovery accounting for an annual growth of 3.40 percent in 2021,\u201d it states.\n\nIn terms of contribution to GDP, the trade sector contributed 15.66 percent, higher than the 15.46 percent it represented in the previous year, and higher than the 14.93 percent recorded in Q3 \u20182021.\n\nTrade, which is the second biggest sector by output production, can be likened as the barometer of consumer purchasing power. The higher the level of consumption, the better the sector performs.\n\nAnd due to this, the sector has been touted by economists as an important tool in the quest for development as it contributes roughly 15-16 percent to the GDP.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s private sector sets aside N100bn to fight insecurity\n\nBut in Africa\u2019s biggest economy, it had been in and out of negative territory since 2016 over myriad challenges like macroeconomic volatility, rapid naira\u2019s depreciation, weak purchasing power, and household incomes.\n\nRecently, a report by FBNQuest shows that Nigeria\u2019s real household consumption as a proportion of GDP rose to 76 percent in 2021, the highest level since 2010. According to the report, the surge led to a fast recovery post-pandemic for Nigeria\u2019s consumer\u2019s industry.\n\nAdditionally, a 2021 Global Retail Development Index (GRDI) reported that the country\u2019s total retail sales rose to $108 billion after it had been trending south, falling to $105 billion in 2019 from $109 billion in 2017, $125 billion in 2016 and $135 billion in 2015.\n\nAnalysts at Kearney, a global management consultancy firm, said the Nigerian economy is making a steady recovery from COVID-19.\n\nAlso, Uchenna Uzo, consumer expert and faculty director at Lagos Business School, says people have started coming out more and they have been able to spend on other items beyond the discretionary ones, noting, \u201cE-commerce has also made it possible to increase the portfolio of what people buy.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n1 \u201c Wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise\u201d Prov. 20:1\n\nAlcohol has turned many in our street to be stupefied. They become object of ridicules and mockery. When alcohol makes them rage they find themselves in a state of extreme anger which in itself is uncontrollable like a mad man. That is why any one who is a new creature cannot go by it nor be deceived by it.\n\nSatan has his strategies; he teaches those who have not given their lives totally to Christ two words to swallow: \u201cDrink moderately\u201d or sometimes: \u201cdrinkbut not drunk\u201d that is Satan\u2019s strategy. He will not tell his disciples do not drink at all. He knows that would keep them entirely from strong drink from alcohol although he knew what that Angel of God told Manoah\u2019s wife: \u201cthou art barren and bears not: but thou shelf conceive, and tear a son. Now therefore, beware, I pray thee and drink not wine or strong drink, and eat not any Maclean thing.\u201d Judges 13:3-4 she obeyed God. But Eve did not obey God. Manoah\u2019s wife did not allow any suggestibility from Satan. Satan would have been capable of suggesting to Manoah\u2019s wife to stick to alcohol but should drink moderately so as not to cause any miscarriage or harm to the child in the womb.\n\nMany people have fallen because they listened to Satan\u2019s suggesting. And he brings his suggestions to people in a subtle way.\n\n2.In a new life one cannot be deceived by Satan. \u201cDrink a little, drink moderately\u201d. That is Satan\u2019s subtle way of opening the door of alcoholism to those who have not totally surrendered to Christ for a new life, for to be a new creature, for to allow old things to pass away and to allow one to be born again. So Jesus was blunt in telling Nichodemus the truth, the gospel truth: \u201cExcept a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\u201d John 3:3.\n\nMany have been deceived into alcohol because they see Priests and Pastors who drink alcohol. The other day I was with some one who still opposed to doing away withalcohol entirely. He was gladdened and satisfied in his heart that Archbishop so and so was drinking alcohol; Bishop so, so and so, mentioning them by their names were drinking alcohol; that Provost so, so and so was drinking alcohol going by names; Cannon so, so and so going by their names were still with alcohol; that Venerable so, so and so going by their names were drinking alcohol; that it was only the present Bishop so, so mentioning his name that preached to his ministers, priests that they should forsake alcohol entirely but that some of the priests were still in alcohol secretly. That was one in his church narrating what he knew. Another could also narrate what goes on in his church concerning alcohol. We can see what great havoc that can be caused when people looking at their leaders see what they do or hear what they say.\n\nMany hundreds, many thousands, many millions have fallen into sin by what they see their leaders do. It is pathetic, disturbing and heart breaking. You look at this scripture: \u201cBut they also have erred throughwine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the Priests and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink\u2026.. Alltables are full of vomit and blitheness so that there is no place clean\u201d. Isaiah 28:7-8.\n\n3.Let those who delight in alcohol forsake their alcoholism and accept Jesus Christ and never seeking any hiding place in the bad examples of their leaders:\u201cmany pastors have destroyed my vineyard and \u2026\u201d Jer. 12:10. What you have to do now if you still drink alcohol, is to come truly to Christ and surrender your life to him and ask for a new life. He will surely do that for you. Be wise and not be deceived into alcohol.\n\nThere is no drunkard throughout all ages that ever agrees that he was at any time drunk. And there is no one in drunkenness that ever agrees that he is a drunkard.\n\nSatan has not relented in his ministrations. To you; he has not relented in whispering to you in his subtle way that you will be in a happy mood when you are in alcohol. Be ware of his suggestibility it is capable of pulling you out of the Christian way. If is capable of removing God\u2019s word from you and replacing it with deceit and unbeliever.\n\nRemember that all that God would use would be filled with the Holy Spiritand not with alcohol or strong drink. Paul was one; Peter, John, Stephen etc were filled with the Holy Spirit. Ask Jesus today to fill you with the Holy Spirit and there will be a change. Remember Hab.2:15\u201cwoe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink\u2026\u201d The end was that the neighbour became naked.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

He said that I don\u2019t want him to become a governor but he is already a governor. What else does he want?\u201d he inquired.\n\n\u201cI am now different from what I used to be when I was a governor because I served wholeheartedly. I\u2019m chubbier now. I campaigned passionately for him under the rain, he is now my enemy. I begged him for two years and even sent people to him. He refused. Everything we did together for eight years, he has destroyed.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on why he is supporting Alhaji. Moshood Adeoti, his former secretary instead of governor Oyetola, Aregbesola said Oyetola has betrayed the confidence he reposed in him, and it was time for a real progressive and a party man.\n\nBoasting that Adeoti will emerge victoriously on Saturday as the party\u2019s flagbearer, he said, \u201cHe (Oyetola) will not return for second term. 2+2=4. This Saturday\u2019s election will determine his date. The party has already said that we should conduct election after four years.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not a sin to contest for a position in a democratic government, the constitution of the party stipulated that after four years we can change our candidate, but if he abides by the tenet of the party, we will support him for another term but if we see that he is doing things against the interest of the party, it the duty of the leaders and party members to vote against such person at the primary.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince Oyetola assumed office, he has waged war against me as if I once harmed him. He claimed that I did not want him to emerge as governor, I told him that I heard him and now he is the governor, what else is the problem?\n\n\u201cHe thought he can destroy me through my work, nobody was pushing him, he is pushing himself. He deliberately toed that path. He wagged war against me. He refused to listen to my please until he got rid of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I observed that he would not listen, I called people together that they should start telling people that progressives family must not spoil.\n\n\u201cWe are the ones that bore the flag of this party, we fought for it since 2004. The owner cannot stand while his possession is destroyed. Those people who don\u2019t know how we build the party, are unpredictable.\u201d",

We are glad that they reworked the bill and the drafting errors might have been resolved. We hope that there are no errors and there are no cross-referencing gaps.\n\n\u201cNow that it has been transmitted, we hope that the president will assent to the bill on time because we are running out of time.

The Bill can afterwards be revisited and amended again if compelling reasons emerge to do so, either before or after the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cIn other words, IPAC is of the standpoint that under no circumstances or pretext must we throw away the grains with the chaff which will be the case if the Electoral Act, for reasons of some clauses in it, is thrown away in its entirety,\u201d Sani added.\n\nINEC had earlier said that it could not issue guidelines for the 2023 general elections if the electoral legal framework was not ready.\n\nEven though the commission could not respond to inquiry yesterday, the INEC chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, had said that the commission would not release the 2023 general elections timetable until the Electoral Act Amendment Bill was signed into law.\n\nHe made the comment during a consultative meeting with political parties in Abuja last month\n\n\u201cAs soon as it is signed into law, the commission will quickly release the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 general election based on the new law,\u201d Yakubu told heads of political parties during a meeting on January 18, 2022.\n\nLEADERSHIP Friday reports that with INEC required to issue a notice of election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for an election, if Buhari acts on the bill after February 22, 2022, INEC may have no option than to postpone the 2023 presidential election to a later date.",

          "text": "Poised to improve electricity supply to rural communities in the country, the federal government has signed Interconnected Mini-grid Acceleration Scheme (IMAS) award grant agreement with eight indigenous solar mini-grid developers for the development of 23 mini-grids across 11 States of the federation.\n\nThe project is expected to generate a 5.4-kilowatt peak to connect about 27,600 households and impact over 138,000 Nigerians in two years. The \u20ac9.3 million project is coordinated by the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) with support from the European Union and the German government through the Nigerian Energy Support Programme.\n\nSpeaking at the grant award signing ceremony, Minister of State for Power, Goddy Jedy-Agba, said he was pleased with the development which is geared towards achieving the country\u2019s vision of generating at least, 30, 000 megawatts of electricity by 2030.\n\nThe minister who commended the management of REA for their efforts and actions towards ensuring power reaches the off-grid communities in the country, said the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari is always open to opportunities that will achieve the acceleration of electricity in Nigeria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe maintained that \u201caccording to the developed National Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Policy, the vision 30:30:30 aims at achieving 30,000 Mega Watts of electricity by the year 2030, with renewable energy contributing 30 per cent of the energy mix. To achieve this, Nigeria will have to construct over a thousand mini-grids of 100 Killowatts\u201d.\n\nWhile admitting that government cannot achieve the target alone, he however, said that it was important to continue to find creative and innovative ways to achieve it, and one of which is through collaborating with development partners and the private sector.\n\n\u201cWe understand that one of the major bottlenecks for the private sector\u2019s involvement is financing, hence, the reason the NESP and REA have worked closely to develop and implement the Interconnected Mini-grid Acceleration Scheme.\n\nThe eight local solar mini-grid developers, Acob Lighting Technology Limited, Gve Projects, Nayo Tropical Technology Limited, Rubitec Nigeria Limited, Darway Coast Nigeria Limited, Havenhill Synergy Limited, Sosa-Protergia Joint Development Company Limited, and A4&T Power Solutions Limited will receive in-kind grants through REA with support of the European Union and the German Government within the framework of the NESP.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThese eight solar mini-grid developers will develop 23 mini-grids across eleven states which include, Zamfara, Niger, Plateau, Kwara, Kogi, Osun, Ogun, Lagos, Delta, Anambra, and Cross River, the indigenous developers\u201d, he added.\n\nEarlier, the Managing Director of REA, Engr. Ahmad Salihijo Ahmad said that the scheme is aimed at bridging the funding gap which is affecting indigenous developers in the renewable energy sector.\n\nAhmad said that \u201cit is our hope that the signatures we put down today in these documents set a precedent for the new and improved power and energy sector in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs an agency, we encourage investors to explore the solar mini-grid sector. However, one major constraint to this is usually financing. This is why the Rural Electrification Agency, with the support of NESP, is working together to alleviate this bottleneck.\n\n\u201cWe do this by providing in-kind grants to selected mini-grid developers on favourable and encouraging terms as contained in the Grant Agreement\u201d.\n\nThe MD explained that \u201cthe main objective of the intervention is to design and test a tender model for interconnected solar mini-grids, invariably leading to the foundation of the Scheme. The wonderful thing about the iMAS project is that we have ensured that all the developers are Nigerians. This is to say that the Nigerian energy sector has come a long way from what it used to be and we are proud of this\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHead of programme, NESP, Benjamin Duke assured that his team will continue to work to build investors\u2019 confidence in the sector by developing an accurate electricity market intelligence that will provide investors with accurate data about the country\u2019s electricity needs.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari Thursday in Brussels, Belgium called on European leaders as partners in promoting democracy and good governance to lend their weight behind measures put in place by the African Union to stem the tide of unconstitutional leadership changes, rearing its head again on the continent.\n\nBuhari made this known in his contribution to the roundtable discussion on Peace, Security, and Governance at the ongoing 6th EU-AU Summit.\n\nHe qually stressed the need to nip the root causes of extremism, conflicts, and tensions in Africa at inception.\n\n\u201cAfrica has continued to witness different waves of violent extremism, community- based conflicts and inter-ethnic tensions, notably in rural areas. For many decades, our continent has been deprived of political stability and socio-economic development due to terrorism and violent extremism.\n\n\u201cMore worrisome is the current state of democracy on the continent, which has become a great source of concern to many of us, with increasing cases of unconstitutional change of governments across the continent, particularly in West Africa. This is in addition to the challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe African Union has often responded to these challenges through its different structures, such as the African Peace and Security Architecture and the African Governance Architecture.\n\n\u201cThrough enhanced collaboration with our development partners, especially the European Union, we can identify areas of cooperation for quick and substantive results.\n\n\u201cAs leaders and policymakers, it is important for our partnership to place priority on tackling the root causes of conflicts in Africa, as well as taking measures in safeguarding peace and security if we are to achieve the African Union Agenda 2063.\n\n\u201cWe also call for stronger support from the European Union in the condemnation and imposition of weighty sanctions on countries that engage in unconstitutional change of governments, as well as manipulation of constitutions in favor of extension of term limits,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Nigerian leader added that it was imperative to ensure that election processes in Africa have outcomes that truly reflect the wishes of the electorate, as to go contrary to these is courting instability.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwe have a responsibility to reduce conflicts that stem from lack of good governance, unaccountability, corruption and social exclusion.\n\n\u201cFree, fair, credible and transparent elections remain crucial elements in ensuring peace and security and promoting constitutional order, democracy and inclusive governance on the continent.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore imperative for our partnership to also focus on strengthening election processes in Africa and prevent interference to influence the process and outcomes of elections.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari also called for the concretization and transformation of promises of cooperation made by the European leaders to actions.\n\n\u201cI wish to underscore the need to convert our pledges on political cooperation in the area of peace, security and conflict prevention into concrete initiatives such as joint field missions, shared understanding and analysis on crisis situations, as well as joint early action and swift implementation of agreed positions.\n\n\u201cThe movement and operation of terrorists and violent extremist groups along the Sahel could better be addressed through an improved Continental Early Warning Mechanism. Consequently, we believe there is a clear need to strengthen our cooperation on security with the European Union, particularly through improved intelligence sharing and acquisition of military equipment and hardware.\n\n\u201cWe invite the EU to upscale its support for the G5 Sahel and the Multinational Joint Taskforce in the Lake Chad Region as we strive to further degrade the Boko-Haram insurgents and their Islamic State in the West Africa Province counterparts. Africa also looks up to Europe for enhanced support in the area of combating Illicit financial flows and terrorism funding that aid the activities of terrorists and violent extremist groups.\u201d\n\nHe called for all hands to be on deck to ensure that Africa\u2019s Blue Economy Agenda for development is realized.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI must emphasize the importance of expanding regional and international cooperation on ocean governance, on the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing as well as on maritime security, including piracy, illicit trafficking and other maritime crimes and threats as reflected in the 2050 Africa Integrated Maritime Strategy.\u201d",

          "title": "Why Nigerians Won\u2019t Forget Buhari \u2014 Femi Adesina",
          "text": "Nigerians would never forget Muhammadu Buhari, says Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, if only for the Second Niger Bridge, which is now under construction.\n\nAdesina stated this in his weekly article titled \u201cINDABOSKI! IF ONLY FOR 2ND NIGER BRIDGE, THIS COUNTRY WON\u2019T EVER FORGET BUHARI.\u201d\n\nHe added that no matter how Buhari\u2019s critics may perceive the administration, Nigerians will never forget the President following his strives in infrastructure despite the fact that the country \u201cearns far less than it used to\u201d.\n\n\n\nIn the article, Adesina also narrated how Shehu Shagari, Ibrahim Babangida, Olusegun Obasanjo, and Goodluck Jonathan allegedly gave the people of the South-East and South-South empty promises only for Buhari to get the job done without boasting.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cThis year, the long wait for Godot will come to an end. The second bridge over the River Niger will be commissioned, and put to use. And what a dream come true it would be.\n\n\n\n\u201cLast December, a friend had traveled from Lagos to the South East for the Christmas holidays. When he had spent six hours on the River Niger bridge, a journey which should take less than five minutes, since the bridge is only 1.6 kilometers long, he called me in frustration. He was almost bursting a blood vessel.\n\n\n\n\u201cI consoled and comforted him, and added for good effect: \u201cThis is the last time you and other travelers would be stranded on that bridge. By next Christmas, there would be two bridges in operation, and it would be a jolly good ride.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe said a resounding amen, and went off the line. What trauma and travails users of the River Niger bridge have passed through. Built in 1965, the artery between the South East, South South, and the rest of the country has become grossly inadequate, and a torture to navigate at peak seasons. There was a year travelers even spent the night on the bridge.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a long history to the building of a second bridge over the River Niger, and it had over the years become a tool of false promises, lies and propaganda. When politicians want the votes of South Easterners as elections approach, they go and offload shovels, pick axes, wheelbarrows, cutlasses and others at the site, as if that is what is required to build a bridge of that magnitude. After they\u2019ve got the votes, they come to remove their miserable implements. Goodbye basket, I\u2019ve carried all my apples. The People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) did it for 16 years, building the bridge with their mouths.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe first recollection was during the campaign for the 1979 presidential election. Candidate of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN), Alhaji Shehu Shagari, went to the South East, and promised a Second Niger bridge. That was all it was. A promise, though the NPN government lasted from 1979 to 1983.\n\n\n\n\u201cThen came the military regimes headed by Muhammadu Buhari, which lasted only 20 months, that of Ibrahim Babangida, which endured for eight years, Ernest Shonekan-led Interim National Government, 84 days, Sani Abacha, five years, and Abdulsalami Abubakar, 11 months. Nothing was heard about the bridge.\n\n\n\n\u201cUnder Babangida, an alarm was raised about the deteriorating condition of the bridge. Ever the master of artifice and sleight of hand, the then military president challenged Nigerian engineers to design a new bridge. They did! End of story. Then came Olusegun Obasanjo, a former military head of state, as civilian President. He promised to build the bridge. It didn\u2019t happen in eight years.\n\n\n\n\u201cAbout five days before he left office, Obasanjo flagged off the project, to cost N58.6 billion, and handed it to his successor, Umaru Yar\u2019Adua. No action in the three years that the administration lasted. Understandably so, for Yar\u2019Adua was infirm.\n\n\n\n\u201cThen came Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, who even at a point added Azikiwe to his name. He promised Heaven on earth, saying he was a South easterner, and he would build the bridge. During a Town Hall meeting on August 30, 2012, in the region, he said what would he claim he had done for his Igbo brethren, if he didn\u2019t build the bridge.\n\n\n\n\u201cLater, Azikiwe disappeared from Jonathan\u2019s name, and the Second Niger bridge disappeared with it. All that happened in the about six years that the administration lasted was a Federal Executive Council approval for final planning and design of the bridge. All motion, no movement. And then came the man from Daura, a Fulani, with no affinity with the South East. He didn\u2019t make promises, he didn\u2019t boast. He just went to work quietly.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom September 1, 2018, without fanfare or swashbuckling, action started on the Second Niger bridge. Babatunde Raji Fashola, Minister for Works and Housing, was the chief executioner. Doggedly, he and his principal set to work. And here we are today. What has defeated many military and civilian administrations is now reality in our country.\n\n\n\n\u201cI will never forget the day I traveled to Onitsha for a private event. I was on the same flight from Lagos to Onitsha with His Royal Majesty, the Obi of Onitsha. When we alighted, and were walking towards the arrival hall of the airport, I went to pay my courtesies to the distinguished monarch. He greeted me warmly, asked after President Buhari, and told me to pass his appreciation for the work being done on the Second Niger bridge.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd that is the thing to do. We must appreciate the ramrod straight man from Daura for succeeding where many other leaders before him had failed. Where there is a will, there is a way.\n\n\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari has taken up many major infrastructure works, most of which would be due for commissioning before he exits next year May. Roads, rail, airports, bridges, many others. If only for the Second Niger bridge, Nigerians will never forget Muhammadu Buhari. But then, you can add Loko-Oweto bridge, Bodo-Bonny road, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Enugu-Port Harcourt, Abuja to Kaduna and Kano, AKK Pipelines, rail network across the country, and many others. Surely, this country will always remember Muhammadu Buhari for good, no matter how revisionists have tried to shroud the successes with only talk of insecurity ravaging the country. While the security challenges are being met frontally, infrastructure proceeds apace. It takes determination and doggedness.\n\n\n\n\u201cIndaboski!

          "title": "Nigeria, Five Other African Countries To Begin Production Of Covid Vaccines \u2013 WHO",
          "text": "Nigeria and five other African countries have been chosen to begin production of COVID-19 vaccines, with the continent having had limited access to jabs.\n\n\u201cToday I\u2019m delighted to announce the first six African countries that will receive technology from the hub to produce their own mRNA vaccines: Egypt, Kenya Nigeria, Senegal South Africa, and Tunisia,\u201d Director-General of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Ghebreyesus, announced on Friday.\n\nAccording to the WHO, they were selected as the first recipients of technology from the organisation\u2019s global mRNA vaccine hub, in a push to ensure the African continent can make its own jabs to fight COVID and other diseases.\n\nRead Also: BioNTech To Ship Mobile COVID-19 Vaccine Labs To Africa\n\n\u201cI was honoured to visit the Hub last week. And it\u2019s already producing results, with Afrigen\u2019s announcement that it has produced its own mRNA vaccine, based on publicly-available information about the composition of an existing vaccine,\u201d Ghebreyesus said.\n\n\u201cWe expect clinical trials to start in the 4th quarter of this year, with approval expected in 2024. We expect the benefits of this initiative will extend far beyond #COVID19, by creating a platform for vaccines against other diseases including malaria and tuberculosis\u201d.\n\n\u201cWHO will work with the companies and the government in each country to develop a roadmap for training and production, based on their needs and capacities.\n\n\u201cThank you all, and we look forward to working with all of you to make this project a success, for the healthier, safer and fairer Africa\u201d.\n\nAccording to the WHO boss, no other event like the Covid-19 pandemic has shown that reliance on a few companies to supply global public goods is limiting, and dangerous.\n\nHe, therefore, stressed that the best way to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage is to significantly increase the capacity of all regions to manufacture the health products they need.\n\nTedros has continually called for equitable access to vaccines in order to beat the pandemic, and rails against the way wealthy nations have hogged doses, leaving Africa lagging behind other continents in the global vaccination effort.\n\nA ceremony marking the mRNA tech transfer announcement was held Friday in Brussels at the summit between the European Union and the African Union.\n\nEuropean Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cWe have been talking a lot about producing mRNA vaccines in Africa. But this goes even beyond. This is mRNA technology designed in Africa, led by Africa and owned by Africa.\u201d\n\nSelf-reliance\n\nCurrently, only one per cent of the vaccines used in Africa are produced on the continent of some 1.3 billion people.\n\nThe WHO set up a global mRNA technology transfer hub in South Africa last year to support manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines.\n\nThe global hub\u2019s role is to ensure that manufacturers in those nations have the know-how to make mRNA vaccines at scale and according to international standards.\n\nAs used in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines, mRNA technology provokes an immune response by delivering genetic molecules containing the code for key parts of a pathogen into human cells.\n\nPrimarily set up to address the Covid-19 pandemic, the global hub has the potential to expand manufacturing capacity for other vaccines and products, such as insulin to treat diabetes, cancer medicines and, potentially, vaccines for diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV.\n\nThe scheme\u2019s ultimate goal is to spread capacity for national and regional production to all health technologies.\n\n\u2018Mutual Respect\u2019\n\nThe WHO said it would work with the first six countries chosen to develop a roadmap of training and support so they can start producing vaccines as soon as possible.\n\nTraining will begin in March.\n\nThe South African hub is already producing mRNA vaccines at laboratory scale and is currently scaling up towards commercial scale.\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Friday\u2019s announcement \u201cmeans mutual respect, mutual recognition of what we can all bring to the party, investment in our economies, infrastructure investment and, in many ways, giving back to the continent\u201d.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said supporting African health sovereignty was one of the key goals of starting up local production, \u201cto empower regions and countries to fend for themselves, during crises, and in peace time\u201d.\n\nMore than 10.4 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered around the world, with nearly 62 percent of the global population having received at least one shot.\n\nHowever, just 11.3 per cent of Africans had been fully immunised by the start of February.\n\nIn Nigeria, many are yet to be vaccinated despite efforts by authorities to make citizens get the jab.\n\nOn Thursday, the country recorded 45 new cases of the virus, bringing its total number of confirmed cases to 254,182.\n\n230,530 cases are, however, said to have recovered, while 3,141 deaths have been recorded in 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nThe 45 new cases were reported from eight states \u2013 Lagos (18), Cross River (7), FCT (7), Oyo (5), Kano (3), Nasarawa (3), Ekiti (1) and Rivers (1).\n\nAcross the world, the vaccine continues to rage on.\n\nHere are some of the latest developments on the impact of the virus:\n\nCanadian Police Deployed\n\nCanadian police mass in the capital, readying to clear a trucker-led anti-Covid curb protest that has choked Ottawa\u2019s streets and provoked the government to call on rarely-used emergency powers.\n\nIsrael to end green pass\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett announces the requirement to show proof of coronavirus vaccination to enter various sites will soon end, as the wave of infections wanes.\n\nWorld \u2018better prepared\u2019\n\nThe world is becoming \u201cbetter prepared\u201d to deal with future variants of the virus, the CEO and co-founder of German vaccine-maker BioNTech tells AFP, as the company works on an Omicron-specific shot.\n\nJapan eases strict border bar\n\nJapan will ease its strict virus border rules to allow students and businesspeople into the country from March, but tourists will still be barred.\n\nPortugal to lift most Covid rules\n\nPortugal will no longer require people to present a health pass when going to restaurants and hotels, the government says, without providing a fixed date. Proof of vaccination is still necessary to enter the country.\n\nSwiss president tests positive\n\nOn the day Switzerland lifts almost all remaining coronavirus restrictions, the government announces President Ignazio Cassis has tested positive.\n\nCovid-19 pill\n\nA South Africa regulator says it has approved the use of Merck\u2019s Covid-19 pill for high-risk adults.\n\nUS jabs for Egypt, Nigeria\n\nThe United States ships nearly 5.2 million doses of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine to Egypt and Nigeria, a White House official tells AFP.\n\nDjokovic ready for Dubai comeback\n\nTennis world number one Novak Djokovic prepares for his comeback in Dubai, after a coronavirus vaccine row kept the Serb from defending his Australian Open title.\n\nAussie tennis star probed\n\nAustralian tennis player Alex de Minaur hits back at allegations he is being investigated over the purchase of false Covid passes, insisting: \u201cI have a completely valid, accurate and true vaccination record.\u201d\n\nOver 5.8 million dead\n\nCoronavirus has killed at least 5,848,104 people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, according to an AFP tally compiled from official sources Thursday.\n\nThe US has recorded the most Covid deaths with 928,519, followed by Brazil with 640,774, and India 510,413.\n\nTaking into account excess mortality linked to Covid-19, the WHO estimates the true death toll could be two to three times higher.",

          "text": "A US judge ruled Thursday that former president Donald Trump and his eldest children must testify under oath in New York\u2019s civil probe into alleged fraud at his family business.\n\nThe ruling is the latest legal blow to the 75-year-old as he fights numerous cases that threaten to complicate any bid for another run at the White House in 2024.\n\nThe Trumps have repeatedly tried to shut down the investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who last month said she had uncovered \u201csignificant evidence\u201d of fraudulent or misleading practices at the Trump Organization.\n\nFollowing more than two hours of oral arguments, state judge Arthur Engoron rejected a plea by Trump, Donald Jr and Ivanka to quash subpoenas issued by James in December.\n\nHe ordered the trio to sit for depositions with James\u2019s office within 21 days. The Trumps are expected to appeal.\n\nTheir lawyers argued that the subpoenas in the civil case were an attempt by James to grab evidence for a parallel criminal investigation into the Trump Organization that she is involved with.\n\nThey argued that James was trying to bypass a New York state law that grants immunity to witnesses that appear before a grand jury in criminal cases.\n\nEngoron said their argument \u201ccompletely misses the mark,\u201d noting that neither the Manhattan district attorney, which is running the criminal investigation, nor James\u2019s office have ordered the Trumps to appear before a grand jury.\n\nIn his ruling, Engoron added that the Trumps could invoke their Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate themselves during questioning in the civil case.\n\nHe noted that Trump\u2019s son Eric had pleaded the fifth \u201cmore than 500 times\u201d during a deposition for James\u2019s investigation in October 2020.\n\nEngoron also rejected Trump\u2019s claim that the inquiry by James, a Democrat, is politically motivated.\n\nFollowing the ruling, Trump\u2019s lawyer slammed James\u2019s investigation as \u201cyet another politically motivated witch-hunt,\u201d one of the ex-leader\u2019s favourite refrains.\n\n\u201cThe court clearly had its mind made up and had no interest in engaging in impartial discourse on this critically important issue,\u201d attorney Alina Habba said in a statement.\n\n\u2018Dereliction of duty\u2019\n\nHe ruled that the motive for the case was not \u201cpersonal animus\u201d but \u201csworn congressional testimony by (former Trump lawyer) Michael Cohen that the respondents were \u2018cooking the books.'\u201d\n\nHe said that for James not to have investigated the allegations or subpoenaed the Trumps would have been \u201ca blatant dereliction of duty.\u201d\n\nJames hailed the ruling, tweeting: \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d\n\nShe said in January that her civil inquiry had found that the Trump Organization fraudulently overvalued multiple assets to secure loans and then undervalued them to minimize taxes.\n\nIf James finds evidence of financial misconduct, she can sue the Trump Organization for damages but cannot file criminal charges.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney\u2019s probe into possible financial crimes and insurance fraud is very similar, however.\n\nIn that case, the Trump Organization and its long-serving finance chief, Allen Weisselberg, pleaded not guilty in a New York court to 15 felony fraud and tax evasion charges in July last year.\n\nHis trial is due to begin in the middle of this year.\n\nAt the heart of the twin, investigations are a decade\u2019s worth of financial statements that Trump\u2019s longtime accountants Mazar\u2019s said last week were unreliable.\n\nMazar\u2019s announced it was ending its relationship with Trump in part because of James\u2019s findings.\n\nTrump has so far kept Americans guessing about whether he intends to seek the Republican nomination again.\n\nIn Washington, he has been trying to prevent a congressional probe into the January 6 attack by his supporters on the US Capitol from accessing White House records related to that day.\n\nIn further bad news for the ex-president Thursday, a congressional committee asked a government agency to terminate the lease for one of his hotels in Washington before the Trump Organization can sell it.\n\n-AFP",

          "text": "Canadian police are poised to clear out on Friday hundreds of truck drivers from Ottawa who have staged a three-week-long protest against pandemic restrictions that has crippled the capital and prompted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to assume emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years.\n\nThe drivers, joined by thousands of demonstrators and some 400 vehicles, turned the streets around Parliament into a noisy party zone since first arriving on Jan. 28, in what has become one of the worst crises to hit Trudeau since he took power in 2015. Police made a handful of arrests Thursday evening, including of Chris Barber, one of the main fundraisers and organizers, after authorities said action was imminent. Barber went without resistance after police told him he was being arrested for mischief. \u201cWe absolutely are committed to end this unlawful demonstration. We have the plan, we have the commitment, we have the resources,\u201d interim police chief Steve Bell told reporters on Thursday. Police will set up a perimeter with 100 checkpoints around downtown to stop people without legitimate reason from entering, he said.\n\n\u201cThis weekend will look very different than the past three weekends,\u201d he added. Previous chief Peter Sloly quit this week amid residents\u2019 fury about what they saw as police inaction. The truckers\u2019 protests started against vaccine mandates for cross-border drivers, a measure in place in the United States, too. But slowly it spread across Canada and morphed into an anti-government movement. Protesters blocked several land crossings with the United States, including the busiest, the Ambassador Bridge which connects to Detroit, for six days, hurting both economies.\n\nCalling the blockades a threat to democracy, Trudeau invoked emergency measures on Monday giving his government temporary powers to end the unrest. Government officials said they were worried about extremists causing violence.\n\n\u201cEnd the mandates, give us our rights and this is over,\u201d said Chris Dacey on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ll all go back to our families.\u201d The border blockades turned the pressure on Trudeau to act swiftly, and U.S. President Joe Biden asked him to use federal powers. Many protesters on Parliament Hill said they would not leave until their demands were met. \u201cThe illegal blockades and occupations have to stop and the borders have to remain open,\u201d Trudeau told legislators on Thursday as Parliament started debate on the Emergencies Act, which needs to be passed within seven days of an announcement. RelatedStories No Content Available\n\nBut the official opposition Conservative Party says there was no need for the Emergencies Act, especially since the border blockades are over. Conservative Parliamentarian Jeremy Patzer told the House of Commons on Thursday that people around the world were alarmed to see Trudeau \u201ccome down on peaceful protesters with a sledgehammer.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari has lamented the mass migration of African youth to Europe, saying it drains the continent\u2019s talent pool, while provoking political crises in Europe.\n\nThe president stated this in an article he penned to mark the participation of Nigeria at the ongoing 6th EU-AFRICA summit in Brussels, Belgium.\n\nIn the article published in Politico, an online/offline magazine which is the most influential publication for the EU/ in Brussels, Buhari noted that despite its best efforts, Europe would not find a sustainable remedy to this problem by further reinforcing its Fortress Europe approach.\n\nAccording to him, instead, more opportunities must be created for Africans at home, providing alternatives to the decision to take a life-threatening boat journey in order to seek them elsewhere.\n\nHe advised that economic relationship between the two continents must be recalibrated to focus on job creation.\n\nThe president said, \u201cBy 2050, Africa\u2019s population of 1.3 billion was set to double, making up a quarter of the world\u2019s total. My country, Nigeria, is set to double its population to 400 million by then, surpassing the United States to become the third largest nation in the world.\n\n\u201cThis means a huge youthful market right on Europe\u2019s doorstep and \u2014 with increased trade a growing middle class with money to spend. However, despite burgeoning possibility, irregular northward migration from my continent drains Africa\u2019s talent pool, while provoking political crises in the EU.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the relationship between the European Union and Africa, unfair arrangements have long been skated over for lack of alternatives.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly unsustainable, these one-sided deals have provoked calls from both sides of the Mediterranean for a partnership of equals.\n\n\u201cAt the EU-Africa Summit, leaders from across my continent will gather with their European counterparts to transform such rhetoric into substance. The EU is currently Africa\u2019s largest trading partner, and Africa is the fastest growing continent on earth. While each presents the other with great opportunities, as partners, we also share a host of problems.\n\n\u201cToday, the EU-Africa relationship must be shifted toward a new economic arrangement in order to address them. The relationship between the EU and Africa must be rebalanced to power job creation. Unfortunately, today\u2019s arrangements do just the opposite.\n\n\u201cWhere some claim preferential trade policies with the EU lend a helping hand to Africa, the real picture is far more complicated. The Everything but Arms scheme grants 32 African countries tariff-free access to Europe\u2019s protected markets. In addition to the fact that this excludes many of the continent\u2019s 54 nations, there remain barriers to Europe\u2019s markets even for countries that qualify.\n\n\u201cFor example, though agricultural subsidies to EU farmers may not be the same as external tariffs, their effects are identical: They make Africa\u2019s exports uncompetitive. More than \u20ac50 billion is ploughed into keeping European food produce cheap. \u201cWith its main export market distorted against them, African countries are deprived of foreign exchange, and investment in agriculture is stifled.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, it is clear what a new economic deal between our unions should entail: For Africa, it must offer a chance for a fundamentally new economic deal. For Europe, it must provide the chance to rid itself of a trade policy that quashes job-creation in Africa and hinders efforts to stem economic migration to Europe. The way forward is clear, the deal just needs to be struck.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

It noted that growth rate under the review period was higher than the 0.11 per cent recorded in Q4 2020 by 3.87 percentage points and lower than 4.03 per cent recorded in Q3 by 0.05 percentage points.\n\nThe NBS, nevertheless, stated that quarter-on-quarter, real GDP grew at 9.63 per cent in Q4, reflecting a higher economic activity than the preceding quarter.\n\nThe average daily oil production stood at 1.50 million barrels per day (mbpd), lower than the 1.57mbpd in Q3 and 1.56 mbpd in Q4 2020.\n\nOil growth rate stood at -8.06 per cent in real terms in Q4 and annual growth rate of -8.30 per cent in 2021. On an annual basis, oil contributed 7.24 per cent compared to 8.16 per cent in 2020.\n\nThe non-oil sector, which excluded crude petroleum and natural gas activities, recorded a growth of 4.73 per cent in real terms, an improvement from the 1.69 per cent reported in Q4 2020.\n\nThe sector recorded an annual growth of 4.44 per cent compared to -1.25 per cent in 2020.\n\nHowever, annual contribution of the non-oil sector increased to 92.76 per cent from 91.84 per cent in 2020.\n\nThe services sector contributed 55.11 per cent to the total growth while agriculture contributed 26.84 per cent to overall GDP in real terms in Q4, lower than 29.94 per cent in the preceding quarter and 26.95 per cent in Q4 2020.\n\nThe manufacturing sector contributed 8.46 per cent, lower than the 8.60 per cent lower than 8.96 per cent in Q3 and 8.98 per cent in Q4 2020.\n\nIn nominal terms, aggregate GDP stood at N49.28 trillion in Q4, higher than the N43.56 trillion in Q4 2020, and indicating a year-on-year nominal growth rate of 13.11 per cent.\n\nNominal GDP in the preceding quarter of Q3 2021 stood at N45.11 trillion, while annual nominal value in 2021 was N173.53 trillion as compared to N152.32 trillion in 2020, indicating a growth rate of 13.92 per cent.\n\nIn terms of real GDP which shows the volume of economic activities, the sum of N20.33 trillion was recorded in Q4, higher than N18.54 trillion in the preceding quarter and also by N778.91 billion compared to N19.55 trillion recorded in Q4 2020.\n\nThe nominal GDP growth rate in Q4 was higher relative to 10.07 per cent growth recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2020 but lower compared to 15.41 per cent growth recorded in the preceding quarter.\n\nHowever, in 2021 annual nominal growth stood at 13.92 per cent.\n\nAccording to the NBS, \u201cThe improvement being seen in the output growth in the last five quarters depicts a steady progress made in stemming the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated negative impact on livelihood, well-being, and the economy.\n\n\u201cGlobally, many countries have witnessed an improvement in economic performances compared to 2020 when COVID-19 was endemic. Thus, economic recovery is a gradual process that requires consistent collective efforts to improve economic activities across the institutional sectors.\n\n\u201cHowever, in Nigeria, the prospects of consolidating the recovery are glaring considering the improved economic performance over these periods of time.\u201d\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja",

          "text": "The Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) has expressed dismay over the threat by the Chairman of Senate Committee on Aviation, Senator Smart Adeyemi that foreign airlines might be invited to operate domestic service in Nigeria if local airlines do not stop incessant flight delays and cancellations.\n\nAON in a statement signed by its President and Chairman of Azman Air, Alhaji Yunusa Abdulmunaf and other airline operators, including Max Air, United Nigeria Airlines, Ibom Air, Arik Air, Aero Contractors, Air Peace, Overland Airways, Green Africa and Dana Air, said such comments by the Senate Committee Chairman only served to aggravate sentiments and sent out the wrong message to passengers and the general public.\n\nAdeyemi made the threat recently in Lagos, during a joint oversight visit by the Senate and House of Representatives Committees on Aviation to the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA).\n\nHowever, in the statement, AON explained that commercial airlines globally, Nigeria inclusive, were set up with strict adherence to flight times.\n\nThe AON noted that the schedules are put in place not only for the benefit of customers, but also to allow airlines maximise the use of their aircraft in order to meet up with their laid out targets over a period of time and ensure their safety and sustainability, adding that it is therefore not in the interest of any airline, whether in Nigeria or anywhere else, to delay or cancel flights as this has severe financial and image consequences.\n\n\u201cFor these reasons, delays and cancellations are therefore the last thing any airline wants. While flight delays and cancellations occur all over the world, it is however instructive to note that in Nigeria, 80 per cent of the causes of delays and cancellations are due to factors that are neither in the control of airlines nor caused by them,\u201d the operators said.\n\nThey also stressed that they operate in a very hostile environment with infrastructure decay and inefficiencies.\n\n\u201cThis is why AON invites the public to be aware that airlines operating in Nigeria are forced to operate in an environment that is wrought with infrastructure deficiencies that are highly disruptive to normal schedule reliability and on time performance.\n\n\u201cAny airline in the world forced to operate under the domestic Nigerian circumstances would be bogged down by delays that they have no control over,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe operators itemised the causes of flight delays to include weather and explained that due to the lack of basic navigational and visual aids at most airports across the country, airlines are forced to delay flights unnecessarily, waiting for visibility to improve either at departure or destination airports.\n\n\u201cThis is the major cause of delays in the months of October to March every year (with the harmattan dust haze and fog) and this impacts the entire system significantly.\n\n\u201cAlmost every morning, the first flights to several destinations are delayed, affecting the schedule of the airline for the rest of the day. This issue of lack of navigational and visual aids at most of the airports in the country accounts for more than 50 per cent of the delays in the system, for which airlines unfairly always take the fall.\n\n\u201cThis would easily be avoidable if the requisite infrastructure was put in place across the network of airports. Thankfully, airlines will never jeopardise safety, but will rather choose to wait for weather conditions to improve or be forced to cancel flights if the situation persists,\u201d the operators said.\n\nThe AON also identified inadequate aircraft parking space due to congested aprons \u2014 both domestic terminals in Lagos; restrictions caused by Sunset Airports, which refers to the airports without night landing facilities; delays due to very important person (VIP) movement, which is the practice of closing the airspace for security reasons to allow the president, vice president or other VIPs to either depart or arrive and frequent bird strikes and Foreign Object Damage (FOD).\n\nThey further explained that bird strikes and foreign objects damage many aircraft during landing, taxiing or takeoff at airports across the country, thereby forcing the aircraft to be parked abruptly until a replacement can be provided to operate a flight.\n\nThe operators also identified unavailability and ever rising cost of aviation fuel; unavailability of Forex for spare parts and maintenance; delays from Customs in clearing of Safety critical spare parts; poor air traffic flow; inadequate Check-in Counters and others as the major factors responsible for flight delays and cancellations.\n\nChinedu Eze",
