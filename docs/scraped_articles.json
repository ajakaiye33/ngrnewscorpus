          "title": "Don\u2019t introduce Sharia in S\u2019West, PFN warns Senate",
          "text": "THE ongoing public hearing on the amendment of the 1999 Constitution continued across the country on Thursday with a warning by the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria to the Senate to avoid surreptitious moves by some groups to introduce Sharia law to the South-West region through the on-going constitution review.\n\nThe President of PFN, Bishop Wale Oke, said in a statement issued by his Media Office on Thursday that the move was capable of adding to the numerous problems facing the country.\n\nHe urged the Senate not to succumb to such agitation which he said was capable of further plunging the country into major religious crisis.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe problems confronting our nation are enormous than wanting to create more. Sharia law is alien to our culture of religious existence in the South-West. As such, nobody should through any subterfuge, bring it in to cause crisis.\u201d\n\nS\u2019South demands power devolution, state police\n\nIn Rivers State, the South-South geopolitical zone demanded devolution of power, resource control and creation of additional states in the area.\n\nThe hearing organised for Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Cross River states by the Senate Ad-hoc Committee on Amendment of the Constitution, chaired by Senator George Sekibo, had many stakeholders from various ethnic nationalities in attendance.\n\nThe host, Nyesom Wike, who declared the hearing open, said there was urgent need for the amendment to produce a people\u2019s constitution that would guarantee devolution of powers, fiscal federalism, creation of state police, as well as strengthening of the electoral system.\n\nWike, who was represented by his deputy, Dr Ipalibo Banigo-Harry, said the amendment must allow the states to create and sustain local government councils and ensure reduction of the cost of governance at both federal and state levels.\n\n\u201cNigerians need a constitution that will give them a true sense of belonging, secure and advance their wellbeing and enable their children to aspire to actualise their potential for any office without discrimination,\u201d he said.\n\nOn its part, the Akwa Ibom State Government said the challenges plaguing the country was deeply rooted in the ground norm that held various parts of the country together.\n\nRepresented by the Director of Litigation, Bassey Ekanem, he said the Federal Government was completely overburdened, adding that the state had listed about 25 matters in the exclusive list that should be transferred to the concurrent list.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, who was represented by Senator George Sekibo, representing Rivers East, disclosed that zonal public hearing on the 1999 Constitution review adopted the bottom to top approach in order to entertain the views of stakeholders at the zonal level.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Vice-President, PFN, Apostle Zilly Aggrey, said the country needed a brand new constitution, even as he expressed fears that the ongoing selective amendment might end in futility.\n\nAggrey stated, \u201cThe PFN is firmly of the view that the review process by amending a segment of the constriction may just be another exercise in futility that cannot meet the expectations of the people.\u201d\n\nS\u2019West seeks fiscal federalism\n\nAlso, the Lagos zonal constitution hearing entered Day Two on Thursday with stakeholders reiterating calls for a total review of the constitution to reflect fiscal federalism; implementation of the Child Rights Act and Disability Act in states, local government autonomy, judicial autonomy and creation of state police.\n\nA Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Wole Olanipekun, represented by his son, advocated that judicial outcome be respected and adhered to so that the common man could feel protected and their rights protected.\n\nAccording to him, the Electoral Act should be amended to allow governorship election cases to terminate at the Supreme Court.\n\nRights activist, Femi Falana, made a large case for the poor and vulnerable, insisting that it was important to give secession agitators the confidence of peace and inclusion if they must remain.\n\nThe lawyer also advocated that the Child Rights Act enacted in 2003, and the Disability Act, be domesticated and implemented in states if the constitution review must make meaning to the common man.\n\nEx-CP declares state police anti-Igbo\n\nThere was, however, a mild drama at the Enugu Centre as Ibezimako Aghanya, a retired Commissioner of Police, declared that creation of state police would not be in Igbo interest.\n\nThe former Kogi State police commissioner said the Igbo should only support state police when state of origin was removed and replaced with state of residence, adding that \u201cotherwise if state police is created, Igbo will suffer.\n\nAghanya said, \u201cSo what I am saying, if actually we want to create a state police let us first remove state of origin in our constitution and put state of residence. With it an Igbo boy born in Lagos can join Lagos police, an Igbo boy born in Kano can join Kano police and an Igbo boy born in Sokoto can join Sokoto police.\u201d\n\nSouthern Borno alleges animals, humans drink from same source\n\nHowever, the people of Southern Borno in Borno State have lamented that the zone has been marginalised for a very long time, hence their demand for the creation of a state for the zone.\n\nThey lamented that despite their contributions to the development of the state, the region had been left to suffer with their people drinking water from the same river with their animals.\n\nThey stated these in an interview with journalists on the sidelines of their presentation on Thursday at the Zonal Senate Public Hearing on the amendment of the 1999 Constitution held in Bauchi on why they are agitating for Savannah State.\n\nCaptain Ibrahim Mshelia of the Southern Borno Global Initiative lamented that their children were learning under leaking classrooms while some studied mathematics on bare ground using their fingers.\n\nHe said, \u201cSome people have no drinking water; they drink water with animals. The same river that feeds them water for everything is the river that they feed their animals with. But in Maiduguri, there are taps, our children are still sitting on stones, inside the buildings; you can see the sun, and when it is raining, they go under trees. They are sitting on the stone.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n***Reels out achievements, future plans\n\n***Says Lagos\u2019ll witness massive infrastructural renewal in next 2 yrs\n\n***Oko-Oloyun, Idowu-Egba wooden bridges marked for construction\n\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nLagos State Governor, Bababjide Sanwo-Olu, has said the construction of the proposed Fourth Mainland Bridge, will kick off in December, 2021.\n\nRecall that the construction of the bridge is estimated to gulp $2.5 billion after it was reviewed upward from $2.2 billion.\n\nThe 4th Mainland Bridge is a proposed 38-kilometer long bridge initiative by the Lagos State Government, connecting Lagos Island by way of Lekki, Langbasa, and Baiyeku towns and across Lagos Lagoon to Itamaga in Ikorodu part. On completion of the project is expected to become the longest bridge in Africa.\n\nSanwo-Olu, disclosed this on Thursday, in his address tagged: \u201cSanwo-Olu: 731 Days and Beyond, the state of the state address, and the glimpse of the greater Lagos,\u201d at grand-finale of a month\u2019s long activities commemorating the second year anniversary of his administration in the state, held at Lagos House, Alausa, Ikeja.\n\nThe event was attended by Deputy Governor, Dr Femi Hamzat, members of the state Executive Council, All Progressives Congress, APC, Chieftains, traditional rulers, market leaders, stakeholders, among others.\n\nThe governor said his administration has delivered on his campaign promises in his T.H.E.M.E.S agenda of making Lagos a smart city areas such as transportation, health, education, environment, security, among others.\n\nSpeaking on the proposed construction of the Fourth Mainland Bridge, Sanwo-Olu said the contract is at the final stage of completion as all arrangements set for implementation.\n\nALSO READ: Emmanuel Fanu emerges acting Registrar of LASU\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWe, therefore, believe that the construction of the 37km 4th Mainland Bridge will significantly change the face of transportation and movement in Lagos State.\n\n\u201cThe ground-breaking for the construction and building of the Bridge will happen before the end of this year. Our PPP concessionaires appear committed as they enter the final stage of the qualification process.\n\n\u201cAll necessary funding has been secured by our partners.\n\nThe governor added that one of the future plans include: Oko-Oloyun and Idowu-Egba wooden bridges which link LASU Iba Road, Igando to Ayobo area in Alimosho local government area.\n\nSpeaking on the theme, \u2018A Glimpse into the future,\u2019 Sanwo-Olu stated that Lagosians should be with his administration over the ongoing construction projects all over the State, saying he is aware of some discomfort being experienced.\n\nThe Governor said, \u201cLagos is 0.4 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s total landmass, with a population of 22 million, representing about 10 per cent of the country\u2019s total population. Looking at the interaction between these figures, one will notice an obvious disproportion between population size and habitation space.\n\n\u201cThis, among other reasons, explains the perennial congestion on Lagos roads and across the State. As a government, we have undertaken several innovative means of ensuring that citizens\u2019 travel experiences are palatable.\u201d\n\nOn the integrated mass transit system, Sanwo-Olu said, \u201cFrom this day on, we are certainly heading in the direction that our city will become so connected by an Integrated Mass Transit System that a trip to the farthest part of the state will be reduced by half of the current travel time.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on activating an intermodal transport system that gives Lagosians the options of commuting by Water, Road, and Rail.\n\n\u201cWe are completing our intermodal bus terminals at Ajah, Abule Egba, Iju, Ojota and Anthony Village.\n\n\u201cThis administration has raised funding for the completion of Phase 1 of the 27km Blue Line Rail Project traversing Okokomaiko to Marina, with a daily passenger capacity of 500,000.\n\n\u201cWe flagged off the construction of the 37.5km Rail Mass Transit Red Line from Agbado to Marina. The rail corridor will move 1 million passengers daily when operating at full-capacity. The rail has 8 stations and 8 vehicle overpasses.\n\n\u201cWe expect to see the first passenger movement on this rail transportation before the end of this administration.\n\n\u201cSince the beginning of this administration, we have consciously promoted water transportation as one of our intermodal commuting options available to our citizens. We are currently fifteen jetties, invested in passenger boats for the Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA), and built on-water satellite monitoring station for passengers\u2019 safety in emergency situations\u201d.\n\nOn Bus Reform Initiative, he said, \u201cOur plan in the Bus Reform Initiative is to increase the First and Last Mile (FLM) Scheme to a fleet of 5,000 in the next 1 year. We also plan to introduce Lagos Ride under our Taxi Scheme. This will witness an initial injection of 1000 cars.\n\n\u201cThis initiative is meant to give our commuters options either on our high-capacity buses, medium-capacity buses, or taxis, which will reduce their dependence on Okada (commercial motorcycle) as a means of transportation in our state.\n\n\u201cThe Imota Rice mill is scheduled for completion this year. Upon completion, the production capacity of the Mill will be amongst the largest in the world and largest in Sub-Saharan Africa, producing 2.5million bags of 50kg rice annually.\n\n\u201cAt full-capacity, the Rice Mills will provide a steady supply of 2.4million bags of 50kg rice to Lagosians and create more than 250,000 jobs.\n\n\u201cCoompleting these projects within the next 24 months will bring absolute transformation to the livelihoods and the economy of our dear State. We have spent the last 729 days laying the foundation for all these to happen seamlessly.\u201d\n\nOn security and youth powerment, the Governor said, \u201cThe totality of our efforts is geared towards ensuring a safe and secure society, where youth employment is guaranteed. With more than two-thirds of Lagos state population falling below age 30, it is undisputable that the future of our State is the empowerment of our youth and security of their future. Our administration is committed to working with the youth and providing a safe environment for all to thrive.\n\n\u201cMost of our programmes are focused on empowering the youth. In the creative industry where thousands of them are being trained to become masters of their arts.\n\n\u201cNo fewer than 4000 youths have been placed in companies under Internship programme; and many more will join. Our Volunteer Corps has more than 9,000 young people.\n\n\u201cThe youth constitute the majority of the players in the tech-ecosystem and we have been supporting by funding for innovative start-ups. Today, we have funded over 20 start-ups in areas such as agriculture-tech, environmental tech, educational technology, and small-scale manufacturing.\n\n\u201cLast October, we provided over $10,000 to each of the start-ups. We have also funded over 70 research initiatives across 4 Universities and Colleges of Education.\n\n\u201cOn Security, we are currently working with the various state security operatives to determine additional operational and infrastructure needs that the state can support with.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, I shall in the coming week, be handing over operational vehicles, communication gadgets, ballistic vests and helmets, anti-riot water cannon vehicles, and Armed Personnel Carriers (APCs) to our various security operatives to further enhance and improve their operations which will ultimately have a positive impact on the security status in the state.\n\n\u201cI have given you an account of what we have done in recognition of your place as those who bestowed on us the sacred responsibility of leadership. We are standing on the threshold of history. The Greater Lagos we collectively envisioned is closer now than ever before.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Joseph Erunke\n\nABUJA\u2013A Niger Delta group under the aegis of Ogoni Liberation Initiative,has warned against further action on the proposed N385 fuel price hike, asking the proponents to immediately drop the proposal.\n\nThe group said implementation of the proposal especially at this time that citizens have not recovered from lockdown and other measures associated with COVID-19 outbreak would further worsen the plights of NIgerians.\n\nREAD ALSO 10 things to know about Queen Nerita Ezenwa as she steps out with Fani-Kayode\n\nAddressing a media conference in Abuja, Thursday, in collaboration with other civil society organisations,President,Ogoni Liberation Initiative,Dr Douglas Fabeke,said the group rejected in totality the proposal which he alleged, emanated from state governors.\n\nReading a prepared text,tagged:\u201dCivil Society Groups\u2019 Rejection of new Proposed N 385 Pump Price of Petrol\u201d,Dr Fabeke,alleged that there were\n\n\u201cdesperate attempts by the Nigerian Governors Forum to pressure the Federal Government of Nigeria and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,NNPC, to increase the official pump price of petrol from N 162 to N 385 per litre.\u201d\n\nAccording to him,there was \u201calso an underground plan to influence Mr President to remove the GMD NNPC for refusing to approve the N380 per litters and also his commitment to addressing all the bad things happening in the system and make a sustainable change in the oil and gas Industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe,the members of the Ogoni Liberation Initiative are holding this press conference with the support of Civil Society Organisations, to bring to the notice of the Federal Government, the state governments, the international community and the general public of Civil Society Groups\u2019 rejection of the new proposed N 385 pump price of petrol by the Nigerian Governors forum,\u201dhe insisted.\n\nHe noted that \u201con the 19th day of May, 2021, the Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF) held a virtual meeting and adopted the recommendations of the report of a six-man committee headed by the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, recommending among other things that the pump price of petrol should be increased from N162 to N385 per litre.\u201d\n\n\u201d Recall also that the referenced report and recommendations contained therein was presented to the National Economic Council headed by the Vice President of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo at its meeting held on the 20th day of May, 2021,\u201dhe further noted.\n\nDr Fabeke said:\u201dThe Ogoni Liberation Initiative and other Civil Society Organisations describe this desperate attempt by the NGF as callous, inhumane, and a betrayal of the public trust reposed on them by the electorate.\u201d\n\nHe vowed that the organisation would \u201cutilise every legal means possible to resist and revolt any attempt by government to further deepen the suffering of Nigerians by increasing the pump price of petrol as this will bring an unbearable hardship to all Nigerian, and further push the nation to a total collapse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the Nigerian governors are making this call at this moment when Nigerians are yet to recover from the ravaging effect of COVID-19.\n\n\u201d It is sad that last year, economic activities all over the country were shut down and many businesses closed down as a result of the lock-down order of the national and state governments to curb the wide spread of corona virus pandemic, leading to lot of losses among which included the disengagement of workers by corporate organisations and businesses,\u201dhe said.\n\nHe regretted that, \u201cMany are yet to recover from the losses, while some of the disengaged workers are yet to find employment replacement to earn a living.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rising challenging security situation in the country has further aggravated the pains of Nigerians as most businesses who thrive in the night such as transport companies, hotels, bars, night clubs and other recreational centres are shut down as a result of the curfew order imposed by state governors in their respective states to curb the security challenges and the gruesome killings of our security officers by armed bandits.\n\n\u201cAt this time when children and our youths are dying on the streets as a result of hunger, businesses are closing down, foreign direct investments have come to a screeching halt and high rate of unemployment in the country, rather than the state governors to complement the efforts of the Federal Government by diversifying the economy, creating employment and improving their internally generated revenue through other sources other than oil and gas, they are attempting to introduce policies that will further impoverish Nigerians,\u201dhe further said.\n\nAccording to him\u201dThe problem is that most of our governors are self-centred, lazy and visionless. \u201d\n\n\u201cThey only rely on the federal allocation and do not have any economic plan to drive the economy of their respective states.\n\n\u201d Most of them are finding it difficult to implement the (stipend) N30,000.00 minimum wage while others are agitating for the reduction of the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cThey cannot pay minimum wage to Nigerian workers yet they want double the current pump price of petrol.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed at the action and attitude of the governors in taking such a decision that will have adverse effect on Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe condemn this move as insensitive and call on the federal government of Nigeria, NEC, and the NNPC to disregard this anti-people proposal of the NGF as its acceptance will further heat up the country.\n\n\u201cThe government should rather make the refineries in Nigeria to work perfectly and also give an opportunities for private investors to invest more in modular refineries in order to boost local production and supply, create employment and increase the revenue of the country.\n\n\u201cAt this present time that Nigeria is facing challenges of insecurities , we need leaders of vision and creativity who will drive the nation beyond all obstacle for a better Nigeria, there is no need to do things that will create an opportunities that will lead to collapse of the system through insecurities,\u201dhe added.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has reaffirmed its commitment to the promotion and empowerment of young women and girls in the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the country.\n\nThe Commission expressed this commitment during separate sensitization campaigns held at Government Girls\u2019 Science School (GSS), Kuje and Nobel Hall Leadership Academy, Abuja on Tuesday, May 25, 2021, as it joined the rest of the world in marking the 10th anniversary of Girls in ICT Day 2021.\n\nThe annual event is an initiative of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), designed to raise global awareness on empowering and encouraging young women and girls to consider studies and careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).\n\nAside the sensitization campaigns held in Abuja, the NCC held similar events, in its zonal offices, across the country in furtherance of its commitment to promote the empowerment of young women through ICT.\n\nAddressing participants at the Nobel Hall Academy, Head, Internet Governance, NCC, Tokunbo Oyeleye, said the annual event is a testimony to the importance the Commission places on the need to expose girls and young women to more opportunities in ICT as well as address their cyber security concerns.\n\nConveying the felicitations of the Executive Vice Chairman/CEO of the Commission, Professor, Umar Graba Danbatta, Oyeleye said the theme of this year\u2019s edition of the programme, \u201cConnected Girls, Creating Brighter Futures\u2019\u2019 aptly underscores the growing importance of the need for an environment that encourages young women to acquire requisite digital skills to attain their future aspirations.\n\n\u201cThe Commission aligns with the ITU\u2019s Resolution 70, which advocates gender mainstreaming and promotion of gender equality, empowerment of women through Information and Communication Technology (ICT).\u201d\n\nThe Commission has consistently used the platform to encourage Nigerian girls to venture into ICT careers. \u201cHence, we sensitise students in secondary schools on how the NCC, as the telecom sector regulator, is creating a safer space for girls, by raising awareness on digital skills, gender-based violence as well as developing initiatives for the protection of children and girls\u2019 rights online,\u201d she said.\n\nShe stated further that the annual event also resonates with the Child Online Protection (COP) drive of the Commission aimed at collectively creating measures for a safer online environment for children. The Commission through various forms of support and participation in activities that educate children on ways to keep safe online has been advancing the objective to promote and safeguard national interests, safety and security.\n\nIn the same vein, a Senior Manager at NCC, Yisa Elizabeth, who led the Commission\u2019s team to GSS, Kuje, encouraged young girls to take advantage of the numerous opportunities in ICT for their personal and career development.\n\nOther locations where the Commission carried out the sensitization include Girls\u2019 Academy Senior Secondary School, Lagos Island and Girls\u2019 Senior Secondary Grammar School, Obalende Keffi, Lagos State; Model Girls\u2019 Secondary School, Rumueme and Government Girls\u2019 Secondary School Rumuokwuta, Port Harcourt, Rivers State; Kano Capital Secondary School (Girls\u2019 section), Matan Fada Road, Nassarawa and Mairo Tijjani Girls\u2019 Science and Technical College, Kano State.\n\nThe participants commended the NCC for the elaborate enlightenment programme, which they said was very beneficial as it has stimulated their interest and dispelled the negative gender perceptions often associated with ICT.",

          "title": "Tinu\u2019s road to building a trans-generational healthcare practice",
          "text": "PhysioCraft Allied Health Services, a private physical therapy practice, works with a team of qualified rehabilitation specialists to support clients during their recovery journey. Its founder, Tinu Okebukola, a physiotherapist, says her dream is to transform PhysioCraft into a profitable trans-generational healthcare practice that supports families and individuals. She is also working with young talents, empowering and challenging them to use their skills to improve Nigeria\u2019s healthcare indices. She shares the intriguing story of her push to redefine the rehabilitation segment of the health sector with Assistant Editor CHIKODI OKEREOCHA.\n\nHer choice of career as a physiotherapist was influenced by her mom who was a Physical Education teacher. So, from the outset of her entrepreneurial journey, the founder, PhysioCraft Allied Health Services, a private physical therapy practice, Tinu Okebukola, was fascinated by the idea that movement and activity have healing properties; that there is empirical evidence that exercise reverses aging, and helps with brain development, among other benefits.\n\nHer realisation of these facts, coupled with the hard work and remarkable dynamism she brought into her career, when she set out as a physiotherapist, must be why she has recorded tremendous successes in over a decade working in several countries and with multiple clients. The 2008 graduate of Physiotherapy from the College of Medicine, University of Lagos, has positioned PhysioCraft as the go-to-place for anything movement and recovery of function for clients.\n\nEstablished in 2013, PhysioCraft Allied Health Services is a one-stop physical rehabilitation centre. It offers rehabilitation services with a team of physiotherapists, occupational therapist, hydrotherapist and speech and language specialist. With three locations in Lagos, one in Abuja, and plans to hit more locations soon, Tinu said: \u201cThe big dream is to have a profitable trans-generational healthcare practice that supports families and individuals in their movement journey.\u201d\n\nTinu, who earned M.Sc. ( Physiotherapy) from the University of Nottingham, England, in 2012, said her plan in the next five years was to replicate PhysioCraft\u2019s model across various locations where it works with young talents and empower them to make impact in patients\u2019 lives, while also challenging themselves as individuals to use their skills to improve the healthcare indices for Nigerians.\n\nPhysioCraft\u2019s model utilises a specialist physiotherapist who leads clients\u2019 care. For example, a stroke patient\u2019s rehab would be led by a neuro-physiotherapist; a knee surgery patient would be led by a sports/orthopaedic physiotherapist and a child\u2019s rehab by a paediatric physiotherapist. PhysioCraft is a conglomerate of physiotherapists with various specialty areas.\n\nExpectedly, the dynamism and innovation Tinu has brought into her practice has not gone unnoticed. In recognition of the work PhysioCraft has been doing as a female-owned business, it received N5 million grant from the International Finance Corporation (IFC). The grant, she said, was used to expand the business and acquire state-of-the-art equipment to help clients in getting better.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only shot in the physiotherapist\u2019s arm. On the strength of a $.1million fully-funded scholarship, Tinu is pursuing a PhD in Rehabilitation Science at the University of Florida, Gainesville, United States. \u201cThe $100,000 scholarship is funding towards my acquiring a PhD in Rehabilitation Science where I am deepening my expertise in advanced neurology rehabilitation and leveraging technology to improve health indices in resource poor region,\u201d she said.\n\nBut it is not so much the funded research position in the university that has made Tinu the rave of the moment in her field. Rather, it is the intriguing, inspiring and, of course, patriotic story of what she did that earned her the highly coveted funding. It was the story of a 16-year-old boy who had a stroke and lost his ability to sit, eat, talk, walk and function when PhysioCraft first met him.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd working with him, despite limited resources then, Tinu was able to get the therapists the boy needed in one location, and to the glory of God, the company made excellent progress with him. \u201cYes, he (the 16-year-old boy) is a Nigerian. He had sudden headache that kept getting worse for three days while in school. Eventually, a scan showed some blood vessels had burst so, he had emergency surgery, and because of the parts of the brain that were affected, he lost a lot of function such as ability to eat, talk, sit move and use his hands,\u201d she narrated.\n\nIt was at this point Tinu\u2019s multiple roles in the boy\u2019s rehab became visible. First, she had to support the boy\u2019s family by helping them navigate all the complex healthcare situations, arranging transportation to Abuja from Lagos, discussing with the medical team to let him have a Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastronomy (PED). This was to ensure that he was getting adequate nutrition since he wasn\u2019t able to swallow enough food.\n\nShe also provided him with the specialists in the company\u2019s location such as physiotherapist, occupational therapist and speech therapist. \u201cThe occupational therapist worked with him to write again, including self-care activities like feeding, and bathing. I had to also arrange for specialised equipment that they didn\u2019t have in Nigeria at the time,\u201d Tinu explained.\n\nNoting that the boy had intense daily rehab for five months and then still had to undergo further rehab, Tinu confirmed: \u201cThe boy is back home and to the glory of God hale and hearty.\u201d\n\nThe budding entrepreneur\u2019s professional accomplishments did not stop there. In 2016, she secured funding from a private organisation, CrusaderSterling, to produce an exercise video for older adults as a social responsibility project for the firm. The idea was to provide interventions which can be cost-effective and used at home.\n\nShe is also a certified project manager by the Project Management International, U.S. By this, Tinu is certified to plan, schedule, execute, monitor and evaluate projects under constraints of scope, time and cost. She also earned the Basic Life Support (BLS) Certification in the U.S.\n\nThe BLS certification teaches medical workers how to perform life-saving techniques on infants, children, and adults. BLS essentially aims to keep individuals suffering from life-threatening medical conditions alive in the interim of being transported to the hospital or during transfers to more advanced treatment centres.\n\nWith an MSc in Physical Therapy in England, PhD in U.S., as well as membership of several international professional bodies, including the Health Care Professional Council (England), among her exposures, Tinu, like most of her peers, would probably have stayed back and practised abroad where the pasture is believed to be greener.\n\nBut she would have none of that. \u201cIt was tempting to stay back, to be honest,\u201d Tinu, who is also a member of the Nigeria Society of Physiotherapy and the Nigeria Institute of Management, admitted. Her sense of patriotism did not allow her give in to the temptation to stay back.\n\n\u201cI looked at home and saw there is a big gap and a real need there. So, I want to be a bridge, a connector,\u201d she declared, adding: \u201cBy being here and establishing a practice, I am able to bring the most current treatment and strategies and also work with world-renowned experts in the rehabilitation field, helping clients and families in their recovery.\u201d\n\nTinu has not looked back in her resolve to leverage her expertise, resources and energy to help redefine the rehabilitation segment of the health sector. She does this by supporting clients and families with movement-related healthcare needs in Nigeria. By so doing, those lucky to benefit from her services have no need to travel for international standard rehab. \u201cWe believe Nigerians deserve better healthcare,\u201d she asserted.\n\nPhysioCraft has 14 workers on its payroll. It was 20 before COVID-19 pandemic forced it to downsize to 14. And since its establishment, the response by Nigerians has been overwhelming, especially considering that Nigerians\u2019 awareness of physiotherapy is relatively lower than what obtains abroad.\n\nTinu confirmed this much when she said \u201cResponse has been gradually changing. Before, people would wait for physicians to send them to physiotherapist, but nowadays, with Internet, people Google information about their condition and find us online.\u201d\n\nMentoring youth, women entrepreneurs\n\nIn line with her avowed commitment to adding value to the health sector and women and youth entrepreneurship, Tinu has turned her attention to grooming the next generation of women and youth professionals and entrepreneurs.\n\nAside organising one-on-one mentoring programmes where she advises young girls, she recently hosted a free zoom chat where she shared some of the mistakes she made in her entrepreneurial journey. The free zoom, which she entitled: \u201cMistakes I made during my Entrepreneurial Journey,\u201d was held on May 15.\n\nThe zoom chat, which targeted service industry professionals, was hugely successful and, according to Tinu, it has birthed something bigger \u2014 a podcast called the \u201cAnonymous Mistakes Podcast. \u201cIt is a podcast where we would chat with successful individuals who would tell us about mistakes they have made, anonymously.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing this because young people put themselves under pressure benchmarking against outstandingly successful people. So, what if you can see the other side, you\u2019ll be more forgiving of yourself and learn from their mistakes while also leveraging their experience,\u201d she explained, adding that the initiative would be launched on June 12, 2021, to coincide with her birthday.\n\nExplaining further, she said during her career of over a decade across several countries and multiple clients, she noticed the mistakes family members make with their loved ones, especially elderly parents, people living with disabilities or long-term illnesses or even sports injury.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m hosting a free virtual session to highlight that. It would help people avoid thdse mistakes and also save money in the long run when it comes to care of their loved ones,\u201d she stated.\n\nIntelligent, savvy, and humorous (an attribute that bodes well for her field) Tinu, who described her job schedule as \u201cIncredibly tough,\u201d however, said she drew strength from the \u201cAmazing support system\u201d of her family. \u201cFirst, my husband supports and encourages me to be all that I can,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also said she did not joke with nanny care. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to me to have someone who helps with the kids. My mental health is also important. I speak with my family members frequently because they love me wholeheartedly. And I also try to take afternoon naps or walk at least three times a week,\u201d she stated.",

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara on Thursday held a town hall meeting attended by various stakeholders amid testimonials of specific impacts the administration of Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq is having on various demographics of the state.\n\nFrom victims of the recent EndSARs protest to artisans, physically challenged community, businessmen, farmers, private school owners, civil servants, and victims of the recent rainstorms, the Governor received widespread accolades for his impactful reign, empathetic leadership, and apolitical governance and support for every segment of the state.\n\nCommunity and political leaders also took turns to commend AbdulRazaq for bringing developments to their areas after decades of neglect, acknowledging the far-reaching impacts his spendings on basic healthcare facilities, water, rural roads, schools, and safety nets for the underprivileged have had across the state within two years.\n\nA representative of victims of looted properties during #EndSARSProtests Ahmed Lawal commended the Governor for coming to the aid of the victims of the looting in the state.\n\n\u201cMany private businesses especially 34 businesses in Kwara Mall were totally looted during the #EndSARSProtests and the governor, in his magnanimity, called us and he supported us. Every single business got money to restart their business. Today, the mall is back and many are indeed stronger now,\u201d he said at the town hall meeting.\n\nRepresentative of persons with disabilities Bashir Yusuf also admitted that the government was supporting them through various interventions, including the procurement and distribution of artificial limbs or prosthesis to many of those who needed it.\n\nBalqis Abdulrasheed, who spoke on behalf of rainstorm victims, said they would not forget how the government supported them without any considerations for their political leanings, a development she observed was a far cry from what occurred in the past.\n\nDr. Tunji AbdulRahman, immediate past president, National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools, Kwara state branch, and proprietor of Socrate College, expressed their pleasure at the manner the Governor heeded their requests for credit facility and tax holiday for their members as palliatives during the serious ravage of Covid19 pandemic.\n\nHe described AbdulRazaq as \u201cthe most hardworking and considerate Governor the state has ever had.\u201d\n\nChairman of the All Progressives Congress Alhaji Abdullahi Samari sought support of the people of the state for the current administration .\n\n\u201cWe called this meeting to assess what the Governor has done for the past two years and tell him where to focus attention on for the next two years. This administration is doing a lot to better the lots of the people and Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq will not disappoint you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLet me also use this opportunity to urge our people to obtain their voters cards in the forthcoming INEC registration/revalidation exercise to enable them vote in the coming elections.\u201d\n\nKwara Speaker Yakubu Danladi Salihu said: \u201cWhoever says no to Mallam AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq is saying no to the development and progress of Kwara State. He doing well in various sectors.\n\n\u201cFor us at the ninth assembly, you have done excellently well. You forwarded Social Investment Programme Bill and we can see the effects on our aged, market women, youths and artisans through Owo Arugbo, Owo Isowo and other components of KWASSIP.\n\n\u201cWe can see infrastructural development in all our constituencies and our people are here today to celebrate you and your government. In fact, you are the first governor to construct asphalt road in the whole of Baruten local government. You are also the first governor to establish radio station in Kwara North to bridge information gap.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe trio of Commissioners for Works and Transport, Water Resources and Health \u2014 Engr. Rotimi Iliasu, Alhaji Femi Agbaje, and Dr. Raji Razaq \u2014 took turns to enumerate some of the highly impactful developmental projects the present government has put in place through their various offices.\n\nThey said all these projects are visible to sights and have changed the narratives in terms of the level of access Kwarans now have to good roads, potable water, and good healthcare services.\n\nDr. Raji, who spoke through the Permanent Secretary in the Health Ministry, Dr. Ayinla specifically thanked AbdulRazaq for hugely investing in the sector and how his government has championed the fight against the spread of coronavirus, a record he said has distinguishably ranked Kwara next to Lagos.\n\nApart from various stakeholders, the event was attended by dozens of top politicians, former state and national legislators, House of Assembly members, heads of federal and state parastatals who hailed from the three senatorial districts.\n\nGovernor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq and Deputy Governor Kayode Alabi attended the well-attended town hall meeting which was streamed live across various social media platforms.",

Will the National Assembly restrict itself out of this opulence state; all the current attempts of the ruling class, elite, the National Assembly in current constitutional amendments?\n\n\u201cThe position of the southern governors are futile attempts to preserve the status quo because they are the beneficiaries of the present system. A new federal constitution written by the Nigerian people with the experience of the last 60 years must replace the 1999 contraption.\n\n\u201cYCE urges that National Assembly, to as a matter of urgency, pass a Halt Bill that will impute referendum into the 1999 Constitution. Bill for the creation of Constituent Assembly Commission to chart and direct the way forward to have stakeholders in Nigerian project, propose and write a new constitution for Nigerians.

It also raised the concern on recent cases of rising poverty, growing inequality and violence against children, saying if allowed to fester, it would compound the woes of children when added to the havoc by COVId-19.\n\nSaid Hawkins: \u201cIt has been a challenging year for us all with the COVID-19 pandemic,not least of all, Nigeria\u2019s children, and I want to commend efforts at all levels of Nigerian government and society to protect education, health, and protection services in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children.\n\n\u201cAs we rightfully celebrate Nigerian children today, let us also remember that the COVID-19 crisis has been a child rights crisis in Nigeria and around the world. Poverty is rising, inequality is growing, and the pandemic has often disrupted the essential services that secure the health, education and protection of children and young people. The longer the pandemic goes on, the more intense the impact on women and children.\u201d\n\nThe statement pointed out that violence has been perpetrated against one in four Nigerian children, while one in three Nigerian girls are sexually abused. \u201cThis has only increased during the pandemic. On this Children\u2019s Day, let us all agree that we cannot let one crisis compound another. The pandemic is threatening decades of progress we have made for children. Today of all days, we must commit to reinforce the protection mechanisms for all children.\u201d",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) met on Thursday with security formations in the country, urging them to put an end continued attacks on its facilities nationwide.\n\nThe Commission warned that the attacks will disrupt the electoral process, undermine Nigerian democracy and destabilise the country.\n\nINEC Chairman Prof Mahmood Yakubu issued the warning in Abuja during the emergency meeting with the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES).\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nWhile lamenting that the last few weeks have been very challenging for the Commission, he noted that the spate of arson and vandalism targeting the Commission\u2019s facilities and property has become a major threat to its scheduled activities and the entire electoral process.\n\nHe said that a preliminary assessment so far indicates that the Commossion has lost 1,105 ballot boxes, 694 voting cubicles, 429 electric generating sets and 13 utility vehicles (Toyota Hilux).\n\nYakubu, however, expressed confidence that by working together with the security agencies, the attacks and wanton destruction of critical electoral assets could be stopped.\n\n\u2018No doubt, the last few weeks have been very challenging to the Commission. The spate of arson and vandalisation targeting the Commission\u2019s facilities and property has become a major threat to our scheduled activities and the entire electoral process. In the last two years, the Commission has recorded a total of 41 incidents involving deliberate attacks on the Commission\u2019s facilities,\u2019 the INEC Chairman stated.\n\n\u2018Nine of these incidents happened in 2019 and 21 cases in 2020. In the last four weeks, 11 offices of the Commission were either set ablaze or vandalised. Two of these incidents were caused by Boko Haram and Bandit attacks while 10 resulted from thuggery during election and post-election violence.\n\n\u2018However, the majority of the attacks (29 out of 41) were unrelated to election or electoral activities. In fact, 18 of them occurred during the EndSARS protests in October last year while 11 attacks were organised by \u201cunknown gunmen\u201d and \u201choodlums\u201d.\n\n\u2018Although the Commission is assessing loss of materials during recent attacks, our preliminary assessment so far indicate that we lost 1,105 ballot boxes, 694 voting cubicles, 429 electric generating sets and 13 utility vehicles (Toyota Hilux). By working together with the security agencies, we can stop these attacks and the wanton destruction of critical electoral assets.\n\n\u2018These attacks, which initially appeared as isolated and occasional actions, have now become more frequent and systematic targeted at demobilising and dismantling critical electoral infrastructure in the country.\n\n\u2018This will not only undermine the Commission\u2019s capacity to organise elections and other electoral activities but will also damage the nation\u2019s electoral process and democracy. Indeed, these attacks on the Commission\u2019s facilities should now be treated as a national security emergency.\n\n\u2018Under the auspices of ICCES, we should ramp up our activities to curtail these unjustifiable acts of aggression. This will entail not only drawing on our separate and collective resources within ICCES, but also increased collaboration with citizens, communities and all stakeholders. I must place on record the support to the Commission from communities we serve across the country.\n\n\u2018Among many other things, they have donated land to locate many of the Commission\u2019s facilities, provided voluntary assistance during electoral activities like registration of voters and even donated materials such as chairs and shelter during elections.\n\n\u2018Even in the context of recent destruction of INEC facilities, some of these communities have offered to rebuild our offices and to help protect them going forward. We should tap into this goodwill in finding solutions to the present situation,\u2019 Yakubu noted.\n\nSpeaking further, the Chairman said: \u2018As a Commission, we have been undertaking our own internal review of the situation and seeking answers. Only last week, the Commission met with (RECs) and received briefings about these rising threats.\n\n\u2018We are presently compiling the useful suggestions from the meeting and other internal review, which we hope to share with this body in due course.\n\n\u2018I understand that the security agencies are doing their own individual assessments. Beyond Election Day security, we look forward to creating a framework for an all-year round, end-to-end protection of electoral facilities under the auspices of ICCES. To disrupt the electoral process is to undermine our democracy and destabilise the country.\u2019\n\nIn his reaction, the National Security Adviser and Co-Chairman of ICCES, Babagana Mungono, charged key intelligence agencies to unravel those behind the attacks.",

          "text": "From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure; Noah Ebije, Kaduna; Paul Osuyi, Asaba; Lukman Olabiyi; Tunde Omolehin, Sokoto; Sola Ojo, Kaduna; Stanley Uzoaru, George Onyejiuwa Owerri and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nThe Senate Committee on the review of the 1999 Constitution (As Amended) began public hearing yesterday, in the various geo-political zones across the country, with renewed clamour for creation of additional state in the South East, state police and power devolution among other demands listed by the State governors and other stakeholders.\n\nKaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai and his Delta and Plateau counterparts, Ifeanyi Okowa and Simon Lalong, respectively, top the list of governors calling for power devolution and true federalism\n\nEl Rufai argued that devolution of powers is necessary because the current structure overburdens the federal government with too many responsibilities which it cannot efficiently handle.\n\nThe governor further recalled that the APC Committee on True Federalism, which he headed, had identified legislative interventions that the National Assembly can more easily undertake to achieve a truly balanced, equitable and fair federal structure.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe reality of our security situation today requires that Nigeria must strengthen its military and security agencies. This includes decentralising the police to enable the states to exercise effective control in securing their residents and communities.\n\n\u201cWe need to have federal, state and community police, with each granted sufficient powers to make them effective in securing the areas assigned to them and cooperating closely with each other.\n\n\u201cThe power to hire and fire police officers should revert fully and totally to the Inspector General of Police, under the supervision of the National Police Council, as envisaged by the Constitution.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn Asaba, Delta state capital, which hosted the public hearing Delta, Bayels and Edo states, Over Ifeanyi Okowa said there should be \u201cacceptable and legitimate division of powers among different tiers of government; a written constitution delineating such division; the coordinate supremacy of the levels of government with regard to their respective functions; and a considerable measure of autonomy \u2013 fiscal, legislative and judicial \u2013 of the Federal Government and the federating units.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who was represented by the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Sheriff Oborevwori, advocated that revenues collected by the Federal Government through the parastatals of NNPC, NLNG, CBN, NIMASA, FAAN and other similar agencies should be remitted into the federation account.\n\n\u2022We want amendments that\u2019ll enhance Nigeria\u2019s unity, prosperity \u2013 Ugwuanyi\n\nEnugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi declared his administration\u2019s support for constitution amendments that will enhance the nation\u2019s unity and prosperity \u201cin an environment where justice, fairness and equity shall prevail\u201d.\n\nThe governor enjoined all relevant institutions, civil society organisations, stakeholders and entire Enugu state citizenry to avail themselves the opportunity of the zonal public hearing to participate in the national conversation.\n\n\u201cI, particularly, acknowledge the leader of the team and Senator representing Enugu West Senatorial District in the 9th Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Distinguished Senator Prof. Ike Ekweremadu, CFR. I also recognise in a special way, Distinguished Senator, Chuka Utazi, who represents me and the people of Enugu North Senatorial District in the Red Chamber of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on behalf of his colleagues from Enugu, Anambra and Ebonyi states, the Speaker of the Enugu State House of Assembly, Edward Ubosi, assured the people of South East geo-political zone that the state legislature will first seek their opinions before adopting the outcome of the constitutional review by the National Assembly.\n\nThe Speaker, who maintained that constitution alteration is a continuous exercise, commended the 9th National Assembly for taking up the task again and thanked governor Ugwuanyi for providing the enabling atmosphere for the event.\n\nIn his vote of thanks, Senator Ekweremadu, also applauded governor Ugwuanyi, who he described as \u201cInsurance Guru\u201d, for his immense contributions towards the hosting of the zonal public hearing in Enugu.\n\n\u2022Sanwo-Olu pushes for special status for Lagos\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who declared the Lagos centre of the public hearing open, yesterday, demanded a special economic status for the state, saying the progress and prosperity of Nigeria is inextricably linked to the progress and prosperity of Lagos State.\n\nSanwo-Olu also demanded for a State Police and entrenchment of true fiscal federalism in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor us in Lagos State, the issues of State Police and fiscal federalism are at the top of the priority in this ongoing review process. Equally fundamental, particularly, for us in Lagos State, is the issue of a Special Economic Status for Lagos, considering our place in the national economy and the special burdens we bear by virtue of our large population and limited land mass.\n\n\u201cI believe the need for this Special Status has been sufficiently articulated and justified. It suffices for me, at this point, to restate that this request is by no means a selfish one, but one that is actually in the interest of every Nigerian and of Nigeria as a nation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Constitution reference point of democracy \u2013 Tambuwal\n\nSokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, represented by his Deputy, Alhaji Muhammadu Manir Dan Iya, described the Constitution as the reference point of democracy.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd in the 22 years of Nigeria\u2019s experience in government by representation, our gains have more than justified our challenges.\n\n\u201cAll constitutions are, therefore, work in progress, because they are subject to the changing needs and aspirations the people, at different times.\n\n\u201cAnd constitutional reviews are the processes for ensuring this guiding document plays that function.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Kebbi State Governor, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu noted that, the exercise is coming at the time of Nigeria\u2019s life when more dialogue is in dire need.\n\n\u201cIt is an opportune time to, therefore, collectively brainstorm on how to discuss these issues, for the country to move forward in unison, by having a more robust constitution.\u201d\n\n\u20221999 Constitution outdated- Senator Uba Sani\n\nThe Senator representing Kaduna Central Zone, Uba Sani noted that the 1999 was outdated with some contentious issues that needed to be addressed, hence, the need to review it.\n\nSpeaking in Kaduna Sani noted that the Constitution was last reviewed 22 years ago which had brought crisis into governance.\n\n\u2022UN Women coalition advocates more in governance, inclusive language\n\nThe Coalition of Women Leaders in Kaduna State, in collaboration with UN Women advocated for an increase of women\u2019s rights, especially in political leadership, to enhance the participation of women in governance.\n\nThe coalition also called on the representatives of the committee currently meeting in Kaduna to be conscious of inclusive language as they amend the 1999 constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u2022State police, additional states dominate S\u2019East constitution review\n\nThe public hearing on the review of the 1999 Constitution which kicked off in Owerri, Imo State, yesterday, was dominated by popular agitations for State policing and creation of another State in South East.\n\nChief of Staff to Abia State government, ACB Agbazuari, while submitting his memorandum, noted that State police will strengthen the peaceful coexistence in the southeast and check security challenges.\n\nHe urged members of the senate committee review to look into their submission in view of granting their request.\n\nSimilarly, Chief Theo Okire, who represented Aba Mass Movement, submitted that an additional states should be created in the South East.\n\nHe said if additional states are created in the South East, it would bring an even political atmosphere and less marginalisation of the zone.\n\nOther memoranda submitted were calls on gender equity, revenue allocation system, youth empowerment in politics, maintaining standards in professions in the country and accordance of constitutional roles to traditional institutions.\n\nGover Hope Uzodimma who also seized the opportunity to warn his detractors said: \u201cLet me, however, use this auspicious opportunity to tell these alarmists and pretenders to love of Ndigbo, that they are not more Igbo than I am and they do not love Igbo more than I do.\n\n\u201cThe difference is that while they want immediate and sentimental public applause, I want enduring prescriptions that can comprehensively address the Igbo challenge in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWithout sounding simplistic, what we seek is justice and equity. When we talk of restructuring or devolution of power, we are talking actually of having an environment created for us to unleash our potential and talent without let or hindrance.\n\n\u201cWe are also talking of being treated equally like every other part of Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u20221999 constitution amendment effort in futility, Babalola tells NASS\n\nLegal luminary Aare Afe Babalola (SAN) has charged the 9th National Assembly to, rather than waste time and resources at amending the 1999 constitution, convoke a National Constitutional Conference to fashion out a new true federal constitution.\n\nHe said the way out is to return the country to a parliamentary system of government and the 1963 structure.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that there is no way the National Assembly can amend the 1999 constitution to cure the inherent defects in the 1999 constitution. First, you cannot cure fraud. Second, it is impossible, by way of amendment, to take away the military system of government under the 1999 constitution or the power and control of public funds by the President. Or can we, by way of amendment, change the Judicial powers of the President under the 1999 constitution? The fact remains that you cannot amend a Coconut tree which has no branches to become and Iroko tree which has branches. It is a well-known fact that everything about the 1999 constitution is wound around the Presidential system of government. Why then is the National Assembly afraid of calling a National Constitutional Conference to fashion out a new true federal constitution and come up with a Parliamentary system of government as we had in 1963,\u201d he further said.\n\n\u2022N/Assembly\u2019ll provide a constitution that\u2019ll Nigeria challenges \u2013 Omo-Agege\n\nDeputy Senate President and Chairman, Senate Committee on Constitution Review, Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege has expressed the determination of the National Assembly to provide Nigerians with a fair and inclusive constitution that will address the challenges of the nation.\n\n\u201cThe focus of this committee is how to manage the review exercise in a fair, inclusive, credible and transparent manner. At the commencement of this 9th Senate, we had set for ourselves a legislative agenda as a basis on which we are to be assessed. Sitting prominently in that agenda is the need to address , by way of constitutional amendments, topical issues like judicial and Electoral Reforms, Local Government Autonomy, and devolution of powers.\u201d",
          "summary": "\u201cWe need to have federal, state and community police, with each granted sufficient powers to make them effective in securing the areas assigned to them and cooperating closely with each other.\n\u2022State police, additional states dominate S\u2019East constitution reviewThe public hearing on the review of the 1999 Constitution which kicked off in Owerri, Imo State, yesterday, was dominated by popular agitations for State policing and creation of another State in South East.\n\u201cThe truth is that there is no way the National Assembly can amend the 1999 constitution to cure the inherent defects in the 1999 constitution.\nOr can we, by way of amendment, change the Judicial powers of the President under the 1999 constitution?\nIt is a well-known fact that everything about the 1999 constitution is wound around the Presidential system of government.",

          "text": "Ndubuisi Francis in Abuja\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has declared that about N35 trillion investment in infrastructure is required for the economy to post a double-digit growth.\n\nBut, he declared that given the paucity of government revenues, it will be difficult to support such investments using government funds alone.\n\nThe Nigerian economy recorded a 0.51 per cent growth in the first quarter of 2021 after a 0.11 per cent growth in the fou rth quarter of 2020. In a goodwill message he delivered at a webinar on \u201cFinancing Public-Private Partnership to Boost Infrastructure Delivery in Nigeria,\u201d organised by the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in Abuja, Thursday Emefiele noted that the theme of the webinar was topical as a critical part of efforts to drive sustainable growth of the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe CBN Governor whose message was delivered by the Deputy Governor of the bank on Economic Policy, Dr. Kingsley Obiora, said the COVID-19 pandemic had exerted unprecedented impact on the Nigerian economy, adding that significant interventions by the monetary and fiscal authorities had led to exit from two recessions although growth is muted.\n\nHe observed: \u201cWhile this news is positive, growth is still well below our population growth of 2.7 per cent. It is therefore imperative that we all work together to harness the growth potential of the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cIf we take into account Nigeria\u2019s Infrastructure Masterplan, we require close to N35 trillion worth of investment in order to attain double-digit growth. But given the paucity of government revenue, which the BPE Director General mentioned earlier, it will be difficult to support these investments using government funds alone.\n\n\u201cSo, finding ways to harness public-private partnerships have become very important and we are happy to acknowledge that these partnerships have started in earnest and the Central Bank of Nigeria looks forward to continuing collaboration with the BPE to harness these partnerships to ensure that we significantly scale up investment in our infrastructure,\u201d he said.\n\nDetails.later\u2026\n\nSent from Yahoo Mail on Android\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Akeredolu seeks return to 1963 constitution\n\n\u2022Okowa demands new document, not amendment\n\n\u2022Lagos wants special status\n\n\u2022NLC, NULGE seek retention of minimum wage, LG autonomy\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nThe process for reviewing the 1999 Constitution as altered gathered momentum yesterday with clamours for creation of state police, devolution of powers to the states, creation of more states, restructuring and fiscal federalism featuring prominently in presentations made by stakeholders at zonal public hearings in 12 venues nationwide.\n\nThe two-day public hearings are being organised by the Senate Committee on Constitution Review.\n\nHowever, while the Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, advocated a return to 1963 Constitution, his counterpart in Delta State, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, called for a new constitution and not an amendment of the 1999 document.\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, canvassed a special status for the state, which hitherto hosted the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) also submitted a 72-page document, seeking the retention of the minimum wage, among other demands, while local government workers under the aegis of the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) asked the lawmakers to make local governments autonomous.\n\nUnder the exercise, each of the six geopolitical zones was assigned two venues each to enable groups and individuals to present their demands.\n\nThe venues are Enugu and Owerri for the South-east; Lagos and Akure for South-west, Kaduna and Sokoto for North-west, Bauchi and Gombe for North-east, Port Harcourt and Asaba for South-south, and Jos and Minna for the North-central.\n\nVarious groups from the four North-west states of Kaduna, Kano, Katsina and Jigawa attended the public hearing at the Hassan Katsina House, Kawo in Kaduna.\n\nChairman of the Senate Committee, Senator Kabiru Gaya, said the committee received a total of 24 memos from the four states, adding that more memos were being submitted.\n\nAmong the groups that presented memoranda were Jamiya Matan Arewa (JMA), the NLC, Civil Society Groups, Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU), Kaduna Elders Forum and Kano Progressives, among others.\n\nIn his remarks, the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, reiterated calls for devolution of powers.\n\nHe said the current structure overburdened the federal government with too many responsibilities, which it cannot efficiently handle.\n\nel-Rufai, who spoke in his personal capacity, said the All Progressives Congress (APC) Committee on true federalism which he headed, had identified legislative interventions that the National Assembly could more easily undertake to achieve a truly balanced, equitable and fair federal structure.\n\nThe governor proposed 10 items which should be shared responsibilities between the federal governments and states.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe reality of our security situation today requires that Nigeria must strengthen its military and security agencies. This includes decentralising the police to enable the states to exercise effective control in securing their residents and communities.\n\n\u201cWe need to have federal, state and community police, with each granted sufficient powers to make them effective in securing the areas assigned to them and cooperating closely with each other.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe governor dismissed the fear of abuse of state police by sub-national governments because a constitutional or statutory framework can be enacted to ensure federal intervention in cases of such abuses.\n\nNLC and NULGE presentations were centred on the retention of minimum wage on the exclusive list, autonomy for local governments, gender issues and creation of additional local governments and states.\n\nIn its submission, Southern Kaduna People\u2019s Union (SOKAPU), reechoed its long agitation for the creation of Gurara State out of the present Kaduna State.\n\nSOKAPU President, Mr. Jonathan Asake, demanded the amendment of section 8 of the constitution, which makes it almost an impossible task for the creation of a new state.\n\nAlso, the Kaduna Development Elders Initiatives, in its presentation, called for the amendment of the constitution to make it easy for the creation of states, especially the creation of a new Kaduna State.\n\nIn Owerri, where Imo and Abia States made their submissions, Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, said the South-east\u2019s popular agitations and Nigeria\u2019s problems could be addressed by amending the constitution.\n\nIn a memorandum, he submitted for Abia State, the Chief of Staff to Abia State Governor, Mr. ACB. Agbazuari, said state police would strengthen the peaceful coexistence in the South-east and check security challenges.\n\nHe urged members of the Senate Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, to look into the state\u2019s submission with a view to granting their request.\n\nChief Theo Okire who represented Aba Mass Movement stated that additional states should be created in the South-east particularly, for Abia State to have Aba State.\n\nEarlier in his opening remarks at the occasion, Deputy Senate President and Chairman of the Senate Committee on 1999 Constitution Review, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, who was represented by Kalu, said at the beginning of the 9th Senate, the legislators had set a legislative agenda for themselves on which they would be assessed.\n\nKalu said he was aware that Ohanaeze Ndigbo, under the leadership of Prof George Obiozor, had articulated the position of the people of the South-east for the committee.\n\n\u201cWhat are the constitutional issues that agitate our minds: rotational presidency, state police, and indigeneship in a state after 10 years of residency, devolution of more powers to the states, resource control, and many more.\n\n\u201cAll these issues can be resolved through constitution amendments. This is the unique opportunity this public hearing offers to our people,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his contribution, Uzodimma stated that the Igbo are better off being part of the larger Nigeria with vast opportunities opened to them than being confined in a separate space with limited opportunities.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn every part of Nigeria outside the South-east, we form the second largest population.\n\n\u201cAs an itinerant group, we move around to expand our economic frontiers. As citizens of Nigeria, we are afforded that lease of life. Our people are suffering harassment in South Africa and Ghana and other countries. Is that what we want to bequeath to our younger generation if, in hastily contrived indignation, we abandon our heritage in Nigeria?\n\n\u201cSo my dearest brothers and sisters, we need Nigeria just as Nigeria needs us. Whatever be our grievances against the system, we have a golden opportunity to seek redress under the upcoming constitutional review. What we seek is justice and equity for our people to thrive. And for that, we owe nobody any apology. But we cannot achieve it through violence or threat of secession. It is through an avenue like this that we put forward our request and follows it through.\u201d\n\nIn Lagos, the participants called for restructuring of the federation to reflect true federalism, saying only such a move would engender unity, progress and the prosperity of the country.\n\nThe state Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and the Speaker of the House of Assembly, Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, reiterated the need for a special economic status for the state and the creation of state police. They also called for true fiscal federalism.\n\nParticipants from Lagos, Ogun and Oyo States made submissions to the Senate Committee under the chairmanship of Senator Oluremi Tinubu, representing Lagos Central.\n\nTop on the agenda of their presentations was the need for devolution of powers whereby the local government system has the greater share and so it is empowered to carry out effective administration of the polity since it is closest to the people.\n\nParticipants also called for the creation of state police, re-inclusion of magistrates in the constitution, review of the retirement age for magistrates from 60 to 65 years.\n\nThere were also calls for a declaration to make the Higher National Diploma (HND) equivalent to a university degree; need to ensure gender equality, judicial and electoral reforms, as well as revenue allocation, among others.\n\nPresident of the NLC, Mr. Ayuba Wabba, Lagos State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), and representatives of civil society organisations, associations and professional bodies, among others, presented and submitted their memoranda to the committee.\n\nSanwo-Olu Wants Special Status for Lagos\n\nIn his presentation, Sanwo-Olu said: \u201cFor us in Lagos State, the issues of state police and fiscal federalism are at the top of the priority list for us, in this ongoing review process. Equally fundamental, particularly for us in Lagos State, is the issue of a special economic status for Lagos, considering our place in the national economy and the special burdens we bear by virtue of our large population and limited landmass.\n\n\u201cI believe the need for this special status has been sufficiently articulated and justified. It suffices for me at this point to restate that this request is by no means a selfish one, but one that is actually in the interest of every Nigerian and of Nigeria as a nation.\n\n\u201cThe progress and prosperity of Nigeria are inextricably linked to the progress and prosperity of Lagos State. A special status for Lagos State, therefore, must be a concern not only for the people of Lagos State alone but for all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nObasa, who was represented by the Deputy Speaker, Wasiu Eshinlokun-Sanni, stated that the most fundamental aspect of the call by the state government is the 30 per cent derivation on natural resources for the domiciling states, as well as the criminalisation of undue interference in activities of the legislature by the executive.\n\nOnigbanjo, while presenting the Lagos memorandum, advocated an amendment to make the constitution reflects a federal system, among other prayers.\n\n\u201cWe also propose that the Value Added Tax (VAT) Act be repealed by the National Assembly because it prevents states from utilising the Sales Act to generate revenue and this has caused confusion and a lot of court cases. We also propose that appointment and promotion of judges should lie with the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) of states and not the National Judicial Council (NJC),\u201d he added.\n\nState Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Revd, Steven Adegbite, queried the establishment and functionality of Sharia Courts since the constitution said there would be no state religion.\n\nHe said that CAN might be forced to vie for canon courts in the spirit of equity and justice.\n\nWabba, insisted that labour and the national minimum wage is retained on the exclusive legislative list.\n\nHe stated that since Nigeria has domesticated 26 of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which governs labour matters, \u2018it would be anomalous, incongruous and contemptible of global standards and order to even contemplate removing labour from the exclusive legislative list.\u201d\n\nIn Asaba, where submissions were received from Delta, Edo and Bayelsa States, true federalism, state police, devolution of power, state creation and gender parity dominated the demands.\n\nThe speakers of the legislatures of the three states presented the position papers of their respective states before the committee, which was chaired by Senator Ovie Omo-Agege.\n\nOkowa Seeks New Constitution, Not Amendment\n\nOkowa, who declared the public hearing open, stated that Nigeria needs a new constitution.\n\nOkowa said what Nigeria actually needed was a \u201cnew constitution\u201d rather than a review.\n\nThe governor urged the National Assembly to look into power devolution to the states, review revenue allocation formula, oil derivation and demand for state police in the amendment to enable the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission to lay revenue allocation formula proposals directly before the lawmakers.\n\nBayelsa State also called for the devolution of power, state police and \u201ctrue federalism with 100 per cent resource control.\u201d\n\nEdo State delegation, led by Hon. Marcus Onobun, submitted proposals for about 30 alterations, including demands for state police, gender equality and true fedederalism.\n\nThe position paper for Delta State dwelt on demand for a 50 per cent derivation fund, a special ecological fund to mitigate the effects of oil and gas exploration as well as true federalism and state police with authority for states to purchase and control arms.\n\nDeclaring the event open in Minna, the Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, said the North-central zone was not opposed to the restructuring of the country as being demanded by the South.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have problem with restructuring,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cat the end of the constitution review exercise, justice should be done to all segments of the country.\u201d\n\nThe governor stated that \u201cNigeria is better and stronger as one country.\u201d\n\nFiscal federalism, devolution of powers to federating units, electoral reforms and state police also dominated presentations at the zonal hearing in Akure, the Ondo State capital, where submissions were received from Ondo, Ekiti and Osun States.\n\nAkeredolu Seeks Return to 1963 Constitution\n\nAkeredolu, set the ball rolling as he backed the call for the country to return to the 1963 Constitution, which gave powers to the regions to develop at their own pace.\n\nThe governor said the 1963 Constitution, which reflected the republican status of the country, remained the best document for a country as heterogeneous as Nigeria.\n\nAkeredolu stated that the powers of the federal government at the present must be trimmed as it was the major source of friction in the country.\n\nAkeredolu warned that the current attempt at constitution amendment should be taken beyond the usual jamboree conceived and executed to arrive at a predetermined result.\n\n\u201cThe current exercise, therefore, must not toe the path of the previous attempts at tokenism. The basic law of any country must not be reduced to frivolities reflecting preferred whimsies,\u201d he added.\n\nPresenting the position of Ekiti State, the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Akeem Jamiu, like Akeredolu, said the new constitution should allow only five political parties, allow independent candidate e-voting and diaspora voting.\n\nHe advocated a new revenue formula, which should be in favour of state and local government.\n\nJamiu also said states should be allowed to collect VAT and remit only five per cent to the federal government.\n\nHe also said that there should be state police.\n\nAt the North-east zonal hearing in Bauchi, Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed, identified inadequacies in the constitution to cover revenue allocation, security provision and inclusiveness in running the affairs of the country.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the move would provide the change needed for the betterment of the country.\n\nAccording to him, the North-eastern part of the country as the most devastated by insurgency and educationally disadvantaged was shortchanged in the constitution, hence the need for the review.\n\nIn Gombe State, the state Governor, Senator Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya said the evolving dynamics of the Nigerian state made it imperative for a periodic constitution review in order to accommodate new realities and the concerns of the Nigerians.\n\nOn his part, Governor of Sokoto State, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal, said citizens\u2019 participation in the ongoing constitution review would strengthen democracy.\n\nTambuwal, at the Sokoto venue of the North-west zonal hearing covering Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara States, described the constitution as a reference point of democracy.\n\nTambuwal was represented by his deputy, Muhammad Manir Dan\u2019Iya.\n\nOn his part, the Governor of Kebbi State, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, implored the stakeholders to deliberate and come up with what will generate more money for the states to enhance development.\n\nIn Enugu, devolution of power and creation of state police also topped discussions at the public hearing.\n\nChairman of the Enugu Zone and former Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, said this was not the first time the National Assembly was amending the constitution.\n\nHe stressed the need to decentralise the police for improved security and for local government reforms.\n\nAlso, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State expressed his support and that of the state to the constitution amendments, which he said would enhance Nigeria\u2019s unity and prosperity, especially \u201cin an environment where justice, fairness and equity shall prevail\u201d.\n\nIn Jos, the Plateau State Governor, Mr. Simon Lalong, expressed the hope that the constitution review would help in addressing the security challenges in the state and other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cHopefully, this constitutional review should lead to better policing that is closer to the people to stop this kind of unacceptable murders,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said his administration had always advocated community policing as a viable tool in addressing the current security challenges in the country\n\nHe added: \u201cThat is why we have embraced community policing, which is a precursor to state police.\n\n\u201cLet me use this opportunity as the Chairman of the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum to say that we have since set up committees on restructuring, the role of traditional rulers, engagement with the youth and even economic reforms of the region.\n\n\u201cThe reports of these committees will also be submitted to the Constitutional Review Committee for consideration.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022DPR targets to remit N900bn to FAAC in Q2\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has expressed interest in purchasing a 20 per cent minority equity stake in Dangote Refinery, Lagos, reputed to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refining facility and the world\u2019s largest single-train plant.\n\nThe 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) integrated refinery, expected to process a variety of light and medium grades of crude, including petrol and diesel as well as jet fuel and polypropylene is owned by Nigeria\u2019s Dangote Group and is worth about $15 billion.\n\nIt is designed to produce up to 50 million litres of petrol and 15 million litres of diesel a day, roughly 10.4 million tonnes of the product, 4.6 million tonnes of diesel, and 4 million tonnes of jet fuel per year, in addition to having a fertiliser plant, which will utilise the refinery by-products as raw materials.\n\nNNPC Chief Operating Officer, Refining and Petrochemicals, Mr. Mustapha Yakubu, unfolded the investment plans yesterday at the end of a two-day Nigeria Oil and Gas Opportunity Fair (NOGOF), 2021, tagged: \u201cLeveraging Opportunities and Synergies for Post Pandemic Recovery of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry.\u201d\n\nHe spoke just as the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has said it is targeting to generate and remit about N900 billion into the Federation Account in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nYakubu said discussions were already ongoing with the Dangote Group for the acquisition of the stake.\n\nHe stated during the virtual event that the collaboration will further ensure undisrupted product supply to Nigerians when the deal materialises.\n\nHe added that one of its divisions, the Greenfield Refining Projects Division (GRPD) was handling the negotiations.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have what we call the green field refinery and the Greenfield Refining Projects Division (GRPD) of the NNPC. What we do, our strategy is to collaborate and seek strategic partnerships with private investors.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we have Dangote Refinery, which is the 650,000 capacity barrels per day plus a mini 80,000 tonnes per annum petrochemical plant.\n\n\u201cWhat are we doing there? I can tell you today that we are seeking to have a 20 per cent minority stake in Dangote Refinery as part of our collaboration and you know that there\u2019s a huge quantity of crude for that refinery.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s 650,000 barrels, going into a single crude distillation unit (CDU).\n\nWhen that comes on board, it will also wet the nation for us.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the corporation is also interested in partnering with the African Refinery in Port Harcourt, a co-location facility, the CNCEC Chinese group, which is interested in building two refineries in Nigeria, the Waltersmith modular plant, in addition to collaborating with Azikel refineries on condensate production.\n\nYakubu stated that notwithstanding the global push for renewables, Nigeria has a local, domestic and regional market for hydrocarbons.\n\nHe added that Africa will continue to rely on fossil fuels at least in the next 20 years.\n\nHe said the country would not just fold its arms and do nothing with its hydrocarbons just because the International Energy Agency (IEA) has predicted a net-zero emissions scenario by 2050.\n\n\u201cToday, when you are bringing products into Nigeria, they disappear to neighbouring countries. There\u2019s nowhere in countries around Nigeria that they sell fuel for less than N400 per litre. So, there\u2019s a market,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the country\u2019s non-functional refineries, he said there was a deliberate effort to power the refineries down because of the need to do a full rehabilitation beyond the regular turnaround maintenance.\n\n\u201cWe believe the only way to do that is to power them down to reduce some of the cost. We have heard that we are spending so much money on the refineries, yet they are idle.\n\n\u201cOf course, there are costs associated with idle refineries; we have staff salaries and remuneration and then the power plant utility operations. And also we need to maintain the plants in terms of preservation and lost investments because they are assets that we believe can be brought to life,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that the NNPC was exiting the running of the country\u2019s four refineries, and it has recently called for bids from competent and qualified contractors for that purpose.\n\nYakubu explained that NNPC was not in the best position to run the refineries and has opted for a new model, the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) for the running of the facilities.\n\nHe added that it is important to bring in O&M professionals, especially given the fact that as an engineer in the NNPC, no matter how competent, the employee must exit when they hit 60 years of age.\n\nThe COO said Expression of Interest (EoI) for organisations that would run the refineries was already out and many people had been evaluated.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the NNPC will choose the best contractors to handle the project.\n\nAccording to him, it is becoming more difficult to get local lenders to finance fossil fuel businesses because of the renewable energy drive, adding that the NNPC is also looking for investors for the rehabilitation of its pipelines because they remain the best way to transport products from refineries to depots.\n\nDPR Targets N900bn Remittance into Federation Account in Q2\n\nThe DPR has said it is targeting to generate and remit about N900 billion into the Federation Account in the second quarter of the year.\n\nThe agency has also received over $20 billion investment proposals since the inauguration of the Oil and Gas Excellence Centre (NOGEC) in Lagos by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe Director of DPR, Mr. Sarki Auwalu, at a strategic management session with the management of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) yesterday in Lagos, said the agency exceeded its first quarter revenue generation target by 6.99 per cent and that the actual amount it remitted was N452 billion.\n\nThe NEITI team was led by its Executive Secretary, Dr. Orji Ogbonnaya Orji, who said the team came to seek partnership with DPR on how to collectively ensure transparency and create value for Nigerians through the country\u2019s oil and gas sector.\n\nAuwalu added that the agency was working to double the first quarter remittance and is trying to support the government to deliver services to the people.\n\n\u201cJanuary to March, we exceeded our target by 6.99 per cent. Actual collection, first quarter, N452 billion already sent to government and between April, May and June, I think if we are lucky, we will double this.\n\n\u201cIt is expected to be around N900 billion, which is the budgeted figure. We are trying our best to support this government to make sure that this government really works for Nigerians,\u201d Auwalu said.\n\nHe stated that the agency was serious about recovering whatever was due to the government which could be through withholding service instruments and penalties.\n\nHe added that the agency would rather want more royalties than penalties as a business enabler and a revenue generator.\n\nAuwalu said this could be achieved through the various strategies adopted by the agency like automation of business and making sure that it improves transparency and accountability.\n\nHowever, the DPR boss said since the inauguration of the National Oil and Gas Excellence Centre (NOGEC) by the president, DPR had received investment proposals of over $20 billion from local and foreign investors.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "REPORTER'S DIARY: 'Who Did You Come To See?' \u2014 A Visit To The 'Racist' Shi Shi Chinese Restaurant In Lagos",
          "text": "What better place to have lunch than a restaurant accused of racism?\n\nSaharaReporters visited Shi Shi Chinese restaurant on Thursday due to multiple allegations of racism towards Nigerian visitors to the restaurant, located at 21B, Emina Crescent, off Toyin Street, Ikeja, Lagos.\n\nOur Experience\n\nOn arriving Shi Shi, tucked away in a residential area in Ikeja, we approached the gate.\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" we called out to the grumpy and irritated-looking security guard.\n\n\"Who did you come to see?\" he queried. Taken aback by the question, the SaharaReporters correspondent asked: \"Is this not a restaurant?\"\n\nThe security guard looked as if he was contemplating a response, but seemed to think twice about it and stepped back.\n\nThe team proceeded (we came disguised as a company of people who had come to hang out).\n\nThe entrance smelt of something funny, but the source of the smell was not readily visible. There was a show glass displaying what looked like bags made of real leather. We made our way into the dimly-lit restaurant. Inside, we approached the front desk, which had a stern-looking female Chinese national at the register (probably trying to reconcile the books). She barely looked up, save for the Nigerian attendants/waiters who looked completely bewildered and almost shocked that we were standing there.\n\nIn the sitting area, two Asian men were seated, looking on at us. A member of the team turned back and requested with an assertive voice: \"Can I see your menu?\" The announcement was to deflect from our main mission there.\n\nWe were ushered to a seat, five of us on a round table overlooking a transparent glass and an outdoor sitting area. As the menu arrived, so did about three waiters, circling for no reason, with one making as if she wanted to serve tea, all the while peeking into our phones.\n\nThe Wait\n\nAs we awaited our moderately-priced fried rice and spaghetti, we made small talk, sipping the tea. By now, apart from the waiters who looked aloof and were now stationed at strategic points in the restaurant, the stern-looking Chinese lady behind the counter was now sitting close by in the restaurant.\n\nShe beckoned to another lady (Chinese) and spoke something to her in their language, while motioning at us. The new lady in the most inconspicuous manner (even for an amateur) started taking photos of us and recording. I caught her glance and she tried to look away while concealing her phone.

In some countries, these attacks come at a very high cost.\n\nThis reduces the level of trust people have in the internet or systems that use the internet. For instance, when it comes to savings, some people prefer not to save their money in traditional banks; and trusting their savings with a fintech company would probably be their last option.\n\nAnd that\u2019s only one example\u2013 there\u2019s a lot of customer data scattered across other tech-enabled services. Losing your money is perhaps the least harmful way cyber fraud can harm you.\n\nFirstly, your data could be used to carry out illegal activities which could put you in even more trouble. Secondly, your company\u2019s trade secrets or other sensitive business data could be leaked to the public. You could lose your good reputation in a blink.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done to improve cybersecurity measures, and the work of improving these measures isn\u2019t the sole responsibility of tech companies. In our present digital age, traditional sectors like oil and gas need new and more effective ways to protect their customers from cyber fraud, too.\n\nAn estimated $103.1bn was spent on security-related software, hardware and services in 2019 and this spending is expected to increase to $133.8bn by 2022. However, improving cybersecurity measures will not only involve spending more on security but also making it a part of the company culture. Every employee should have a role to play in keeping the organization safe.\n\nTomorrow at 11 am on TechCabal Live, we will be discussing with Adeoluwa, Daniel, Joseph, Sophina and Nick about some of the best practices they\u2019ve picked up in the course of their careers.\n\nRegister here to join the event.\n\nAdeoluwa is a skilled Information Security Professional. He has built a career spanning about 20 years in the field and has honed his expertise in some of the world\u2019s leading organizations, including Barclays, Brown Shipley and the British Council.\n\nDaniel is the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at Evolve Credit, a loan and financial products marketplace. He is responsible for building the backend infrastructure, driving product roadmap, leading the technical team and driving company strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Joseph led the United Capital Group of companies to transition to a 100% remote work structure due to the COVID limitation while improving services and automation, leading to a 61% growth in revenue for the year ended 2020, with customers transacting seamlessly and securely.\n\nSophina is a cybersecurity professional currently working with a leading financial services firm. She has in previous years worked on providing digital and holistic security support to various marginalized communities and NGOs across Nigeria and Africa at large. She also collaborated on creating digital security guides to such organisations and communities to stay safe.\n\nNick Maxwell is a cybersecurity and networking industry professional with a passion for learning, working and creating a better understanding of the concerns and needs of clients and partners, across several regions in a variety of verticals. He has over 13 years experience in the technology industry and has worked for multinational, leading technology companies.\n\nAttendees will be able to ask the speakers questions in an interactive session.\n\nRegister here to join the event.",

          "text": "Nigerian public procurement and regulation can be labyrinthine, but recent policy reforms and the model of good practice provided by Kaduna State hint at opportunities for public-purpose innovation to flourish in the country. The result could be more accountable and effective governance institutions.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic found Nigeria\u2019s health system largely unprepared. When the Federal Government first announced a lockdown in March 2020, the country only had 6 testing centres. With a population of 200 million across 36 states, it needed to expand its ability to test quickly. One of the government\u2019s readiest supporters in this situation, the genomics research startup 54gene, had only been on the scene for a year. 54gene studies the African genome in order to personalise medication for Africans. It put these research capabilities to use establishing its DNA biobank lab as Nigeria\u2019s first accredited private testing centre and\u2013strikingly\u2013converting shipping containers into mobile testing laboratories, helping to augment testing capacity.\n\n\n\n54gene is one of many high-quality startups driving large investments into the Nigerian ecosystem and earning its position alongside Kenya, South Africa and Egypt as Africa\u2019s top four VC funding destinations\u2013Africa\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d. The government partnered with 54gene out of necessity, but broader gains await should it systematically seek out such partnerships as a means to achieving its service delivery and administrative rationalisation goals. Its capacity to deliver on plans to digitise all government operations is questionable\u2013the 2020 UN e-government survey revealed that Nigeria\u2019s online service quality declined from already low levels in 20181. Accountable and well-managed partnerships with innovative startups can tip the scales in its favour, here and in other areas: improving education, promoting sustainable forms of energy and tackling healthcare challenges from both the most served verticals and some of the most pressing governance challenges.\n\n1 According to the UN e-government survey, Nigeria\u2019s online service index declined from 0.5278 in 2018 to 0.5176 in 2020. Scores range from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).\n\n\n\nPolicy progress?\n\nThe Federal Government looks to be aware of this opportunity. Its recently released National Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship Policy aims to prioritise the use of tools developed by Nigerian startups to automate public processes and services, including modifying the Procurement Act to better allow for the procurement of innovation. It has also mandated Nigerian companies with large public sector IT contracts to engage Nigerian startups as R&D partners on the projects. Ideally, a more immediate intervention to consider is introducing the Nigeria Sustainable Development Goals Fintech Hackathon. In its first iteration, the hackathon will allow FinTech startups with innovative approaches to agricultural credit schemes, cash transfers to the financially vulnerable and clean energy to partner with relevant public sector bodies.\n\nThese are all steps that, on their surface, should enable more startups to work with it. However, to truly capitalise on potential gains, the government must focus on unravelling deep-seated behavioural barriers to access. The strength of these biases\u2013such as a preference for partnering with large, established companies and a tendency for harsh regulation of innovation\u2013will determine how well the above-mentioned initiatives play out.\n\nLabyrinths of Procurement and Regulation\n\nThere is plenty of evidence of these biases\u2019 detrimental impact on the potential for partnerships. When the Nigeria Railway Commission (NRC) started the train line between Kaduna State and the Federal Capital Territory, a payments startup called Payant Technologies sent in an unsolicited proposal to handle the digital booking and payments infrastructure. They didn\u2019t receive a response.\n\nUndeterred, Payant sent another in when the official request for Expressions Of Interest came out, but this also went unanswered. Why? The NRC was, according to its eligibility criteria, only looking for companies with an annual turnover of a billion naira ($2.4 million) or more, something only a few startups in Nigeria have. Preferring to work with large firms does more than stymie startup growth. It could lead to vendor lock-in and eventually, bilateral dependence between government and supplier. Both do not bode well for the quality of services rendered.\n\nHarsh regulatory policies also deter local and global partnerships. Like US-headquartered 54gene, many of Nigeria\u2019s best startups have chosen to incorporate outside the country. When one defines startup location as a place of incorporation, Nigeria falls out of the top four African VC funding locations\u2013the most adversely impacted country.\n\nThis year alone, government actors have stopped banks from processing transactions associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and issued a cease and desist to investment startups offering access to foreign securities. Both actions have negatively impacted startups working in those spaces. More importantly, they may signal an unwillingness to cooperate that will put off startups serving the government market.\n\nAso Villa Demo Day \u2013 Enterprise 54\n\nFor Inspiration, Look Local\n\nMitigating these and other negative behaviours will be hard work. But the Federal Government need not look far for inspiration; it can take a page out of the Kaduna State Government (KDSG)\u2019s Govtech playbook. Govtech developments in Kaduna have unfolded as part of a broader governance reform programme; reform has itself been driven by the capable leadership of seasoned public servant Nasir El-Rufai. Elected for a second term in 2019, perhaps the most important quality Governor El-Rufai brings to the table is a capacity for making unpopular but ultimately effective decisions. He previously displayed this capacity as Minister of the Federal Capital Territory from 2003 to 2007; in the face of limited resources, he downsized the civil service, an action he is repeating in Kaduna.\n\nBuoyed by experienced leadership, KDSG is blazing the trail for both digital government interventions and partnering with startups and SMEs. Its globally recognised Eyes and Ears budget monitoring program enables citizens, via a mobile app, to provide feedback on public infrastructure projects. It worked with Yellow Line Services, a Kaduna-based IT company, to facilitate electronic voting during its 2018 local government elections, Nigeria\u2019s first and Africa\u2019s second electronic voting exercise. It has recently signed a deal with drone-delivery unicorn Zipline to deliver Covid vaccines and other on-demand medications. According to the World Bank\u2019s latest subnational Doing Business ratings, Kaduna is the most accessible state to register property and get contracts enforced in Nigeria. Kaduna\u2019s example is an exciting preview of what could be should the Federal Government follow through on a promising start.\n\nWritten by Tolu Segun, Fellow at StateUp.\n\nStateUp is a leading provider of public-purpose technology intelligence. We aim to bridge the gap between the worlds of government and technology through specialist, multi-disciplinary advisory, training, and information services focused on digital innovation that serves a public purpose.",

          "text": "OPay is reportedly in talks to raise $400 million from investors at a valuation of $1.5 billion, according to an exclusive report from The Information.\n\nOPay is looking to raise funding to finance its expansion plan, having launched in Egypt this year. The payments giant says it processed $1.4 billion in payments in October 2020 alone, and that number also reportedly increased to $2 billion by December 2020.\n\nHaving done impressively in Nigeria since its launch in 2018, the new push for funding means that the company has bigger plans.\n\nAn Africa-focused company with Chinese backers\n\nWhile OPay is based in Nigeria, its backers are mostly Chinese companies like Meituan, a multi-billion-dollar Chinese shopping platform.\n\nIn July 2019, OPay raised $50 million from Sequoia Capital, IDG Capital, Source Code, GSR Ventures and Meituan-Dianping. Opera itself also invested in the round. Four months later, it raised a massive $120 million in a Series B round.\n\nThe company\u2019s initial play seemed to be focused on building a super-app, and it led with its popular bike-hailing service, ORide. But the ban on bike hailing in Nigeria stopped that, and the company focused on what had always been at its core: payments.\n\nThe pandemic is one factor that spurred growth for OPay, and as social distancing and Covid-19 regulations made banking halls challenging to access, more people are leaning on mobile money services. The company also has plans to roll out debit and credit cards.\n\nCompetition in the mobile payments space is stiff; while at one time OPay seemed to be the only company growing its agent network, other rivals have now tapped into the same network. Telcos like MTN and Airtel are spinning their mobile money arm into standalone businesses as they are betting on it for the future.\n\nIt means that at home, where OPay may claim dominance, challengers are arising, and outside Nigeria, grabbing market share from more established players will be no easy feat. Yet, should they successfully raise $400 million, it will be the kind of war chest that makes anything possible.",

          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria. 26th of May, 2021. \u2013 In the recently released Africa\u2019s Best Brands 2021, TECNO ranked for five consecutive years among the TOP 6 brands on the African continent, marking another prestigious recognition of the brand\u2019s leadership in Africa.\n\nEstablished in 2011, the Brand Africa 100: Africa\u2019s Best Brands rankings is the most authoritative survey and analysis on brands and underlying businesses in Africa, based on a study by Geopoll across 28 countries spanning all the five economic regions and analysis and ranking by Kantar and Brand Leadership. Collectively they account for over 80% of the population and over 80% of the GDP of Africa. The 2021 survey was conducted between March and April 2021 and yielded over 80,000 brand mentions and over 3,500 unique brands.\n\nSince its entry into the African market, TECNO\u2019s operations have been customer focused. Year in year out, they have ensured that their offerings are tailored to meet the needs of Africans.\n\nSpeaking to this at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Vincent Uzoegbu, Public Communications Manager, TECNO said; \u201cFrom the first day of our business, TECNO made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.\u201d\n\nTECNO has worked tirelessly all these years to do just that. With the brand\u2019s Phantom, Camon, Spark and Pova smartphone series, TECNO has been able to set numerous records that define its success and popularity on the continent, evident of its dogged resolve to present Africa with the best of technology and innovation. When TECNO launched dual SIM cards in Africa, there had been nothing of the kind before then. TECNO was also the first to develop long-lasting batteries that lasted 3 days to combat the epileptic power supply in places like Nigeria.

          "text": "OctaFX brought two popular bloggers together in a cooking studio: the comedian Apaokagi Maryam and the music video director Abdulazeez Greene. They prepared a special evening meal for Ramadan called Iftar and compared the subtleties of cooking with those ingrained in trading.\n\n\u2018Ramadan Special\u2019 is the first cooking show in Nigeria produced by a financial company. However, OctaFX had two great reasons for this accomplishment.\n\nFirst, the company honoured the Holy Month along with its clients. Ramadan is about being with your family, and what better way to bring the relatives together than cooking a tasty meal?\n\nSecond, trading and cooking surprisingly have a lot in common. The two hosts of the show explored this correlation while putting together ingredients for their very own blend of Iftar\u2014a popular evening meal for Ramadan.\n\nThe duo prepared this particular version of iftar quite close to Nigerian tradition, including a fruit salad, grilled chicken, grapes, dates, jollof rice, and a vegetable salad. Influencers Abdulazeez Greene and Apaokagi Maryam rose up to the challenge to deliver this delicious meal.\n\nApaokagi Maryam is a frequent collaborator of the global Forex broker and took part in the last OctaFX Goal Booster promotion. According to Rosbena, she ranked first among the \u2018Top Ten Nigerian Instagram Comedians\u2019. Neither influencers are professional traders but have already had their fair share of exciting Forex encounters.\n\nThe show went live on YouTube on 8 May and is available for viewing. This is not OctaFX\u2019s first take on producing a show. The company enjoys experimenting with formats to bring its clients the most engaging and useful content. In March 2021, OctaFX stepped into an exciting collaboration with the popular rapper Peruzzi, taking part in his music video \u2018Somebody Baby\u2019.\n\nOctaFX is committed to educating its clients about trading in accessible and appealing ways. The company is aspiring to create more shows like \u2018Ramadan Special\u2019 in the future.\n\nOctaFX is a global broker that provides online trading services worldwide since 2011. It offers a state-of-the-art trading experience to over 7 million trading accounts globally. OctaFX has won more than 40 awards since its foundation, including the \u2018Best ECN Broker 2020\u2019 award from World Finance and more recently the 2020 \u2018Best Forex Broker Nigeria\u2019 award and the 2020\u2032\n\nMost Transparent Broker\u2019 award from Global Banking & Finance Review and Forex Awards, respectively.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNCC to take subscribers\u2019 IMEI | Newsbites\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "On Monday, May 24, 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced new licensing requirements for Payment Service Providers (PSPs) in Nigeria.\n\nThe new requirements apply to companies registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and wish to apply for new licences or renew old ones.\n\nThese requirements relate to licences for Switching and Processing, Mobile Money Operators (MMOs), Payment Solution Services (PSSs), Super Agent, Payment Solution Service Providers (PSSPs), and Payment Terminal Service Providers (PTSPs).\n\nThere is a flat application fee of \u20a6100,000 for all categories, and if an application is successful, \u20a61m is to be paid into CBN\u2019s Licensing fee for Payment Products account. This excludes other additional financial requirements for each category.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwitching companies like Interswitch that facilitate communication between different payment service providers are expected to have \u20a62 billion in shareholders\u2019 funds and deposit an escrow of \u20a62 billion into CBN before getting the Switching and Processing licence.\n\nThe same requirements also apply to the MMO licence for mobile apps like Paga and OPay used to send and receive money.\n\nCompanies applying for a PTSP or PSSP licence are expected to have \u20a6100 million in shareholders\u2019 funds and deposit an escrow of \u20a6100 million into CBN.\n\nPTSPs like CitiServe deploy and maintain payment terminals for banks, while PSSP like Paystack and Flutterwave accept electronic payments.\n\nFor a Super Agent licence required to provide an agent network for deploying payment services, companies like the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) must have \u20a650 million in shareholders\u2019 funds and deposit an escrow of the same amount.\n\nA company looking to get a PSS licence, which encompasses all earlier mentioned licences, is expected to have \u20a6250 million in shareholders funds and deposit an escrow of the same amount.\n\nFor all categories, shareholders\u2019 funds must be unimpaired by losses, escrow deposits made in full, and payments made in the name of the company applying for the licence \u2014 not an individual or related company.\n\nAccording to the CBN, the escrow deposits are refundable and will be invested in treasury bills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecall that in December 2020, CBN made changes to its licence categorisation, dividing up payment system licences into four broad categories: Switching and Processing, MMOs, PSSs, and Regulatory Sandboxes.\n\nThus, the previous PSP licence with its tier systems no longer applies.\n\nComparing the old with the new\n\nIn comparison with CBN\u2019s previous requirements, there are very few differences. These new requirements act as a further explanation in line with the apex bank\u2019s decision to create new categories.\n\nIt introduces the following:\n\nEscrow deposits are to be invested in treasury bills.\n\nAll payments must be made in the applying company\u2019s name.\n\nAn Information Technology policy detailing ten different policies relating to cybersecurity, data privacy, and physical security.\n\nOther documentary requirements peculiar to each category.\n\nIn addition to these new requirements, the document does not state how much it would cost to renew a licence, a licence\u2019s validity, or how long the CBN should hold escrow deposits.\n\nIt is also important to note that in comparison with the old PSP tier system \u2014 super licence, standard licence, and basic licence \u2014 there are reductions in the required minimum Shareholders\u2019 Fund (SHF) and application fees.\n\nSwitching and Processing, PSSPs, PTSPs, and Super Agent (super licence) \u2014 no longer apply: \u20a63 billion reduction in minimum SHF, \u20a61,900,000 reduction in application fees.\n\nMMOs, Non-Bank Merchant Acquiring, and Super Agent (standard licence) \u2014 no longer apply: \u20a61 billion reduction in minimum SHF, \u20a6900,000 reduction in application fees.\n\nPSSPs, PTSPs, and Super Agent (basic licence) \u2014 no longer apply: no change in minimum SHF, no change in application fees.\n\nWhat does this mean for fintechs?\n\nFintechs wishing to get into the PSP space have to meet all the requirements stated in the document. While these requirements are not new and even seem favourable, they might pose challenges for cash strapped startups.\n\nHowever, the requirements set by the CBN are there for a reason. The PSP space is a capital-intensive industry, and these requirements will prevent unscrupulous persons from handling large sums of money.\n\nFor fintechs already in the PSP space, further guidelines are needed regarding the specific amount to be paid in renewal fees. This is doubly interesting because the CBN\u2019s deadline for compliance is the end of June 2021.\n\nWhy is the apex bank just releasing these guidelines? Did it communicate these requirements with the PSPs? Why take the PSPs by surprise?\n\nRegister to attend the largest educators\u2019 event in Africa. Edves Catalyst 2021: \u201cA New Path\u201d.

These new requirements act as a further explanation in line with the apex bank\u2019s decision to create new categories.\n\nIt introduces the following:\n\nEscrow deposits are to be invested in treasury bills.\n\nAll payments must be made in the applying company\u2019s name.\n\nAn Information Technology policy detailing ten different policies relating to cybersecurity, data privacy, and physical security.\n\nOther documentary requirements peculiar to each category.\n\nIn addition to these new requirements, the document does not state how much it would cost to renew a licence, a licence\u2019s validity, or how long the CBN should hold escrow deposits.\n\nIt is also important to note that in comparison with the old PSP tier system \u2014 super licence, standard licence, and basic licence \u2014 there are reductions in the required minimum Shareholders\u2019 Fund (SHF) and application fees.\n\nSwitching and Processing, PSSPs, PTSPs, and Super Agent (super licence) \u2014 no longer apply: \u20a63 billion reduction in minimum SHF, \u20a61,900,000 reduction in application fees.\n\nMMOs, Non-Bank Merchant Acquiring, and Super Agent (standard licence) \u2014 no longer apply: \u20a61 billion reduction in minimum SHF, \u20a6900,000 reduction in application fees.\n\nPSSPs, PTSPs, and Super Agent (basic licence) \u2014 no longer apply: no change in minimum SHF, no change in application fees.\n\nWhat does this mean for fintechs?\n\nFintechs wishing to get into the PSP space have to meet all the requirements stated in the document. While these requirements are not new and even seem favourable, they might pose challenges for cash strapped startups.\n\nHowever, the requirements set by the CBN are there for a reason. The PSP space is a capital-intensive industry, and these requirements will prevent unscrupulous persons from handling large sums of money.\n\nFor fintechs already in the PSP space, further guidelines are needed regarding the specific amount to be paid in renewal fees. This is doubly interesting because the CBN\u2019s deadline for compliance is the end of June 2021.\n\nWhy is the apex bank just releasing these guidelines? Did it communicate these requirements with the PSPs? Why take the PSPs by surprise?\n\nRegister to attend the largest educators\u2019 event in Africa. Edves Catalyst 2021: \u201cA New Path\u201d.

          "text": "\u201cKnowledge is power. Information is liberating. Education is the premise of progress, in every society, in every family.\u201d \u2013 Kofi Annan.\n\nEducation is vital for any society looking to make any form of progress. In Africa, however, that is not always the case. The United Nations Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) reports that close to half of Africa\u2019s population is under 18.\n\nThanks to steady growth in births and declining child mortality rates, Africa\u2019s child population is expected to reach the 1 billion mark by 2055.\n\nAccording to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics, one in five children between the ages of 6 and 11 are out of school. That number increases as the children get older, with one-third of youth between the ages of 12 and 14 out of school and almost 60% of youth between 15 and 17 out of school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese numbers are more startling when we consider school enrolments by gender. Nine million African girls between the ages of 6 and 11 will never go to school compared to 6 million African boys. By the time these children are adolescents, the exclusion rate for girls is 36% compared to 32% for boys.\n\nRecognising the role of education in development, the United Nations designated quality education as one of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nEdtech startups are rising to the occasion in Africa. Although they do not receive as much coverage or funding as fintech or agritech startups in Africa, they supplement the job of the continent\u2019s existing educational structures. However, they face a major hurdle with low internet penetration meaning that only a few children can access these services.\n\nData from Techpoint Intelligence showing the percentage of students with access to digital connectivity in West Africa reveals that The Gambia has the highest rate of digital connectivity among school-age children with 65%.\n\nNigeria, on the other hand, has just 3% of school-age children able to access the Internet at home despite having more edtech startups than any other African country.\n\nThe sector has grown consistently, with a Briter Bridges report stating that there are over 210 edtech startups on the continent as of Q1 2020. These startups adopt different models but with the same goal, making learning seamless while getting outstanding outcomes.\n\nListed in no particular order below are 11 randomly selected edtech startups you should check out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nuLesson\n\nFollowing stints at Konga, DealDey, and E-motion Advertising, Nigerian serial entrepreneur, Sim Shagaya, founded uLesson in 2019 to bridge the gap in learning for kids in secondary schools across Africa.\n\nSince its launch, the startup has recorded more than one million app downloads and raised over $10 million from investors, making it one of Africa\u2019s best-funded edtech startups.\n\nCurrently serving students in Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and The Gambia, uLesson has its sights trained on the East and South African regions in its expansion plans.\n\nUsing interactive videos and focusing on producing content that students enjoy, uLesson seeks to augment the existing educational systems.\n\nIt can be accessed through an Android device or a Windows PC for a relatively affordable fee. Depending on what plan a user chooses, they could end up paying as little as $6 monthly.\n\nTuteria\n\nIn 2005, Godwin Benson was not paid for tutoring services he rendered. Worse still, the man who hired him searched for two months before he found him.\n\nThat experience inspired him to co-found Tuteria \u2014 an online platform that connects people who want to learn to people who can teach them \u2014 with Abiola Oyeniyi in 2015.\n\nSome of the startup\u2019s investors include Microsoft, Facebook, and the Royal Academy of Engineering.\n\nPrepClass\n\nPrepClass was founded in 2014 by Chukwuwezam Obanor and Olumide Ogunlana to address the severe shortage of trained teachers in Nigeria. Similar to Tuteria, PrepClass connects learners and tutors for a fee. The startup has raised over $400,000 from investors such as Venture Garden Group and Africa Angels Network.\n\nPass.ng\n\nExaminations are an important part of the educational system. For a long time, the only resources available to Nigerian students preparing for examinations like the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) were voluminous past questions. But with Pass.ng, students have the opportunity to test their knowledge of different subjects through a series of mock tests.\n\nAlthough the startup initially focused on students preparing for WAEC and the Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination \u2014 now the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) \u2014 it currently supports tests for the University of Lagos (UNILAG) diploma programme and the Federal Government\u2019s N-Power programme.\n\nM-Shule\n\nLaunched in January 2016 by Julie Otieno and Claire Mongeau, Kenyan edtech startup, M-Shule, utilises artificial intelligence to deliver personalised learning experiences to learners through SMS and chatbots. Performance data from students is then shared with parents, schools, and teachers to enhance the learning process.\n\nAmbani Africa\n\nAs more parts of Africa become urbanised, there is the danger that indigenous African languages would be lost in the process. For families that feel this way, Ambani uses augmented reality (AR) to teach young people African languages. The languages currently available on the app include isiZulu, isiXhosa, Setswana, Sepedi, Tshivenda, and English.\n\nSmartix Education\n\nGhanaian-based Smartix Education develops learning solutions for students using animated videos, activities, and books delivered through an Android and web app. It also runs a vacation school for students in kindergarten and upwards.\n\nSyafunda\n\nSyafunda was founded in 2013 by Zakheni Ngubo in South Africa to provide access to digital content. The startup partners with local content developers setting up digital libraries in places where Internet connection is limited or non-existent.\n\neLimu\n\nThe Kenyan edtech startup\u2019s name means education in Swahili, and it creates educational apps and content for students in primary school. In 2020, it was acquired by CcHUB as part of its content creation expansion plans. The idea for eLimu was conceived by Marie Githinji and Nivi Mukherjee in Kenya\u2019s iHub; the startup uses local examples to teach concepts to students.\n\nKidato\n\nPublic schools in Africa have a high student-to-teacher ratio of 1:50. An alternative is private schools which have a student-to-teacher ratio of 1:20. However, this comes at a steep price for parents. Kenyan serial entrepreneur, Sam Gichuru, founded Kidato to solve this problem after he had to take his children out of school to be homeschooled.\n\nThe startup was accepted into Y Combinator in 2021. Kidato is an online school for students between the ages of 4 and 18. It offers both regular academic classes and after-school lessons for students. To ensure that the students also have the interaction that occurs in regular schools, the school takes students on monthly educational field trips.\n\nGradely\n\nGradely provides an adaptive learning platform that helps parents and schools identify learning gaps in students and recommends specific ways to close those gaps. It was founded in 2019 by Boye Oshinaga, Femi Ibiwoye, Seyi Adelaju, and Babatunde Caleb, and counts Microtraction as one of its investors.\n\nFeatured image credit: Global Partnership for Education \u2013 GPE Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nRegister to attend the largest educators\u2019 event in Africa.

We introduced the Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EDOBEST) programme, where we have efficiently deployed and utilized technology to impact knowledge on our pupils.\n\n\u201cThey can now read and write with the aid of technology. The activities of teachers can easily be monitored; they have also benefited as we have enhanced their skills, using technology.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Kallon said the delegation was in Benin to reinforce partnership with the government and to see how they can work better in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nHe noted that a part of the aim for the visit was to discuss ideas that would put an end to irregular migration among youths in Edo.\n\n...",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has reportedly pledged N600 million to the Akwa Ibom State Government in support of the building of a hospital in the state.\n\nThe hospital project \u2013 Akwa Ibom State University Teaching Hospital \u2013 is located in Awa, Onna Local Government Area of the state.\n\nPunch newspaper quoted Mr Wike\u2019s media aide, Kelvin Ebiri, as saying that the governor made the pledge on Wednesday while performing a groundbreaking ceremony for the hospital project.\n\nThe hospital project is a partnership between the Akwa Ibom Government and Bua Group which announced an initial support of N2.5 billion for the project, the Akwa Ibom State Government said in a statement.\n\nThe oil-rich Rivers State shares a boundary with Akwa Ibom, another state that is also rich in petroleum oil. Both states are ruled by the Peoples Democratic Party.\n\nMr Wike in January made a similar pledge of N500 million towards the rebuilding of a market destroyed by fire in Sokoto State, Nigeria\u2019s North-west region.\n\nThe pledge had sparked controversy because of a lingering dispute over the non-payment of pensions and gratuity to thousands of retired civil servants in Rivers State.\n\nThe Chairperson of the Nigerian Union of Pensioners in the state, Collins Nwankwo, last December, threatened to lead his members into the street for a protest against the state government over the unpaid pensions, according to a report by Punch newspaper.\n\nMr Nwankwo said the pensioners had made several pleas to Mr Wike, and that the governor was just insensitive to their plight.\n\n\u201cIt is very pathetic that the usual payment of gratuities, pension arrears and death benefits which hitherto was a thing of joy, has become a source of punishment to our living pensioners and the survivors of the deceased ones.\n\n\u201cSince the inception of the present administration in 2015, no dime has been paid in this direction and all efforts towards getting our government to consider the need to address them are never admitted. At a point, when all these efforts fail, we will embark on the protest. We will have to talk to those who will be able to walk,\u201d Mr Nwankwo said.\n\nGovernor Wike\u2019s media aide, Mr Ebiri did not respond to calls and a text message seeking comment from him.\n\n\u2018Akwa Ibom, Niger Delta safe for investors\u2019\n\nMr Wike, while in Akwa Ibom, also performed a groundbreaking ceremony for Sterling Petro-Chemicals and Fertiliser Production plant in Eastern Obolo.\n\nThe governor said Akwa Ibom and Niger Delta are safe for investors.\n\n\u201cIf Akwa Ibom State is not safe, will investors come here? Investors are here because the governor has provided an enabling environment and that gives confidence to the investors. If a place is not secure for people to invest their money, we won\u2019t be here.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind the enemies of the people who will always say that Niger Delta is not safe. If it is not safe, can anyone come and invest money here?\u201d Mr Wike said.",

PEARL will commence the formulation of eco-friendly products and provide superior innovative treatment chemicals and application technology services to Oil and Gas exploration and production platforms, refineries, petrochemical plants, among others.\n\nPEARL\u2019s well-trained and highly experienced engineers\u2019 partner with clients to identify and proffer proper resolutions to challenges related with upstream production and downstream chemical treatment solutions, as well specialised chemical solutions for the transportation sector.\n\nThe team of engineer\u2019s support customer needs with extensive laboratory and real-time field testing to help solve queries using world class standards and industry best practice.\n\nSpeaking on the partnership, General Manager, PEARL, Franklin Oranusih said that PEARL was established out of a desire to solve industrial challenges with innovative solutions and partnerships.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe have a commitment to deliver quality and eco-friendly products as we continue to play our part in supporting local content in Africa. As the oil & gas sector continues to grow, it is expedient that we consider the effect it has on the environment, among others. This partnership is a sign of our commitment and we are delighted to announce it.\n\n\u201cWe also appreciate the support of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment and the Nigerian Content and Development Board \u2013 NCDMB for its support as we continue to fulfil this commitment.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the partnership, the Honourable Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo stated that there is a need for innovative partnerships such as this to boost local content in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to formally commission the first local content fluids and chemical solutions manufacturing plant in Nigeria, which represents a significant landmark for the country\u2019s industrialisation programme.\n\nDomestication of products has been at the centre of this administration\u2019s industrialisation programme to drive job intensive growth of the Nigerian economy.\n\nIt will increase local production, create job opportunity and improve our foreign exchange reserve position. I believe this will help in taking us ahead in our effort to diversify the economy and increase the contribution of the manufacturing sector to GDP. Most especially, the plant will provide jobs to Nigeria\u2019s workforce, promote local content, and save the nation the extra cost of importing the now locally produced input\u2019\u2019.\n\nFounded in 2001, CES Energy Solutions has extensive testing capabilities for corrosion, scale, hydrogen sulphide scavenger and other production related requirements.\n\nThe company will provide technical assistance to PEARL who is the exclusive representative for production chemicals in the oil producing countries of Africa. CES manufactures raw ingredients that PEARL formulates within Nigeria to provide field strength chemicals. CES who wanted a partner in Africa that brought their own in-house expertise and facilities to compliment CES\u2019 capabilities in North America, chose PEARL because of its impressive resume and the track record of Pacegate.\n\nAlso speaking, the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), represented by the General Manager, Project Authorisation and Certification, Engr. Paul Zuhumben, said, \u201cWe commend the effort of Pacegate Energy Resource Limited for investing an installed capacity of 12.9 metric tonnes into the manufacturing of chemicals solutions aspects of the hydrocarbon value chain in Nigeria.\n\nAt the beginning of local content implementation, the board had always emphasised that its focus will be on developing in-country capacity in manufacturing, fabrication, engineering and other high-end services supporting the oil and gas industry. This project by Pacegate speaks effectively to this\u201d\n\nPEARL manufactures a wide range of chemicals and products such as Demulsifiers & Water Clarifiers, Corrosion Inhibitors, Scale Inhibitors, Biocides, and so on, while its technology partner, CES provides upstream chemical products bases.\n\nWith PEARL\u2019s access to CES Energy Solution\u2019s global state of the art analytical and R&D laboratory capabilities as well as domain expertise for specialized test work, both companies continue to conduct innovative research and development activities to provide site specific solutions across Africa.",

          "text": "Pacegate Energy and Resources Limited (PEARL), an arm of Pacegate Limited have launched an ultra-modern manufacturing plant where drilling chemicals, water and oil-based production chemicals are formulated and manufactured in Nigeria and accessible to clients.\n\nPEARL, an Integrated Management System (ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 & ISO45001:2018) Certified will provide chemical treatment solutions, laboratory testing and services, and professional field support services to the upstream and downstream sectors, as well as other relevant sectors.\n\nThis is in a bid to meet the growing needs of the Oil and Gas and transportation sectors of the Nigerian economy and Africa at large.\n\nThis has been made possible by its partnership with global energy solutions provider, Canadian Energy Solutions (CES).\n\nThe partnership sees PEARL\u2019s wide reach in both offshore and onshore operations supported and extended by CES\u2019 global capabilities. PEARL will commence the formulation of eco-friendly products and provide superior innovative treatment chemicals and application technology services to Oil and Gas exploration and production platforms, refineries, petrochemical plants, among others.\n\nPEARL\u2019s well-trained and highly experienced engineers\u2019 partner with clients to identify and proffer proper resolutions to challenges related with upstream production and downstream chemical treatment solutions, as well specialised chemical solutions for the transportation sector.\n\nThe team of engineer\u2019s support customer needs with extensive laboratory and real-time field testing to help solve queries using world class standards and industry best practice.\n\nSpeaking on the partnership, General Manager, PEARL, Franklin Oranusih said that PEARL was established out of a desire to solve industrial challenges with innovative solutions and partnerships.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe have a commitment to deliver quality and eco-friendly products as we continue to play our part in supporting local content in Africa. As the oil & gas sector continues to grow, it is expedient that we consider the effect it has on the environment, among others. This partnership is a sign of our commitment and we are delighted to announce it.\n\n\u201cWe also appreciate the support of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment and the Nigerian Content and Development Board \u2013 NCDMB for its support as we continue to fulfil this commitment.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the partnership, the Honourable Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo stated that there is a need for innovative partnerships such as this to boost local content in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to formally commission the first local content fluids and chemical solutions manufacturing plant in Nigeria, which represents a significant landmark for the country\u2019s industrialisation programme.\n\nDomestication of products has been at the centre of this administration\u2019s industrialisation programme to drive job intensive growth of the Nigerian economy.\n\nIt will increase local production, create job opportunity and improve our foreign exchange reserve position. I believe this will help in taking us ahead in our effort to diversify the economy and increase the contribution of the manufacturing sector to GDP. Most especially, the plant will provide jobs to Nigeria\u2019s workforce, promote local content, and save the nation the extra cost of importing the now locally produced input\u2019\u2019.\n\nFounded in 2001, CES Energy Solutions has extensive testing capabilities for corrosion, scale, hydrogen sulphide scavenger and other production related requirements.\n\nThe company will provide technical assistance to PEARL who is the exclusive representative for production chemicals in the oil producing countries of Africa. CES manufactures raw ingredients that PEARL formulates within Nigeria to provide field strength chemicals. CES who wanted a partner in Africa that brought their own in-house expertise and facilities to compliment CES\u2019 capabilities in North America, chose PEARL because of its impressive resume and the track record of Pacegate.\n\nAlso speaking, the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), represented by the General Manager, Project Authorisation and Certification, Engr. Paul Zuhumben, said, \u201cWe commend the effort of Pacegate Energy Resource Limited for investing an installed capacity of 12.9 metric tonnes into the manufacturing of chemicals solutions aspects of the hydrocarbon value chain in Nigeria.\n\nAt the beginning of local content implementation, the board had always emphasised that its focus will be on developing in-country capacity in manufacturing, fabrication, engineering and other high-end services supporting the oil and gas industry. This project by Pacegate speaks effectively to this\u201d\n\nPEARL manufactures a wide range of chemicals and products such as Demulsifiers & Water Clarifiers, Corrosion Inhibitors, Scale Inhibitors, Biocides, and so on, while its technology partner, CES provides upstream chemical products bases.\n\nWith PEARL\u2019s access to CES Energy Solution\u2019s global state of the art analytical and R&D laboratory capabilities as well as domain expertise for specialized test work, both companies continue to conduct innovative research and development activities to provide site specific solutions across Africa.",

          "text": "The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), said that it has strengthened collection of taxes, rents and other royalties to meet its target of remitting N900 billion to the federation account by June this year.\n\nIn a presentation by the Director of DPR, Sarki Auwalu, during a stakeholders meeting with the Nigerian Extractive industries Initiative, NEITI in Lagos yesterday, he said the agency remitted N452 billion to the federation account in the first quarter of the year\n\nThe Director also disclosed remitting N1.5 trillion to federal government in 2020, an indication that the agency is fully tracking production and collecting revenue for government.\n\nHe said the DPR is pushing investment to help meet government\u2019s aspiration of hitting 3 million barrels a day production and 40 billion reserve base.\n\nAnwalu,regretted that put of 7,000 identified assets only about 1,500 are currently producing.\n\nIn view of that, he said the agency is about issuing licences to 57 operators that the marginal field bid round recently concluded.\n\nThe fields he said are expected to start producing first oil in 2022.\n\nLEADERSHIP reports that the federal government in a patriotic consideration had introduced the marginal field development programme in 1996 to help grow the country\u2019s oil and gas production.\n\nThe policy is to enable divestment of dormant discoveries by oil majors and making same available to indigenous operators who are nimble enough to venture into neglected terrains.\n\nThe programme has seen Shell, Total, Agip, Chevron and others surrender fields which are then allocated to marginal field operators in bid rounds.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA corollary to the programme is the development of local content in the oil and gas industry, and it is no coincidence that the Nigerian Content Act came into force in 2010, five years after the marginal field initiative was introduced.\n\nAmong other things, the Act aims to address over 50 years of capital flight of some $380 million, 2 million job losses and less than 5% in-country value addition in the oil and gas industry in Nigeria.\n\nThe marginal field development programme is a sure platform for the achievement of these ideals, and it is reassuring that Nigeria achieved 30% local content in the oil and gas industry in 2017, and hopes to take this to 70% by 2027.\n\nThe aspiration to increase Nigerian content will however, not materialise if the stock of marginal field operators dwindle not just because of the harsh operating environment but because of counter-productive pronouncements and actions by regulators.\n\nIn his earlier remark the Executive Secretary of the NEITI, Orji Ogbonnaya Orji, appealed to the agency technical support to enable it execute its mandate of monitoring the activities in the oil and gas industry.",

          "text": "CHAIRMAN of the White Paper Panel on the unlawful sales of Kwara State Government\u2019s properties from May 29, 1999 to May 29, 2019, Mr. Hussein Buhari, yesterday, indicted former Senate President and former Kwara governor, Dr. Bukola Saraki and his successor, Mr. Abdulfatah Ahmed and their cronies of economic sabotage of state properties and urged Governor Abdulrahman AbdulRazaq to prosecute them to recover the properties.\n\nThe panel, in its report, recommended a 10-year ban from political office for the indicted former governors and their aides, among others, to recover the alleged stolen properties. Buhari while submitting the report to the governor, said the affected personalities shunned the panel and failed to use the opportunity to defend themselves hence the need to prosecute them. READ ALSOOkowa blames human trafficking, irregular migration on poverty His words: \u201cThe committee swung into action immediately it was inaugurated and went through the report of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry on the sales of Kwara State Government Assets between May 1999 and May 2019. There are so many rots perpetrated by the past governments especially in the 16 years before 2019. \u201cFor instance, the rots on Shonga Farms, Satellite Motel, and our properties in Kaduna, Abuja and Lagos were simply inconceivable.\n\nThey were all sold to themselves at giveaway prices. We saw criminal conspiracies. In fact, Kwara State is now heavily indebted to some people because the past governments mismanaged our properties. \u201cI just wish Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq will have the courage and political will to implement the report so that everybody found wanting will be brought to book.\n\nAnd the Electoral Act is very clear that anybody who is found guilty of mismanagement of resources be banned for 10 years from holding political office. \u201cWe wish the government will accept our recommendations and set up an implementation committee. \u201cThe State Government should take them to court and prosecute them for economic sabotage and, if found guilty, the government should ban them from holding political offices for 10 years. Responding, Governor AbdulRazaq commended the panel for a job well done adding that the recommendations were noted for action.

It also described the state government\u2019s claims as false and diversionary. In a statement by the Press Officer on Local Matters, Abdulqadir Abdulganiy said: \u201cOur attention in the Abubakar Bukola Saraki Media Office has been drawn to a press Release released by the Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq Government titled: \u2018Assets: Try Saraki, Others for Criminal Conspiracies against Kwara.\n\nWhite paper panel tells Gov\u2019, and our initial reaction is that we are not surprised the quality of writing demonstrated in the statement and the incoherent, fallacious and salacious claims contained in it. It just shows how low governance has become in Kwara State.\n\n\u201cFirst, for the information of discerning members of the public, neither Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki who left the Office of Governor of Kwara State 10 years ago nor Alhaji Abdulfatai Ahmed, the immediate last Governor got an invite to appear before any investigative and fact-finding panel set up by the Abdulrazaq administration.\n\nThus, it is clear that the so-called investigation being conducted is not about finding facts. It is about throwing mud and staining the predecessor of Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq in Office. \u201cSecondly, while reacting to the claims contained in the poorly written and disjointed press statement, it should be noted that both Dr. Saraki and Alhaji Ahmed will never be shy of giving account of how they managed the assets of Kwara State. In fact, both men took decisions concerning those assets in a manner that will enhance their value and stimulate economic activities in the state, which was hitherto referred to as a civil service state.\n\n\u201cIt is also noteworthy that Abdulrazaq\u2019s administration has failed woefully to attract any investment in its two-years in office and has rather resorted to making false claims about how BUA Investments came to Lafiagi. This is an investment that was attracted to the state by both the Saraki and Ahmed administrations.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the press statement under reference is another one of the tactics of Abdulrazaq to divert the attention of the people from his non-performance and lack of tangible projects that can be showcased during the second anniversary of his administration, which is about 48 hours away. \u201cAbdulrahman should stop getting jittery about the name of Saraki.

This was the Minister of Finance, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed said she was not in the know of the current status of the repatriated \u00a34.2 million loot linked to a former governor of Delta State from the United Kingdom.\n\nThe two public officers had appeared at the resumed hearing of the Adhoc Committee on Assessment and Status of All Recovered Loots Movable and Immovable Assets from 2002 to 2020 by Agencies of the Federal Government of Nigeria for Effective Efficient Management and Utilisation chaired by Hon. Adejoro Adeogun.\n\nThe Committee had raised questions on the N19 billion withdrawn from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) recovery account. Idris, who listed several recovery accounts including that of the EFCC, tried to justify the withdrawals from the separate recovery accounts. According to him, the accounts were all linked by the Treasury Single Account.\n\nHe said that technically, it was an extension of the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF), submitting that approvals were obtained for the withdrawals. But his submission angered the Committee members who said that there were no appropriations for such withdrawals. According to the Committee, there must be a recourse to the law through the national assembly, of which any failure would mean a violation of the law.\n\nThe Committee stated there was no trace of any withdrawals from the recovery accounts in any Appropriation Act passed by the national parliament Insisting that withdrawals must be from the CRF with the backing of the law, the lawmakers asked that the AGF should be held responsible for any infractions.\n\n\u201cOf what essence is appropriation if you can just dip your hands and take money from government accounts?\u201d a member of the committee, Wole Oke, questioned. Incidentally, the lawmakers got the support of the Finance Minister, Ahmed who agreed that it was unconstitutional to tamper with unappropriated funds. She said though there was fiscal provision in the budget for recovered loot, such money would have to be moved to the CRF first before it can be touched. Similarly, the Minister who entertained questions on the status of the \u00a34.2 million Ibori, said she was yet to be briefed. \u201cOn the \u00a34.2 million I am still waiting to get information about this recovery.\n\nI have read in the media that the recovery has been made. But what has happened in the past is that the Attorney General would write to Mr President and report that recovery and then give advice on what needs to be done or give advice based on the negotiations that they made during the process of the recovery. \u201cAnd then that instruction is now conveyed to us. But up till now, I have not received any formal conveyance, any formal information written in respect of this \u00a34.2 million.\n\nSo I cannot say whether it is a Federal Government fund or a state fund. It depends on the advice that would come,\u201d she said. In its ruling, the Committee directed the AGF and Finance Minister to furnish it with a summary of all transactions made from the recovered loot accounts since 2002.

          "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Femi Falana on Thursday said Nigeria is on the verge of collapse as the 2023 general election is threatened in view of series of attacks on INEC offices.\n\nFalana spoke at the final sitting of the Senate Committee on the review of the 1999 Constitution, South West, Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, Zonal Public Hearing, Lagos Center, held in Ikeja, under the chairmanship of Senator Oluremi Tinubu, representing Lagos Central.\n\nAccording to Falana, Nigeria is ruled by rule of the rulers and not rule of law, lamenting that people commit all manner of crime and got away with it because there are no sanctions.\n\n\u201cThis must change. The Social Security Bill must also work so that jobless people can get stipends pending when they will get full employment. What can we do very quickly to save this country which is on the verge of collapse? If you don\u2019t want people to break away from Nigeria, we must give them confidence and sense of belonging, don\u2019t declare a war,\u201d he said.\n\nFalana said for the constitutional amendment to be fruitful, for Nigeria to have genuine outputs from this meeting, peace must reign.\n\nHe stated that Nigeria\u2019s problem must be addressed frontally, as well as give people the confidence of peace and inclusion if the government must kill the cries for secession.\n\n\u201cIn fact, in some parts of the country, the 2023 elections are already threatened. \u201cINEC offices are being burnt, police stations are being burnt. In that kind of atmosphere, we cannot pretend that there is political stability in our country.\n\n\u201cEssentially, I am making a case for the poor, the masses of our people who are generally not represented in fora of this nature which are most times for the elites and privileged among our people,\u201d he added.\n\nThe rights lawyer explained that chapter two of the constitution guaranteed the right to education, health, living minimum wage, good adequate housing, unemployment benefits, among others, but that members of the ruling class conspired and agreed, regardless of political affiliation, that these provisions shall not be enforceable or made justiciable.\n\n\u201cBut unless we are prepared to make these provisions justiciable and enforceable, this country will know no peace. Whatever constitution will come forth after now must make justiciable the fundamental objectives and directive principles of state without which there will be no political stability in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nFalana submitted that the Child Rights Act enacted in 2003 be made applicable throughout Nigeria, adding that as of today, only 25 states have adopted the law, \u201cbut even then, not fully implemented. Unfortunately, it is states where banditry, kidnapping and terrorism thrive that have refused to adopt or domesticate the law, and that is where banditry, terrorism, and kidnappers recruit daily.\n\n\u201cWe also advocate a 50/50 representation for men and women in government. We should emulate other African countries where women even take a larger percentage in government affairs.\u201d",

Most of them abandoned their goods to joining in praise singing and eulogizing him.\n\nIn a release by his Special Assistant on Media to the former President, Kehinde Akinyemi stated that Obasanjo, who arrived the market at about 9.20am, took time to go around the long and congested market.\n\nThe tour was conducted by Deacon Sunday Agusa, the General Manager of the Obasanjo Farms, Ibadan, located in the area.\n\nThe elated former President said his attention was drawn to the presence of the market by his staff and that his name has been used to grow the market, becoming national and international market on day-old chicks in the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cmy attention was drawn to the situation here and I decided to come and see things myself. Consciously and unconsciously, you have developed into a source of market, you buy, you sell, you interact. And this has made it very popular far and near, even though, it was not structured.\n\n\u201cSo, what remains is that if we don\u2019t want them to send us away from here, we have to structure ourselves in order to continue to benefit from the gains of trading our day-old chicks.\n\n\u201cWhat I am saying in essence, is that, I will endeavour to see the Governor to provide for us an alternative place if this area is not available for you bringing your hatch chicks or you coming to buy our chicks here. We have to plan against any government coming to send us away and that is the structure that I am talking about,\u201d Obasanjo disclosed, as the crowd responded overwhelmingly to his submission.\n\nThe leader of the Day Old Chicks Merchant Association of Nigeria (DOCMAN), Olaiya Ogunmoyewa at the Obasanjo Day Old International Market, appreciated the coming of the former President, saying the visit had lessened their fears on the future of the market. He said the Obasanjo had spoken their agitation \u201cand we\u2019re pleased with what you have told us.\n\n\u201cThis is what was on our mind. And you have told us the move you will take to assist us. We want to thank you and that by Gods grace, we shall all be happy at the end of the day,\u201d Ogunmoyewa said.\n\nA giant sized portrait of the former President was presented as an appreciation of the visit.",

Quite a large number of Nigerian children have fallen victims of illicit commercial activities which include human trafficking, sexual exploitation domestic servitude, and street begging.\n\n\u201cThe safety of our children from kidnappers, abusive parents and guardians as well as the sale of our children for exploitative purposes further re-enforces the need to strengthen the resolve to accelerate action on policies and programs including a legal framework that will help in enhancing the protection of our children from these evil elements and criminal minds.\n\n\u201cThis framework includes the need for the passage and full implementation of the Child\u2019s Right Acts, and the Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act in all States that have neither passed nor implemented these laws as these laws have been designed to provide a safe-net for our children.\n\n\u201cThere is a great need to begin instilling in our children the core values of honesty, hard work, selfless service, moral rectitude, patriotism, respect for elders, accountability, discipline and self-confidence. We as leaders must set a good example for the children.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that if our children grow with these core values instilled in them, the hope of having a truly great Nation in the near future will be rekindled.\n\n\u201cTo parents, teachers, guardians and religious leaders, I implore you all on this day to take into cognisance the need to protect our children and wards from unscrupulous elements that see our children as mere commodities and toys to be toiled with and exploited.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore imperative that parents work closely with NAPTIP and other law Enforcement Agencies in ensuring that perpetrators of evil acts towards our children are reported in order to ensure that such perpetrators are brought to book.\n\n\u201cNAPTIP on its part shall continue to work assiduously towards the protection of our children,\u201d she said.",

This has only increased during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cToday of all days, we must commit to reinforce the protection mechanisms for all children.\n\n\u201cBut we have learned from this pandemic too. One thing we have learned is that education takes place not only in schools \u2013 children can and should learn both in and out of school. A learning continuum is critical, so that all children continue to get an education irrespective of their situation, location, or the pandemic.\n\n\u201cNigerian children are resilient, talented and aspire to do great things. And it is our responsibility to give them the platform and encouragement to do just that.\n\n\u201cWe know that protecting children and investing in women and families is not only the right thing to do it has proven to be a sound economic choice and a cost-effective tool for national development.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate our children today, we must act in their best interests and deploy innovative solutions to fast-track learning and health services to build back better, for every Nigerian child.\u201d",

          "text": "Mauricio Pochettino is in talks with Tottenham over a return to the club that would see him leave Paris Saint-Germain after less than six months in charge.\n\nThe Argentine was appointed at the Parc des Princes in January, signing a contract until June 2022, with the option for an extra year, after being sacked by Spurs in November 2019.\n\nHe was replaced at Tottenham by Jose Mourinho, who led the club to a sixth-placed finish in his first season before being sacked in April 2021.\n\nPochettino led PSG to French Super Cup and Coupe de France wins but failed to deliver the Ligue 1 title, missing out to Lille by a point.\n\nThey reached the semi-finals of the Champions League after victories over holders Bayern Munich and Barcelona in the knockout stages but missed out on a second consecutive final after defeat to Manchester City in the last four.\n\nAs well as coaching PSG, Pochettino also spent two-and-a-half years at the club as a player after joining from Espanyol in 2001.\n\nDespite being in talks with another club, Pochettino told PSG\u2019s website on Thursday: \u201cWith this way of working, and with the desire to be able to develop other kinds of ideas on the pitch, it will be possible to do great things in the future.\n\n\u201cI think that in football you are never satisfied because perfection doesn\u2019t exist. But we are always looking for that satisfaction that we can\u2019t find, because I always believe that football challenges you every day and that from season to season you have to be better and better.\u201d\n\nPochettino also said he and his players had missed playing in front of supporters, adding: \u201cThis is something that hopefully will be solved soon and we will be able to have this strength again and with our fans, create this bond that makes the team better and will help us to achieve the goals that we have set.\u201d\n\nDespite being sacked by Spurs in 2019, Pochettino remains a popular figure in north London after spending more than five years as the club\u2019s manager.\n\nHe arrived from Southampton in 2014 and led them to the final of the Carabao Cup in 2015 and the final of the Champions League \u2013 for the first time in the club\u2019s history \u2013 in 2019.\n\nPochettino also oversaw Premier League title challenges in 2015-16 and 2016-17, although Spurs were overpowered by Leicester and Chelsea on those occasions.\n\nWere Pochettino to depart PSG, he would leave them searching for their third head coach in less than a year.\n\nPochettino joined the club as a replacement for Thomas Tuchel, who was sacked in December 2020 despite leading them to their first Champions League final just months earlier.",

          "text": "Zinedine Zidane has stepped down as Real Madrid head coach for the second time, the club have confirmed.\n\nThe Frenchman has called time on his second spell in charge of the La Liga club, who he has led to two league titles and three Champions League victories since 2015.\n\nZidane told club directors and the first-team squad of his decision on Wednesday and finalised his exit at Real\u2019s Valdebebas training complex a day later.\n\nHis departure comes after Real narrowly lost out on the league title to city rivals Atletico Madrid at the weekend. Real finished second in La Liga, two points behind Atletico, and were knocked out of the Champions League at the semi-final stage and the Copa del Rey in the round of 32 to end the season without a trophy for the first time in 11 years.\n\nOff the field, Real were one of the key players behind the failed Super League breakaway with the club president, Florentino Perez, repeatedly defending the plan and engaging in a war of words with Uefa that shows no sign of slowing down.\n\n\u201cIt is now time to respect his decision and show him our appreciation for his professionalism, dedication and passion in all these years, and for what his figure represents for Real Madrid,\u201d a club statement read.\n\n\u201cZidane is one of the great myths of Real Madrid and his legend goes beyond what he has been as a coach and player of our club. He knows that he is at the heart of Real Madrid and that Real Madrid is and will always be his home.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an option that Zidane could replace Maurio Pochettino at PSG. He\u2019s unpredictable and he could well head back to France if Pochettino decides to return to Tottenham.\n\n\u201cIt was thought that Juventus was an option before they turned to Massimiliano Allegri to replace Andrea Pirlo. But who knows what will happen after the Euros?\n\n\u201cPerhaps Didier Deschamps will leave the French national team and maybe Zidane will be his replacement. He\u2019s unpredictable so could stay a whole year without coaching.\u201d",
