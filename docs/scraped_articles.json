          "title": "Monkeypox can be transmitted through sex, says NCDC",
          "text": "Monkeypox, a disease endemic to West and Central African countries, can be transmitted through sexual intercourse, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has warned.\n\nThis is as a medical virologist and immunologist noted that the disease is deadlier in patients suffering from other diseases.\n\nThe PUNCH reports that Monkeypox, a rare disease that is caused by infection with the monkeypox virus, belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus in the family Poxviridae.\n\nThe disease has recently surfaced in some European countries, with 66 suspected cases reported so far in Nigeria in 2022.The NCDC noted that of the 66, no fewer than 21 cases had been confirmed but countries such as the United Kingdom, the US, Portugal, Spain, Israel, Lebanon and Canada among others have reported cases.\n\nThe World Health Organisation, in a statement it released last week, noted that the outbreak of the Monkeypox disease is being discovered in countries where it is not endemic.\n\nHowever, the NCDC\u2019s post on its website, which was seen by The PUNCH on Thursday, noted that sexual intercourse happens to be a mode of transmission.\n\nThe post read, \u201cSymptoms of the illness include fever, headache, body aches, weakness, swollen lymph nodes (glands) and a rash. After about 1 to 3 days of fever, the rash erupts, beginning on the face and then spreading to the body with the face and palms/soles being mostly affected. \u201cThey can also occur in and around the genitals which is why contact during sex is one mode of transmission. It is mostly a self-limiting illness that often lasts for two to four weeks.\u201dSpeaking in an interview with The PUNCH, a Professor of Medical Virology, University of Maiduguri, Prof Marycelin Baba, said the disease could be transmitted through skin contact.\n\n\u201cThere is a risk of human to human transmission. If you have someone around you who has the infection, it is very easy for you to get infected and sex cannot be ruled out because there is contact,\u201d Baba said.\n\nAlso, a medical virologist and immunologist at the Adeleke University, Ede, Osun State, Dr Oladipo Kolawole, told our correspondent that Monkeypox can overwhelm patients with co-morbidity (existence of more than one disease or condition within the body at the same time) and can lead to death.\n\nKolawole said, \u201cThere are different types of co-morbidity but anybody that is immunocompromised due to a certain disease condition and now has Monkeypox may suffer the possibility of death.\n\n\u201cThe meaning is that the person\u2019s immune system is immunocompromised; he cannot handle such infections. So, the power of the virus will overwhelm the immune system of such an individual which may lead to death.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Onyewu was delighted that UMUCHINEKEise is being vindicated by the startling revelations which are irresistibly exposing the strangers in our land, and their criminal gangs alike, who are kidnapping on our soil daily.\n\n\u201cOnyendu maintained that no son of the soil should pause until all forms of criminalities are eradicated from our land, he insisted that our land should no longer be a haven for those who kidnap for ransom, kill or indulges in any form of prohibited acts.\n\n\u201cOnyendu thanked ChukwuOkike Abiama for exposing these criminals behind the sacrilegious activities on our land and stressed further that there will be no hiding place anymore for these unscrupulous elements who are desecrating our land, hiding in bushes and arrogating the rights of landlords/overlords of our lands to themselves. He is profoundly pleased with the unprecedented success so far recorded in containing these monsters who have nothing/ no connection whatsoever with his freedom movement.

Onyewu was however impressed with the extent of legal engagements aggressively being deployed to ensure that she regains her freedom within the shortest possible time. We are not relenting in our effort to see it happen, the same energy is also being dissipated to ensure the release of all IPOB members illegally arrested and still detained across the detention facilities of various security Agencies.\n\nWe implore you all to intensify your supplications and prayers, as it is impacting so positively UMUCHINEKE.\u201d",

I will tell you the story shortly. Let\u2019s reverse a bit to Tuesday, and the meeting he held with the Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum before we left Abuja.\n\nPresident Buhari told them of what he would like to see at the All Progressives Congress (APC) primary to elect a presidential candidate early next week. No word about zoning, consensus, or imposition of candidate. He just charged them to let their plans converge, so that the party would put its best foot forward. Shortly after the meeting, we headed for the airport.\n\nA short time into the about five hours flight, I went on social media, to see that all hell had broken loose. Trust some Nigerians.

Oh, he used the words \u2018my successor,\u2019 instead of \u2018APC candidate.\u2019 That means he wants to rig the election. Otiose.\n\nOh, he talked about Governors who performed well being given opportunity to get a second term, for continuity. That means he wants to impose someone from within the government to succeed him. Consensus is what he wants. Puerile.\n\nIs consensus not one of the acceptable ways of choosing candidates, according to the Electoral Act? So the party can jolly well decide on the method it wants.\n\nOh, he didn\u2019t talk about zoning. APC wants to give its ticket to the North. Really? Did you see anything like that in the speech?\n\nI tell you. When some Nigerians don\u2019t see what they expect in a speech or statement, they simply conjure and create their own. And the wailing starts.\n\nWe arrived Madrid in the night. Hala Madrid! Home of the conqueror of Europe in football, Real Madrid, which just beat Liverpool to the diadem a few days before. Is the city still celebrating?\n\nMadrid is beautiful, no doubt about it. And seeing the city at night gives it an ethereal ambience. Lovely, very lovely.\n\nDriver of the car in which I rode with a colleague told us we were going to the best hotel in the city. And why not? We were guests of the Spanish President, Pedro Sanchez. President Buhari was also to be hosted by the King of Spain, His Majesty King Felipe V1. Honors don\u2019t come higher than that.\n\nOur first port of call on Wednesday was United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). Nigeria would be hosting the body in November, and our President is said to be the second African ever to visit the place. The Secretary-General, Zurab Pololikashvili, had very good words to say about our country.\n\nNext was the Zarzuela Palace, to meet with His Majesty, King Filipe. The kiln of patriotism could not but be kindled in your heart as you see the tall Fulani man from Daura being welcomed by an equally tall King. Back home, some people call him all sorts of names, out of malice and evil hearts, but here was the man flying the flag of his country proudly, meeting those who matter, and making conquests.\n\nDuring lunch, I sat at table with some aides of the Spanish President, diplomats and Protocol officials. We initially talked about soccer, the Real Madrid UCL victory, and Nigerians making waves in Spanish soccer. There are 19 males and 7 females currently there.\n\nOne of our hosts asked about a former Nigerian footballer, who had shone like a star in Spain. Mutiu Adepoju.\n\n\u201cThe Headmaster!\u201d I exclaimed. The guy concurred, saying Adepoju scored many goals with the head while playing in Spain. He couldn\u2019t stop talking about him.\n\nAnd then, the talk shifted to our President. One of our hosts said he was a man of integrity, probity and accountability. He added that they respect him very much in their country, and generally in the West.\n\nPeople like this are not spendthrift with accolades. Before they say anything positive about you, they must have checked you out over and over. They must have seen that President Buhari has no loot stashed in any part of the world. He has no oil bloc, and his life remains as thrifty and frugal as it was, before he came to power.\n\nNo wonder Barack Obama gave him plaudits in the area of integrity during our visit to Washington in 2015. Justin Trudeau of Canada, Thabo Mbeki, former South African President, Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, and many other world leaders have spoken in the same vein. Buhari, oh Buhari. Those who know the worth of gold appreciate it.\n\nLet me see you dey buga o (go low-low-low)\n\nLet me see you (go low-low-low) buga won.\n\nFrom the palace of the King, we went to another palace. The presidential palace, to see President Sanchez. Another tall man, who has deep respect for our President. He was very delighted to have him as a guest, and said Spain-Nigeria relations could only get better, going forward.\n\nBilateral agreements and Memorandum of Understanding were signed. On extradition of convicted persons, economic and trade cooperation, sports, fighting COVID-19, tourism, scientific cooperation, and others.\n\nOn Thursday, one of the high-points of the visit. President Buhari was Keynote Speaker at the Business Meeting between Spain and Nigeria. He unfolded the opportunities available in our country, and invited investors to come. They hung on his every word, and gave a standing ovation when he finished.\n\nLet me see you dey buga o\u2026\n\nCome and see the meeting with Nigerians in Diaspora on Thursday afternoon. The President was in his elements. When Chairman of Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Abike Dabiri-Erewa, introduced Kenneth Omeruo, a Nigerian footballer playing professional soccer in Spain, the President said: \u201cI know him. I always see him on TV, with his peculiar hairstyle.\u201d Looool.\n\nOmeruo thanked the President for his many supports to the Super Eagles, and presented him with an autographed football, jersey of his team, Leganes FC of Madrid, and a jersey of the Super Eagles.\n\nAn appreciative President told the footballer that as a student, he didn\u2019t play much of football because of his lean stature, \u201cbut I felt safer with hockey, since I had a stick I could use to defend myself.\u201d\n\nThe expedition to Spain by President Buhari was very successful on all fronts. Our President did the country proud, represented well, and brought us glory. Why shouldn\u2019t we then flaunt him? We must \u2018buga,\u2019 and showcase our leader, no matter what those who cavil say.\n\nLet me see you dey buga o (go low-low-low)\n\nLet me see you go low-low-low) buga won.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity",

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nHe told Daily Sun there is palpable tension over the plot to resist the president\u2019s anticipated choice as some governors, including those from the North are yet to be convinced on why Buhari must impose his successor.\n\nThe affected governors, it was learnt, enjoy the backing of some northern power brokers.\n\nOur source said the arrowheads, who were impressed with the recent outcome of the presidential primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) have demanded that the APC also adopts open primary.\n\nThe governors, he said, have become jittery that President Buhari and APC might lose at the poll if the procedure for electing the ruling candidate was not transparent.\n\nIt was learnt they also faulted moves by Buhari to limit his search for a successor to the North with only the senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan and Governor Yahaya Bello from the North East and North Central respectively in mind.\n\nThe governors, our source said, wanted the party to allow more fresh aspirants to participate. He told Daily Sun that the aggrieved governors insisted that reopening of the nomination would enable more aspirants from the North to join the race to enable Buhari have more alternatives.\n\nBut it was learnt that aspirants from the South have rejected the moves by the northern governors to reopen nomination after screening has been concluded.\n\nSome of the governors, according to our source, have been trying to lobby the National Chairman, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, to reopen nomination for presidential primaries.\n\nAbout five northern governors were alleged to be behind the new plot to cause confusion.\n\nOur source told Daily Sun: \u201cSome of these governors have also been privy to the fact that Buhari might have zeroed in on two or three candidates, including a few Northern aspirants that they don\u2019t want adopted. I think there must be more to this reopening of nomination agenda. We don\u2019t know the mindset of our national chairman on this.\u201d\n\nOur source who was privy to the latest plot, described it as a \u201cdangerous trend for APC as that may deepen the split in the ranks of governors on the platform of the party.\n\n\u201cAs the president intensifies consultations on his successor, he has an uphill task ahead. Some of the APC governors, especially those on second term, do not subscribe to the imposition of APC presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cThey are forming a group to advise the President to drop the idea because it will erode voters\u2019 confidence in APC and its anointed candidate.\n\n\u201cThey also claimed that APC will be setting a bad precedent for the nation\u2019s democracy. Their greatest challenge is how to convince Buhari to buy in their view,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari had on Tuesday urged governors on the platform of his party to avail him the privilege of picking his successor as they were allowed to do in their states. He made the appeal when he had audience with the APC governors and the National Chairman of of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "An Abuja court has struck out an application by Premiere Academy Lugbe seeking to stop a probe of the circumstances that led to the alleged rape and death of Keren Akphagher, one of its students.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeren died in June 2021 after developing sepsis from an infection caused by a condom allegedly left inside her by someone who had raped her.\n\nIt was gathered that it had compromised Keren\u2019s immune system, spiked her blood sugar \u2014 as an already diabetic patient \u2013and resulted in hyperglycemia.\n\nA report issued to the family by Queen\u2019s Hospital Abuja stated that decomposed condom particles and dead sperm were found in the girl\u2019s vagina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FCT police had commenced an investigation into the case but the family sought for it to be transferred to the force criminal investigation department (FCID), alleging the former was compromised in its handling of the matter.\n\nAn autopsy was later conducted in July 2021 while the ministry of education and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) also waded in to probe the case.\n\nThe house of representatives had also directed that a DNA test be conducted on the male staff at Keren\u2019s school so as to fish out the culprit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lower legislative chamber thereafter set up a panel for an investigative public hearing on the case in December.\n\nAfter Keren\u2019s death, Vivien Akphagher, her mother, had lodged a complaint at the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC).\n\nShe had accused the school of breaching their contract of duty of care and protection of her daughter.\n\nThis prompted the commission to summon the school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPremiere Academy had asked the court to grant an order of interlocutory injunction.\n\nThis was to restrain the FCCPC from inviting the school or demanding any of the school\u2019s information, pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.\n\nBut on Friday, the Abuja federal high court struck the request to halt FCCPC\u2019s investigation into the case.\n\nRuling on the school\u2019s interlocutory application, Evelyn Maha, the judge who presided over the matter, held that granting the application means delving into the legality and illegality of the commission\u2019s action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaha refused the application and ordered an accelerated hearing of the substantive suit.\n\nThe judge thereafter adjourned to June 22, at which time it would have been one year since the student\u2019s death.\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable.

          "text": "Ikechuwku Onachukwu, the Nigerian rapper, has demanded justice for his wife\u2019s cousin who he said was found dead inside the boarding house of an Imo state catholic school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a video shared via his Instagram page on Thursday, the rapper said the 14-year-old student, named Obinna, died after a series of events he suggested was suspicious.\n\nThe rapper also called for an investigation and autopsy to be carried out before the burial of the late boy.\n\n\u201cEarlier on today, I put up a post about Obinna and his tragic passing. Obinna is related to my wife but I do not know his direct family. He was at my wedding. Now, he\u2019s dead. He was discovered at his school,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat is the school I listed. People from the school have been going online to leave all kinds of derogatory remarks towards me. But that\u2019s irrelevant. What I do care about is finding out how this boy died.\n\n\u201cI hope that an autopsy is going to be performed prior to his burial. I hope that there is a thorough investigation into it so that we can have the truth come out. At the end of the day, the truth will set everybody free.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ikechukwu Onunaku (@official_ikechukwu)\n\nIn another post, which is now deleted, Ikechukwu alleged that his in-law was found lifeless in the dormitory with bruises he claimed showed the boy was beaten up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the school involved is Queen of the Holy Innocent Secondary School, Ogwume in Ideato LGA.\n\n\u201cThis is Obinna, 14 years of age, my in-law. Cousin to my wife. He was found at 1 am dead in the boarding house at this school. Class? SS2, senior hostel. Beaten up, bruised. So many holes in this story,\u201d the rapper had said.\n\n\u201cAnd frankly, I\u2019m sick of these happenings. Now it has come to my doorstep. This is outrageous.\n\n\u201cI urge every media portal to help bring light to the happenings surrounding this event and every other event concerning these children who we confidently give to schools to look after. No child should have to die.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen TheCable Lifestyle contacted Mike Abattam, the police PRO in Imo, he said he had yet to receive any report on the case.\n\nObinna\u2019s passing comes as the latest in a series of death cases that have hit secondary schools in Nigeria.\n\nTheCable published a two-part series on the frustrations of the bereaved of such cases in their quest for justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable.

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Founder of Babymigo speaks on reducing maternal deaths in Africa",
          "text": "Kemi is the co-founder of Babymigo, a Nigerian femtech startup founded in 2017 to expand access to quality information on pregnancy and parenthood. It works by providing a digital platform where expectant, pregnant, and nursing mothers can connect with their peers and experts as well as find local health and welfare services. Overall, it creates an inclusive support system for new and expecting parents to help make informed decisions during pregnancy and parenthood.\n\nTechCabal had a conversation with Kemi about Babymigo\u2019s background, challenges, motivation, and future plans.\n\nBabymigo website\n\nBabymigo\u2019s background\n\nHannatu Asheolge: How did the idea of Babymigo come about?\n\nKemi Olawoye: As a physiotherapist, I worked at a hospital where it was my job to lead antenatal classes, which included exercise. In my interactions with the pregnant women there, I discovered that a lot of them were misinformed on maternal health issues and were also subscribed to harmful cultural beliefs. When I met my co-founder, who also worked in the health sector, we decided to do something to combat this misinformation.\n\nHA: It\u2019s been 4 to 5 years since your company launched, and it has accomplished a lot. As CEO and co-founder, what have your key achievements been?\n\nKO: We\u2019ve seen a steady increase in the number of users since our launch. Now, we have up to 250,000 users on our platform, including pregnant women and new parents. We also raised our pre-seed in this period, which led to a lot of international partnerships and recognitions. Some notable ones include the Google Black Founders Fund and the GIST Initiative by the US Department of State.\n\nHA: What are some of your biggest challenges?\n\nKO: There are two major challenges we\u2019ve faced. The first one is human resources. Finding the right people who are committed to our vision of reducing maternal and child mortality rates was quite difficult, but I believe we\u2019ve managed to get past that. We now have built a team of passionate people.\n\nThe second challenge was more about an error in our initial plan. We didn\u2019t involve our users in our solutions, and this led to some dissonance between what we were working on and what our users actually needed us to work on.\n\nHA: What motivates you?\n\nKO: The statistics on child and mother mortality rates in Nigeria are my biggest motivation. Nigeria is currently one of the worst places in the world to have a child. Statistics show that 1 in 22 women that will get pregnant in Nigeria will most likely die from pregnancy-related complications due to misinformation and lack of adequate support.\n\nKemi Olawoye\n\nThe role of tech in improving maternal healthcare\n\nHA: How big of a role do you think tech can play in improving maternal health in Nigeria?\n\nKO: There\u2019s a growing number of people in Africa now with access to the internet. We can leverage this internet access to spread healthy information to them. Also, providing a community with millions of other moms is a great way to counter harmful cultural beliefs around pregnancy. It\u2019s easier to learn and believe something when there are millions of other women who are learning with you and confirming these beliefs.\n\nHA: What singular aspect of maternal healthcare in Nigeria do you think needs the most urgent intervention?\n\nKO: If I had to pick one, I\u2019d say addressing the inaccurate information on these cultural beliefs.\n\nHA: If you could describe the Nigerian femtech sector in one word, what would it be?\n\nKO: I\u2019d pick \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d.\n\nHA: What are the things you believe will accelerate the growth of the maternal health sector in Nigeria?\n\nKO: The first thing will be to identify policies and interventions that affect outcomes in terms of maternal and child health. The second thing will be restructuring or improving our current healthcare system. About 50% of Nigerians are already living below the average income level. This means that more than half of the female population cannot afford to pay for antenatal care in a regular hospital. The government needs to provide quality healthcare for free or at affordable rates for these women in order to lower the child and maternal mortality rates.\n\nHA: You\u2019ve mentioned quite a number of solutions. How do we incorporate technology into these solutions? How can tech help?\n\n\n\nKO: There can be digitising of some routine healthcare services. These can be in the form of online consultations or even digital classes which can go a long way. For a number of women, visiting a clinic is time-consuming and being able to reach a doctor online will go a long way to help women gain access to health services.\n\nNew services and future plans\n\nHA: Babymigo recently launched the Mamacare plan. Can you tell us more about that?\n\nKO: Mamacare is a maternity plan that allows mums to access antenatal child delivery and baby care services in about 120 multi-partner hospitals across Nigeria.\n\nHA: What are some of the things to expect from Babymigo in the next 5 years?\n\nKO: The plan is definitely to continue empowering more mums across Africa. In the next 3 years, we hope to provide healthcare services to 10 million mums across the African continent.\n\nWe\u2019re also looking at geographical expansion, as maternal health issues are not peculiar to Nigeria. We\u2019re looking at expanding to Ghana and Kenya within the next 5 years. Another thing we\u2019re looking at is expanding our services. We hope to be able to partner with telecom service providers to provide information via SMS for mums in rural areas who do not have access to the internet.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Patricia\u2019s CEO on taking risks and building for impact",
          "text": "Hanu Fejiro may today, at 26, sit atop a crypto exchange company boasting of 30,000 daily transactions and 660,000 users, but only a few years ago, he knew little about cryptocurrencies. The company in question, Patricia Technologies\u2014or just Patricia\u2014was originally registered in Nigeria as a gift card exchange after Fejiro fell into the hands of fraudsters.\n\nHe\u2019d received a gift card worth \u20a630,000 (~$73), in 2015, from his uncle in the US, in lieu of a monthly allowance. Needing to exchange the gift card for cash, he went online to transact with a gift card exchange, only to fall victim to a scam. Gift card scams are commonplace: users are asked to disclose the card\u2019s number, unwittingly granting the scammer access to its funds. After his experience, Fejiro figured that if he was getting scammed, others were too; building an exchange where people could safely exchange their gift cards for cash was an obvious opportunity. And he seized it.\n\nFor the next 2 years, from 2017 through 2018, Patricia would operate as a gift card exchange. But not for long.\n\nIn 2019, Fejiro transitioned Patricia from gift card exchanging to a line that he found to be blossoming in popularity and demand: crypto trading. Nigeria was on the cusp of being identified, within the next 2 years\u20142020 and 2021\u2014as a leading crypto economy. The stats thrown around about this development functioned as both news headlines and high praise for the country\u2019s crypto adoption rate. The highest number of Google searches for \u201cbitcoin\u201d came from Nigeria. Twenty-three-point-seven percent of Nigerians online owned some form of cryptocurrency. Businesses were adding crypto plugins to their payment options. Trading volumes were surpassing $1 million per day on Binance.\n\nIf an economy could be a crypto heaven, Nigeria was looking like it. But the country\u2019s government did not share the enthusiasm. Soon, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) would descend its regulatory hammer on crypto trading, and Fejiro would have to think fast to save his young business.\n\nThinking fast, moving faster\n\nFejiro is speaking to me from Dubai. It has taken me and his team 5 weeks to schedule this interview; there\u2019d been a scheduling conflict in February and a long silence after that, until April, when he gets on a call with me, 6 minutes late, battling a cold that sometimes fogs up his voice. And yet, the story he tells me over the course of an hour, about himself and Patricia, is clear and does not stumble. It\u2019s a story he\u2019s told so many times he knows it backwards\u2014which comes as no surprise; he will write his memoir someday, he assures me, and is already shooting footage of his life for a future documentary.\n\nAs an undergraduate at the University of Port Harcourt, studying mathematics and statistics, he\u2019d done everything he could to make some extra change. He sold noodles, then popcorn, then started a clothing company, and had even attempted to start a taxi business. The list of start-and-stop businesses to his credit would eventually stretch from 5 to 13\u2014all before his hit venture: Patricia.\n\nI wonder at his going bullish on several entrepreneurial ventures while still in school. I ask as delicately as I can manage: was he poor? He says no. He\u2019d lost his dad when he was 8 and his mum when he was 16, just before university, but he hadn\u2019t lacked anything; his extended family took good care of him. He just had always been entrepreneurial, he says. When he was in primary school, growing up in Warri, south-south Nigeria, he distributed candy to 4 primary schools in his neighbourhood, earning enough profit to pay his family\u2019s rent for 2 years.\n\nFejiro has an uncomplicated relationship with executing his ideas; he does not overthink them. In his world, if it sounds like a plan, it probably is. He\u2019d christened his company by its curious name on a whim: his mother\u2019s name was Patience, but his grandfather preferred to call her Patricia, to annoy her, and start an argument\u2014every time. Many years later, when Patricia popped into Fejiro\u2019s head as a suggestion for his company\u2019s name, he didn\u2019t think about it twice.\n\n\u201cYou may spend so much time thinking and not acting fast enough,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd the market is actually moving. You need to be able to move as fast as the market. When you spend too much time thinking, you end up losing everything.\u201d\n\nAnd so, when the CBN suddenly banned commercial banks from facilitating crypto transactions, Fejiro knew he had to think\u2014and act\u2014 quickly.\n\nNews of the ban had dropped on February 5, 2021, a Friday afternoon. Reactions to it on social media were riotous, angry, and pained. The apex bank had not only proscribed banks from servicing crypto transactions, it had ordered them to close all accounts found to be used for crypto trading. Worse, the following week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) banned crypto use altogether.\n\nWhen it became clear that the country\u2019s regulations had a hostile attitude towards crypto use, Fejiro relocated Patricia\u2019s headquarters to Estonia, a country in northeastern Europe, famous\u2014at the time\u2014for its liberal crypto regime. This was 5 months after the ban in Nigeria.\n\nThe Estonian business environment is famously progressive. The country has an e-residency programme\u2014the first country in the world to introduce this; a young entrepreneur can easily incorporate their startup there, in a process that takes less than an hour and costs less than \u20ac5,000\u2014all based on a residency permit that is entirely digital. The country had even considered introducing its own national cryptocurrency, the estcoin, in 2017.\n\nBut the Estonian crypto party would not last long. Three months after Patricia\u2019s relocation, the Estonian government opened discussions to tighten its crypto regulations; in March this year, the tightening became law, a move directed at combating rising fraud and money laundering issues associated with its earlier liberal crypto regulations.\n\nAlthough Fejiro supports the tightened regulations, it would seem that he is cautious about camping his business too close to regulatory quick fire. He moved Patricia\u2019s headquarters to Lithuania.\n\n\u201cWe moved out of Estonia when the law became too stringent for us to operate,\u201d he says.\n\nWay bigger than him now\n\nFejiro rises at 7:30 AM, every day. Three times a week his day begins with him receiving management updates from a team he had gradually built from 2 to over 350 employees spread across Ghana, Lithuania, the UK, Nigeria, and China. The management meetings set the tone of his day. Although he describes himself as a risk taker, building a thriving business may have given that trait an altruistic edge. When he started Patricia, he\u2019d invested all his personal money in the venture, but he tells me now that that kind of risk taking is well behind him. \u201cWhen you start a company, you really have nothing to lose except your life savings\u2014and that\u2019s just my life savings. I will take risks, though,\u201d he cautions, lest I get it twisted, \u201cbut at the scale we\u2019re at now, I wouldn\u2019t take a bet-the-company risk, because Patricia is way bigger than me now.\u201d\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

Maybe because I need someone to tell me soothing things too. \ud83e\udd7a\n\nWell, can we do something this weekend? Find one or two people you love and tell them how much you appreciate them. Alternatively, you could send them an encouraging note or a love letter.\n\nWho knows how far your words, written or spoken, can change or help them? Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m going to do that too. So, do we have a deal? Great!!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI really want to hear how this goes and would appreciate some testimonies \ud83d\ude09. How you felt or anything else you\u2019d like to say, I\u2019m all ears \ud83d\ude01.\n\nSo, today I\u2019ll talk about:\n\nHow Ademi found a gem in crypto\n\nSwvl Kenya\u2019s intra-city rides suspension\n\nM-Pesa\u2019s GlobalPay Visa virtual card\n\nHow Ademi found a gem in cryptocurrency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much money can you lose before it becomes unbearably painful?\n\nFor me, it wasn\u2019t my phone, which I bought for \u20a670,000 ($168.64). It was the \u20a620,000 ($48.18) I lent someone sometime this year. Even though I had \u20a623,000 ($55.41) that weekend, I lent them my money because I trusted them to return it the next week as promised.\n\nHowever, I learnt never to trust anyone with my money again. That wasn\u2019t the first time. I also learnt not to lend money I can\u2019t afford to lose. That has been my personal experience with financial loss so far. What about you?\n\nLet\u2019s recreate this image: Can you keep doing something unstable like cryptocurrency even after losing $10,000?\n\nSee, I understand that life is full of uncertainties, but losing $10,000 on a volatile investment is a no! I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t go on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, Bolu spoke with Ademi, a crypto trader who took an interest in cryptocurrency when its value was rising. I believe she began trading at the right time, and even though prices crashed, she was motivated to continue.\n\nAllow me to introduce you to Bolu\u2019s People in Emerging Tech series. Give it up for Bolu, ladies and gentlemen!! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\n\nFirst off, what do you think about the title? Just like it says, Bolu will be talking to people in emerging tech spaces like blockchain, Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things. If you\u2019re a lover of sci-fi movies or books, you should be interested in this!\n\nAnd Bolu\u2019s series, like Nifemi\u2019s and Chimgozirim\u2019s, comes with a podcast and a newsletter. Do anticipate his story weekly on Thursday, 12 p.m. WAT!\n\nBack to the main gist: Ademi reveals how she began as a crypto trader and how far she has progressed in influencing people\u2019s decisions on which exchange to use and even which assets to invest in.\n\nBefore you read her story, if you\u2019re interested in cryptocurrency trading or investing, Ademi has a question: \u201cAre you prepared to lose everything?\u201d\n\nI find the question ridiculous because I\u2019ve got nothing to lose. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I don\u2019t have money, please. \ud83d\ude02\n\nJokes apart, Ademi\u2019s story may inspire you to leave your tedious 9-5 job for cryptocurrency trading if you are interested in it but have been sceptical. Why not read the story to find out for yourself?\n\nPlease, find it here: Even after a $10,000 loss, this crypto trader found a gem in the crypto space, and she\u2019s never letting go\n\nSwvl Kenya to suspend its daily intra-city rides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwvl, an Egyptian ride-hailing service, has announced that it will suspend daily intra-city rides in Kenya beginning today, June 3, 2022, citing the global economic downturn.\n\nThe company, which has been in business since July 2019, has also suspended Swvl Travel as of May 30, 2022, and will only operate Swvl Business, which caters to corporations, organisations, and private entities.\n\nRecall that the startup announced plans to lay off 32% of its workforce. According to the company, teams responsible for functions that have been automated due to investment in engineering, product, and support functions will be affected by the planned layoffs.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s LinkedIn profile, it has over 1,330 employees. With the mobility company laying off over 30% of its workforce, approximately 400 people will lose their jobs.\n\nNow, it appears the company may have continued this trend with employees in Kenya.\n\nBecause Swvl Kenya partners with nearly 500 bus owners, the decision to suspend its two main operations may affect close to 100 employees who work directly for the company.\n\nNonetheless, Swvl Kenya has started rolling out a product that will allow commuters to use the platform for long-distance travel.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, they can book and pay for future upcountry trips to Naivasha, Nakuru, Molo, Eldoret, Narok, Bomet, Kericho, Kisii, Kisumu, Nyeri, Nanyuki, and Machakos, via its app.\n\nThe M-Pesa GlobalPay Visa virtual card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly M-Pesa usage. Source: Vodafone webiste\n\nYesterday, June 2, 2022, Visa, digital payments giant, and Safaricom, Kenya\u2019s leading telco, launched the M-Pesa GlobalPay Visa virtual card.\n\nThis virtual card, accessible via the M-Pesa app or with the code, *344#, means M-Pesa can be used on global platforms to make digital payments worldwide. The card is only accepted by international platforms and is incompatible with local eCommerce platforms like Jumia Kenya.\n\nMoreover, users can only have one virtual card active at any given time. This means that even if you have multiple Safaricom SIM cards linked to your ID, you can only use one at a time. You can also use the VISA card to track your M-Pesa balance.\n\nPreviously, M-Pesa users could only make mobile money payments to the company\u2019s nearly 400,000 merchant network. However, with this launch, 30 million customers will be able to make cashless payments through Visa\u2019s global merchant network.\n\nRecall that in 2020, the two companies entered into a partnership to develop \u201cproducts that will support digital payments for M-Pesa customers.\u201d\n\nFollowing this launch, Visa has indicated that it will form similar partnerships throughout Africa, opening up a massive market for merchants looking to expand into Africa.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nBinance has open roles in Communication, Business Development, Customer Support, Engineering, Marketing, Product, Customer support, and other departments.

Even after losing $10,000, she still sticks to crypto trading as a career.\n\nAdemi decided to forge a career out of trading crypto and NFTs when she realised how efficient cryptocurrencies are for cross-border transactions.\n\nMy dealings with expert crypto traders have revealed that most of them began trading because they believed strongly in the technology, which made researching the best ways to make money easier.\n\nTheir journeys seldom started with a desire to make money; they often gave in to their curiosity and desire to understand what made them efficient, their shortcomings, how they worked, and their technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdemi got interested five years ago, in 2017, when a friend suggested crypto has a payment option, that are instant, and cross borders quickly. She marvelled at the possibilities and became curious about cryptocurrencies. And that was the beginning of the journey.\n\nWhile crypto traders might flaunt their wealth on social media, the journey to becoming an expert is long and unpleasant. But nothing would deter Ademi as she set out to make some money with crypto and turn it into a career.\n\nStarting with the 2017 bull market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by CardMapr.nl on Unsplash\n\nA crypto bull market is a time when the value of crypto assets keeps rising. It is a time when crypto investors and traders are almost always in the green, and the media goes agog with news of all-time highs and mind-boggling market caps.\n\nIt\u2019s when most people decide to invest in crypto to get a piece of the action. However, a bear market \u2014 what comes at the end of a bull market \u2014 is what separates the newbies from the experts.\n\nThe 2017 bull run was huge. For context, Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, went from $900 to almost $20,000 between May and December. However, just as Bitcoin reached the $20,000 limelight, it was followed by a 30% drop that bloodied the entire crypto market.\n\nBy 2018, Bitcoin had dropped 80% below its initial all-time high in 2017, going as low as $3,500. While it might seem overly dramatic to describe it as a catastrophe, it is a mild way to put it in the eyes of investors who had to watch their investments bleed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@nampoh?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Maxim Hopman</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/crypto-fall?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a>\n\nLike most newbies, Ademi found the 2017 bull run attractive and saw a chance to cash out, not knowing one of the worst bear markets of all time was just around the corner.\n\nShe lost money to the unforgiving bear market but had already learnt how to trade futures, a way to make money even when crypto charts are as crimson red.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFutures trading isn\u2019t a hack to make money when the market is on a downtrend; it is considerably more difficult than regular trading.\n\nIt is a way to invest in assets by betting on what their price will be in the future. It\u2019s a lot more complicated than it sounds, but that\u2019s the idea. Ademi was a fast learner, and while the 2018 crypto meltdown did a number on her for some time, futures trading helped her leverage the meltdown.\n\nDetour to crypto influencing\n\nAdemi isn\u2019t just making money speculating what direction crypto assets will take; she also makes money influencing people\u2019s choices on what exchange they use and even which assets they invest in.\n\nShe got in early and spent a lot of time understanding the space, which has helped her build a following over time. As an undergraduate in 2017, Ademi was already learning the crypto ropes, and as soon as she graduated, she landed a job with the crypto exchange, Quidax.\n\n\u201cI mostly organised training for people on how to trade crypto. And I eventually got employed by Quidax.\u201d\n\nWhen you can learn all there is to know about crypto trading as fast as Ademi, a nine-to-five doesn\u2019t seem like an exciting option. After a few months, she left Quidax to be a full-time crypto trader.\n\n\u201cI decided to be on my own after a little while just trading, and it seemed to be working for me. It actually did; 2019 was a good year. I also got to work with people that I met on Twitter.\u201d\n\nFrom talking crypto and sharing trading tips on Twitter, Ademi was gradually becoming an influencer, and she was about to start reaping fruits.\n\nShe had always done most of her trading on BitMex, but it wasn\u2019t optimal enough, making her and some other users lose money. Either price changes didn\u2019t reflect early enough or the platform suffered from system overload.\n\nIt was time for a change, and Ademi was introduced to Bybit. Like BitMex, Bybit offered futures trading, a feature not many exchanges had at the time. Seeing how good Bybit was, Ademi recommended it to her community, and that was where she started reaping influencer profits.\n\n\u201cBecause I was early, I got many people to sign up using my referral link. In addition to profits from trading crypto, I was also able to get income from referrals that I actually didn\u2019t expect, to be honest.\u201d\n\nBy the end of 2019, Bitcoin was trading at about $7,200, and Ademi earned two Bitcoins from all her referrals. Considering profits from trading, 2019 was indeed a good year.\n\nThe NFT holy grail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrypto trading and influencing were going well for Ademi, but the crypto space constantly evolves and keeping up with the trends could fetch a lot of money.\n\nNFTs were the new trends, and Ademi was not going to be left out. As usual, she didn\u2019t jump in right away; she observed, learnt, and decided to take a dip into the NFT pool last year, and that was when things got interesting.\n\nTrading NFTs started beautifully, with her first NFT coming from the Cool Cats collection. A collection of anthropomorphised 2D cats now has a floor price of 3.4 Eth, which is ~ $12,000.\n\nAdemi got in early, and she made a 100% gain on her investment in the Cool Cats, a very cool start to NFT trading.\n\nIn the crypto game, you quickly learn that things will not always be rosy, regardless of whether you are trading NFTs or trading futures.\n\nAdemi was about to find this out the hard way; asides from the Cool Cats, she had bought into another project that brought her more good fortunes, and NFTs seemed to be the next best thing.\n\nShe decided to go big on NFTs and bought into a collection for $10,000. The collection had good hype, the kind that could result in very high percentage gains, but even in crypto, as with most things, not all that glitters is gold.\n\nAdemi watched as her $10,000 plummeted to almost $0.\n\nWhile $10,000 is a lot of money, she was unfazed by the loss. Some people might decide to call it quits with all things crypto at this point, but to Ademi, it was just another day in the crypto sphere.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever gotten to that point. Because at the end of the day, crypto brought me here. I started with literally nothing, actually, and crypto brought me here. So I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever come to the point where I\u2019ll be like, \u2018no more crypto for me.\u2019\u201d\n\nCrypto as a full-time job\n\nAfter Ademi\u2019s brief stint at Quidax, she never took another job because crypto paid the bills despite $10,000 losses. She had already found something she was good at, and chasing a nine-to-five was unnecessary.\n\nImportantly, Ademi\u2019s crypto career transcended just trading, technical analysis, and staring at charts.\n\nIn addition to teaching and being an influencer, Ademi has a knack for running and managing crypto projects. She is familiar with marketing tactics, what projects are doing wrong, and which projects are likely to succeed or fail.\n\nCrypto trading has been touted as the biggest, if not the only, opportunity that came with the advent of cryptocurrencies, but, according to Ademi, there are many ways to make life-changing money with crypto.\n\nTo her, the crypto space has morphed into an industry of its own creating brand new opportunities for people in different fields such as design, web development, engineering, marketing, and content creation.\n\nThis is why Ademi remains a firm believer in the crypto space, and even when the market decides to bleed for months on end, crypto brought her here, and crypto will keep her here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

I mean, as a reader, this should matter to you.\n\nYesterday, June 1, 2022, Google announced the integration of two of its video-calling apps, Duo and Meet, into a single platform.\n\nThis means that there will only be Google Meet, and Google expects that it will be the only calling app users need.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, Slack is introducing new features like the ability to add name pronunciation guides either by recording audio or adding phonetic spelling to promote team collaboration and connection.\n\nLastly, Instagram has incorporated Amber Alerts, a tool that helps locate kidnapped children, into users\u2019 feeds. While the feature was only launched in the United States yesterday, the company plans to expand it to 25 countries in the coming days.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nHow Victoria Fabunmi helps founders get capital\n\nTalk360\u2019s $4 million seed\n\nAppetito\u2019s acquisition\n\nHow Victoria Fabunmi helps founders get capital\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria Fabunmi. Source: LinkedIn\n\nI mentioned yesterday that the editorial team is cooking. These meals are ready for consumption. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve started to enjoy them.\n\nStill unclear? I\u2019ll help you out. The editorial team \u2014 Nifemi, Emmanuel, Chimgozirim, Bolu, and Ogheneruemu \u2014 have got new and \u201cretouched\u201d series. And if you noticed, we also brought back How I Work, handled by Samuel our content guru.\n\nWhether you\u2019re interested in blockchain, AI, IoT, how tech helps everyday people, experts\u2019 journeys in tech, East Africa coverage, or venture capital and startups, we\u2019ve got you covered!\n\nOn today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, the editorial team discussed their series and why you should care. While you know Nifemi\u2019s The Experts, I\u2019d like to discuss Chimgozirim\u2019s series, Equity Merchants, today.\n\nIf you\u2019re a regular, you\u2019re probably familiar with Chimgozirim as the guy who covers VCs and startups in Africa. Well, his new series is not far from this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019ll talk to angel investors, venture capitalists, private equity merchants, and founders. If you want to understand how the Venture Capital market works, look for his story every Wednesday at 12 p.m. WAT!\n\nHe\u2019s also adding a podcast and a newsletter. While the articles will be available on the website every Wednesday at 12 p.m. WAT, the podcast can be found anywhere you get your podcasts, and the newsletter will be sent directly to your inbox. Isn\u2019t this fantabulous?\n\nIn his words, this week\u2019s story is the \u201cmost interesting conversation he has ever had in a long time.\u201d Chimgozirim had a chat with Victoria Fabunmi, CcHUB\u2019s Head of Investment.\n\nInterestingly, Fabunmi, like many Nigerian students, was unsure of her career path despite studying accounting at the University of Lagos in Nigeria.\n\nYou can probably relate if you are or were a Nigerian student. But how did you decide on a career path? You can share with me. I mean, I don\u2019t bite. \ud83d\ude01\n\nFor Fabunmi, she was determined to make a difference. And one way she could do that was to venture into investment banking to help businesses bridge the financing gap.\n\nClearly, her undergraduate degree had an impact on her career choice.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019re wondering how to get started in venture capital; wonder no more! Irrespective of your background, you can get started. And Fabunmi gave some pointers on this.\n\nCheck them out here: How Victoria Fabunmi helps startup founders get capital to drive growth\n\nTalk360\u2019s $4 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk360, South Africa\u2019s international calling platform, had announced a $4 million seed round.\n\nHAVA\u00cdC led the round. 4Di Capital and some angel investors like Gaston Aussems, Robert Kraal, Gabriel de Montessuss, and Marnix van der Ploeg participated.\n\nIn 2016, Dean Hiine, Hans Osnabrugge, and Jorne Schamp launched the startup as a travelling app to avoid roaming fees. However, after social media apps like WhatsApp introduced Internet calls, the co-founders were forced to reconsider their model.\n\nNow, Talk360 is an African Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) provider that allows users to make international calls for a fee through its app.\n\nIt\u2019s quite different from a voice call on WhatsApp or Telegram, for instance. Only the person initiating the call requires the Talk360 app and an Internet-enabled smartphone.\n\nIn other words, the recipient doesn\u2019t need a smartphone or Internet access. Essentially, you can use it to reach your cousin who lives in a village where Internet penetration is low.\n\nTalk360 claims that it connected 2 million people in 2021. Besides, the startup relies on integrations with older payment service providers, which are severely limited by region.\n\nThe company wants to use some of its funding to build its own payment platform to make payment and checkout easier for its African users. According to Hiins, the platform will bring all of Africa\u2019s \u201cscattered payment methods\u201d onto a single platform.\n\nFurther, he believes that the product will provide businesses with access to Africa\u2019s largest pool of localised payment options.\n\nWhile the app is primarily used in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, the startup is looking to expand its international calling operations across Africa and build a hub in Kenya.\n\nAppetito acquires Lamma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppetito, Egypt\u2019s on-demand delivery startup, has acquired Lamma, a similar startup with operations in Tunisia and Morocco\u2019s Maghreb regions.\n\nLaunched by Shehab Mokhtar, Appetito delivers groceries and household products to customers from 11 dark stores across three cities in the North African country.\n\nIn 2020, Lamma was founded by Yassir El Ismaili El Idrissi, Hamza Guesmi, and Koussi Aymen as a carpooling service in Tunisia.\n\nSoon after that, the startup shifted to a quick commerce platform that delivers groceries, personal care, and fashion items to users in Tunisia and Morocco \u2014 which launched this year.\n\nWhat does this acquisition mean? The Lamma team, its three dark stores, and a distribution centre will be integrated into Appetito as the two companies \u201cexplore many synergies.\u201d Also, El Idrissi will join Appetito as CEO.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Appetito intends to become the leading on-demand delivery player in frontier and emerging markets.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nBinance has open roles in Communication, Business Development, Customer Support, Engineering, Marketing, Product, Customer support, and other departments.

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain-based company, Vault Hill, has launched its NFT marketplace with the public sale of land in its human-centric metaverse, Vault Hill City (VHC). The ongoing sale is being held auction style using its native token, $VHC.\n\nAs part of the land sale, a free HTC VIVE Flow VR glasses will be given per parcel of land bought. However, to ensure scarcity and value, a limited number of virtual land (VLAND) parcels have been made available for purchase due to the high number already sold during the private sale round.\n\nLand parcels are currently being sold in the Vitality and Play districts of the metaverse, and using Vault Hill\u2019s interactive map, prospective land buyers and those who already participated in the private land sale can view which districts still have available VLAND. The map can also be used to explore the brands and creators that have already purchased land in the metaverse.\n\nThe VHC land parcels are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) built on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC-721) which are unique and distinct. The land has been grouped into four categories\u2013 standard, premium, deluxe and exclusive \u2013 each with their own unique offering.\n\nThe exclusive land type for instance can be merged to form a cluster of up to 8 land parcels, and it also has a courtyard in its center. Not only will Exclusive landowners benefit from a prime location, but owners of all 8 parcels that form a cluster have a unique advantage of monetising the courtyard to the limits of their imagination. Owners could erect a billboard in the courtyard, or even stadiums, conference centers, art installation, etc.\n\nOne of the many benefits of being a virtual land owner in VHC is that VHC is the first virtual world that combines all aspects of users\u2019 reality leveraging seven basic human instincts to enhance experiences in the metaverse. It is also the first virtual world with urban planning and development benefits to ensure users build on their virtual land respectfully.\n\nAdditionally, land owners will be given a \u2018NO CODE\u2019 builder tool which gives them total creative freedom to build their desired edifice without having to learn a single line of code. These edifices could range from cinemas, fitness studios, museums, libraries, event centers, etc. There are limitless opportunities for land owners in VHC be it individual investors or brands seeking to establish their presence in web3.\n\nVisit Vault Hill\u2019s marketplace now for your chance to own a piece of the world\u2019s first human-centric metaverse. Further information regarding the land sale can be found here and the metaverse development timeline can be viewed in the whitepaper.

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa\u2019s audience directly. Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdaverse, a Cardano ecosystem accelerator established to foster the growth of crypto-native projects in Africa, today announced its investment into a seed funding round for Cassava Network, a blockchain infrastructure that empowers African content creators, developers, and end-users through mutually aligned tasks and incentives. Over 40 investors, including Dragonfly, CMT Digital, YGG, Mirana, etc., participated in the recently closed investment round to implement the next phase of Cassava platform development.\n\nAdaverse was launched in September 2021 as a joint venture partnership between EMURGO Africa and Everest Ventures, to identify and provide valuable support resources to promising African founders building the next wave of Web3 dApps in DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and metaverse tools on Cardano\u2019s third-generation and environmentally-sustainable blockchain.\n\nWhat is Cassava Network?\n\nCassava is a blockchain infrastructure that connects developers and users to the Web3 ecosystem. Through its native token CSV, Cassava transforms any web application into a crypto-enabled app suitable to reward contributors and end-users for their dedication. Their product offering consists of token rewards networks, digital identification systems, user-controlled data profiles, and a crypto and NFT wallet specifically designed to empower content creators.\n\nAs such, Cassava is a new incentives platform for Africans and the regional market, as CSV will enable projects, content creators including NFT artists, video creators, and content consumers to earn rewards in innovative ways through play-to-earn, create-to-earn, and engage-to-earn models. Additionally, it will offer CSV holders a portfolio of incentives, including lending, staking, AMM, and voting rights for platform governance.\n\nWhy Cassava Network?\n\nCassava offers a unique opportunity for African creatives to build digital economies, protect their intellectual properties and connect with the global market at large, through an easy-to-use multifunctional wallet that can be integrated with apps for user incentivization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cassava Network\u2019s PR Director, Kelin said \u201cCassava Network will use the investment capital to expand and improve its technological capabilities in order to leverage the Web3 economy to drive crypto mass adoption across Africa and beyond.

Ikomi and others made appearances for the Prosecution.\n\nAt the resumption of proceedings, Ikomi told the court that he had another application to be allowed to take evidence by oath to make for faster proceedings.\n\nThis application was vehemently opposed by the defence counsel, Chief Otomewo arguing that there was no provision for the use of Statement on Oath at the Magistrate\u2019s Court.\n\nCounsel to Prosecution informed court that the provisions of Section 255 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law, Delta State as well as the Evidence Act to which it refers allow it.\n\nAccording to the Prosecution counsel, the prosecution witness was on a security assignment and so could not appear in court and the matter was consequently adjourned for rulings as shown in the records of the court.\n\nFollowing the prosecution\u2019s submission, Otomewo said that, there were some lawyers whose names were not in the Fiat stressing that they always come to court because they had no job to do.\n\nAngered by Otomewo\u2019s comment, Chief Robinson Ariyo who is a Chief at the Palace of the Olu of Warri with traditional title of the \u201cEgogo (Mouthpiece) of Warri Kingdom warned Chief Otomewo never to make such insinuating remarks about him or he would receive an insult.\n\nIn a swift response, the Magistrate asked if Chief Ariyo had any case in the court and if not he should leave insisting that she would not recognize Ariyo as a Chief.\n\nResponding, Chief Ariyo informed the Court that he was one of the nominal complainants in the matter\n\nbeing a Chief in the Palace and the Council of Chiefs being the body that wrote the Petition.\n\nIt will be recall that ever since the matter commenced, the Magistrate had continued to target Chief Ariyo refusing to either call him a Chief or record him with the suffix Chief.\n\nIt is also on record that the Magistrate had never recorded Chief Ariyo as a Chief even though Chief Ariyo announces himself as such.\n\nAccording to the prosecution counsel, the refusal of Magistrate Diejomaoh to recognise Ariyo as a Chief while according Otomewo as a Chief was an indication that she was playing ethnic politics having served as a Lawyer under Chief Otomewo.\n\nThe Prosecution counsels, however, said that they had tried to distinguish between an objection arising from the lack of neutrality of a court and other forms of objection.\n\nAccording to them, this goes to the root of lack of fair haring arising from the developments and decisions in the case.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Justice Joe Acha represented by Justice Geraldine Ono Imadegbelo said violence against women, girls and children should be treated under the violence against persons prohibition (VAPP) Law. He called on all facets of the justice system to look into and correct the rationale for giving a life imprisonment to a single perpetrator of rape but handing over a twenty year imprisonment for those involved in gang rape which was a more grievous offence.\n\nThe DPP, Kingsley Odabi Esq while reeling out data at its resource stated that there was a geometric rise in the pattern of offense with cases of parents violating female children; adults and grandfathers violating children 3years old and less prevalent in society hence the recommendation to stop GBV through his call for a gender management system to be put in place; Liaising with legislature to enact laws passed; empowerment of women in all the Ministries, Department, and Agencies (MDA\u2019s); Getting Judges to buy into the FIDA campaigns and endorse such; Development on the education curriculum to focus on raised lapses to effect corrections.\n\nEarlier in her welcome address to stakeholders, legal luminaries and representatives of organizations, CSO\u2019s, NGO\u2019s and the media at the FIDA occasion, Chairperson Edo FIDA, Mrs. Violet Oghogho Olumese stated that apart from counselling and rendering Pro bono services to indigents, FIDA was poised to change the narrative in incidents of GBV through reliance on the VAPP Law as domesticated in Edo State in 2021. She urged stakeholders to ventilate and come up with solutions which could help at curbing the Hydra headed monster ravaging society,\n\nIn her keynote address,\u201d Changing the narrative of gender based violence, multimedia approach, \u201d former FIDA Chairperson and Permanent Secretary (PS) Ministry of Art and Culture, Iryn Omorogiuwa quoting world statistics on GBV stated that every minute one out of three women gets abused. She said this was accompanied by other forms of dehumanization and a lack of respect for the women folks especially on issues relating to traditional practices and human trafficking in which women are the main culprits who violate the rights of other women.\n\nApart from cyber bullying which she frowned at for its ability to tilt victims over the edge leading to suicide, she also mentioned family laws governing inheritance which she observed sent wrong signals which engendered violence and harassment hence the call to participants to look beyond the justice sector by making personal efforts to change perception through restoring, reintegrating victims of GBV in society and creating a zero violence state.\n\nShe therefore called for the regulation and control of money in circulation, empowerment of youths and prescription of maximum punishment for perpetrators of GBV, also, blowing the cover of perpetrators from the point of arrest to conviction to serve as deterrent to others.\n\nProfessor Evelyn Uwa Edosomwan presented the paper on, \u201cResolving the concept of feminism and gender equality in contemporary Nigeria while Professor Job Okhioma Odion presented the paper, \u201d An assessment of the legal framework for engendering women participation in politics in Nigeria which was closely followed by discussion segments and a robust question and answer session.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Shortly after the meeting, we headed for the airport.\n\n\u201cA short time into the about five hours flight, I went on social media, to see that all hell had broken loose. Trust some Nigerians. When there\u2019s no controversy, they simply create one. They will die of boredom if they don\u2019t have something to wail or ululate about.\n\n\u201cWhat were they bellyaching on? Oh, he used the words \u2018my successor,\u2019 instead of \u2018APC candidate.\u2019 That means he wants to rig the election. Otiose.\n\n\u201cOh, he talked about Governors who performed well being given opportunity to get a second term, for continuity. That means he wants to impose someone from within the government to succeed him. Consensus is what he wants. Puerile.\n\n\u201cIs consensus not one of the acceptable ways of choosing candidates, according to the Electoral Act? So the party can jolly well decide on the method it wants.\n\n\u201cOh, he didn\u2019t talk about zoning. APC wants to give its ticket to the North. Really? Did you see anything like that in the speech?\n\n\u201cI tell you. When some Nigerians don\u2019t see what they expect in a speech or statement, they simply conjure and create their own. And the wailing starts.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Buhari had while addressing the governors on Tuesday ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primary taking place on Monday, stated, \u201cThe party has successfully established internal policies that promote continuity and smooth succession plans even at the state and local government levels.\n\n\u201cFor example, first-term governors who have served credibly well have been encouraged to stand for re-election. Similarly, second-term governors have been accorded the privilege of promoting successors that are capable of driving their visions as well as the ideals of the party.\u201d\n\nBuhari said he would be seeking reciprocity from the governors ahead of the presidential primary which comes up in the next six days.\n\n\u201cIn keeping with the established internal policies of the party and as we approach the convention in a few days, therefore, I wish to solicit the reciprocity and support of the governors and other stakeholders in picking my successor, who would fly the flag of our party for election into the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023,\u201d the President added.\n\nHe asked the governors to ensure that all interests \u2018converge\u2019 as regards the outcome of the presidential primary. The President added that the person who emerges as the presidential candidate must be one who could give Nigerians a sense of victory even before the polls.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cAs we approach the convention, I appeal to all of you to allow our interests to converge, our focus to remain on the changing dynamics of our environment, the expectations of our citizens, and the global community.\n\n\u201cOur objective must be the victory of our party and our choice of a candidate must be someone who would give the Nigerian masses a sense of victory and confidence even before the elections.\u201d",

We visited our offices in several Local Government Areas, held meetings with our staff, had audience with the Council of Obas to solicit the support of their Royal Majesties for peaceful elections and met with the security agencies.\n\n\u201cWe also observed the ongoing training of ad hoc staff and the deployment of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) for mock accreditation of voters in some Polling Units across the three Senatorial Districts of the State.\n\n\u201cWe will again return to Ekiti State shortly to meet with the stakeholders and for the signing of the Peace Accord by political parties and candidates under the auspices of the National Peace Committee.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said as the Commission was getting ready for the Ekiti poll, it has also gone far with similar preparations for the Osun State governorship election holding next month on Saturday, July 2022.\n\nAt the same time, he said the Commission has continue with preparations for the 2023 General Election.\n\n\u201cOn this note, let me seize this opportunity to address two critical aspects of our preparations for the forthcoming General Election.\n\n\u201cNigerians may recall that the ongoing CVR started a year ago. For the first time, the Commission introduced online pre-registration as well as physical registration at designated centres.\n\n\u201cAs the deadline for the suspension of the CVR i.e. 30th June 2022 approaches, long queues are building up, especially in some states in the South East, Lagos, Kano and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\n\u201cThe Commission had anticipated the last-minute surge and therefore established additional centres and deployed more machines to register citizens,\u201d he said.\n\nUnfortunately, he said the security situation in many parts of the country has not allowed full deployment as planned.

          "text": "With barely 72 hours to the presidential convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the party\u2019s national leader and frontline presidential aspirant, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Thursday opened up on how he worked to ensure Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s victory during the 2015 presidential elections.\n\nThe former Lagos state governor also went memory lane on how he ensured the emergence of Professor Yemi Osinbajo and Mr Dapo Abiodun as vice president and Ogun state governor respectively.\n\nTinubu spoke Thursday at the Presidential Lodge in Abeokuta, the Ogun state capital, at a meeting with the state\u2019s APC delegates ahead of the party\u2019s primary holding Monday.\n\nOn his entourage were Lagos state Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Kano state Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and former Borno state governor, Senator Kashim Shettima.\n\nThough a former Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice in Lagos state under Tinubu\u2019s watch as governor, Osinbajo is from Ogun state, a reason the governor recently endorsed him for the nation\u2019s top job.\n\nThe former governor\u2019s position may have come against the backdrop of the recent plea by President Buhari that the governors allow him pick his successor.\n\nThe president\u2019s position which has been receiving hard knocks from some party stakeholders is a semblance of consensus, an arrangement Tunubu has consistently kicked against.\n\nThe current national chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu emerged via consensus.\n\nOn the party\u2019s platform to seek its presidential ticket are 23 chieftains who were all screened Monday and Tuesday, with the John Odigie-Oyegun-led committee asking them to commit to the consensus arrangement.\n\nThe convention holds at the Eagle Square in Abuja.\n\nTinubu\n\nSpeaking on how he worked for the emergence of Buhari and his deputy, Osinbajo, the former lawmaker said it\u2019s the turn of the Yoruba to lead and that he\u2019s the one.\n\nAddressing the delegates in Yoruba language, with Governor Abiodun seated, he said: \u201cYou have not heard this from me before. This is the first place I am saying this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf not for me that led the war front, Buhari won\u2019t have emerged. He contested first, second and third times, but lost. He even said on television that he won\u2019t contest again.\n\n\u201cBut I went to his home in Katsina, I told him you would contest and win, but you won\u2019t joke with the matters of the Yorubas.\n\n\u201cSince he has emerged I have not been appointed minister. I didn\u2019t get nor request a contract. This time, it\u2019s Yoruba turn and in Yorubaland, it\u2019s my tenure,\u201d he declared in an emphatic tone.\n\nContinuing his trajectory of history, the APC national leader said: \u201cSince the time we started with the Action Congress, Action Congress of Nigeria, and now the All Progressives Congress, I had wanted to contest for president that time.\n\n\u201cThis is me telling you between me and God Almighty, Buhari called me to be his Vice President. He said because the first time he contested, he picked Okadigbo, flamboyant, catholic, but Nigerians didn\u2019t vote for him.\n\n\u201cThe second time, he picked another Igbo, Ume-Ezeoke (Edwin, former Speaker, House of Representatives), Nigerians didn\u2019t vote for him, that if he goes to bring the Pope to run as his vice, Nigerians won\u2019t vote for him, \u201cbut you, Bola Tinubu, you have six governors, you have never lost an election before, come and be my vice.\n\n\u201cHe knew all the calculations then favoured us, that was why he wanted me as his vice, but I told him to let us build the party first. And when we finished building the party after we brought in people from the PDP, Saraki now saw that those from the PDP will not get anything if Buhari, a Muslim becomes the president and me, also a Muslim becomes his vice, he won\u2019t get the senate president and the senate president cannot also be a Muslim, that was how they started the campaign of calumny against me.\n\n\u201cAnd I told them that I have a candidate that is a Christan that I can nominate so that the party will not break, that was how I nominated Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. I surrendered my right to him (Osinbajo).\n\n\u201cI was asked to submit three names, Yemi Cardozo, Wale Edun, and Yemi Osinbajo, but I told them if I submit three names, they will play a game, they may make it four and pick the fourth one. I gave them one name and that was Osinbajo.\u201d\n\nHe also told the delegates why he\u2019s best qualified to succeed Buhari. From the array of South-west presidential aspirants.\n\n\u201cIt is my time, I\u2019m educated, I\u2019m experienced. I have been serving people for a long time, bring me the presidency, it is my turn,\u201d Tinubu further declared.\n\nOn Governor Abiodun\n\nOn the current Ogun state governor, Tinubu also said without God and him, Abiodun would not have emerged governor in 2019.\n\nPointing to the governor, he said: \u201cDapo that\u2019s sitting down here, could he have become governor without me? We were at the stadium, they tore all his posters. Even the party flag, they didn\u2019t want to hand over it to him, I was the one who brought it.\n\n\u201cIf he wants to meet God at the right place, he must know that without God and me, he would not have become Governor.\u201d\n\nBiodun responds\n\nResponding, Governor Abiodun acknowledged the sagacity and political prowess of Tunubu whom he described as a \u201cpolitical warrior, serial winner and strategist.\u201d\n\nHowever, rather than a straight endorsement, Abiodun told the aspirant and members of his entourage delegates from the state would do \u201cthe right thing\u201d at the convention.\n\nEx-Lagos gog urges reconciliation in Oyo\n\nAnd during a similar visit to Ibadan, Oyo state capital, Thursday, Asiwaju Tinubu asked the party\u2019s governorship candidate to commence reconciliation and harmonise different tendencies within the party.\n\nTinubu stated this in Ibadan while addressing 99 APC delegates from the state.\n\nThe APC national leader said governorship election is not a child play, hence the need to visit the aggrieved party leaders\u2019 houses, even at midnight, to reconcile and forge unity ahead of the general elections.\n\nThe presidential aspirant said Senator Teslim Folarin \u201chas to work, walk and that APC leaders in the state should help him to pacify all aggrieved members for the party to come out victorious in 2023 general elections.\n\nAsiwaju Tinubu assured the APC delegates and party leaders present that he would come back on behalf of Senator Folarin to talk to the aggrieved members on the need to sheath their sword.\n\nSpeaking further, Asiwaju Tinubu declared that he would be coming back to Ibadan to raise the hands of Senator Folarin as the state\u2019s APC governorship candidate.\n\nLawan names Kalu campaign DG\n\nIn a related development, the Ahmad Lawan Campaign Organisation has announced the Whip of the Senate, Orji Uzor Kalu as its Director General.\n\nThe appointment was contained in a statement issued to that effect in Abuja Thursday by media team of the campaign group.\n\nAlso, chairmen and vice chairmen of strategic committees set up were also announced.\n\nThe chairmen of the eight committees are Finance and Budget headed by\n\nAuwal Lawan with Senator Sani Musa as co-chair, Strategy and Planning headed by Senator Ikechukwu Obiora with Senator Betty Apiafi as deputy chair, and Contact and Mobilization chaired by Senator Barau Jibrin, while\n\nSenator Peter Nwaoboshi is the deputy.\n\nThe rest are Media and Publicity committee led by Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi with Femi Fani Kayode as deputy chair, Security and Intelligence is headed by Mallam Lawal Daura with Commodore Mohammed as deputy chair, while Senator Bello Mandiya and Hon. Hillary Bisong are chairman and deputy chairman respectively of the Transport and Logistics committee.\n\nAlso, Prince Mustapha Audu chairs the youth groups and Hon Aisha Ismail the women groups.\n\nThe statement further said the Kalu-led campaign team \u201cis expected to strengthen the campaign organization and build a stronger cohesion that would deliver All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket to the Senate President during the presidential primaries, and ultimately lead him to victory in the general election.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu, Ngige, Ganduje, others chair convention c\u2019ttees\n\nMeanwhile, the APC Wednesday released the list of chairmen/persons of subcommittees to organise the national convention to elect the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nAfter several postponements, the party finally fixed its presidential primary for June 6-8.\n\nThe list, as released by the APC National Publicity Secretary Felix Morka, has most governors heading the subcommittees.\n\nGombe state Governor Muhammed Inuwa Yahaya chairs the committee on budget, with Minister of Finance, Budget and Planning Mrs Zainab Ahmed as co-chair.\n\nWhile Lagos state Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu will chair the committee on finance, his Ogun counterpart, Dapo Abiodun heads the accreditation and decoration committee.\n\nAlso, the duo of Ondo state Governor Rotimi Akeredulou and former interior minister, Lt.Gen Abdulrahman Dambazau(retd), are to chair the committee on security and compliance.\n\nThe list also showed Kebbi state Governor Atiku Bagudu and Imo state Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo state as co-chair of the election planning committee.\n\nKano state Governor Abdullai Umar Ganduje chairs the transportation committee with FCT Minister of State Ramatu Aliyu providing necessary support.\n\nThe duo Borno state Governor Babangana Zulum and his Osun state counterpart, Gboyega Oyetola, take charge of accommodation, with their Nasarawa counterpart heading the media and publicity committee.\n\nSimilarly, Minister of Labour and Employment Chris Ngige, and a former minister of health, Isaac Adewole, will co-chair the committee on medical, while Attorney General and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami, SAN, heads legal committee.\n\nThe party also saddled Zamfara state Governor Bello Matawalle and FCT Minister Mohammed Bello with the responsibility of venue and site servicing, with Yobe state Governor Mai Mala Buni leading the committee on election appeal.\n\nAlso, the party named Plateau state Governor Simon Lalong and Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development Sadiya Farouq as co-chairs of hospitality and welfare committee.\n\nThe committees on protocols and digital communications are chaired by the duo of Katsina state Governor Aminu Masari and Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara state respectively.\n\nThe committee on pre-convention/management/ rapporteur is co-chaired by Kaduna state Governor Nasir El-Rufai and Minister for Women Affairs Pauline Tallen, while the presidential screening appeal committee has Niger state Governor Sani Bello and Deputy Speaker House of Representatives as co-chairs.\n\nBesides, there is a committee on accreditation of diplomats to be chaired by Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege, with Minister of Foreign Affairs Geoffrey Onyeama as co-chair.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "Nigeria is hosting the maiden edition of the \u2018Nigeria-Africa Natural Resources and Energy Investment Summit\u2019, a three-day Summit with the theme \u2018Towards a Greener Africa\u2019, in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nSpeaking in his keynote address at the event, President Muhammadu Buhari represented by the Hon. Minister of mine and steel Arc Olamilekan Adegbite on Wednesday said Africa needs to join the rest of the world\u2019s shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources.\n\nArc Olamilekan Adegbite, pointed that Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s convention is indeed important. Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development, even as the world shifts away from fossil fuel to clean and renewable energy sources, in the fight against climate change. In the midst of this energy transition lies many challenges and opportunities for a continent yearning for development.\n\n\u201cI believe this should spur us as a continent of diverse people to co-operate and collaborate more, initiate innovative solutions to the challenges that are peculiar to us, come up with technologies and products that will lead to the growth and industrialization of Africa in a more environment friendly manner while encouraging the development and financing of green energy projects.\n\n\u201cOur meeting today provides the opportunity to share views on natural resources and energy market developments. Additionally, the morning session will focus on Maximizing Mineral Potentials and Attracting Private Investments. Our esteemed speakers will discuss the opportunities within the Nigerian Mining Sector, the underexplored minerals which are key to clean renewable energy, the success stories and the strides towards driving Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the Sector.\n\n\u201cParticipating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation would strengthen their cooperation, through joint assessment and viewpoints, with the aim to financing sustainable African Natural Resources and Energy Projects that are key to the transition, for the benefit of producers and consumers and to regularly review at technical and ministerial levels the status of our cooperation,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn policies and framework, Buhari stated that, \u201cOur joint meetings and activities will support us in formulating favorable policy and strategy development for the natural resource sector as the world looks towards a greener future. A policy that is less subject to extremes, both today and in the future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Group Managing Director, African Industries Group, Alok Gupta, who was represented by Partha Ghosh spoke on opportunities on Nigeria\u2019s mining sector. African Natural Resources and Mines Limited, ANRML, is a group company of the African Industries Group.\n\n\u201cNigeria is heavily endowed with solid minerals with 44 minerals found in over 500 locations including all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, have more than one mineral type which indeed is a rare occurrence.\n\n\u201cWith the view of maximizing these opportunities, to create wealth, grow the GDP and expand opportunities available to Nigerians. The mining sector is the backbone of industrialization of the economy.\n\n\u201cHe also pointed various incentives rolled out n the Buhari-led administration to promote ease of doing business in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe mining implementation and stability is strategically focusing on steel. Nigeria has the 12th largest steel deposits in the world with more than 3 billion tonnes resources in Kogi, Enugu, Zamfara and Kaduna States.\n\n\u201cAnnually $3.3 billion is still spent on steel imports which impact the economy. With focusing on steel Nigeria can reduce dependency on imports and the economy would become a major player in global markets.\n\nHowever, he disclosed that his company has established a fully integrated mining and steel processing plant in Gujeni Village in Kagarko Local Government Area of Kaduna State, with 5 million tonnes per annum, which is Nigeria\u2019s largest foreign direct investment of $600 million, and will be employing over 4000 Nigerians, including good community development projects and schemes ongoing.",
          "summary": "Minister of mine and steel Arc Olamilekan Adegbite on Wednesday said Africa needs to join the rest of the world\u2019s shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources.\nAfrica requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development, even as the world shifts away from fossil fuel to clean and renewable energy sources, in the fight against climate change.\n\u201cOur meeting today provides the opportunity to share views on natural resources and energy market developments.\nAfrican Natural Resources and Mines Limited, ANRML, is a group company of the African Industries Group.\nThe mining sector is the backbone of industrialization of the economy.",

Based on our yield measurement of 66 m2 for each variety in Abuja, the calculated yields per hectare of Faro 44, GAWAL R1 and Mayun 1 are 5.6 mt, 7.0 mt and 8.7 mt respectively with the transplanting method. GAWAL R1\u2019s yield is 25% higher than that of Faro 44 and Mayun 1 is 55% higher than Faro 44\u201d.\n\nHe said the company was also looking at the establishment of rice extension system and improvement of rice research system in collaboration with the agriculture research institutes such as National Cereal Research Institute (NCRI), National Agricultural Seeds Council(NASC), IITA, Bwari Area Council and agricultural research and extension services in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are aiming to introduce and register many more good quality and high-yield new rice varieties to Nigerian rice farmers\u201d, he said.\n\nHe said that apart from the traditional rice transplanting technique, the company has also been promoting the new technique of broadcasting rice production for large and small-scale farming and the result shows that the rice yield is relatively high as well.\n\nHe said the company was a professional seed company, that not only sell seed but teach farmers advance planting technique for optimum yield.\n\nGAWAL was established in Nigeria in 2006 and has\n\nbeen committed to the agricultural development of Nigeria through the production and supply of quality crop seeds.\n\nAs one of the large-scale seed companies in Nigeria, it has supplied over 20,000 mt rice and maize seeds to Nigeria farmers in over 30 states.",

          "title": "Nigeria Committed to Energy Transition, Reducing Gas Emission \u2013 Silva",
          "text": "Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, HE Chief Timipre Sylva has disclosed that Nigeria made a strong commitment to embracing energy transition while pledging to significantly reduce its greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\n\nThe Minister stated this yesterday at the Nigeria-Africa natural resource and energy summit in Abuja\n\nHe said that that was in addition to the commitment Nigeria made through President Muhammadu Buhari, at COP 26 in 2021 to attain carbon net-zero by 2060.\n\nSylva who explained that Nigeria is following a transition pathway that combines technology, investment, business strategies, and government policy that will enable Nigeria to transit from its current energy system to a low-carbon energy system with natural gas playing a pivotal role, added that the country needs affordable, reliable and sustainable energy resources to eradicate the prevalent energy poverty in the shortest time possible, and propel economic growth.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe only viable option currently on the table is natural gas, considering vast proven gas endowments, put at 209 TCF, with 600 TCF potential reserves. We cannot ignore this resource, especially when energy poverty is viciously starring at us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal of Nigeria\u2019s gas policy is to ensure that gas development is undertaken in accordance with our socio-economic development priorities. The aim is to guarantee long-term energy security in the country, and boost the domestic gas market, hence the declaration of 2021-to-2030 as the \u2018Decade of Gas\u2019 by Mr. President. We have embarked on a critical pathway to ensuring that our abundant Natural gas resources are marshalled to engender domestic economic growth and development.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the Ministry of Petroleum Resources has launched the National Gas Expansion Programme NGEP as part of the National Gas Policy to expand Nigeria\u2019s Domestic gas utilization; the National Gas Flare Commercialization Programme; as well as specific provisions in the new Petroleum Industry Act PIA that elevates LPG as the fuel of choice compared to other competing fuels and the usage of solar energy is already being vigorously promoted across the country, while the use of hydro, wind and other natural resources are also being expanded.\n\nThe Minister who lauded the theme of the Summit \u2018Towards a Greener Africa\u2019 observed that it is very apt and timely at this challenging time in the energy industry globally. However, he explained that at the core of this challenge is the issue of climate change that is eliciting clamour for transition to greener energy sources to reduce carbon emission.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that every nation and region comes up with a green initiative to foster a collective combat against the incessant threat to the planet caused by CO2 emission. Such initiatives must be bold, decisive and on target.\n\n\u201cIt should however be borne in mind that such initiatives should reflect the realities and conditions prevailing in these places, particularly the socio-economic development and energy needs.\n\n\u201cThe key consideration in every country\u2019s energy policy should be pivoted on energy security. This constitutes a very high priority goal for nations all over the globe. The reason is not far-fetched: Energy propels economic growth.\n\n\u201cThat makes energy security synonymous with optimum and sustainable economic growth. Energy is an indispensable ingredient for human development and socio-economic prosperity. It is central to jobs creation, security, health, and other challenges facing humans.\n\n\u201cThis is why access to energy is prominently addressed in the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals. In particular, SDG 7 focuses on access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, as a fundamental right.\n\nHe said that as at today, energy poverty is still much prevalent in the world, especially in Africa where millions of people still do not have access to electricity or clean cooking fuels.\n\nBased on the UN data, about 760 million people lack access to electricity worldwide, with three out of four of them living in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFurthermore, one-third of the world\u2019s population \u2013 about 2.6 billion people \u2013 have no access to clean cooking fuels, with over 900 million of these in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nOn the average, only 48% of sub-Saharan Africa population have access to electricity, while only 18% have access to clean cooking fuels, compared with a global average of 90% and 70%, respectively.\n\nIn relation to CO2 emission, World Bank statistics shows that the world average of CO2 emissions was 4.48 metric tons per capita in 2018, with some regions and individual countries recording five to seven times this value. Emission by sub-Saharan Africa in total was only 0.76 metric tons per capita.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe implication of the above is that the issues surrounding energy poverty, climate and sustainable development are not mutually exclusive. Consequently, the approaches to attending to these issues should not be disconnected.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Sylva admitted that climate change is definitely of serious concern to Africa. But of equal concern is the alarming level of energy poverty. Both must be addressed in a sustainable manner. It must be a win-win situation.\n\nEnergy transition is about providing clean energy, and not about discriminating between energy sources. In the face of the current high level of energy poverty worldwide, especially in Africa, all energy sources will be required to achieve the sustainable development goal of providing access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.",

          "text": "Activities intensified on Thursday among key players within the All Progressives Congress (APC) as the party continues its search for a strong and acceptable presidential candidate in the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe party had fixed next week Monday to commence a special convention for its presidential primary shortly after the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) extended the deadline for political parties to conduct their primaries.\n\nAhead of the primary, some of the presidential hopefuls have stepped up activities aimed at boosting their chances of emerging as the party\u2019s flagbearer in the forthcoming poll.\n\nShun Monetary Incentives\n\nIn what could be described as a last-minute effort, one of the aspirants and incumbent Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, was said to have met with the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, and five governors of the ruling party.\n\nAlthough his spokesperson, Laolu Akande, has yet to confirm this, the meeting was reportedly held on Thursday evening at the official residence of the Vice President in Abuja.\n\nElsewhere, another presidential hopeful and Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, wants the party\u2019s delegates to consider the future of Nigeria and a candidate who will deliver in the nation\u2019s best interest while voting in the primary next week.\n\nHe urged the delegates to set aside monetary incentives and seriously consider what was for the greater good of the country.\n\nLawan, while wooing the delegates, asked them to consider him critically, saying he would offer himself, his heart, integrity, and dedication to ensure that the dream of justice for all and a dream of uniting to fight the nation\u2019s foes, were achieved.\n\nHe urged them to scrutinise the past practices of all aspirants to elicit what behaviours, avarice, and rapacity his co-contenders have exhibited in the past.\n\nIt Is My Turn\n\nSimilarly, an APC chieftain, Bola Tinubu, visited Ogun State in continuation of his consultation ahead of the primary where he hopes to get the party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nWhile addressing party delegates at the Presidential Lodge in Abeokuta, he recalled his role in the process that led to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s victory over then-incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan in 2015.\n\nTinubu believes if not for him, President Buhari would not have won the election, having lost three previous attempts to occupy the highest office of the land.\n\n\u201cIf not for me that stood behind Buhari, he wouldn\u2019t have become the President,\u201d he said. \u201cHe tried the first time, he failed; the second time, he failed; the third, he failed. Since he became the President, I have never gotten ministerial slots; I didn\u2019t collect any contract, and I have never begged for anything from him. It is the turn of Yoruba; it is my turn.\u201d\n\nApart from the President, the APC chieftain stated that he played major roles in the careers of several political leaders, including the emergence of Professor Osinbajo as the Vice President.\n\n\u201cHe (Buhari) knew all the calculations then favoured us, that is why he wanted me as his vice, but I told him to let us build the party first \u2026 I told them that I have a candidate that is a Christian that I can nominate so that the party will not break.\n\n\u201cThat was how I nominated Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, I surrendered my right to him. I was asked to submit three names \u2013 Yemi Cardozo, Wale Edun, and Yemi Osinbajo.\u201d\n\n23 Aspirants For Ticket\n\nAs part of activities lined up for its presidential primary, Osinbajo, Lawan, Tinubu, and 20 others had appeared before the John Oyegun-led APC Presidential Screening Committee.\n\nIn no particular order, they include Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole; and oil magnate, Tein Jack Rich.\n\nGovernor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa; former governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun; former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha; popular Pastor Tunde Bakare, former governor of Zamfara State, Sani Yerima; and former governor of Rivers State, Rotimi Amaechi, also appeared before the panel.\n\nAlso screened were former Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba; former presidential candidate, Nicholas Felix; a female aspirant, Uju Ken-Ohanenye; Ondo North Senator, Ajayi Boroffice; and a former Senate President, Ken Nnamani.\n\nOthers include Governor David Umahi Ebonyi; former Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation, Ogbonnaya Onu; Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi, and former Minister of Information under the late General Sani Abacha regime, Ikeobasi Mokelu.\n\nSoutherners\u2019 Agitation\n\nOn the second day of the screening, President Buhari met with governors elected on the APC platform on how a candidate should emerge.\n\nHe charged the governors to ensure that the party\u2019s convention picks a presidential candidate that reflects all the values and virtues of the party.\n\nThe President had assured the governors that the consultation process would continue, to ensure that all aspirants and stakeholders would be brought on board right through to the convention.\n\nHe explained that the process was to also ensure that any anxiety occasioned by different factors was effectively brought under control and that the APC emerges stronger.\n\nDespite the development within the party, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has insisted that the APC must zone its ticket to the South to retain the presidency in 2023.\n\nAlthough he said he has no preferred presidential candidate, Akeredolu who doubles as Chairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum explained that it was important for the South to produce the next President in the spirit of equity and fairness.\n\n\u201cSuccinctly, Governor Akeredolu as a leader and stakeholder in the southern presidency agitation is committed to the interest of the southern Nigeria geopolitical zone,\u201d his Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, said in a statement on Thursday.",

He disclosed that he never jumped bail not received any invitation from the EFCC prior to the invasion of his house. \u201d Let me start by thanking God and Nigerians for their prayers. I thank God that our convention didn\u2019t hold as it was earlier scheduled to hold, if not I would have missed. Let me also say that I did not jump bail nor failed to honour EFCC invitation. Infact, there was no time I was invited by the commission.\n\n\u201cI am a serving senator of the federal republic of Nigeria and a former two-term governor with a known address. As a serving senator, EFCC could have approached the national assembly through the president and request my presence. None of this was done. I wouldn\u2019t want to talk about it again, I believe EFCC is doing its job. But it is important to know that a man under investigation is a man who left N48bn in the coffers of Imo state and I am being charged for N2.9bn. I was able to run free education throughout my tenure and maintained peace in my entire tenure.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about how he was able to beat the screening deadline, the Imo lawmaker said: \u201cMy screening went well. I arrived there at about 10:30pm and the chairman had already folded his papers and was about to leave before I made a sudden appearance. I was able to tell them my manifesto.\u201d\n\nHe also spoke on the conduct of the primary and the choice of candidate the party might eventually settle for. \u201cAPC primary is not the final election. There\u2019s going to be a general election after the primary where Nigerians who are party members and non-party members will vote. And Nigerians are looking for three basic things \u2013 the person they can trust, who can build the economy and the character of the individuals.\u201d\n\nOn whether the former Imo governor is willing to step down for any presidential aspirant, Mr Okorocha revealed that he\u2019s ready to step down but only for a consensus candidate of the party. \u201cWhat I really don\u2019t like is a gentleman waking up in the morning after consulting your family and friends, picking a N100m form and get to the stage and announced that you are stepping down. But if it\u2019s about consensus I will gladly abide. A serious minded individuals won\u2019t just step down. People step down for different reasons. If I see somebody who has the same idea I have or better than what I have, I will step down. I have come to create wealth, change the economy of this nation and make life better for Nigerians. It\u2019s passion that keeps driving me not the desire for personal wealth.\u201d\n\nThe embattled Imo governor also spoke on whether is President Buhari\u2019s anointed candidate, he noted: \u201cI have never seen myself as the candidate of the presidency. I have not but if I have favour in the eyes of presidency, I will appreciate.\u201d\n\nSenator Okorocha noted that he believes President Buhari is a democrat and will not impose any candidate, rather requesting to have a say in who succeeds him. \u201cThe president himself is not even a delegate. Mr president I know will not impose a candidate, he\u2019s only saying he wants to have a say in who becomes his successor.\u201d\n\nOn the possibility of having a strong third force in 2023, Senator Okorocha said: \u201cWe have three types of candidates. There are some that are very good on social media, those on the TV and radio and those that are well rooted in the grassroots. 2023 will be very interesting.\u201d\n\nThe former Imo state governor said he remains the only Southern APC aspirant who can win win votes in the north because of his record and he has done for them.",

Nyesom Wike, said \u201cwe will play our part to ensure that the PDP\u2019s Operation Rescue Nigeria is a resounding success.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cAs you already know, we had the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) primaries in which we again demonstrated two things to Nigerians:\n\n\u201cOne, that the PDP is serious about ensuring that we make the right decisions for Operation Rescue Nigeria. For the PDP to have gone ahead to conduct its primaries even though the umpire, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), decided to change the rules in the middle of the game shows that we are a truly formidable force to reckon with. The weaker party had to wait for the results of the PDP convention before they made their move.\n\n\u201cTwo, that the PDP stands head and shoulders above the rest in coordinating primaries at the state and national levels. Almost all results are in, and we had rancour-free deliberations. \u201cSo, those who tell you that the PDP and the All Progressives Congress (APC) are the same are not being honest.\n\n\u201cWe all saw and watched the primaries play out, and a winner emerged. The result was the will of the majority, which is what democracy is all about.\n\n\u201cLet me then take this opportunity to once again congratulate our party\u2019s flagbearer, HE Atiku Abubakar, for his victory in the primaries. We will play our part to ensure that the PDP\u2019s Operation Rescue Nigeria is a resounding success.\u201d\n\nGovernor Makinde, who on Wednesday, embarked on a tour of the ongoing Ibadan Circular Road and the 500,000 Litres Aviation Fuel depot at the Ibadan Airport, said his administration is determined to deliver the two projects to Oyo State residents.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn a governance note, we visited the Ibadan Circular Road project yesterday and assessed the impact it would have on the ongoing Ajoda New Town Estate. From our assessment, a few of the constructed houses will be affected, and we are having conversations with the contractors about how to navigate the disruption.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to deliver the Ibadan Circular Road project to our people, and Craneburg Construction Company has already started work on the bridges and interchanges.\n\n\u201cLet me end this newsletter by saying that if you want to come into politics and make a change in the system, the time to do that is now. \u201cJoin a political party and be part of the process of building the structure. 2027 is not as far away as you may think,\u201d he added.",

          "title": "Atiku\u2019s Running Mate: Wike, Ekweremadu, Bruce Join Race as Stakeholders Consider Okowa, Okonjo-Iweala, Udom, Anyim",
          "text": "New scenarios have emerged, as permutations to find a running mate for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, intensifies.\n\nWhile persons like the Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu and Senator Ben Bruce, have already joined the race, PDP stakeholders have started considering the Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa and the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, as possible options for running mate.\n\nAlso, on the cards for consideration for the number two slot, are the Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, and a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim.\n\nThis is as the the South-east has made a strong case for compensation with the vice president slot, saying PDP could not deny the zone tickets for both president and vice-president.\n\nNevertheless, the governor of Abia State, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu, on Thursday, met Atiku with a wish list of areas he should focus on if elected Nigeria\u2019s next president.\n\nWike, Wednesday, reciprocated the visit to his residence by Atiku, when the governor visited the PDP presidential candidate at his Abuja residence. The implication of the visit was not lost on observers.\n\nSources said Wike\u2019s visit was part of the process of building unity in the party following a raucous campaign that preceded the PDP convention last weekend.\n\nThe visit came in the wake of increasing speculations that Wike might join the race for consideration as running mate to Atiku.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that some people in the party considered it unfair for the PDP not to pick Wike as running mate, especially, in view of his financial contributions and contacts he was able to build within a period of 90 days that he joined the race for the PDP presidential ticket.\n\nMultiple sources told THISDAY that PDP was not oblivious of the fact that Wike could have defeated Atiku to become the presidential candidate, if not for the eleventh hour stand down by the governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal.\n\nThe quest for Wike to become the running mate to Atiku is being championed by the leadership of PDP in the South-south, headed by the National Vice Chairman, South-south, Dan Orbih.\n\nAn associate of Atiku, who was contacted on the development, refused to speak on the matter, but sources insisted that Wike\u2019s visit to Atiku was in return to Atiku\u2019s gesture on Monday.\n\nThe meeting with Wike was witnessed by Orbih and former Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Mohammed Adoke (SAN).\n\nAside Wike, Ekweremadu and Bruce, party sources claimed, were also being considered as likely options, from both the South-east and South-south to balance the Atiku ticket.\n\nHowever, before the new calculations crept in, Okowa was believed to be the main person being considered for the position of vice president, with Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State as a distant prospect.\n\nThe consideration of Okowa, according to sources, flowed from his cross appeal to the South-south and the South-east geopolitical zones. While Emmanuel and Wike mobilised their state delegates to vote for them in the presidential primary, Okowa was said to have firmly backed Atiku with Delta State delegates voting 100 per cent.\n\nThose making a case for Okonjo-Iweala, argued that there was need for a trusted economist in the team to champion the boost for the economy. They recalled the role she played in the international creditors write-off of Nigeria\u2019s debt during the President Olusegun Obasanjo era.\n\nOne of the sources said, \u201cWhy we are advocating for Okonjo Iweala is basically because of his international connections and being a renowned economist. The economy is certainly in a bad shape and needs the touch of experienced persons in the management of the economy.\u201d\n\nIn the race too are both Udom and Anyim, also from South-south and South-east, as people, who could help the PDP make strong showing in the general elections, if paired with Atiku.\n\nPDP sources hinted that the party was already confused with loads of the options before it and was yet determine, which of the many choices it would embrace as complementary to the ticket in nearly all considerations for electoral victory.\n\nIkpeazu Meets Atiku, Lists Priority Areas\n\nGovernor of Abia State, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu, on Thursday, met the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, with a list of priority areas Atiku should focus on if he emerges president. The meeting, which took place at the Abuja residence of Atiku, was said to be at the instance of the former vice president, in his bid to unite the main opposition party after the fractious presidential primary.\n\nChief press secretary to the Abia State governor, Onyebuchi Ememenka, in a press release after the meeting, said Ikpeazu assured Atiku of his personal commitment and those of the entire Abia PDP to work for the success of the party at the 2023 poll.\n\nHe counselled the PDP presidential candidate to prioritise the institutionalisation of inclusive governance, if he gets to Aso Rock, and specifically reminded Atiku that the people of the South-east currently \u201cfeel profoundly alienated from the scheme of things in the country, with no south easterner in the top echelons of the executive, legislative and judicial arms of the federal government.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThis unprecedented state of affairs also persists in the entire security architecture of the country, including the paramilitary agencies as none of them is being headed by a person from the east for the first time in the history of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Abia chief executive also raised issues around ease of doing business in the country, which, according to him, ranked behind security among the most important things the South-east needs.\n\n\u201cAs natural business people, entrepreneurs and small scale manufacturers, the people of the South-east are interested in policies that will allow them do and grow their businesses,\u201d Ikpeazu said.\n\n\u2018Atiku\u2019s Presidency An Idea Whose Time Has Come\u2019\n\nCoalition of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Persons With Disabilities Support Group said former Vice President Atiku Abubakar\u2019s presidential bid was happening at a most auspicious time. The group vowed to actualise Atiku\u2019s presidency come 2023, adding that his knowledge of the economy would lead Nigeria out of poverty.\n\nAddressing newsmen at the PDP national secretariat, National Coordinator of the group, Dr. Chidi Olujie, said, \u201cThe special delegate convention to elect our presidential flag-bearer has strengthened our party and demonstrated our leader\u2019s readiness to take over the affairs of this country come 2023.\n\n\u201cWhile I congratulate all party faithful on this predictable success, I equally charge all members, regardless of gender, disability, and age, to work harder to deliver all our candidates come 2023\n\n\u201cI want to formally, on behalf of the Coalition of PDP Persons with Disabilities Support Group, congratulate the 2023 PDP presidential flag bearer, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, GCON (Wazirin Adamawa) on his predictable victory at the just concluded special delegate convention. Your emergence didn\u2019t come to us as a surprise considering your political antecedent in reaching out to all and sundry.\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that Atiku\u2019s presidency is an idea whose time has come and is ready to be validated by the Nigerian masses, come 2023. Persons with disabilities believe in your capacity, reckon with your experience and trust your knowledge of the economy and security in leading Nigeria out of the poverty and insecurity situation we found ourselves\n\n\u201cThe coalition recognises the efforts of all contenders in the last special delegate convention and sincerely appreciates them for deepening democratic ethos and practices within the party by participating in the election.\n\n\u201cHowever, we want to extend our appreciation to the governor and aspirant at the just concluded convention, His Excellency, Right Honourable Aminu Tambuwal, the governor of Sokoto State, for his magnanimity and show of statesmanship for stepping down for Atiku Abubakar. This singular gesture will undoubtedly remain the cornerstone of our association as a party that is ready to take leadership.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to engaging, mobilising, and actualising the Atiku presidency come 2023. Within our available resources, we shall sensitise, reorient, and educate the public, in general, and persons with disabilities, in particular, on the necessity of PDP coming back.\u201d\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and Emmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo in Umuahia",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government on Thursday said despite significant progress made in the fight against tuberculosis (TB) epidemic in the country, there were still over 200,000 new tuberculosis infections occurring every year with the knowledge of health officials.\n\nThe revelation came just as government said there was a 15 per cent increase in tuberculosis notification from 120,266 cases in 2019, to 138,591 in 2020.\n\nSimilarly, stakeholders in the campaign against tuberculosis scourge in Nigeria have advocated for increased local funding for tuberculosis intervention programme.\n\nThe Minister of Health Dr. Osagie Ehanire who spoke at the launch of the compendium of best practices for tuberculosis control in Nigeria in Abuja, said though significant achievements had been recorded in the control of tuberculosis epidemic, there was need to step up commitment and to invest strategically across the nation, to scale up best practices.\n\n\u201cDespite significant progress in the past three years in our fight to end the tuberculosis epidemic, we know that there are still over 200,000 new TB infections occurring every year among us, yet to be detected and enrolled in treatment.\n\n\u201cThere are also significant numbers of TB deaths annually. We know that we must step up our commitment and invest strategically across the nation, to scale up best practices,\u201d he said.\n\nEhanire described the event as a remarkable one in the history of Tuberculosis control in Nigeria, adding that it afforded opportunity to showcase best practices that have enable the steady and marked increase in tuberculosis notification in Nigeria over the past few years.\n\nAccording to the minister, at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, there was an 18 per cent drop globally in the number of tuberculosis cases diagnosed and notified, from 7.1 million in 2019, to 5.8 million in 2020.\n\nIn the same period, Ehanire also said tuberculosis deaths increased significantly as a result of reduced attention to treatment of patients.\n\nHe said Nigeria, as with many others countries, suffered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with negative socio-economic trends and health service disruptions. Ehanire further said following the introduction of lockdown measures for pandemic control in the second quarter of 2020, tuberculosis testing reduced by about 30 per cent, resulting in 17 per cent reduction in tuberculosis case finding and notification.\n\nThe minister however said with the implementation of innovative strategic interventions put in place by the tuberculosis programme managers, including the integration of tuberculosis control into COVID-19 response measures, there was a 15 per cent increase in tuberculosis notification from 120,266 cases in 2019, to 138,591 in 2020.\n\nHe said Nigeria was one of the few countries in the world to record an increase in tuberculosis case notification during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cFurther to this, the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme (NTBLCP) again recorded a remarkable increase in 2021 annual T notification, when numbers increased by 50 per cent, from 138,591 in 2020 to 207,785 in 2021,\u201d he said.\n\nEhanire said tuberculosis was curable, adding that the treatment was available free of charge in each and every one of the 774 Local Government Areas of Nigeria.\n\nHe expressed hope that the compendium would be a useful tool for all stakeholders, in the efforts to scale up tuberculosis control activities and to further maximise the yield from all our investments in tuberculosis control.\n\nThe National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme, headed Dr. Anyaike Chukwuma said Nigeria has achieved a milestone, from a situation of not being able to identify her prevalence level of tuberculosis infection to now being able to account for 45 per cent of the tuberculosis scourge.\n\nHe used the occasion to pay tribute to those Nigerians who have contributed significantly to the efforts to eradicate tuberculosis in Nigeria, especially the deceased.\n\nStakeholders from the Global Fund, Institute of Human Virology Nigeria (HVN) and USAID all Canvassed for improved funding from preferably local sources to ensure that the fight against tuberculosis is sustained.\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday in Madrid, Spain, met with two Spanish companies doing business in Nigeria and assured them of a safe, secured and prosperous Nigeria for businesses to thrive.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting with chief executives of GB Foods, which grows tomatoes in Kebbi State and employs about 5,000 people, the president pledged that Nigeria would be secured, noting that it was one of the cardinal objectives of the administration.\n\nHe also assured of protection for local farmers against smuggling and dumping of foreign products, saying: \u201cDetractors are working very hard against our efforts. That was why we closed our borders for so long, and the result is evident. We want to grow what we eat, and eat what we grow. Thank you for your huge investment in our country, the jobs you create, and skills imparted to our people.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman of GB Foods, Artur Carulla, described the company as a family business now in its third generation in Africa, and which has invested over 250 billion dollars in countries like Nigeria, Algeria, Ghana and Senegal.\n\nPromising to \u201cdouble-down in Nigeria,\u201d Carulla added: \u201cFood is all we do. We have been in Africa since the 1970s. I\u2019m married to an African, and connected emotionally with the continent. We bet on local talents and ingredients.\n\n\u201cIt is good for us, and for Nigeria. We have built three factories in the last five years, and our products are 100 per cent locally manufactured.\u201d\n\nGB Foods pledged that in about two years, it would be en route to supplying 30 per cent of the nation\u2019s tomato needs, stressing; \u201cWe will replicate what has happened with rice. We knew what it was before you came.\u201d\n\nAt another meeting with Naturgy, a leading Spanish gas company, Buhari expressed pleasure that the company had established a steady partnership with Nigeria in the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe said: \u201cI had the opportunity to head the industry for over three years. And a feasibility study showed that we are more of a gas-producing country than oil. I\u2019m pleased that you have been our partners for so long, and we are doing our best to stabilize the security situation in the country.\u201d\n\nChief Executive Officer of Naturgy, Francisco Reynes, said the firm\u2019s first contact with Nigeria was in 1992, and since then, they have become one of the largest buyers of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG).\n\nAccording to him, Naturgy was interested in extending its relationship with Nigeria on gas, citing its 178 years experience in the business.\n\n\u201cCountries like Algeria, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, and the USA, are our suppliers. We want to invest more in Nigeria,\u201d Reynes said.\n\nAlso yesterday, President Buhari met with Nigerians living in Spain on the sidelines of his official visit, pledging that Nigeria would continue to defend the interests of its nationals living abroad.\n\nThe Diaspora team, which met with the President included President of the association, John Bosco; his deputy, Richard Omoregbe; Super Eagles player who plies his trade with Leganes FC, Madrid, Kenneth Omeruo; Obinna Okafor, a football agent; Mohammed Bashir, a student of Aviation; Segun Adedoyin, studying Global Affairs, and Bright Omorodion, a businessman.\n\nThe Nigerian leader said: \u201cOn the part of the federal government, Nigeria will continue to aggressively protect and defend the interests of all Nigerians abroad, especially the law-abiding compatriots.\u201d\n\nBuhari told the Nigerians he described as ambassadors of the country in Spain: \u201cMany of you are here for different reasons, some for a fulfilling career in sports, especially in football from where you earn respectable incomes to sustain yourselves as well as maintain your extended families in Nigeria including investments back home.\n\n\u201cSome of you are engaged in other businesses that have enhanced your socio-economic status, both here and at home. More importantly, through your commitment to your various callings, you have enhanced the name and image of our country, thereby, earning Nigeria respect in Spain.\n\n\u201cI have also been informed of how law-abiding you are here in Spain. I wish to encourage you to continue to be role models for our youth back home as well as sustain the image of being excellent Ambassadors of Nigeria in Spain and live peacefully in the various communities in which you reside here.\u201d\n\nBuhari, who the Chairman of Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM), Abike Dabiri-Erewa, described as, \u201cthe most Diaspora-loving President\u201d then explained why he established the Commission: \u201cAs I have always done whenever I am abroad, I wish to reassure all of you in Spain, of the determination of the federal government of Nigeria, to continue to remain engaged with our compatriots in the diaspora, for more purposeful partnerships that impact our country and people, it is in the quest for actualising this objective that I established the Diaspora Commission to give focus to the management of this partnership that leads to a win-win situation for Nigeria, at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cI believe that you are aware of how important your character, conduct and comportment in your daily activities define your roles as Ambassadors and image promoters of Nigeria abroad. As you perform this responsibility, I encourage you to embrace purposeful investments back home. Such investments can be financial or through your talents and skills which can help mould and develop our youths.\u201d\n\nThe president touched on the many challenges facing the country, assuring that the government would not rest on its oars in surmounting them.\n\n\u201cDespite our numerous challenges at home, such as the containment of terrorist activities and other forms of threats to our national security as well as the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our government continues to work assiduously to tackle challenges of infrastructural development, power, water, transportation, housing, etc with a view to creating the enabling environment for our collective prosperity.\n\n\u201cOur unity in diversity has always been our strength. I therefore call on all Nigerians, including those of you in the Diaspora, to join hands with us in building the Nigeria we desperately want.\u201d\n\nTalking politics, Buhari said the country has started the process leading to national elections in 2023, noting that government is working tirelessly to ensure that the Independent National Electoral Commission delivers credible, free and fair elections and a smooth transition to the next democratic government.\n\n\u201cThis is with a view to concretising our democracy and being an example to other African countries,\u201d he stated.\n\nMeanwhile, Buhari has called on investors to look beyond the challenges currently facing the world and focus on opportunities they present.\n\nThe president gave the advice when he addressed the Spain-Nigeria Business Meeting organised by the Spanish Chamber of Commerce and the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment.\n\nThe president told the gathering of Spanish and Nigerian corporations and investors to look towards Africa for the opportunities therein.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cIt is currently a challenging time for the global economy. But I have always held the strong conviction that there is no crisis without an accompanying opportunity and solution. Increased collaboration with African nations could well be what Europe needs to mitigate against both current and potential future supply-chain challenges and improve both our economic opportunities.\u201d\n\nHe added that the business meeting provided a good opportunity to advance trade relations between the two nations which are today principally dominated by the oil and gas sector.\n\nHis words: \u201cI believe this forum is an excellent platform to establish and strengthen business relationships, share valuable experience, and collaborate for the mutual benefit of our countries.\n\n\u201cFor quite a number of decades, Spain has been one of Nigeria\u2019s most important trading partners. It is, for example, a major importer of Nigerian crude oil. Nigeria\u2019s exports to Spain stood at $4.8 billion in 2020 whilst Spain\u2019s exports to Nigeria increased from $97.2 million in 1995 to $517million in 2020.\n\n\u201cA lot more can be done to increase the volume of trade and today presents a good opportunity to explore how this can be achieved.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian leader reiterated that the current administration has put in place mechanisms to shift the age-long dependence on oil for the sustenance of the country, adding that the focus now is into value chain and exploitation of available abundant solid minerals.\n\nHe said: \u201cSince the inception of our administration in 2015, we have concentrated on moving beyond the historical dependence on crude oil for government revenue and foreign exchange inflows.\n\n\u201cWe have successfully driven its diversification and put the economy on the path of sustainable and inclusive growth through an open, rules based and market-oriented way of doing business.\n\n\u201cHistorically, the focus has been on Nigeria\u2019s oil sector but Nigeria is home to a wide range of other sectors that hold very great potentials. We are the largest economy in Africa and our well over 200 million-strong consumer market is home to a range of attractive opportunities in sectors such as agriculture, healthcare, light manufacturing, infrastructure development and technology.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a number of other notable mineral resources including coal, gold, bitumen, iron ore and uranium. However, our current focus is on adding value to our natural resources prior to exportation\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, called on investors at the meeting to take advantage of the opportunities that the Nigerian market offers\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWe are open to widening collaboration with Spain and in order to encourage private capital inflow, we have put together fiscal investment incentives which include the following: three to five years tax holidays for enterprises in what we deem to be pioneer industries; tax-free operations and no restrictions on expatriate quotas in our Free Trade Zones; capital allowances for agriculture, manufacturing and engineering amongst others.\n\n\u201cGoing into partnerships with trusted local and foreign partners who have well-established networks and understand the dynamics of the economy and country is one of the identified keys to success in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cToday provides a platform for Spanish businesses to connect with credible Nigerian partners. I trust that all here present will build relationships that will translate into increased trade and investment flows between Nigeria and Spain.\u201d\n\nBuhari also used the forum to thank the Spanish government for donating 4.4 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking earlier, Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Mr. Niyi Adebayo, said Nigeria and Spain have enjoyed a very cordial relationship since the 1960s.\n\nHe added that Nigeria was committed to increasing its volume of trade with Spain, even as Spain is currently one Nigeria\u2019s strongest EU trading partners.\n\n\u201cSince signing the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) Nigeria is also a gateway to the wider African market. Nigeria is a central point for companies wishing to do business in other parts of Africa. We are attracting and retaining sustainable investments by creating an enabling environment for businesses to thrive. \u201cThe federal government is addressing critical concerns around infrastructure and security; and creating employment for its youthful population,\u201d the minister further said.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "text": "For the first time since April 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the global oil industry, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Thursday increased Nigeria\u2019s production quota to about 1.8 million (1.799) barrels per day.\n\nThe new oil drilling limit increased Nigeria\u2019s production deficit by an estimated 400, 000 barrels per day, since the country has only been able to produce about 1.4 million barrels daily of the 1.8 bpd ration.\n\nThe cartel and its allies, OPEC+ would increase oil production by 648,000 barrels per day in July, as opposed to the 400,000 bpd initially approved and the subsequent increase to 432,000bpd.\n\nThis was just as the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mallam Mele Kyari , has said that with about 26 per cent of all Nigeria\u2019s gas exported to Spain, the country remains a major market for Nigeria.\n\nAlso, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) said on Thursday that troops of the Nigeria Navy under Operation Octopus Grip and Operation Delta Safe discovered and destroyed 40 illegal refineries in the Niger Delta region in the last two weeks.\n\nNigeria has blamed massive oil theft, years of declining upstream investment, inability to restart oil wells shut in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as outright sabotage by oil-producing communities for its lack of capacity to raise production.\n\nFrom the approved schedule, Saudi Arabia would drill 10.833 million barrels per day in July, same for Russia, while the UAE would produce 3.127 million barrels per day.\n\nIn the same vein, Angola would produce 1.502 barrels per day, Iraq would be 4.58 million bpd while Algeria was given a limit of 1.039 million bpd.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the increase by over 200,000 bpd was possibly to partly compensate for a small portion of Russian oil, which has been shut-in due to sanctions spurred by its war with Ukraine.\n\nA communiqu\u00e9 released by the organisation after the 29th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting held via videoconference, also acknowledged the most recent reopening from lockdowns in major global economic centres.\n\nIt further noted that global refinery intake was expected to increase after seasonal maintenance and highlighted the importance of stable and balanced markets for both crude oil and refined products.\n\n\u201cThe meeting therefore resolved to: Reaffirm the decision of the 10th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial meeting on 12 April 2020 and further endorsed in subsequent meetings, including the 19th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on the 18 July 2021.\n\n\u201cReconfirm the production adjustment plan and the monthly production adjustment mechanism approved at the 19th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting and the decision to adjust upward the monthly overall production by 0.432 mb/d for the month of July 2022.\n\n\u201cAdvance the planned overall production adjustment for the month of September and redistribute equally the 0.432 mb/d production increase over the months of July and August 2022. Therefore, July production will be adjusted upward by 0.648 mb/d,\u201d it stated.\n\nIt also resolved to extend the compensation period until the end of December 2022 as requested by some underperforming countries and called on underperforming countries to submit their plans by June 17, 2022.\n\nWhile reiterating the critical importance of adhering to full conformity and to the compensation mechanism, OPEC noted that its next meeting will hold on June 30, 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, speaking on Thursday at the Nigeria-Africa Natural Resource and Energy Summit in Abuja, said while it was imperative to have a green initiative to fight carbon emission, it should reflect current realities and conditions.\n\nAs at today, Sylva argued that energy poverty was still much prevalent in the world, especially in Africa where millions of people still do not have access to electricity or clean cooking fuels.\n\n\u201cBased on the UN data, about 760 million people lack access to electricity worldwide, with three out of four of them living in sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, one-third of the world\u2019s population \u2013 about 2.6 billion people \u2013 have no access to clean cooking fuels, with over 900 million of these in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cOn the average, only 48 per cent of sub-Saharan Africa population has access to electricity, while only 18 per cent has access to clean cooking fuels, compared with a global average of 90 per cent and 70 per cent respectively.\n\n\u201cIn relation to CO2 emission, World Bank statistics shows that the world average of CO2 emissions was 4.48 metric tons per capita in 2018, with some regions and individual countries recording five to seven times this value. Emission by sub-Saharan Africa in total was only 0.76 metric tons per capita,\u201d he argued.\n\nThe implication of this, he said, was that the issues surrounding energy poverty, climate and sustainable development are not mutually exclusive.\n\nConsequently, he noted that the approaches to attending to these issues should not be disconnected, but stressed that climate change remains of serious concern to Africa.\n\n\u201cBut of equal concern is the alarming level of energy poverty. Both must be addressed in a sustainable manner. It must be a win-win situation,\u201d he maintained.\n\nAccording to him, energy transition is about providing clean energy, and not about discriminating between energy sources.\n\nWith 26% Share of Nigeria\u2019s Gas Export, Kyari Says Spain Remains Major Market\n\nMeanwhile Kyari on Thursday said that with about 26 per cent of all Nigeria\u2019s gas exported to Spain, it remains a major market for the country. He, therefore, reiterated his commitment to sustaining what he described as the strategic energy partnership between both countries.\n\nKyari spoke while addressing Nigerian and Spanish business leaders on investment opportunities in the Nigerian oil and gas industry in Madrid, Spain, on the sidelines of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s state visit to the country.\n\nA statement by the Group General Manager, Public Affairs of the NNPC, Garba Muhammad, stated that Buhari had earlier met with the Spanish President, Pedro Sanchez, King of Spain, His Majesty, King Filipe VI, and had given a speech at the headquarters of the World Tourism Organization (WTO) in Madrid.\n\nDuring the visit, the NNPC statement quoted Buhari as saying that Nigeria looked forward to increasing bilateral relations with Spain.\n\nDescribing the partnership between Nigeria and Spain as an important one for the NNPC GMD said: \u201c26 per cent of all LNG produced in Nigeria ends up in Spain and 14 per cent of all crude oil produced in Nigeria ends up in this country. Clearly for us as a business, it is an important market for my company.\u201d\n\nKyari explained that the world would need energy for today and for the future in industries such as power, Information Technology, automobile, among others.\n\n\u201cWe know that energy transition is real. We know that net-zero by 2050-2060 is real. But it doesn\u2019t mean zero hydrocarbons in 2050-2060. It means that you are going to have a cleaner use of hydrocarbons,\u201d Kyari added.\n\nHe said that investors must get returns when they invest, with a high chance that they are able to recover their costs and make some margin from it.\n\nAccording to him, in line with global acceptance of gas as a transition fuel, Nigeria has since declared 2021-2030 as the decade of gas.\n\n\u201cIn our country today, we have a legislation that has clearly created a commercial National Oil Company (NOC) which will be unveiled by our president in the coming days.\n\n\u201cTogether with the Spanish business community, I am confident we can build this industry,\u201d Kyari explained\n\nDHQ: Troops Destroyed 40 Illegal Refineries in Niger Delta\n\nHowever, speaking at a media briefing in Abuja, yesterday, the Director, Directorate of Defence Media Operations (DDMO), Maj.Gen. Bernard Onyeuko, said the military recently launched an operation in the Niger Delta to curb the growing oil theft, illegal refining, vandalism in the country and sustained pressure on economic saboteurs and other criminal elements which had significantly reduced the oil thieves\u2019 freedom of action. He said military operations were conducted in different theatres between May 19 and June 2.\n\nOnyeuko said within the period under review, troops discovered and destroyed 40 illegal refineries, 165 metal storage tanks, 72 ovens, 23 dug out pits and five wooden boats.\n\nIn addition, he revealed that troops also recovered 1,107,400 litres of crude 456,450 litres of Automotive Gas Oil (AGO), 6,250 litres of PMS, six trucks, three outbound engines and one AK 47 rifle.\n\nTroops also apprehended 21 criminal elements.\n\n\u201cTroops have sustained pressure on economic saboteurs and other criminal elements, and this has significantly reduced oil theft.\n\n\u201cOperations were conducted in creeks, towns and communities at Mosogar, Jesse and Warri Road in Ethiope West Local Government Area, and at Banga and Modangho Creek in Warri South West Local Government Area of Delta,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOther locations are Okubotowa Creek in Akassa Brass Local Government Area, as well as Ikebiri in Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of Bayelsa.\n\n\u201cOperations were also carried out at the Gawthrone Channel in Bonny Local Government Area of Rivers, Akpabiyo Local Government Area in Cross River and Effiat Waterways, Ibaka, in Akwa Ibom,\u2019\u2019 Onyeuko said\n\nHe said all recovered items and apprehended criminals were handed over to the appropriate authorities for further action.\n\nTHISDAY",
