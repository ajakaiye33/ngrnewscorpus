          "title": "Self-defence: Ban on firearms still in force, CP warns Matawalle",
          "text": "The Zamfara State Commissioner of Police, Ayuba Elkana, has said the embargo on firearms licence is still in force, noting that the police have stopped issuing licence to citizens who wished to own guns.\n\nThe police boss stated this, on Sunday, in response to inquiries from The PUNCH about the directive by the state government that the police command should issue gun licence to those eligible to bear arms.\n\nThe Zamfara State Commissioner for Information, Ibrahim Dosara, had in a statement on Sunday, disclosed that the government had directed residents of the state to prepare and obtain guns to defend themselves against bandits who have been terrorising the state.\n\nThe government, therefore, directed the state Commissioner of Police to issue licence to all those who qualify and are willing to obtain guns to defend themselves.\n\nDosara had said, \u201cGovernment has, henceforth, directed individuals to prepare and obtain guns to defend themselves against the bandits, as the government has directed the state commissioner of police to issue a license to all those who qualify and are wishing to obtain such guns to defend themselves.\n\n\u201cGovernment is ready to facilitate people, especially our farmers, to secure basic weapons for defending themselves. The government has already concluded an arrangement to distribute 500 forms to each of the 19 emirates in the state for those willing to obtain guns to defend themselves.\n\n\u201cPeople must apply to the Commissioner of Police to own guns and such other basic weapons to be used in defending themselves. A secretariat or centre will be established for the collection of intelligence on the activities of informants.\u201d\n\nBut reacting to the directive, the state commissioner of police said he has yet to receive any directive to issue gun licences to the people.\n\nElkana, in a telephone interview with The PUNCH said, \u201cI have not received any directives and also, there is a ban on firearms licence and we don\u2019t give licence.\n\n\u201cI am yet to receive any directive. Let me see the directive first before I can comment. I have not seen the directive, so I cannot comment on compliance.\u201d\n\nAsked if the government\u2019s decision was a vote of no confidence on the police, the CP replied, \u201cThere is nothing like vote of no confidence, please. This is farming season and you cannot get police or any security to be following everybody to the farm. They are attacking people on the farm; that is the problem. It is not as if we are not doing our best; we are doing our best. Of recent, we rescued many people (from bandits).\u201d\n\nThe Force Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, declined comment on the matter when contacted.\n\nOgun State differs\n\nThe Ogun State Government also says it is not planning to allow residents of the state to carry arms and defend themselves in the face of insecurity in the state.\n\nSpecial Adviser to the Governor on Security, Olusola Subar, said this while speaking with one of our correspondents in Abeokuta on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThere is no plan in Ogun State here that I know of to direct the police or citizens to be giving licence to bear arms,\u201d he said.\n\nEkiti State\n\nThe Special Adviser to Ekiti State Governor on Security, Brig. Gen. Ebenezar Ogundana (retd.), has said the situation of the state could not get to the extent of where everybody would be required to bear arms.\n\nOgundana, in an interview with The PUNCH, said, \u201cWe cannot get to that level, because when you say everybody should go and get arms to defend themselves, you are creating panic that the government is not in control and you are creating panic that the environment is not safe.\u201d\n\nAbia State\n\nAnswering questions from The PUNCH in Umuahia on if the state will follow Zamfara State\u2019s plans to liberalise gun purchase, the Abia State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Eze Chikamnayo said, \u201cWhat successfully applies in one location may not necessarily be the solution in another location, but what is paramount in our mind as a government, is to ensure the security and welfare of our citizens.\u201d\n\nExperts foresee anarchy\n\nSecurity experts have, however, warned against the implementation of the directive, describing it as an invitation to anarchy.\n\nOne of them, Timothy Avele, said the Zamfara state government should anticipate a high number of extrajudicial killings as a result of the directive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a direct call for anarchy at the highest level. You can\u2019t imagine the kind of extrajudicial killings that would result from this current governor\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cIt simply shows the Federal Government, state governments, security agencies and the military have failed woefully,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother security expert, Jackson Ojo, said the Zamfara State government directive was against the law of the land.\n\n\u201cWhat the Zamfara State Governor has just declared is like a mutiny. Under which law does the government of Zamfara State permit its indigenes to bear arms?\u201d Ojo wondered.",

By virtue of his said position, the Deji was the paramount ruler over the entire Akure land as well as being the consenting authority over all minor chiefs, Olus and Baales under him.\n\n\u201cThat prior to the bifurcation of Akure Local Government, the Deji of Akure by virtue of his position is the prescribed authority, was empowered traditionally and in law to appoint and consent the appointment of minor chiefs within the land not minding the bifurcation of the old Local Government into Akure North and South\u201d.\n\nThe monarch said the consenting authority of the Deji was backed by a circular from the Ondo state government dated January 16 2007 recognizing the monarch as the prescribed authority.\n\nHe therefore dismissed claim of chairman, Akure north local government, Hon. Ogbesetore on removal of Olu of Ilado as unnecessary describing the outburst as a deliberate attempt to twist facts.\n\n\u201cIt is a known fact that the Local Government does not appoint and cannot appoint Minor Chiefs as such action remains the prerogative of the Deji as the recognized Prescribed Authority for such purpose\u201d, he said.\n\nHowever, the chairman insisted that the monarch has no constitutional power to appoint or install any chief in Akure North local government since the division of Akure into the councils.\n\nOgbesetore said management of the local government does not recognize the installation of one Mr. Ifedayo Afelumo as Olu of Ilado-lgbatoro Community performed by the Deji of Akure adding that the installation of the said Olu is null and void and unconstitutional.\n\nHe insisted that Akure North local government does not fall under the purview of Akure South Local Government.\n\nt\u201cI am using this medium to advice the said Olu to stop parading himself as Olu of Ilado-lgbatoro community henceforth as the Deji of Akure does not have any constitutional right to install any Chief in Akure North Local Government as earlier said\u201d.\n\nRecall that the removed community Head had earlier petitioned the state government raising the alarm of a looming crisis over the installation of parallel community heads in some communities by the Deji of Akureland",

You can never imagine what you did. How you rescued us. How you brought peace. How you brought succor. How you came and salvaged us from the 20 years old running battle.\n\n\u201cIt can only be God. There is nothing we will do here that is comparable to what you have done for our community. We gathered as a people to say thank you very much sir\u201d.\n\nAppreciating Gov.

Is it that he was not aware that his military invaded Mazi Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s Afaraukwu country home on September 14, 2017 or that he deliberately decided to be mischievous?\n\n\u201cIt is on record that Nnamdi Kanu did not jump bail but only ran for his dear life. The video evidence of the military invasion of his house which claimed no fewer than 30 lives, only confirmed that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu did what was needful for the moment.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that world leaders enjoy making Buhari to advertise his ignorance of obvious realities and current issues.The global community after watching the military invasion of the home of the Biafran leader, where armoured vehicles and helicopter gunships were used against an unarmed leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra clearly understand that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu did not jump bail, instead he escaped for his life.\n\n\u201cThe indisputable truth is that if he did not run, by now he would have been a dead man.\n\n\u201cThe world is watching and looking for what is still keeping Nnamdi Kanu in DSS custody, but Buhari and his security agencies won\u2019t admit the truth. We are aware that he has been under intense pressure to explain the role of his Government over the illegal abduction and extraordinary rendition from Kenya to Nigeria of a British citizen.\n\n\u201cThe Commonwealth meeting in Rwanda exposed Buhari and his Fulani-controlled Federal Government of Nigeria but because he is looking for opportunity to lie against Kanu that is why he chose to lie to the international community and Commonwealth heads of government in Kigali Rwanda.\n\n\u201cThe world should hold Buhari accountable for the torture he is being put through and whatever that may happen to our Leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\u201d",

Why would one leave a party he had laboured to build? It is not good to labour in vain.\n\n\u201cHowever, they are not contesting elections. The election in Anambra is between APGA and other political parties.\n\n\u201cAPGA remains the third in Nigeria as the country inches closer to the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cElections are not done on WhatsApp or the internet.

APGA is on the ground here and everywhere.\n\n\u201cHow can a party that does not have a councillor want to compete with us?\n\n\u201cWe are strong and we are growing stronger and stand a real chance in Abia. We will compete in all places vigorously.\n\n\u201cWe shall campaign when it starts, and by the time we enter January, we will know those that are still contesting.\n\n\u201cOur victory will be resounding this time but we will not take anything for granted. Anambra people will see,\u201d he said.\n\nSoludo said APGA would contest strongly for all positions it has candidates in.\n\nHe said in Anambra, the target is to win 30 seats in the House of Assembly, 11 in the House of Representatives and three in the Senate.\n\nHe said the APGA government was determined to deliver value-based governance amid dwindling revenue.\n\nSoludo said about 220 kilometres of roads had been designed for construction and that all the 21 Local Government Areas in the state would witness massive road activities after the rains.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to cut the cost to the bones. We have renegotiated some contracts and saved money with which we are fixing some roads.\n\n\u201cWe have used N20 million saved from there to fix the Chisco Park area of the Bridge Head \u2013 Upper Iweka expressway in Onitsha.\n\n\u201cThe approval that was presented to me by FERMA for that same job is about N200 million. By this week it will be done,\u201d he said.\n\nSoludo said the tasks demanded belt-tightening by the government and people and thanked all for their understanding.",

Sixty-one others were injured.\n\nIn Oyo State, Governor Seyi Makinde ordered the recruitment of another 500 operatives to strengthen Amotekun.\n\nImo State Governor Hope Uzodimma issued a 10-day ultimatum to bandits to embrace amnesty or face bombardment.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Akeredolu, while speaking on the security situation in the country had alerted that governors cannot fold their arms or rely exclusively on the distant federal police to adequately protect the lives and property of residents.\n\nHe also said the Federal Government should brace up for a situation whereby citizens will take their destiny into their hands and carry guns to defend themselves against terror.\n\nZamfara State Information Commissioner Ibrahim Dosara, who spoke on the state\u2019s new security measures, said: \u201cThe government has henceforth directed individuals to prepare and obtain guns to defend themselves against the bandits.\n\n\u201cGovernment has directed the state commissioner of police to issue a licence to all those who qualify and are wishing to obtain such guns to defend themselves.\n\n\u201cGovernment is ready to facilitate for people, especially our farmers, to secure basic weapons for defending themselves.\n\n\u201cGovernment has already concluded arrangements to distribute 500 forms to each of the 19 emirates in the state for those willing to obtain guns to defend themselves.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner said the government had resolved to deal with the recent escalating attacks, kidnapping and violence unleashed on communities by bandits.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis act of terrorism has been a source of worry and concern to the people and government of the state.\n\n\u201cTherefore, to deal decisively with the situation, the government has no option but to take these measures.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner, however, cautioned that residents must obtain from the Commissioner of Police a licence to own guns and other basic weapons to be used in defending themselves.\n\nDosara said: \u201cA secretariat or centre will be established for the collection of intelligence on the activities of informants.\n\n\u201cResidents are strictly warned and advised to make sure that any information or intelligence about an informant must be true and nothing but the truth.\n\n\u201cAll information on such informants must carry correct data on the suspects, including their pictures, correct names, address, occupation and witness to testify on the facts of the information given.\n\n\u201cThe government will take punitive measures against anyone found as an informant. Any person who gives wrong information against anybody will be served the same punishment as an informant and will be treated as such.\u201d\n\nHe said the government had requested the State House of Assembly to pass, as matter of urgency, the Informants Bill before it to enable the government to take the drastic measures on informants as contained in the bill.\n\nHe said the government had ordered the recruitment of 200 additional Community Protection Guards (CPGs) in each of the 19 emirates, bringing it to 500 per emirate.\n\nThe state government had also constituted an 11-man special committee to receive intelligence on the activities of informants, with Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Bello Bakyasuwa Soja, as chairman.\n\nHe also announced an additional para-military unit to support control and command, to properly and effectively reinforce the operations of the CPGs.\n\nThe new unit has eight members with retired Commissioner of Police Mamman Anka as Commandant\u2013General.\n\nDosara said the state government had reconstituted an 11-member committee on the prosecution of banditry-related offences with Dr. Sani Abdullahi Wanban Shinkafi as Chairman.\n\nAlso yesterday, Governor Bello Matawalle ordered the immediate closure of all markets, including livestock markets in Mada, Wonaka, and Ruwan Bore Districts of Gusau Local Government Area and Yandoto Emirate in Tsafe Local Government Area.\n\n\u201cThe governor has equally banned riding of motorbikes and selling of petroleum products in Mada, Wonaka and Ruwan Bore districts, as well as Yandoto emirate.\n\n\u201cHenceforth, all filling stations in the affected areas are hereby closed with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cAnyone found riding a motorbike within the areas is considered a bandit and security agencies are thereby directed to shoot such persons at sight.\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies are by this announcement directed to ensure strict compliance.\n\n\u201cAnyone found violating this order should be dealt with according to the rule of law. The government would not condone any act where innocent people are being killed.\n\n\u201cThe government hereby directs the Military, the Nigeria Police, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), and other security agencies to mobilise their operatives and take the fight to the enclaves of the criminals with immediate effect.\u201d\n\n10-day ultimatum to bandits in Imo\n\nUzodimma issued a 10-day ultimatum to bandits to surrender themselves and their arms to their traditional rulers for unconditional pardon or face bombardment.\n\nThe governor, who spoke at the Government House Chapel, Owerri, after Sunday Service, said the government has decided to rid the forests in Imo of bandits and procured the necessary equipment for the purpose.\n\nUzodimma urged the bandits to take the advantage of the amnesty and be reintegrated into the society.\n\nThe governor also said Imo State will be hosting the annual Army Day Celebration from June 30 to July 6, 2022.\n\nUzodimma said from June 27, \u201cImo State will take delivery of military equipment that will be used to clear the remnants of bandits hiding in various bushes in the state.\u201d\n\nHe, however, gave 10 days to bandits in the forests to come out of their caves, \u201cwhere necessary, report themselves to their traditional rulers or their council chairmen so that government will grant them amnesty\u201d.\n\nHe said the period of grace will not be extended, warning that those who fail to take advantage of it will have themselves to blame.\n\n500 recruits for Oyo Amotekun\n\nMakinde spoke on the recruitment of additional 500 men for the Oyo State Western Nigeria Security Network (WNSN) at a security meeting with local government chairmen, vice chairmen, heads of security agencies and traditional rulers among other stakeholders at the House of Chiefs, Secretariat, in Ibadan.\n\nHe described security as a collective responsibility requiring the participation of all stakeholders.\n\nHe said: \u201cSecurity is everyone\u2019s business and if we all play our parts well, we will have a safer and more secured environment.\n\n\u201cAs far as the operation of the Amotekun corps is concerned, we have perfected the process of employing 500 more hands to enhance their performance and further deepen the security architecture of our state.\u201d\n\nOndo Assembly to review Amotekun law\n\nThe Ondo State House of Assembly said it has commenced the review of the law establishing Amotekun to tackle the rising insecurity in the state.\n\nAssembly\u2019s spokesperson, Gbenga Omole, said this on the sidelines of the Oka Security Summit organised by Oka community in Akoko Southwest Local Government Area at the weekend.\n\nOmole, who is a member of the House Committee on Security, said the reviewed law, would give the Amotekun corps power to have access to improved technology and more sophisticated weapons to tackle security challenges.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari will soon take a decision on the controversial University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) and the condition of service for varsity teachers, Labour and Employment Minister Chris Ngige hinted yesterday.\n\nTo guide the President in taking a decision, the inter-ministerial departments and agencies committees of the Federal Government will turn in their reports on Wednesday.\n\nThe reports of the committees could bring an end to the four-month old strike embarked on by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).\n\nDr. Ngige dropped the hint in a statement yesterday by his ministry\u2019s spokesman Olajide Oshundun.\n\nThe striking lectures are at war over which payment platform to be adopted in public varsities between the government-approved Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS) and ASUU-preferred UTAS.\n\nYesterday, Ngige said last Thursday\u2019s meeting was with the government side and not with ASUU members as assumed by their leadership.\n\nThe minister noted that the meeting was with the representatives of the Federal Ministry of Education, Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Budget Office of the Federation, National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC), the Federal Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy and National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA).\n\nHe explained that the meeting was geared towards accelerating the resolution of the multiple strike actions o ASUU, Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU), Non-Academic Staff Union of Universities (NASU) and National Association of Academic Technologists (NAAT).\n\nThe leadership of ASUU began a one-month strike in February which was extended at the expiration by two-month. The union further extended the strike by another three months to give the government ample time to meet its demands.\n\nThey were soon joined by other varsity-based unions to demand for improved condition of service, deployment of a new payment platform among others.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cThe meeting was meant for the inter-ministerial departments and agencies committees of the Federal Government, including the Federal Ministry of Education, Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Budget Office of the Federation, National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC), the Federal Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy and National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA). The committees are reporting to the office of the Chief of Staff to the President and the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment.\n\n\u201cThe meeting in question was called to assess the progress made so far on addressing the few outstanding demands of the striking university workers, such as the contentious payment platform and the renegotiation of their conditions of service. These two committees were empaneled by the Honourable Minister and the Chief of Staff to the President at the last tripartite plus meetings of the unions and the government side.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, none of the unions was invited to last Thursday\u2019s meeting and the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Dr. Chris Ngige, while briefing State House correspondents after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting last Wednesday, June 22, 2022, clarified that the meeting would hold the next day (Thursday, June 23, 2022), for the government side alone.\n\n\u201cAs expected, the meeting was held and all the stakeholders reported on the various assignments given to them and accordingly, received further briefing and directives from the President in order to accelerate discussions with ASUU.\n\n\u201cIt is hoped that before Wednesday this week, all the various sub-committees will turn in their reports, to enable Mr. President to be briefed fully and for decisions to be taken on the contentious payment platform and the renegotiation of the conditions of service, especially the issue of wage increase.\n\n\u201cIt is after receiving briefings from the government side that the Ministry of Labour will bring all the stakeholders, including the unions, to a conference table to look at the agreement before signing or endorsement.\n\n\u201cConsequently, all insinuations that the Ministry of Labour does not sympathise with the students, unions and parents, of which the Minister is one, should be disabused. The Minister had on several occasions received commendation from the ASUU leadership for his role in the resolution of the impasse in the education sector.\n\n\u201cActing with the Chief of Staff to the President, he empaneled the two committees to work assiduously and according to the law, towards the resolution of the teething issues of payment platform and renegotiation of the conditions of service. The claims made here are verifiable, being out there in the public domain.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, the ministry will not allow itself to be bullied by any union into forcing any payment platform on the government, which took a decision to adopt the IPPIS a long time ago in 2017.\n\n\u201cASUU should know that we are arbitrators and conciliators. We cannot manufacture agreements. Regardless, we are not constrained from listening to the government and pushing them to do their own bit as quickly as possible.\n\n\u201cThese clarifications are necessary so that the public will understand our role in the Ministry of Labour as conciliators and arbitrators in a Labour dispute.\u201d",

          "title": "Northern govs stall selection of Tinubu\u2019s running mate",
          "text": "From Fred Itua, Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja, Desmond Mgboh, Kano and Gyang Bere, Jos\n\nWeeks after Bola Ahmed Tinubu, former Lagos State governor emerged as presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), intrigues and infightings within the party has stalled efforts to select his substantive running mate.\n\nTinubu had chosen a placeholder, Kabiru Masari, in order to beat the deadline set by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). However, the choice of a substantive running mate has proved Herculean given mounting pressure by northern governors under the party platform to have him cede the position to one of them.\n\nDaily Sun learnt that though President Muhammadu Buhari had instructed the leadership of the party, led by its national chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, to steer clear and allow Tinubu the free hand to select his running mate, the governors are unwilling to concede that right to the presidential flag bearer.\n\nIt was also learnt that Tinubu\u2019s headache is further compounded by the growing opposition to his planned Muslim-Muslim ticket by Northern Christians and the leaderships of various churches in Nigeria. The APC presidential flag bearer, it was learnt, has however narrowed his option to the North East and North West.\n\nMultiple sources familiar with the development, however, said Tinubu in recent weeks has been having a running battle with northern governors, believed to have worked for him during the presidential primary, who are insisting he must honour the gentleman agreement to pick one of them as running mate.\n\nA source said Tinubu was in a dilemma that the governors may work against him if he failed to honour the agreement reached with them ahead of the primary to pick one of them as his substantive running mate.\n\nOne of the sources who hails from the North East and who doesn\u2019t want to be named because he\u2019s not authorised to speak, said there is also the dilemma of choosing between the North West and North East which also explains why the party candidate is yet to name his vice.\n\nHe said beside the governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, the other two APC governors from the North East, are unwilling to risk their second term tickets for the position.\n\n\u201cTinubu has been given the free hands to pick a running mate. From what we\u2019ve seen, he will possibly settle for a Muslim-Muslim ticket. Many party leaders are against this option, including President Buhari. But since Buhari has also instructed that Tinubu should be allowed to pick his running mate, he has no choice, but to respect his choice. But governors from the North who are APC members, are not willing to give up that position. They\u2019re insisting that a running mate should be produced by them.\n\n\u201cIf Tinubu must win in the North, he needs these governors. If he ignores them and picks someone outside their circle, there will be trouble. But the issues are beyond that. North West has six APC governors and the highest in the party. The geopolitical zone also has the highest number of registered voters. That gives them the bargaining power.\n\n\u201cSo, they\u2019re dictating and pushing that a governor from the geopolitical zone be picked. But North Central is equally important. But it appears that Tinubu isn\u2019t unwilling to gamble with votes from the North West and that\u2019s part of the reasons why the party has no substantive running mate right now,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother source lamented that the leadership of APC that should have handled this critical assignment had been completely sidelined.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t recommend or decide; it has become a toothless bulldog. I\u2019m aware that Tinubu has given a deadline within which governors and other leaders from the North will recommend at least three names to him. Tinubu is then expected to pick from these names. Whether or not the governors will shift their selfish positions and carry others along, time will tell,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022I\u2019m still searching \u2013Tinubu\n\nTinubu, yesterday, said he was still searching for a running mate. The former Lagos State governor, who spoke at the public presentation of the book: \u201cMr Speaker\u201d in honour of Femi Gbajabiamila, on the occasion of his 60th birthday, however, did not say to what extent he had gone in the search.\n\nDirector of Media and Communications, Bola Ahmed Tinubu Campaign Organisation, Mr. Bayo Onanuga, in a chat with Daily Sun, confirmed that Tinubu is still consulting.\n\nHe said the APC presidential candidate cannott do the selection alone.\n\n\u201cTinubu isn\u2019t having any issues with Northern APC governors or in any fix. He\u2019s consulting with the party and will decide soon. So, there\u2019s no problem at all,\u201d he said.\n\nAPC spokesman, Felix Morka, did not respond to calls or a message from our correspondent on the issue.\n\n\u2022It\u2019ll be suicidal to pick Christian running mate \u2013Yakasai\n\nElder statesman, Tanko Yakasai, has warned that it would be politically suicidal for Tinubu to pick a Christian as running mate.\n\nLending his voice to the push for a Muslim-Muslim ticket, Yakasai said If Tinubu should pick a Christian, whether from the North or South, majority of voters in the Muslim North may move their support for Atiku.\n\nHe said a Muslim northerner would strengthen Tunibu\u2019s hold on votes of Muslims.\n\nYakasai implored Tinubu to pick a credible Muslim from the North East arguing that the zone has had the least presence in the corridor of power compared to the North Central and North West.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that by the time he completes his own tenure, it would naturally pave the way for the North-East to produce the next president,\u201d he said.\n\nHe argued that despite the opposition by some Christians, including the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), the idea of a Muslim-Muslim ticket was not new in Nigeria, saying it has been deployed in the past with considerable success.\n\nYakasai recalled that MKO Abiola appointed Babagana Kingibe, a fellow Muslim as his running mate in the1993 presidential elections and were well received by Nigerians, who voted massively for them at the polls.\n\n\u2022Lalong: I\u2019m not desperate\n\nPlateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, has dismissed reports of abandoning the state to lobby for the vice presidential slot in Lagos.\n\nHis media aide, Makut Macham, said he had never been desperate for any elective or political position.\n\n\u201cIf God says he will be the next vice president Nigeria, nobody can stop it. It is up to Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and the APC family to decide. Lalong together with his colleagues have done their part in insisting that power goes to the South. Let everyone remember that it is God who gives power to whomsoever he pleases. No amount of paid propaganda can change anything. Head or tail, Lalong wins,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also refuted the claim that the governor was spending billions of the state\u2019s funds for the said endeavour.\n\nHe said the story was \u201canchored completely on a fathom anonymous source that provided wonderfully packaged fiction and lies claiming that Governor Simon Lalong abandoned governance in Plateau State and relocated to Lagos in search of being nominated as Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s running mate.\u201d\n\nHe said Lalong has not been to Lagos in the last couple of months, the last, being the inauguration of the Dangote Fertilizer Plant and new Murtala Mohammed International Airport Terminal by President Muhammadu Buhari and attended by many governors.\n\n\u201cWe wonder where the so-called \u201csource\u201d got his imagination from about Governor Lalong relocating to Lagos, but could not provide the date, time, mode of movement or address where he allegedly relocated to in Lagos. Of course, he cannot provide such details because they do not exist even in his fictional contraption.\u201d",
          "summary": "The APC presidential flag bearer, it was learnt, has however narrowed his option to the North East and North West.\n\u201cTinubu has been given the free hands to pick a running mate.\nThey\u2019re insisting that a running mate should be produced by them.\n\u2022I\u2019m still searching \u2013TinubuTinubu, yesterday, said he was still searching for a running mate.\n\u2022It\u2019ll be suicidal to pick Christian running mate \u2013YakasaiElder statesman, Tanko Yakasai, has warned that it would be politically suicidal for Tinubu to pick a Christian as running mate.",

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo, has charged stakeholders in the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) sub-sector, popularly called cooking gas to ensure that they put Nigeria\u2019s interest first.\n\nObasanjo made the plea at 2nd West Africa LPG Expo and Nigerian Liquefied Petroleum Association (NLPGA) Summit 2022 held in Lagos at the weekend.\n\nThe ex-president\u2019s plea came on the heels of rising cost of cooking gas currently at about N12,000 per 12.kg cylinder in parts of the country.\n\nHe argued that the domestic market has so much potential as the fastest growing LPG market globally.\n\n\u2018\u2018However there are challenges which I will call on all stakeholders to come together and resolve. These include but not limited to; more volumes from other domestic producers to the ever rising demand/supply, infrastructural development to aid supply to the last mile and the issue of regulations such as VAT, among others that make affordability by the common man a challenge,\u2019\u2019 the former leader said.\n\nHe encouraged other oil and gas majors to remain committed and look at how to develop the local liquified petroleum gas sector as a way of showing appreciation to a country in which they have benefited enormously.\n\nObasanjo recalled that the leadership of NLPGA while on a courtesy visit alluded to the role that his administration played in promoting LPG use in the domestic market to what it has become today.\n\nHe said that the policies his administration initiated as at 2005 leading to the 2007 intervention, assisted in not only maintaining gas supply sustainability of alternative energy but significant than the industry has today, but also helped in managing the risk of deforestation, stoppage of health and safety risks associated with the use of kerosene and firewood.\n\n\u2018\u2018Let me start by commending the organisers of this conference and for the kind words they had shared in the past recognising the impact that has been made so far by an initiative I took when I was the President, to direct that some of our liquefied petroleum gas be retained locally for domestic use.\u201d\n\nObasanjo said the government under his leadership saw the Nigerian Gas Master Plan as a major interventionist concept to move the gas sector from its essentially dormant status in 2006 to a market-based system with willing sellers and willing buyers, realising the full potential of the sector for the benefit of all Nigerians.\n\nThe former president pointed, out that it was clear that the major players were at that time more interested in the global market and this led to the Domestic Supply Intervention Policy.\n\n\u2018\u2018Achieving a rapid growth in supply to drive the market was unlikely to happen on its own with the then structure of the sector, which was dominated by oil-centric International Oil Company\u2019s (IOCs) with little appetite for domestic gas market development.\n\nAccording to him, the domestic supply intervention policy was necessitated to jump start sustainable supply to the domestic market, the main objectives being to, enhance living standards, reduce deforestation and rural-urban migration with its associated national security issues, reduce household energy poverty and serve to promote industrial growth.\n\nHe disclosed further that, the thrust of the policy was to create a minimum level of supply by intervention. However, beyond this threshold, he said, it was expected that the basis for a fully competitive market would have been established and market forces will thereafter drive the growth of supply and demand in the market.\n\nIn essence, he maintained that, the domestic supply intervention policy was a transitional policy intervention aimed in the short term at driving supply availability to a level that could sustainably support a fully competitive gas market.\n\n\u2018\u2018The domestic supply intervention policy required all associated and nonassociated gas reserves holders to dedicate gas supply to the domestic market in the first instance thereafter export to the international market.\n\nOn NLNG interventions, he said \u2018\u2018I have heard from the NLPGA that since 2007 inception of the Domestic LPG supply program till date, the Nigeria LNG Ltd. has stood tall above its peers in the discharge of supporting the local sector.",

Fr. Peter Egielewa, announced this in a statement last night.\n\n\u201cWith heavy hearts but with total submission to the will of God, we announce the death of our priest, Rev. Fr.

          "text": "Hunger in Nigeria is not only a metaphoric reality. In many ways, it is powerfully literal. Many Nigerians are not just hungry for adequate social services, public goods, and everything else that make for a content citizenry, they are hungry for food. In a country where food security has been a mirage for years, the nightmare has been all too real for many, including children.\n\nAccording to a recent report titled Hunger Hotspots: FAO-FWP early warnings on acute food insecurity (June to September 2022 Outlook) the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Food Programme starkly warned that acute food insecurity is likely to deteriorate further in 20 countries or situations (including two regional clusters) \u2013 called hunger hotspots- during the outlook period from June to September 2022.\n\nAccording to the report which warned that global food insecurity continues to escalate, Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen remain at the highest alert level.\n\nFrom the report, about 19.5 million people are projected to be in Crises or worse levels of acute insecurity in Nigeria during the lean season (June \u2013 August 2022), including 1.2 million people in Emergency if humanitarian interventions are not scaled up or sustained.\n\nPerhaps, apart from the biting effects of climate change, it is insecurity that continues to fuel food insecurity in Nigeria more than any other factor.\n\nAs terrorism has continued to surge into many of Nigeria`s rural communities, farmers have been killed, stopped from farming entirely or forced to hand over meagre proceeds from their agricultural activities to terrorists.\n\nMultiple attacks on farmers in Nigeria`s rural communities are well documented. In November 2020, in Zabarmari, about 70 farmers were killed in attacks by terrorists who beheaded at least 30 of them in attacks which sent shockwaves across the country.\n\nIn December 2021, at least 45 farmers were killed as hostilities were renewed in Lafia, Obi and Awe local government areas of Nasarawa State.\n\nIn May 2022, more than 50 farmers were massacred when terrorists thought to belong to ISWAP invaded farmlands on the outskirts of Kala Balge Local Government Area of Borno State.\n\nWhen in May 2022, about seven farmers defied warnings not to go to their farms by bandits, seven of them were slaughtered.\n\nOn Wednesday, June 22,2022,scores of gunmen attacked farms in Rafin Daji, a farming community in Abaji Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, where they killed about two persons and whisked away 22 others who included men, women and children who were on their farmlands during the day. The sum of 12 million naira has reportedly been demanded by the attackers who have been said to be Fulani herdsmen. The police has confirmed that the victims were on their farms when they were attacked and carried away.\n\nThe insecurity ravaging the country was always going to permeate every area of the national life if nothing was done to halt it.

          "title": "BABAJIDE SANWO-OLU AT 57 \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "Kolade Badmus pays tribute to the Lagos Governor, at age, 57\n\nIt is a special day for the governor of Lagos State, Mr Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu. On Saturday, 25 June, the performing governor turned 57. Born 25 June, 1965, Sanwo-Olu earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Surveying from the University of Lagos. He went to earn an MBA and attended top schools around the world including London Business School, Lagos Business School and John F. Kennedy School of Governance, United States.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu is also an associate member of the Chartered Institute of Personnel Management (CIPM) and fellow of the Nigeria Institute of Training and Development (NITAD).\n\nBabajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu was the treasurer at the defunct Lead Merchant Bank from 1994 to 1997 where he moved to the A-list bank, the United Bank for Africa as the head of foreign money market. He then proceeded to First Inland Bank, Plc, now First City Monument Bank as a deputy general manager and divisional head. He was the chairman of Baywatch Group Limited and First Class Group Limited.\n\nHe came into the public service as a core professional. Sanwo-olu was Special Adviser on Corporate Matters to then deputy governor of Lagos State, Mr Femi Pedro. He was later appointed the acting Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget until 2007, when he was appointed as the Commissioner for Commerce and Industry by Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\nBabajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu was appointed Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pensions by Governor Babatunde Raji Fashola (BRF) in 2007. He served as the Managing Director/CEO of the Lagos State Development and Property Corporation (LSDPC) by Governor Akinwunmi Ambode in 2016.\n\nThe man who brought great transformation to Lagos got into the saddle May 29, 2019. He was not a flight by night technocrat cum politician, Sanwo-Olu had understudied the governance model of Lagos as an illustrious student of Asiwaju Tinubu school progressive politics. So, getting things done was less cumbersome. The builder of modern Lagos, Asiwaju Tinubu has set up a masterplan for development.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu came with a winning THEME agenda that focuses on Traffic Management and Transportation, Health and Environment, Education and Technology, Making Lagos a 21st Century Economy, Entertainment and Tourism as well as Security and Governance.\n\nHe has been breaking new frontiers in these thematic areas and also upgrading other critical sectors of lives as a state. Indeed, the Sanwo-Olu administration is governance redefined.\n\nUnder his watch, Lagos has improved in all facets and is enjoying a unique brand of progressive development. Men of good conscience are proud of the governor\u2019s dynamic leadership qualities and his ability to sustain the tempo of excellence by making Lagos State the envy of all.\n\nIn the area of road construction for instance, he ensured quality roads that will stand the test of time. Sanwo-Olu roads are majorly concrete built that will last for years. In all parts of Lagos State, the impact of the governor is being felt.\n\nIn the transport sector, he opened the waterways under the Lagos intermodal transport systems. He acquired additional modern ferries into the fleets of LAGFERRY to make commuting seamless across the mega city.\n\nLagos launched First and Last Mile buses to address the transport challenges in the hinterlands. Decent and safe transport system is what befits Lagos State. This speaks to the clampdown on the commercial motorcycles popularly called Okadas. Aside from the grave security threats, their operations portend, they have continued to constitute nuisance in the state.\n\nSo, as a government with a human face, the ban was not total but only restricted to the urban centres of the state and major roads and highways. In the same vein LAGRIDE, a fleet of over 1000 taxis for Lagos residents. It is all geared towards ensuring a better and safer transportation options for teaming commuting Lagosians.\n\nIn the education sector, teachers are getting required attention as well as the students. More schools and modern instructional learning materials have also been provided for schools to improve learning outcomes.\n\nThe best of governor Sanwo-Olu came to the fore during the COVID-19 crisis, he provided great leadership when the State became the epicentre of the pandemic.\n\nAt the peak of the greatest public health crisis of the century, Sanwo-Olu said: \u201cOne of the things that you learn in life is you do not put a crisis to waste, as tough as it is, the crisis could be a time to define yourself. Like you said, we came in at a very difficult time, you can imagine getting sworn in during the rainy season, we came when traffic gridlock was at its highest, it was almost on a daily basis and you had to settle in very quickly and on the bed of that as we were ending that half year in 2019, COVID was announced in China and by January, it became global.\n\n\u201cI would say two things that toughened me was the fact that you cannot fail yourself. A failure to oneself is the biggest disservice you can do to the teaming number of people that believe in you. Those who believe in you are not necessarily about your power or your strength, but the fact that there is something inherent that has been part of your environment that you need to come up and showcase. And so, when COVID happened, I listened and I listened very well. I listened to experts, to science and to what makes a lot of sense and that helped me to be able make quick decisions. Something we have never seen before would demand decisions that are quick and smart so that, even if it was a mistake, you cannot afford not to make a mistake.\n\n\u201cAt the peak of it we were dealing with a health issue, an economic issue and a security issue, all three woven up together and one of the early things like I said apart from listening is that you need to flip your listening to communication. You have to bring out the ability to transparently tell people what is going on, that communication helps for people to know that it is bad but it is not all over yet and so that will calm a lot of nerves down. I believe we did and every other thing was just learning from it as we went on. We could say that our strategy worked and we are thankful that people believed in us to have listened to the things we were saying. It is just like a crash programme; get wiser and older almost immediately\u2019.\n\nLet\u2019s jointly wish visionary Sanwo-Olu a happy 57th birthday.\n\nBadmus writes from Lagos",

          "title": "WHEN THE STATE CONDONES TORTURE \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "Government should enforce the Anti-Torture Act, writes Chidi Anselm Odinkalu\n\nWhen I first met Elechi Larry Igwe early in 1991, he was safely ensconced in the bowels of a mortuary in Lagos. Elechi, a resident of the United States of America, had flown into the Murtala Muhammed International Airport for the Christmas and New Year holidays in 1990 into 1991 on his way to his village in Abiriba, now in Abia State in south-east Nigeria. He never made it home nor did he return to the USA. His journey ended in the Surulere Police Station. On his way from the airport to his hotel layover, some police men waylaid Elechi, abducted him to the police station and, having tortured him to their hearts\u2019 content, mercifully put a bullet to his mouth shattering his mandibles, his facial structure and the lives that depended on him.\n\nElechi was one of a multitude of victims whose ordeals at the hands of the Nigeria Police Force and the security services defined my early life as a legal professional in Nigeria. All of them were either survivors of torture or relatives of victims of torture and extra-judicial killings.\n\nThe advocacy group, Access to Justice, describes the practice of torture in Nigeria\u2019s security services as \u201cinstitutional and routine\u201d, while Amnesty International complains that \u201cpolice and military personnel routinely use torture and other ill-treatment to extract information and \u2018confessions\u2019, and to punish and exhaust detainees.\u201d\n\nThe methods and means of torture in the practice of policing Nigeria, for instance, are infinite. In many cases, security and law enforcement agents built their careers on torture and third degree policing. Indeed, the prevalence of torture, inhumane treatment, and even extrajudicial killings by law enforcement officers is rampant and very well documented, to the point of being the cause of a national uprising in October 2020 under the nomenclature of #EndSARS.\n\nA report jointly issued in 2010, the Open Society Justice Initiative and Network on Police Reform in Nigeria (NOPRIN) alleged that \u201ctorture facilities and personnel, including dedicated torture chambers, instruments, and an officer known as \u2018O/C (officer in charge of) Torture\u2019 exist in every major police station. In most cases, the O/C Torture has a workshop or torture chamber entirely of his own, and a seemingly limitless number of options for dispensing suffering and eliciting the confessions that are the principal means of police investigation in Nigeria. Some of them achieve near-legendary status.\u201d\n\nOne of such officers whose legend was built on his skill in the dreadful art of torture reportedly headed the anti-robbery section in the State Criminal Investigation Department, SCID in south-east. The torture chamber that he ran was known as \u201cthe theatre\u201d. It was infamous for its dexterity in dismantling even the most hardened of suspects and detainees. One of the assets under his command was \u201ca police officer called \u201cOkpontu\u201d\u2014meaning \u201cthe Nailer\u201d in Igbo language\u2014after he reportedly drove a nail through the palm of a detainee in 2006.\u201d\n\nTorture in Nigeria is a resilient atrocity, with deep origins in the institutional foundations of the police, army and security institutions in the country from the middle of the 19th century when blacks were not considered human beings. By the time the country became independent in 1960, these attitudes and practices had crystallized into institutional doctrine after a century of white supremacism, under which those institutions were established.\n\nTorture is the crime that prospers despite the being prohibited the world over. The constitutional prohibition of torture is as old as post-colonial Nigeria. It was contained in section 18 of the 1960 Constitution and section 31 of the 1979 constitution as well as in section 34 of the 1999 Constitution. Quite apart from these, Article 5 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights which is law in Nigeria also prohibits torture.\n\nThere were two problems, however, with this prohibition. First, none of these constitutions ever defined torture. Second, torture was not a crime in Nigeria until 2017.\n\nWhile it was not a crime to torture human beings in Nigeria until 2017, it was criminal in many parts of the country to torture animals. For instance, s. 394(1)(a) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2011, makes it a crime for any person to \u201ccruelly beat, kick, ill-treat, over-ride, over-drive, over-load, torture, infuriate, or terrify any animal, or cause or procure, or, being the owner, permit any animal to be so used.\u201d Impressively, the same law did not criminalize torture of humans.\n\nThe Anti-Torture Act (ATA) of 2017 set out to rectify these anomalies in Nigeria through six steps. First, for the first time in Nigerian law, the Act defines torture which can be physical or psychological. The former includes \u201csuch cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment which causes pain, exhaustion, disability or dysfunction of one or more parts of the body\u201d, while the latter covers \u201csuch cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment calculated to affect or confuse the mind or undermine a person\u2019s dignity and morale.\u201d\n\nSecond, the Act prescribes a state-actor requirement as inherent in the definition of torture. Thus, section 2(1) prescribes that for an act to constitute torture, it must be done \u201cby or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity provided that it does not include pain or suffering in compliance with lawful sanctions.\u201d This requirement of state actor extends to abuses by militias or civilian task-forces maintained by governments and politicians.\n\nThird, there are no defences or exceptions to torture under the Act. For the avoidance of doubt, the ATA provides that \u201c[n]o exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war. Internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification for torture.\u201d It is no defence that we are fighting an insurgency or liquidating some people whom we do not like.\n\nFourth, the Act makes torture a crime punishable on conviction with a minimum of 25 years in jail under section 9(1) of the Act. Section 9(2) provides that \u201c[t]orture resulting in the loss of life of a person is considered as murder and shall be tried and punished under the relevant laws.\u201d\n\nFifth, with reference to possibilities for redress, the National Human Rights Commission and NGOs may help victims file complaints concerning violations of the ATA and the Attorney-General may make rules and regulations for the implementation of the Act respectively under sections 6 and 12.\n\nSixth, the ATA is a federal piece of legislation enacted by the National Assembly in exercise of its powers to implement the Fundamental Rights under the Constitution. Being an exercise of powers exclusive to the National Assembly, the Act is applicable to all states of Nigeria and does not require any further act or acts by the states to make it applicable in their respective jurisdictions for purposes of enforcement.\n\nCiting the ATA, Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), claimed before a meeting in Abuja on 21 June, 2022, that Nigeria does not condone torture. However, five years after the passage of the ATA, the same Attorney-General cannot point to a single case prosecuted by him under the Act. Indeed, the National Committee against Torture established since 2009 continues to function as an appendage under his office, lacking independence or authority to fight the scourge.\n\nWhen it met with the United Nations in Geneva in November 2021, the National Committee toed the same line as the Attorney-General but got smacked down by the United Nations officials who told them pointedly that while \u201cit was good to pass laws, but it was better to act on them. The legal framework of Nigeria was not called into question; rather, the questions raised had been more about the implementation of those laws.\u201d\n\nContrary to the protestations of the Attorney-General of the Federation, therefore, and to the express provisions of the Nigerian constitution, it seems clear that Nigeria does condone torture.\n\nOn Sunday, 26 June 2022, the world marks the International day in Support of victims of Torture. The International Day was instituted by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 52/149 of 12 December, 1997, \u201cwith a view to the total eradication of torture and the effective functioning of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which entered into force on 26 June 1987.\u201d If Attorney-General Malami wants to be taken seriously in his protestations about torture in Nigeria, he can choose this day to announce how he will make the ATA work. That will be an auspicious start.\n\nA lawyer and a teacher, Odinkalu can be reached at chidi.odinkalu@tufts.edu",

          "title": "INCREASE IN EMPLOYMENT IS SOLUTION TO HIGH INFLATION \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "F. E. Ogbimi contends that increasing interest rate does not reduce inflation, but increasing employment\n\nWe know there are persistent inflation pressure in low-productivity-, one-sector- agricultural-artisan African economies, especially Nigeria\u2019s. We are also hearing of inflation pressure in the technologically-advanced economies in Europe, America and Asia. We are also hearing that Central Banks all over the world are meeting to increase interest rates as they always do. Indeed, the United States of America\u2019s Federal Reserve Bank has increased interest rate by 0.75 per cent. Economists and other social scientists, accountants, bankers, etc., who populate central banks and related global institutions like the World Bank and IMF as they do always, are wrong in suggesting that interest rates be increased as solution to inflation. Lack of sense of history and lack of understanding of the science which underlies the economic development process, are two of many debilitating reasons economists and related experts cannot manage our economies well. Economists and their friends do not understand how a national economy works. They merely deify money and see the economy inside the bank rather than see the bank inside the economy.\n\nOur theory of employment, \u201cSolution to Co-Existent Low Productivity, High Unemployment and High Inflation (Ogbimi, 1995),\u201d published in the Nigerian Journal of Economic and Social Studies (NJSS), Vol. 37, No.2,3, pp, 223-251, which revealed the relationships among employment, productivity and inflation showed clearly that large increase in employment (in quantity and quality) and consequent improvement in productivity or production is the true antidote to inflation. Of the three fundamental variables that characterize the economy: employment, productivity and inflation, employment is the independent variable while productivity and inflation together are the dependent variables.\n\nThat means that the statuses of production/productivity and inflation in an economy are always determined by the level of employment in it. The theory also showed that the inflation curve is the image of the productivity curve and vice versa. The inflation curve is a parabola (bell-shaped curve opened up) resting on top of the productivity hypabola (bell-shaped curve opened down) and vice versa. Our theory of employment therefore demonstrated that employment (in quantity and quality) is the blood of the economy. Large increase in employment leads to large increase in the knowledge, skills and competences available and being applied in the economy. These in turn lead to increase in productivity/production and reduction in inflation.\n\nOur theory of employment also showed that any economy may be in one of three statuses. The statuses are: Low Productivity, Low Employment (High Unemployment) and High Inflation, otherwise known as stagflation (one); Optimum Productivity, High Employment (Low Unemployment) and Minimum Inflation (two); and Low Productivity, Full Employment and High Inflation (III).\n\nQuite importantly, the analysis showed that in the region between position one and two, increase in employment leads to increase in productivity and decrease in inflation. That is, improvement in productivity is the true antidote to inflation. In the region between position two and position three, increase in employment leads to decrease in productivity and increase in inflation. This is the region Phillips (1958) claimed to have identified in isolation. It has since been wrongly applied: promoting retrenchment when increase in employment should be promoted in low productivity-, one-sector-, artisan-agricultural African economies that have long been experiencing mass unemployment, by the World Bank and IMF.\n\nNigeria and other African nations are in status I \u2013 stagflation, while the technologically advanced nations (the industrialised) are between position I and position II. The management of an economy from one fundamental position to another, say from I to II, is a transformation from an undesirable status into a desirable status.\n\nEconomists were brought up to believe that money (capital) play very important role in the economic development of a nation (De-Fleur, et al., 19977). Consequently, they either do not know or do not understand the implication of the historical evidence that all the rich nations in Europe, America and Asia were poor village-nations (like the poor nations in Africa today) for many centuries during which they learnt very slowly and achieved industrialization before becoming rich. Hence, promoting industrialization is the most important factor for reducing poverty in the developing nations. Because economists do not understand the relationship among employment, productivity and inflation in an economy, they do not know that one or two of the variables cannot be dealt with in isolation.\n\nOur theory of employment is a confirmation of our algebraic theory of industrialisation based on the observation that the intrinsic value of the learning-person appreciates with learning rate and time; the learning-person is an appreciating asset (AA) which the growth may be modelled by a growing function like the compound interest formula. Scaling of the basic equation demonstrated that the Sustainable Economic Growth and Industrialisation (SEGI) process of a society may be modelled by five learning-related variables. The variables are (Ogbimi, 1996): N i , the number of people involved in productive activities or employment level in the nation (1); M oj , the level of education/training of the people in the nation and those involved in productive activities (2); L k , the linkages among the knowledge, skills, competences and sectors in the economy (3); the learning rate or intensity in the economy, especially that of the workforce (4); and n p , the experience of the workforce and the learning history of the society.\n\nAll of these variables are related to the learning-people and they are directly related to the economic strength of the economy. This means that the more the number of people involved in productive activities, the higher the average education/training of the people/workforce, the more the linkages among the knowledge, skills and competences possessed by the people/workforce and society or by the sectors of the economy, the higher the learning rate in the society and among the workforce and the more the learning experience of the society and workforce, the more productive the economy becomes.\n\nOur industrialisation theory also demonstrated that the number of people involved in learning (education, training, employment and research), is the variable that determines the health of an economy.\n\nMany individuals and groups of intelligentsia and intellectuals work to suppress the truth. I praise the Nigerian economists who allowed our theory of employment to be published in their journal. I am a retired professor of the Science of Development (Technology Management). I have written the following books:\n\n1. Solution to Mass Unemployment in Nigeria, 160pp + ix; 2. Understanding Why Capital Investments Cannot Promote Sustainable Economic Growth and Industrialization, 130pp + x; 3. Understanding Why Learning Is the Primary Source of Growth, Industrialization and Development, 110pp+vii; 4.

          "text": "All is not well with Nigeria, writes Charles Dickson\n\nIf you must buy a baboon don\u2019t buy the one with a 10% discount.\n\nReality is a construct.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, I had promised that for 12 months, In Shaa Allah, I will once a month X-ray the issues around the forthcoming General Elections in the world\u2019s largest black population and sufacracy. This is number six, and six more to go.\n\nSo, there\u2019s this theory we call the theory of the reality tunnel. The reality tunnel is a theory that, with a subconscious set of mental filters formed from beliefs and experiences, every individual interprets the same world differently, hence \u201cTruth is in the eye of the beholder\u201d. It is similar to the idea of representative realism, and was coined by Timothy Leary.\n\nAccording to the theory, humans see the world through the filters of their experiences and beliefs. Upbringing, education, all the joys and failures that have ever happened to us are the building material for the tunnel of reality. And that\u2019s why people react differently to the same things.\n\nTake Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s legendary painting, \u201cGioconda.\u201d As you look at it, one person will notice the enigmatic smile, another will notice the mathematical perfection in it. And the third will see a complete woman without eyebrows. And none of this trio is wrong \u2013 they all live in their tunnels and sincerely believe they are right.\n\nAnd all because, according to the theory of tunnels, there is no single truth. And cannot exist. Escaping from your tunnel is difficult. It is like a well-trodden path: comfortable and familiar.\n\nEach exit from the tunnel is unusual, dangerous and unpleasant \u2013 but it\u2019s in these moments that real creativity happens, in these moments you can become a creator who creates a completely new, unique reality. Nigeria is at a verge, 2023 presents an opportunity, and a new reality, if we take it, remains to be seen.\n\nLooking out across the rolling wooded acres of Arlington National Cemetery, with its hundreds of thousands of white stones in perfectly ordered rows, brings an assortment of emotions that are impossible to escape. Sadness. Desolation. Pride of country. Anger over so many lost young lives. The stones represent tremendous loss as well as the gift of freedom we are able to enjoy.\n\nArlington National Cemetery is a United States military cemetery located across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., in Arlington County, Virginia. Within its 624 acres, over four hundred thousand active-duty service members, veterans, and their families have been buried. In addition to the military heroes, Arlington is also the final resting place for a select number of presidents, astronauts, senators, and Supreme Court justices. Founded during the dark days of the Civil War, the cemetery now contains the remains of military personnel from every American war \u2014 from the Revolution to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nBut what about those of us who have never been called upon to lay down our lives in battle? Is the whole concept of \u201csacrifice\u201d something for others and not for us? No!\n\nSacrifice isn\u2019t just some dramatic final act of heroism. Sacrifice is also laying down our privileges, benefits, and pleasures for the good of someone else.\n\nNigeria and Nigerians are torn deeply by terrible segregated, divided, dichotomous, ethnic and religious schisms. The nation has as much as one million tunnels of reality. With barely a handful willing to make a sacrifice for a new reality.\n\nAs we approach 2023, very few persons are thinking, and by thinking, I mean this THINK stands for:\n\nT\u2013True: Is what I write true?\n\nH\u2013Helpful: Is what I say or do helpful?\n\nI\u2013Inspiring: Is what I do, write and say, inspiring?\n\nN\u2013Necessary: Is what I do say, or write necessary?\n\nK\u2013Kind: Are my actions, words kind to others?\n\nI as a matter of me look at issues from the larger picture. I do not just dabble into matters, I THINK, I look beyond sophistry, anchored more on bare-face political partisanship, and ethnicity or group affiliation. I leave room for human frailties but I THINK before I write or talk.\n\nWhether Atiku, Peter Obi, Wike, Buhari or GEJ, Fulanis and the South, all are situated in dichotomies, APC is a Muslim party, does it make PDP any Christian? Our tunnel of reality is not a subject within the shores of this nation that one talks about without understanding, it evokes a lot of passions from the heated arguments which it generates, everyone holding dear to their values, and idiosyncrasies.\n\nAgain with 2023, our propensity to think as easterners, westerners, northerners, middle belters, all depending on the turns of event comes to bear.\n\nEvery nation has countless tunnels or the other, if it is not the north vs south, it is versus blocs, religion or even ideological dichotomies. There are several reasons why such tunnels exist. Sometimes it is a function of creation or political correctness like we have in the Nigerian case.\n\nIn our sensationalism, we have in every sense approached most problems sectionally thereby creating all kinds of unnecessary petty-culture-ethnic-religious-parapoism and bourgeois mentality in dealing with our national issues.\n\nTunnels and dichotomies are one that is used by political apologists as a socio-economic weapon. Apart from the positive, our dichotomy has been used to exploit and bamboozle the masses without major consideration being given to the dynamics of the law of development which in essence deals scientifically with the unity and struggle of opportunities and opposites.\n\n2023 provides in truth a possibility for a social revolution that can solve our problems, be they political, economic or social. In this sense we need more than a free, fair and credible election, what we need is the progressive element (Sadly that progressive element today is largely on paper only) to come together as a striking force. Because they have a revolutionary duty to this nation to help in striking a balance, to disabuse the thought pattern that has been built.\n\nThere is an ideology of hatred, one that props up again and again. This is a factor that reactionary elements within the system use in battling the progressives.\n\n2023 again exposes us to one thing and it is the national question. What is a nation? We cannot fully understand the implication of the drama of the delegates primary, the consensus drama, without answering the national question scientifically in relating this phenomenon to our socio-political economic development, it is important to look at the historical development of our national question.\n\nThe national question \u201cis a question of solving vital national problems of social development, abolishing national oppression and inequality, eliminating obstacles to the development of peoples, including achievement of factual quality and internationalism in national relations.\u201d\n\nThe general elections and the road to it brings to question the concepts of \u201cnational character\u201d, \u201cnational culture\u201d, \u201cnational consciousness\u201d, \u201dnational philosophy and psychology\u201d all often used and discussed without carefully and critically understanding their contradicting class nature in antagonistic societies and their relative independence.\n\nNigeria should be a nation of a lasting historical community of people constituting a form of social development based on the community of economic life in combination with the community of language, territory, culture, consciousness and psychology. But are we?\n\nAre we a nation of various ethnic groups moving towards greater realization of cultural togetherness, peace and stability for all?\n\nThe summary of this admonition is both a warning and a challenge on the basis of what I have outlined; it is only fair and fitting to direct our critical analysis of the Nigerian political climate in the form of serious warning that all is not well. We cannot abdicate our responsibility to do and say what is right and choose which battles to fight on the premise of parochial locus standi.\n\nWe need to come to grips with realities of the moment which point to the inevitabilities of the future, because time is running out, for us to initiate entry into a tunnel of social revolution. Are we ready.\n\nDr Dickson is a Development and Media Practitioner",
          "summary": "So, there\u2019s this theory we call the theory of the reality tunnel.\nThe reality tunnel is a theory that, with a subconscious set of mental filters formed from beliefs and experiences, every individual interprets the same world differently, hence \u201cTruth is in the eye of the beholder\u201d.\nUpbringing, education, all the joys and failures that have ever happened to us are the building material for the tunnel of reality.\nNigeria is at a verge, 2023 presents an opportunity, and a new reality, if we take it, remains to be seen.\n2023 again exposes us to one thing and it is the national question.",

Two boxes were found but they (the ICPC) can\u2019t open the second one still,\u201d a source had told SaharaReporters.\n\nOn Sunday, SaharaReporters learnt $170,0000 (N103,700,000 at the parallel market rate of N610 to $1), \u00a385,000 (N64,600,000 at the parallel market rate of N760 to 1\u00a3) and \u20ac54,000 (N34,020,000 at the parallel market rate of N630 to 1\u20ac) in cash were found in the second box.\n\n\n\nThis amounts to N202,320,000.\n\nSaharaReporters earlier reported that the ICPC appeared to be doing the bidding of the former Army chief, Buratai, whose house was being used by a proxy, as the agency gave inconsistent figures of the amounts it found in the recovery of cash, vehicles and other items from the building.\n\nSee Also Military REVEALED: Identity Of Civil Servant Who Took Bail Of Military Contractor Arrested In Buratai\u2019s Abuja House With Multibillion-Naira Cash, Vehicles, Rolex Watches\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that while the ICPC granted bail to the military contractor fronting for Buratai, claiming that N30 million was found in the apartment, the agency later said in an official release that N175 million was recovered.\n\nBuratai, a retired Lieutenant General was the COAS between 2015 and 2021.\n\nAzuka Ogugua, the spokesperson for the commission, had disclosed on Friday how the apartment was raided but did not give the details of Buratai\u2019s links to the recovery.\n\nBuratai, despite denials by his lawyer and other faceless individuals, already admitted to a newspaper that the property was his and no search warrant was obtained before it was raided.\n\nOne of the sources further revealed that the ICPC figures of recovery had discrepancies all in a bid to cover up for Buratai who is at the heart of the massive corruption unfolding.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Anti-graft Agency, ICPC Covered Up For Ex-Army Chief, Buratai, Failed To Submit Funds To Central Bank, To Secretly Move Cash From Facility\n\nOne of the sources had said, \u201cBuratai spoke to People\u2019s Gazette saying ICPC had no search warrant contrary to denials by his lawyer that the property was not his.\n\n\u201cICPC granted administrative bail to Buratai\u2019s front claiming that they only found N30 million. They then issued a statement claiming they found N175 million.\"\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time Buratai would be involved in such a massive scandal. Buratai\u2019s first issue was with a businessman who fronted for him in Kano but took away his loot. Buratai got military intelligence to arrest the guy but covered up the issue when the man threatened to spill.\n\n\"They advised Buratai to let him go or find an amicable way of settling the matter. Those involved properties are in Kano and Abuja,\u201d another top source had told SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters on Friday reported that the ICPC confirmed the recovery of cash, vehicles and other items worth billions of Naira from a military contractor fronting for Buratai.\n\nAzuka Ogugua, the spokesperson for the commission, disclosed the arrest in a statement on Friday.\n\nOgagua identified the suspect as the Managing Director of K Salam Construction Company Nigeria Limited, Mr. Kabiru Sallau.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how ICPC officials last Thursday invaded a property in Abuja, recovering cash, vehicles and wrist watches worth billions of naira from a man who said they belonged to Buratai.\n\nSources said the anti-graft agency was tipped off about the cash haul by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) during a probe of Kabiru.\n\nSubsequently, the NFIU transferred the matter to ICPC, which deployed its operatives to invade the property in Wuse 2 of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the huge cash was part of the billions of Naira earmarked for the purchase of arms and ammunition by the Muhammadu Buhari-led government.\n\n\u201cLast week Thursday, ICPC officials stormed a house in Wuse area of Abuja, beside National Open University and arrested a man, Kabiru Salisu (Sallau) after they saw N850 million cash in the house,\u201d a source had told SaharaReporters on Thursday.\n\n\u201cHe claimed the money belonged to Tukur Buratai who was in Cotonou at that time.\n\n\u201cOfficials of the ICPC took him to an office where another N1 billion in cash was also discovered. Also, bulletproof cars, BMW, G-Wagon worth N450m were recovered.\u201d\n\nReacting in a statement on Friday, Ogugua said acting on intelligence, the commission raided the residence in Wuse 2, Abuja, where the expensive items were found.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe Commission wishes to state that ICPC operatives raided a property in Wuse 2 of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, on Thursday, 16th June, 2022 between 5:00 pm and 12:00 am in suspicion of money laundering.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Anti-graft Agency, ICPC Uncovers Billions In Cash Meant For Arms, Ammunition To Fight Boko Haram In Abuja Home Of Ex-Chief Of Army Staff, Buratai\n\n\u201cFacts available for the time being indicates that the property is owned by owner of K Salam Construction Company, a military contractor.\n\n\u201cThe Commission recovered money and other items from the property viz. N175,706,500; $220,965; G-Wagon; 2022 editions of BMW and Mercedes Benz cars; customized mobile phones; several designer wrist watches, including three Rolexes, and some property documents.\n\n\u201cThe Commission arrested the Managing Director of K Salam Construction Company Nigeria Limited, Mr. Kabiru Sallau and investigation is ongoing. The Commission is yet to conclude its investigation and prefers not to preempt its outcome and also avoid the frenzy of a media trial.\u201d\n\nA source had earlier said the commission was under pressure to reduce the amount found in the ex-army chief\u2019s house to as low as N30 million.\n\n\n\n'Missing' Arms Funds\n\nIn March 2021, Nigeria\u2019s National Security Adviser (NSA), Babagana Monguno revealed that funds running into billions of naira meant for the procurement of arms and ammunition under the past service chiefs were unaccounted for.\n\nHis revelation came a few months after President Buhari replaced Buratai and other service chiefs.\n\nOthers were former Chief of Defence Staff, Gabriel Olonishakin; Chief of Air Staff, Abubakar Sadique and Chief of Naval Staff, Ibok Ibas.\n\nAccording to Monguno, neither the money nor the arms were on the ground upon the resumption of the new service chiefs.\n\n\u201cNow that he (President Buhari) has brought new people (service chiefs), hopefully, they will devise some ways\u2026 I\u2019m not saying the former service chiefs diverted the money, but the money is missing. We don\u2019t know how, and nobody knows for now,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cThe President will surely probe this matter. As we speak, the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum too is also wondering where all the money went. I can assure you the President takes issues of this nature seriously.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that preliminary investigation showed the funds are missing and the equipment is nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cWhen the new service chiefs assumed office, they also said they did see anything on the ground.\u201d\n\nBuratai's History Of Graft\n\nSahara Reporters had in a series of publications in 2016 exposed how Buratai procured expensive assets in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, between 2013 and 2015, from proceeds of crime.\n\nHe and his two wives in 2013 paid the sum of 1,498,534.00 AED (N120 million/$419,000) for the first property, Project TFG Marina Hotel Unit 2711.\n\nSale documents indicated that the first property was handed over to the Buratais on January 13, 2013.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Revealed: Buhari's Chief Of Army Staff, General Buratai, Wives Own Dubai Property https://t.co/Kc5qFjmoEI pic.twitter.com/aAOVXKEsha \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) June 24, 2016\n\nEleven days after he was appointed by President Buhari, the retired Army General made arrangements for the purchase of a second property from the same company in Dubai.\n\nBetween July 24 and August 17, 2015, he paid a total sum of N42.2 million into TFG Sigma 111\u2019s account in Nigeria (Skye Bank 1770380452).\n\nEvidence exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters revealed that Buratai made N10 million payments on July 24 and August 7 respectively.\n\nSee Also Exclusive Revealed: Buhari's Chief Of Army Staff, General Buratai, Wives Own Dubai Property\n\nThree days later, another N10 million was paid into the real estate firm\u2019s account. The phone number on the Skye Bank teller is 08033349740. Saharareporters' investigations showed that it belonged to a Nigerian Army Major, Emmanuel G. Adegbola of the Nigerian Army Finance Corps (N/10808).\n\nOn August 17, 2015, the Chief of Army Staff paid the sum of N3,270,000 into the account.\n\nBuratai, who owned up to purchasing the two properties in Dubai, however, claimed that he amassed his wealth through \u201cpersonal savings\u201d and not ill-gotten gains.\n\nHe added he made a lot of money from his snake farm along Keffi-Abuja Highway in Nasarawa, just 50 kilometres from the nation\u2019s capital.",

The Commission is yet to conclude its investigation and prefers not to preempt its outcome and also avoid the frenzy of a media trial.\u201d\n\nA source had earlier said the commission was under pressure to reduce the amount found in the ex-army chief\u2019s house to as low as N30 million.\n\n\n\n'Missing' Arms Funds\n\nIn March 2021, Nigeria\u2019s National Security Adviser (NSA), Babagana Monguno revealed that funds running into billions of naira meant for the procurement of arms and ammunition under the past service chiefs were unaccounted for.\n\nHis revelation came a few months after President Buhari replaced Buratai and other service chiefs.\n\nOthers were former Chief of Defence Staff, Gabriel Olonishakin; Chief of Air Staff, Abubakar Sadique and Chief of Naval Staff, Ibok Ibas.\n\nAccording to Monguno, neither the money nor the arms were on the ground upon the resumption of the new service chiefs.\n\n\u201cNow that he (President Buhari) has brought new people (service chiefs), hopefully, they will devise some ways\u2026 I\u2019m not saying the former service chiefs diverted the money, but the money is missing. We don\u2019t know how, and nobody knows for now,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cThe President will surely probe this matter. As we speak, the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum too is also wondering where all the money went. I can assure you the President takes issues of this nature seriously.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that preliminary investigation showed the funds are missing and the equipment is nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cWhen the new service chiefs assumed office, they also said they did see anything on the ground.\u201d\n\nBuratai's History Of Graft\n\nSahara Reporters had in a series of publications in 2016 exposed how Buratai procured expensive assets in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, between 2013 and 2015, from proceeds of crime.\n\nHe and his two wives in 2013 paid the sum of 1,498,534.00 AED (N120 million/$419,000) for the first property, Project TFG Marina Hotel Unit 2711.\n\nSale documents indicated that the first property was handed over to the Buratais on January 13, 2013.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Revealed: Buhari's Chief Of Army Staff, General Buratai, Wives Own Dubai Property https://t.co/Kc5qFjmoEI pic.twitter.com/aAOVXKEsha \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) June 24, 2016\n\nEleven days after he was appointed by President Buhari, the retired Army General made arrangements for the purchase of a second property from the same company in Dubai.\n\nBetween July 24 and August 17, 2015, he paid a total sum of N42.2 million into TFG Sigma 111\u2019s account in Nigeria (Skye Bank 1770380452).\n\nEvidence exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters revealed that Buratai made N10 million payments on July 24 and August 7 respectively.\n\nSee Also Exclusive Revealed: Buhari's Chief Of Army Staff, General Buratai, Wives Own Dubai Property\n\nThree days later, another N10 million was paid into the real estate firm\u2019s account. The phone number on the Skye Bank teller is 08033349740. Saharareporters' investigations showed that it belonged to a Nigerian Army Major, Emmanuel G. Adegbola of the Nigerian Army Finance Corps (N/10808).\n\nOn August 17, 2015, the Chief of Army Staff paid the sum of N3,270,000 into the account.\n\nBuratai, who owned up to purchasing the two properties in Dubai, however, claimed that he amassed his wealth through \u201cpersonal savings\u201d and not ill-gotten gains.\n\nHe added he made a lot of money from his snake farm along Keffi-Abuja Highway in Nasarawa, just 50 kilometres from the nation\u2019s capital.",

          "text": "The family of the deceased 12-year-old pupil of Dowen College, Lekki, Lagos, Sylvester Oromoni Jnr, allegedly tortured to death by some senior students who wanted to initiate him into a cult group, has raised the alarm over an alleged plot to unnecessarily delay proceedings at the coroner\u2019s inquest into his death.\n\nAccording to the Oromoni\u2019s family, there is a plot to frustrate them from seeking justice.\n\nSpecifically, the family indicted the representative of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) in the court proceedings, one Bernard Onigah, who it claimed was been used to create confusion at every court sitting just to ensure that the Coroner never arrived at a conclusion to make its final report based on findings and substantial evidence at its disposal.\n\nConsequently, the father of the deceased, Mr. Sylvester Oromoni, who spoke with journalists in Warri at the weekend, urged the leadership of the NBA to withdraw its representative, Onigah, from the court proceedings in order to allow the Coroner to carry out its job diligently, so as to arrive at a conclusion in bringing out its report on the matter early enough.\n\nHe stated that the failure of the NBA leadership to continue to keep Onigah as its representative in the court would be interpreted as complicity on the part of the body to frustrate the proceedings, thereby prolonging sittings in order to deny the family the justice craved over their son's death.\n\nIn the meantime, Sylvester Oromoni has appealed to Nigerians to keep the faith with the family, as they would not relent in their efforts until they secure justice for their late son who was alleged to have been tortured by a gang of senior students before being released to die some days later.\n\nWhile assuring that no level of frustration can make the family abandon the cause of justice for their son, Oromoni noted that the family was determined to seek justice even if it\u2019s going to take them another three decades.\n\nAccording to him, from the events of the past few weeks at the Coroner inquest, we can draw a conclusion that some parties in the case have resulted in using one Bernard Onigah, a representative of the NBA in the matter to buy more time by causing confusion and unnecessary setback at every sitting in order to delay its report and frustrate the family.\n\nHe said, \"We, the members of the Oromoni family, hereby urged the leadership of the NBA to immediately withdraw its representative, Bernard Onigah from the Coroner, in order to assist in making the court draw conclusions based on findings and present its report appropriately.\n\n\"I wish to state categorically that failure of NBA leadership to withdraw Bernard Onigah from the panel after this passionate appeal would be interpreted as complicity on the part of its leadership to continue to frustrate the court proceedings through its representative who had been causing confusion and dragging the court back.\n\n\"We are not unmindful of the fact that NBA representatives just like other bodies were supposed to play an observer role in the inquest proceedings but to our greatest surprise, the said Bernard Onigah has assumed the role of a Defence counsel in the case by raising issues that tend to frustrate proceedings in order to buy time before the Coroner.\n\n\"However, we want to appeal to Nigerians to keep the faith alive with the Oromoni family and wish to thank everyone who stood by us during our trying period last December when we lost our Dear promising son, Sylvester Oromini Jnr, to the cold hand of death as a result of complications from the torture he received while in school.\n\n\"We assured everyone that we will continue to remain focused on the case and no amount of plots to frustrate or discourage us would succeed, as we are determined more than ever before to get justice for our late son even if it would take us another 30 years to achieve this, we are prepared.\u201d\n\nHe lamented the present situation where those alleged to have masterminded and carried out the torture that led to the death of his son had resumed a new academic session in the same school, Dowen College, while his son remained lifeless in the mortuary.\n\nHe stated that no frustration would deter him from getting justice for his late son.\n\nThe family had accused five students of Dowen College namely Kenneth Inyang, Ansel Temile, Edward Begue, Michael Kashamu, and Benjamin Favour of being involved in torturing Sylvester, who later died.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Kune, a Kenyan food tech startup that delivered ready-to-eat meals at affordable prices, is closing down today, the company\u2019s founder and CEO Robin Reecht announced.\n\nIn a statement posted to his LinkedIn page, Reecht cited a stifled economy and inflated food prices as circumstances that contributed to Kune\u2019s closure. \u201cWith the current economic downturn and investment markets tightening up, we were unable to raise our next round. Coupled with rising food costs deteriorating our margins, we just couldn\u2019t keep going,\u201d he said.\n\nThe announcement comes just 4 months after the startup began its commercial operations at established meal centers around Nairobi. Around that time, Kune leadership also declared its intentions to raise $3.5 million in its second round of funding.\n\nBut while Kune was well-liked by its customers, the startup\u2019s journey wasn\u2019t without its fair share of controversy. Last June, Reecht faced the mighty lash of Kenyans on Twitter (best known as KoT) after he shared in a TechCrunch interview that he was inspired to launch Kune after taking a trip to Kenya in November 2020 and having trouble finding affordable, ready-to-eat meals.\n\n\u201cAfter three days of coming into Kenya, I asked where I can get great food at a cheap price, and everybody tell [sic] me it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible because either you go to the street and you eat street food, which is really cheap but with not-so-good quality, or you order on Uber Eats, Glovo or Jumia, where you get quality but you have to pay at least $10.\u201d\n\nReecht, who is white and French, founded Kune just one month later.\n\nKenyans were aggrieved by his comments, and did not hesitate to voice their critiques. They argued that Reecht\u2019s ability to secure funding so quickly was due more to his white privilege than his business plan, which some believed aimed to solve a nonexistent problem. Those discussions gave way to a larger conversation about white privilege and favouritism in tech, as well as Kenya\u2019s neglect of its local founders.\n\nIn his statement, Reecht said that even though Kune had sold more than 55,000 meals and acquired more than 6,000 individual customers and 100 corporate customers since the start of the year, its $3 per meal price point wasn\u2019t enough to sustain its growth.\n\nAddressing Kune\u2019s investors, he said, \u201cNot only did you invest in Kune but you gave us your time, brain-width, connections, and emotional support. I am deeply sorry that Kune\u2019s vision didn\u2019t come true. To betray your confidence is something for which I will never forgive myself.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "These founders are helping companies make decisions with data",
          "text": "On a drab January day in 2018, in Pamplemousses, Mauritius, 2 friends, Joseph Rutankangwa and Eric Sewankambo, sat in Rutakangwa\u2019s apartment and decided to start a company. It wasn\u2019t their first time venturing into business together; only the previous year they\u2019d tried building an aggregator to curate data from various African countries which multinational companies could use. The problem was: there was simply no available data to be gathered. Generally speaking, data about Africa is scarce, and even when it is available, it can be inadequate and outdated.\n\nAt the time they decided to give their business aspirations a second chance together, Rutakangwa and Sewankambo had been consulting for multinational consumer goods companies that were looking to expand into African markets. In their work, they often encountered the data gaps. Government ministries and countries\u2019 chambers of commerce (did not have detailed information about consumer persona and behaviour in Africa\u2019s markets. While these offices might, for example, present data on what percentage of a country had electricity, they had nothing on how many homes exactly had power, or how many of them experienced power cuts each month, or how long these power cuts lasted. A solar company entering into many African markets would thus have little information to work with. Such gaps in the data cost businesses money in wasted marketing efforts, and make it tough for the continent to attract further investment.\n\nRutakangwa understands why these costly business errors occur: the data the multinational companies rely on\u2014often collected by market research firms\u2014is assumed African countries to be monolithic and did not provide companies with enough detail with which to make market expansion decisions.\n\nAnd so, when Rutakangwa and Sewankambo launched Rwazi, a Mauritian-based startup that provides multinational organisations with on-ground data to facilitate effective decision making, they decided that they\u2019d collate data that dealt in the specifics. \u201cI want to know the details,\u201d Joseph tells me, firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to tell me the market share of this [brand] is 75%. What is 75%? Is it 6,255 outlets? Is it 10,800? I don\u2019t want the percentage. I want the exact number, exact location, exact contact, and exact images [of these shops].\u201d\n\nDespite Rutakangwa and Sewankambo understanding the problems with multinational consumer goods companies accessing useful data, figuring out the most effective way to collect this data was initially challenging.\n\nAt first, they tried using retailers and sales reps to collect information. But both groups proved inefficient as they are incentivised to falsify the data\u2014retailers because claiming that they stock products they actually don\u2019t have gets them freebies from companies; and sales reps because success in their jobs meant reporting, always, that their products were in stores.\n\nThey changed their approach. They figured companies were trying to sell to consumers, not retailers or sales reps; only a consumer would be truthful about the availability of a product and their access to it. So, Rutakangwa and Sewankambo employed regular local consumers, called \u201cmappers\u201d, to collect the data from shops and households.\n\nThese mappers collect data within the neighbourhoods closest to them at any given time. Think Uber, but for data collection.\n\nIllustration: For shops, when a mapper signed up to the Rwazi platform receives a mapping order from a toothpaste company to find out how many shops around them sell toothpaste and what brands they carry, the mapper accepts the request, then proceeds to locate and count how many shops in the area sell toothpaste. They also document what brands they stock, and at what prices. For households, the mappers meet consumers in their homes and quiz them on the brand of toothpaste they use, why they use it, their experience using it, what it costs them, and so on.\n\nA mapper can only submit data while they are still at a shop or household. Every shop is already geotagged on the Rwazi platform. When a mapper submits the data, Rwazi verifies the information by checking that the shop or household\u2019s geocoordinates matches the mapper\u2019s current location.\n\n\u201cSynergy\u201d\n\nFor this story, I spoke to Rutakangwa and Sewankambo 3 days apart, but some of the things they told me could easily have been convergent thoughts from 2 people in the same room at the same time. The week of our conversation, they are in Los Angeles participating in the Techstars Accelerator, and they have been stunned by how differently from the rest of the world success for African founders is defined. They have met with Western founders whose startups make up to $3 million in annual revenue but who consider this feat modest. \u201cBack home,\u201d Sewankambo says, \u201cif you\u2019re making $3 million dollars [a year], you\u2019re a conglomerate!\u201d\n\nRutakangwa and Sewankambo have been friends for 7 years, having met as business management undergraduates on the Mauritian campus of the African Leadership University, where Rwazi\u2019s story first began to shapen. Their roles as COO (Sewankambo) and CEO (Rutakangwa) may state sharply defined responsibilities\u2014Sewankambo deals with operations and customer delivery while Rutakangwa\u2019s handles customer acquisition\u2014but they are not fussy about the demarcation. \u201cWe tend to switch, depending on who can do it faster or better,\u201d Sewankambo says. \u201cSometimes, I talk to clients, sometimes he talks to the operations team.\u201d\n\nThey both say \u201csynergy\u201d when describing their partnership, painting a picture of complementariness, where, during conflict, one founder\u2019s scepticism is another\u2019s faith. A few months into Rwazi\u2019s launch, they had begun receiving mapping orders from clients from outside the consumer goods industry\u2014medicine, pharmaceuticals, hospitality, fintech. Sewankambo was concerned about them servicing these orders that had nothing to do with consumer goods as that could mean Rwazi taking on work in industries they had no prior experience in. But Rutakangwa saw things differently: in principle, mapping data for hospitals and pharmacies was the same as mapping for beverage and liquor companies. They ended up accepting these orders, which they claim increased their revenue and client base.\n\nWhere next, after Techstars?By 2050, Africa will make up 25% of the world\u2019s population; Rutakangwa and Sewankambo have this at the back of their minds as they use the access granted by Techstars to court more US-based clients looking to understand consumer habits and trends in African markets, raise seed worth $3 million, and evolve Rwazi\u2019s product by incorporating machine learning and AI into it so it can perform simulations, make forecasts, and generate automatic reports. Today they have 20,000 mappers spread across 60 countries and over 100 cities; by the end of the year, they aim to onboard 1 million mappers spread across their current coverage.\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), on Sunday night said he was still searching for his running mate for the 2023 general election.\n\nTinubu had submitted the name of\n\nKabir Masari, former APC national welfare secretary to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as \u2018placeholder\u2019running mate.\n\nBut speaking at the presentation of the book, \u2018Mr Speaker\u2019 and the unveiling of the Legislative Mentorship Initiative to mark the 60 birthday of Femi Gbajabiamila,\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives in Abuja, the former Lagos govenor said he was still looking for who would be his running mate.\n\nTinubu lauded the good working relationship between the Gbajabiamila and his deputy, Ahmed Wase, saying he need to learn from the duo as he continues his search for a running mate.\n\nHe described Gbajabiamila as a symbol of democratic value, honesty and integrity, and Wase as a good symbol of unity, dependability and honesty.\n\nThe APC presidential candidate thanked the speaker for his contribution in his emergence as the flagbearer of the party, adding that he discovered Gbajabiamila as a potential politician even though he was reluctant at first.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs a Minority Leader, he consults wide and he was always there to see the thinking of opposition that we must bring a revolution to the House to be able to beat the PDP. And then, he will brainstorm for any length of time about political strategy.\n\n\u201cWhen he was challenged for the position of the speaker, I think after our merger he worked with me tirelessly. Femi is a workaholic. The problem of failure stared him in the face. He lost the election to become the Speaker.\n\n\u201cI was close to tears. Stamping my foot to the ground, I said we will win again. Femi keep up. Pick yourself up. I am very proud of you that you did, you didn\u2019t give up. You did the opposition and the support job. You demonstrated what we learnt from textbooks and other authors.\n\n\u201cThat life is not about education of one section of the society. Remember what we discussed about paying the WAEC fee of omo iya oniboli (the Son of the woman who roasts plantain), and my mum was alive then, asking me to see to it each time I gave her money, it doesn\u2019t last.\n\n\u201cAnd I said whatever you do with the money I don\u2019t know. Mama will say no, those women there they are mothers, they want to pay WAEC fees. And Femi was one of the first set of people I consulted. Are we going to say that the children of the poor are not deserving becoming governors, doctors and engineers? I said I was afraid. He said do it. So that is how a junior brother can inspire a senior leader.\n\nRead also: Abiodun\u2019s administration didn\u2019t receive N37bn road refund from FG \u2013 Okubadejo\n\n\u201cFemi with your determination, grit, you are a contributor to our democratic growth, thank you. You have character. You are a great mentor and you are doing a good job charting a path to success. You\u2019ve done a good job and I say thank you, thank you.\n\n\u201cWhat you did during my primary is a story for another day. I\u2019ve spent more time, too many times and people might be bored, they might be envious too, they might be jealous. I won landslide, I thank you.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari described Gbajabiamila as a true patriot, a team player and a skillful parliamentarian.\n\nBuhari who was represented by his Chief of Staff, Ibrahim Gambari, said the Speaker is one who looks beyond differences for the benefit of all.\n\n\u201cFor him what matters is not so much the party differences but what unites Nigerians and that is why he is a passionate advocate for a peace democracy and unity of Nigeria. And no amount of parliamentary maneuvers or differences between parties would deviate him from this. He introduced the term legislative diplomacy. When there were issues between Nigerian and Ghanaian traders, He went to Accra and met with his colleagues and tried to resolve the issue.\n\n\u201cMr President is very proud of the fact that he did not need to interfere in how the National Assembly runs because he had trust in the capacity in the leadership of the Senate and House of Representatives and therefore he feels that with capable hands in both chambers of the NASS there is no need to interfere.\n\n\u201cIt is also a fact that under the Speaker and leadership of the senate there is no automaticity of opposition and antagonism to the executive. The role of legislature is not to be antagonistic as a matter of routine, but to be partners for good governance for teh people of Nigeria. They are working together to make Nigeria better,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, Gbajabiamila urged Asiwaju Tinubu to consult him in choosing his running mate, saying he would help the presidential candidate to get a running mate that would work smoothly with him.\n\n\u201cYou (Tinubu) said in your address that many years ago you consulted with younger brother on the issue of WAEC and that consultation bore fruits. I give you my own parting shot. It is that time again to consult with your younger brother. I will give you a running mate that you will enjoy working with. But this time the consultation I promises you will not be for free,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the book was not just about him but also a tribute to everyone that has helped him get to where he is today particularly Tinubu.",

          "title": "More troubles for households as landlords hike rents further",
          "text": "Landlords in major cities in Nigeria are increasing house rents, even as many households are grappling with surging food prices as well as the rise in transportation and energy costs.\n\nIn the last six months, the rental market has seen many landlords and tenants engage in hot arguments over rent increases. Many tenants have started adjusting to their new rents while those that have just been served notice of increases are pondering on the next move to make.\n\nIn Lagos, the rental market has seen about a 30 percent increase across the board while tenants in serviced apartments are groaning under the weight of both rents and service charges.\n\nThe households caught in this web are mostly those whose rents expired in May and June and are, therefore, due for renewal. Those whose rents will expire later in the year still have their fate hanging in the balance.\n\nHenry Emenike is a tenant living in a three-bedroom flat in Oke-Afa, a Lagos suburb where he has been paying N450,000 per annum. His rent is expiring by the end of this June and just last Wednesday, his landlord served him a notice of rent increase to N650,000 per annum.\n\n\u201cIt all looked vague to me; I thought the man was just joking but he was not. Since it was his caretaker that served me the notice, I decided to call the man to find out if he knew about the increase. His answer was in the affirmative. Now, what do I do to pay this and still be able to feed my family?\u201d Emenike said.\n\nBusinessDay findings reveal that across Lagos and especially in the suburbs, landlords are increasing house rents in the name of rising costs to levels that have left many tenants worried.\n\nIn Ijesha, Surulere, rent for a one-bedroom self-contained has moved from N200,000 per annum to between N300,000 and N350,000 per annum, depending on the age of the building. A two-bedroom flat now goes for between N400,000 and N500,000 per annum, also depending on the age of the house.\n\nOn Lagos Island, rents are relatively more stable and that, according to Godwin Essien, an estate manager, is because tenants are mostly on longer lease while some rents are dollar-denominated.\n\n\u201cThis does not, however, mean that rents don\u2019t increase here. They do, but not as frequent and uncontrolled as what you get on the Mainland, mostly in the suburban areas where landlords are kings,\u201d Essien said.\n\nIn Ibadan, rents have also gone up considerably and, according to Osunyomi Adetiba, who lives in a three-bedroom apartment in the Orita Challenge area of the city, his rent, beginning from July this year, will be N500,000, up from N350,000 per annum.\n\n\u201cThis is a house I rented first at N120,000. The increase had been gradual but came with this steep increase just this year. My landlord says cost of maintenance has gone up because cost of building materials has also gone up,\u201d Adetiba lamented while responding to questions from BusinessDay.\n\nAccording to him, depending on whether it\u2019s a new house or not, its proximity to a major road and the kind of neighbourhood it has, a two-bedroom flat goes for between N300,000 and N400,000 per annum.\n\nRead also: You are responsible for loss or damage in the building you occupy \u2013 not your landlord\n\nThe story from Onitsha, the commercial nerve centre of Anambra State, is not any different or better. From the N220,000 he paid last year, Chijama Udaya told BusinessDay that his current rent is now N350,000 per annum for a three-bedroom flat that is not even in the centre of the city.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what landlords want. Everybody is lamenting. It is everywhere and this is coming at this time when the cost of everything has gone up. When will things get better in this country,\u201d he wondered, hoping that Nigerians would get it right when choosing their next leaders.\n\nIn a country where the rental market is very active, it means that a good percentage of the population is affected by this jolting development. Records show that about 80 percent of Nigeria\u2019s estimated 200 million population live in rented apartments.\n\nThe record also estimates that these renters spend 50 percent of their incomes on house rents.\n\nThese same people are the ones hardest hit by the soaring prices of foodstuff, diesel, cooking gas, and transportation. From N600, the price of a small paint bucket (painter) has moved up to N1,200 in just six months. 5kg of Semovita is now N3,500, up from N2,000 in December 2021.\n\nFrom between N300 and N350, the price of one litre of diesel has soared to N750,000. The story is worse for cooking gas. When the price of kerosene became unaffordable for many households, everybody switched to gas as a cheaper and cleaner energy.\n\nThe price of gas, which was about N370-N400/kg in December 2021, is now N850/kg.",

          "title": "Surge in voter registration catches INEC off-guard",
          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) did not see it coming. Although it had planned for continuous voter registration (CVR) as part of its activities towards a successful 2023 general election, the Commission, perhaps, did not envisage the surge in the number of people willing to participate in the exercise.\n\nUsually, the umpire organises such an exercise to accommodate those who are clocking the voting age of 18 years; makes provisions for those who have relocated and would want to transfer their voting centres and those who for one reason or the other have lost their voters\u2019 cards and need to be issued with new ones.\n\nThe INEC draw up budgets for these exercises and allocate the funds based on materials, personnel needed and according to the duration of the exercises. Whenever such exercises go beyond the time allotted, the umpire runs the risk of seeking additional funding, which may not come handy.\n\nThe INEC began the CVR last year June, but many Nigerians did not show interest until a few months ago, which has not only mounted a serious pressure on the men and materials deployed by the Commission, but has also resulted in all manner of allegations against some officers of the agency as well as against some politicians and political parties.\n\nIn the last one month in particular, Nigeria seems to have witnessed increased citizens\u2019 interest in the political process never equaled since the return of the country to civil rule 23 years ago, in relation to their willingness to take part in the next round of national election next year. Moreover, the upsurge in the number of citizens desiring to take part in the CVR exercise seems to be proving that.\n\nOur correspondents across the country, who visited some registration centres, report that the citizens are going through intense stress, while the INEC officers seem to be overwhelmed by the crowd they confront with on a dailybasis.\n\nAlthough it has been difficult to pin down to any particular reason for the upsurge in youths\u2019 participation, some of those who spoke with our correspondents said it was a sign of political awakening and that the youth were determined to take back their country.\n\nThe citizens, who are showing interest in the voting process, many of them for the first time since 1999, said they would want to change the leadership narrative in the country.\n\nThey also strongly believe that, unlike before, their votes would count in 2023, as they had determined to cast their votes and defend such votes despite intimidation and any form of rigging.\n\nAlthough the INEC appears overwhelmed, it has shown no sign of extending the date for the closing of the exercise which is June 30. It has explained that an extension would mean that the PVCs would not be printed and delivered to their owners before the commencement of the elections.\n\nHowever, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, INEC chairman, recently said: \u201cWith every registration, there has always been a clamour for extension towards the end. The Commission will always listen to what Nigerians want and facilitate it to make sure that as many Nigerians as possible register and collect their PVC.\u201d\n\nHowever, to respond to the cries of Nigerians in some parts of the country on the need to lessen the stress of registration occasioned by unavailability of machines and personnel, INEC has since deployed some machines to some critical places.\n\nWe hereby present the goings-on in some registration centres as captured by our correspondents in some parts of the country.\n\nPort Harcourt\n\nI must get my PVC this time no matter the antics of INEC \u2013 Benedict\n\nObinna Benedict studied in Benue State from his primary school to the University, and thus belongs to many social platforms to which most vibrant young persons from the Middle Belt belong. Also, as an easterner and one that works in Rivers State and as an evangelist, he also belongs to many platforms for young elite and people from the South-South and South-East.\n\nBenedict had always shown total apathy to issues of elections and politics generally, coming from an angry generation and as someone that is totally disillusioned by perceived corruption, ineptitude, and dishonesty in government and the public sector.\n\nNow, however, he seems totally galvanised by the prospect of one or two presidential candidates, just as he was in 2019 when Obiagali Ezekwesili and Kingsley Moghalu showed up for the presidency and seemed to dazzle most young people on television with their economic models for better governance.\n\nBenedict has become active on social media, mobilising other young people to go register and get their voters\u2019 cards so as to cast a vote to the man the youth seem to be having a frenzy for. Most of the youth in the many platforms he belongs to are said to be admonishing one another to go beyond social campaigns and go get a permanent Voter\u2019s Card (PVC).\n\nSo, Monday last week, according to a source close to him, he went to a centre in Port Harcourt to register, only to meet a large crowd.\n\nThe source said over 90 percent of those who came to obtain a PVC were young people who said they were first-timers.\n\nThe source said the youth at the INEC centre, who endured the scorching sun till 2pm, grudgingly dispersed when they could not see any official to attend to them; they accused the officials of having some sinister motives.\n\nWhat seemed surprising, according to the source, was that the youth seemed very angry with any young person who showed tiredness or eagerness to quit. They admonished each other to remain determined to get a PVC.\n\nThe source said the youth also agreed that during the elections, nothing must deter them. \u201cEven if they like, let them shoot from morning till night, we must make sure we cast our vote and we must defend our votes. Our votes must count,\u201d one of them was quoted as saying.\n\nAt every turn, it was gathered that the youth chanted the name of their new-found political idol to boost their morale.\n\nOther sources said the young people, unlike before, seem to know every bit of what is going on in politics in recent times. They seem to read a lot from social media these days and this seems to have created wildfires of political awareness.\n\nWhen our correspondent went round the Rivers State capital, it was found that young people have massed at venues advertised by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). This seems to be a national phenomenon.\n\nMost churches and socio-cultural organisations have also caught the fire. They now urge their members to strive to obtain their PVCs. This too has created more frenzy.\n\nReacting to the upsurge, Geraldine Ekelemu, INEC Rivers State Public Affairs officer, told BusinessDay Friday evening that the Commission has reacted to the situation.\n\nShe said eight more machines had come in and that the mobile centre system has been adopted to take the service to all parts of the state. She however said the Commission was not working on Sundays as requested by some churches.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the State Resident Electoral Commissioner, Obo Effanga, the PRO said the INEC was sure to attend to almost all those coming to their centres.\n\nThe next day, Saturday, June 18, 2022, the PRO issued an alert saying; \u201cINEC Rivers State has received the PVCs for transfers, updates, lost and defaced requests made between June 2021 and December 2021. Those who fall under the above categories should kindly visit the INEC LGA offices where they want to vote in to collect their PVCs from Monday June 20th.\u201d\n\nMost persons interviewed by our correspondent in Port Harcourt said they would go on Monday, to endeavour to either collect their PVCs or to register.\n\nBenin\n\n\u2018We want to vote\u2019 \u2013 Benin residents cry out\n\nIt was as if vigil was scheduled for the month of June. Middle-aged men, women as well as young adults come in droves, surround the \u201cbeautiful gates\u201d, hoping to gain entrance to the small but enticing electoral buildings and access the key card that may unlock a rebirth for a seemingly ailing nation and eventually give a new lease of life for its citizens, but it appears that they may be hitting a brick wall.\n\nAnguish, despair were written all over their faces as they patiently stood, lost valuable man-hours in the process and devoted their precious time to the cause of registering for a voting permit, the Permanent Voter\u2019s Card (PVC), so as to perform their civic duties in 2023.\n\nThe undaunted prospective voters defied the week-long torrential rain, trooped out and besieged the different Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) centres across Edo State at the dawn of each day to register for the PVC.\n\nIn the past few weeks, the interests of the citizenry, particularly the youths, have started to gather momentum and it has shown that they are a force to be reckoned with owing to the recent activities that have cropped up in the political space ahead of the general election scheduled to hold next year.\n\nThe recent sudden turnout of Nigerians at the different INEC centres, according to political observers, has been linked to perceived failure by successive governments and it is now occasioned by a wave of sensitisation drive.\n\nHowever, some pundits said the rush by eligible voters to registration centres may be prompted by the looming June 30 deadline and the surging popularity of their respective candidates.\n\nFor a 63-year-old grandmother, who preferred anonymity, \u201cThe PVC registration process has been stressful. I was here yesterday and I met only one INEC official who said he can\u2019t do the job alone. He asked me to come today, and I am here but they said I should come back again the following day. It is tiring,\u201d she frowned.\n\n\u201cI am here to do transfer of my PVC. I have filled the form online and I have been coming to present the form but they keep on telling me to come again.\n\n\u201cThis crowd showed that the youths have woken up from their slumber. I am a mother and grandmother, and I have to buy the future of my children. So, I will stay put till I successfully do it,\u201d she said.\n\nTolu Adeyemi, a middle-aged mother, who strapped her six-month-old baby to her back, while waiting at the electoral office in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State, said: \u201cIt\u2019s like a routine, people come here, they send them back and repeat it the following day.\n\n\u201cI spoke to my friend in Lagos and she told me the process wasn\u2019t so difficult. So, I came to do my own this morning and they are making it difficult. The INEC officials said they do not have forms that they distributed over 100 forms the previous day and they need to process those ones first before they can attend to those of us that came today. I am confused,\u201d Adeyemi told our correspondent in Benin.\n\nFelix Ogochukwu, a 28-year-old prospective registrant, said: \u201cI was here yesterday and the officials told me they are done. Today, I have been here since 7am and it seems the crowd has overwhelmed them. We were told they are using the names of persons that came the previous day and, until they are done, they will not look into today\u2019s list.\n\n\u201cWe want to vote. So, we, the youths have resolved that this is our time to make sure our votes count. We are here to withstand any pressure to ensure our candidate, the person we want to restore Nigeria and revive the country\u2019s dwindling economy, emerge.\u201d\n\nAnthony Ikogwe, a Benin-based engineer, who has spent more than three days trying to transfer his Permanent Voter\u2019s Card (PVC) to his new location so he can perform his civic duty without being inhibited by distance, said: \u201cThis is discouraging, and it may prevent people from registering; if such happens, this may disenfranchise them from the next elections.\u201d\n\nThe depressed 54-year-old man further said: \u201cI am here this morning to do a transfer of my voter\u2019s card to my current place of residence. We have been here since 7am, and you can see everywhere is crowded.\n\n\u201cWe understand that they only have one machine used for capturing. It is quite disheartening that, with this level of the number of persons outside the premises that want to do registration, transfer or collect their PVCs, INEC has not provided manpower to attend to this huge number.\n\n\u201cThis is my third time coming for this exercise. Some persons have been coming for the past four days and they are yet to achieve the process. I have been to different centres and same thing is happening in those places. They have just one machine to attend to more than 500 persons.\n\n\u201cI just hope that INEC should improve on this whole process. There is no way many people can successfully do this exercise before the end of June 30. I hope INEC will hearken to the yearnings of the masses and appeal by the House of Representatives to extend it with 60 days,\u201d Ikogwe said.\n\nHe further said that the crowd across the different registration centres was triggered by Nigeria\u2019s existential challenges which have further pushed the citizens to the wall, adding that Nigerians are now left with no option but to stand up and speak with their voters\u2019 cards.\n\n\u201cI think the crowd is more this time because people now see the importance of voting. A lot of people in the past think votes do not count but with the current happenings in the country, they believe it will count this time around and need to cast their votes en masse.\n\n\u201cThere is awareness now. The youth, in the past, have discovered that in one way or the other, they have compromised in the part of supporting people into elective positions. This time around most of the youths, who have not been voting, feel they need to cast their votes for the person they know will carry the country forward,\u201d he said.\n\nCorroborating, Osagie Orobator, a Benin resident, said the recent upsurge of people showing interest in obtaining the PVC simply means there is a renewed confidence among Nigerians that their votes will count this time around.\n\n\u201cWhat you are seeing is a reawakening. Nigerians just realised that they can effect the change that is needed in this country and that is why you are seeing the crowd. With this, INEC might be forced to extend the deadline because there are still some states that have eligible voters and were not thinking of registering.\n\n\u201cBefore now, many people think their votes will not count, but presently, with what INEC is doing and the interest people are showing, I think, this time around, they will realise their votes will count,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough there has been several clamour for INEC to extend the registration exercise following the marked increase in the number of persons who want to register, the electoral body is yet to bow to the pressure of extending the exercise. Instead more INEC Voter Enrollment Devices (IVEDs) were deployed to areas of largest potential registrants.\n\nPeeved by the vigorous exercise of PVC registration, John Otabor, an eligible voter, advocated for extension of time to allow more people register so that they can vote, adding that If the electoral body can extend the date for presidential primaries, then nothing should stop the Commission from applying same rules to give more windows of opportunity to the citizenry.\n\nMahmood Yakubu, chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), while recently speaking at an event, hinted of possible extension of the June 30 Continuous Voters Registration (CVR) deadline.\n\n\u201cWith every registration, there has always been that clamor for extension towards the end. The commission will always listen to what Nigerians want and facilitate it to make sure that as many Nigerians as possible register and collect their PVCs to be able to vote. So, we are watching the trend. Be rest assured, we will be positive when the time comes,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nDetermined to increase the number of registered voters and improve participation of citizens in the forthcoming election, a coalition of youths and student bodies in Edo State said it would mobilise 10,000 residents in the state to register for their PVCs and collect them.\n\nSpeaking at a rally in Benin City, Osawe Uwagboe, Speaker, Edo State Youth Parliament and convener of the \u201cMassive March For 10,000 PVC registration, said \u201cWe have understood that over time, youths are making all sorts of statements that the PVCs and their votes are not needed and do not count and we are here today to tell the youths that their votes count and that Nigerians should come out en mass come 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nIlorin\n\nAllegations of bribery, corruption fill the air\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s Correspondent visited the INEC head office in Ilorin, Kwara State and discovered that many people; especially youth are yet to get their PVCs.\n\nPeople in their hundreds were on queue at the main gate and inside a hall within the premises, and it was observed the officials of the agency were busy attending to the people on different purposes.\n\nA female officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, managed to disclose that they were confronted with the challenge of many people on ground and unable to satisfy them at once.\n\n\u201cWe are only registering people today. As you can see, they are many and we are trying our best to ensure that they all get done what they are here for. Nigerians don\u2019t do things early but they will be rushing when a programme is about to close,\u201d the officer said.\n\nSome of the citizens who spoke to BusinessDay lamented slow pace of service, discrimination and lack of care for people to register.\n\nOne of those who spoke with our correspondent, who gave his name as Michael Adeniran, said: \u201cI have been here since morning and till now I don\u2019t know my fate. Security agencies at the gate are collecting money before they allow people in. We are inside now but the service is very poor. Some people have gone because of how the situation is. They just have to improve on it.\u201d\n\nAnother respondent who pleaded anonymity equally complained that, \u201cWe have been delayed. Some people who just came have done their registration and gone; may be, they know officers here. The situation is not impressive at all. Nigeria itself is not working well; so, it applies to all aspects of our lives- bribery and corruption everywhere.\u201d\n\nBinta James, a female, who wanted to register for the first time said: \u201cThe network is okay. Within five minutes you are done but the workers are for eye service. I am 18 years old and I want to get the card for me to be able to vote in the coming election.\u201d\n\nAnother female explained that she needed a replacement (PVC) because she lost the first one issued to her. She also complained and advised that the agency should step up strategies in serving people so as not to get them frustrated.\n\nDelta\n\n\u2018We go through hell to register for PVC\u2019\n\nThe process of registering and collecting of the Permanent Voters Card (PVCs) by citizens in Delta State is seen to be hellish as people now leave their homes at 1:00 am in order to be recorded among those to be attended for the day.\n\nThis is just as some of them lodge in nearby hotels to enable them stroll to INEC office early in the morning so they could be captured among those to be attended to.\n\nBusinessDay learned that the Regis Anukwojivoterregistration exercise starts by 9:00 daily and sometimes later than that, yet even before 7am, there is huge crowd at INEC offices most of whom are spill over registration centres from the previous day as well as the current day.\n\nWhen our Correspondent visited INEC office located around South Local Government council headquarters, on Friday, citizens mainly youths, crowded the front gate as they were eagerly waiting for their turns to enter and get registered or apply for transfer of their PVCs to their present polling units.\n\n\u201cI am from Ebonyi. I have my PVC but all I want is to have my centre/unit transferred to Asaba so I can vote here since I\u2019m now on transfer to Asaba,\u201d said one respondent who simply identified himself as Moses.\n\nHe however, lamented that it hasn\u2019t been easy as he was yet to be attended to despite coming to INEC office for days while his job suffered.\n\nHe accused INEC officials of receiving bribe from the buoyant and influential persons and attending to them fast while those who couldn\u2019t buy their way out, are left unattended to. \u201cPeople pay as much as N5,000 because they see the exercise as game of highest bidder,\u201d he alleged.\n\nAnpther citizen, who said he had spent three days and had to change tactics by lodging in a hotel near to INEC office in Oshimili South headquarters, said: \u201cThat was how I was able to fall into the number of those that registered on Friday, June 17,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bigger challenge is that there are only two machines being used for the registration at the centre.\n\nThe INEC official, who addressed the people, disclosed that \u201cthere are four registration centres within this cluster, including Okpanam, Ibuzo, Oshimili South headquarters and another centre, all having two machines each. It\u2019s unlike places like Lagos State where you have more number of machines at every centre.\u201d\n\nA citizen, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been used to voting during general election but I\u2019m here to transfer my PVCs to my current unit, and effect correction on my date of birth. I believe that the crowd is overwhelming INEC on daily basis. Some people have gone home because they can\u2019t continue to wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here because PVCs is one of the requirements for me to be given job in Anambra State,\u201d another said.\n\nPatience, a business in woman, lamented that the process has been slow as only one machine was working out of the two that were deployed to the centre.\n\n\u201cYesterday, I was here as at 5am and was number 8 on the list. Under the rain, we were still queued up, yet we\u2019re tear-gassed by a security agent. Thank God nobody died,\u201d she said.\n\nPeculiar, a member of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), said she has been at the INEC office for five days and yet was unsure if she would be successful with her registration as at Friday due to obvious challenges.\n\n\u201cI need my PVC so I can vote for a candidate of my choice for a better Nigeria devoid of bad leadership.\n\n\u201cThey (operating officers) are very slow and incompetent. There should be more machines at INEC registration centres. The electoral umpire should engage more youths as personnel rather than using all these old men,\u201d she said.\n\nUgonna Benjamin who said he had registered twice since year 2009 without receiving voter\u2019s card, disclosed that this is the third time he was attempting to register yet couldn\u2019t make it as a result of the crowd.\n\n\u201cMy anger is on how they are frustrating us here (in the South-South and South-East). In the north, you will be in your house they bring voter\u2019s card for you but here, they left only two machines at each centre of which only one is working.\n\n\u201cI want to choose my leader, so I need my PVC. Enough of this frustration!\u201d he cried out.\n\nMercy Ehikhametalo, assistant engineer at the INEC Delta State headquarters, located in Okpanam, admitted that they have been overwhelmed but explained that it was as a result of the late registration population turn out, who are mostly youths.\n\nShe also said that there would not be extension of registration as being clamoured, adding that even if the registration is extended, the card would be of no use because the card owner cannot collect it since elections are done with time table.\n\nShe also admitted that the machines being deployed for the registration exercise were inadequate, adding that the crowd recorded as a result of late registration has been huge compared to the number they have been used to since January.\n\n\u201cYou can see it yourself. We suppose to officially close office 3pm daily but because these youths would persist, the office is open even till 5pm. Only the entrance gate is closed after 3pm while we continue to attend to those who are already inside the registration hall,\u201d Ehikhametalo said.\n\nLagos\n\n\u2018I am determined to wait and get the card\u2019\n\nIn Alimosho Local Government Area (LGA) of Lagos State, the Electoral Officer of the council who spoke to BusinessDay said they were trying their best to cope with the large number of Nigerians who are besieging the various centres in the council to register and get their Permanent Voter\u2019s Cards (PVCs).\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), official, however, said they discovered that some of the intending voters were doing double registration, while often failing to disclose to them that they had registered elsewhere but had lost their cards.\n\nHe revealed that only 10 machines were available in the council and had been shared to the various registration points in the council.\n\nAccording to him, we are doing our best here to register people; we register them with the time they come here. We are trying to register everybody, if they can wait. We don\u2019t leave here till 8-pm.\n\n\u201cA lot of them have done it before; we discovered some of them are doing double registration; we often detect that in the Abuja office, when they want to produce the card.\n\n\u201cIn this council we have 10 machines, we shared them across the registration points in the communities, but we have been promised two more machines next week.\n\n\u201cBut I think, the more machines we have, the more possibility of double registration in the process.\n\nSpeaking on his experience at the centre, an intending voter, Chima Ike, lamented the bottleneck involved in the registering process, advising INEC to make available more machines and create more polling units in the council.\n\n\u201cThere are some things the government is supposed to correct, this registration should be something you just walk in and get it done. How can somebody register twice, they should check.\n\n\u201cI am here to transfer to my new address, but I have been here since 8 am, no hope. I was given number 92, but they are not following the number,\u201d Chima said.\n\nSimilarly, another intending voter, Nfon Okon, said she was determined to wait and finished the process despite the rigorous process and large crowd in the centre.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cI came here last week and could not do it, because of the crowd, I left with my husband. But we came back this morning; some people have left out of frustration.\n\n\u201cWe are tired. If this thing is going on like this, we may not register. I came here this morning, they said we should wait, that they want to get another machine\u201d.\n\nSimilarly, at another registration centre around Iyana Ipaja within the council, a crowd of people were seen arguing with security officials about some people who were given preferential treatment after they arrived at the registration centre.\n\nSeveral of the people advised INEC to create more registration centres in the community to end the suffering of people.\n\n\u201cI am determined to wait and get the card,\u201d Bunmi Ola, a student, said.\n\nRead also: INEC\u2019s shifting goalposts and political disenfranchisement in Nigeria\n\nEnugu\n\nEnugu REC moves additional 20 machines\n\nAbout 46 percent of registered voters during this continuous voter registration exercise in the last three quarters in Enugu state are double registration which will not count.\n\nThe Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Enugu, Emeka Ononamadu, stated this when the Nigeria Union of Journalists Enugu state council led by its Chairman Sam Udekwe paid him a courtesy visit.\n\nOnonamadu said it was because a lot of people who registered before came back and registered again hoping that the old one is no longer in use without cross-checking with the INEC voter machine.\n\nHe said that the surge at the Okpala square was as a result of misinformation where many residents believe that it was the only place for registration within the area.\n\nREC used the opportunity to advise people to take advantage of other registration centers including the INEC office, he also asked people to first check the status of their voter card by visiting their website before going to register a new card,\n\n\u201cit is regrettable that about 46 percent of registered voters during this continuous voter registration exercise in the last three quarters in Enugu state are double registration which will not count.\n\nHe said that once you have registered before from 2010 and 2011, you can\u2019t register again unless where one has issues with his card that the machine cannot read it or you moved from one location to the other and wants a transfer, replacement or data change.\n\nFresh registration is mainly for young ones that are just 18 years or those that have never registered before. He said that those who are doubting the status of their cards to go to their website www.cvrinecnigeria.com to verify.\n\nResponding to the call by the NUJ chairman to extend the date of the CVR looking at the number of people that came out to register and the challenge they are facing, the REC said that the commission had been getting pressures to extend the CVR, but quickly added that such decision would be determined by the headquarters of INEC.\n\nHe, however, said that extension of the exercise would have huge financial implications.\n\n\u201cThe commission has been getting pressure to extend but that date might be sacrosanct due to the time to produce and distribute the PVCs,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Ononamadu, INEC office in Enugu has moved 20 additional machines to the field with a view to capturing all the people including those at Okpala square,",

This factory needs 480 tonnes of cassava per day and there are about 5,000 hectares of land to grow. Already 1,500 have been grown; 350 people from neighboring communities will work here on the feedstock alone. The 480 tonnes per day will be converted to waste for feedstock for the piggery.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Governor Obaseki said \u201cThis project is very significant and important as it is a project where almost a 100 percent of raw materials needed are sourced locally and 100 percent of the outputs are feedstock to other companies and industries, particularly in the food and beverages sector, whether it\u2019s ethanol or carbon dioxide.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the company is a beneficiary of the state\u2019s tax credit scheme which has influenced the construction of a 3km road in Ologbo, Ikpoba Okha Local Government of the state.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt\u2019s a very innovative finance method; the first to be used by a state government in Nigeria. The federal government does tax credit for big, large corporate organizations but here, we, as a state, have been able to attract an investor and used his tax credit to enhance infrastructural development in the state. We are lucky in the state because we have an investor and partner like Saro Africa who believes in Africa, Nigeria, and in our state. These projects were conceptualized about five years ago but construction could not commence until last year due to various challenges.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

He said the street is always flooded every raining season leaving some residents with no choice than to seek shelter with their relatives elsewhere until the rainy season is over.\n\nAccording to Okonedo, \u201cWe have written several letter to the state government through the Commissioner for Works and all to no avail. All they keep telling us for the past seven years is that they will soon start work on the road.\n\nMadam Eseoghene , resident of Sokoh Estate Road,in Uwvie Local Government Area of the state lamented the deplorable condition of the road,saying\n\n\u201d This road has been like this for more than 4years. Two days ago ,it was God that saved my daughter,she was returning from work , around 9pm, you see that bad portion near the filling station, you must slow down before passing there, robbers were operating and she didn\u2019t know until she got do close .She quickly jumped out of her car and ran away.\n\n\u201cThis road is not only spoiling our cars, worst still, putting our lives at risk\u201d. She lamented.\n\nMr Francis Onos ,an Uber driver,while complaining bitterly about the road said, \u201d one would have expected the government to maintain road because ,this is a major road linking Jakpa road to Airport Road, if not for this community boys that help to patch the big potholes with broken blocks,the road would have long been abandoned\u201d. Okowa should do something!\u201d He enthused.\n\nAnother residents said, ,\u201dFor those of us who live and have stores here, we cannot do any business during this rainy season because the whole street is flooded. I am a tailor and I have my store here but because of the bad road customers no longer come because the whole place is flooded,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother resident, Mr Kiesena Omoyibo who lives at 22 Ginuwa Road in Warri said that they have been experiencing flood in the street for over eight years, adding that on several occasions the flood entered their houses whenever it rains.\n\nHe said, \u201cthis road has been like this for so many years and government have refused to come and fix it for us. We have to fold our trousers and pull our shoes in our hands anytime we are going out and coming in.\n\n\u201cOkowa should please come to our aide because we are suffering. People call Okowa the Road Master but we are not feeling the impact of that name in this street. He should come and fix this road for us before he leaves office so that we can say he has done something for us,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral roads in the oil-rich city including the Effurun Roundabout, Sokoh Estate, First Marine Gate, Etuwewe, Uti among many others are in very bad shape and residents are calling on the state government under the leadership of Senator Ifeanyi Okowa to come to their aid.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "BY NSE ANTHONY-UKO, Abuja\n\nThe group managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mallam Mele Kyari has attributed the LEADERSHIP Award to the teamwork of the management and staff of the company, noting that the recognition would not have been possible without the collective efforts of all NNPC staffers.\n\nHe spoke yesterday when he received the award letter, presented to him by the editor-in-chief, LEADERSHIP Group Ltd, Mr Azu Ishiekwene, who led other management staff on a courtesy visit to the NNPC Towers.\n\nKyari emerged LEADERSHIP CEO of The Year2021 for his strategic intervention in turning the NNPC into a profit-making national oil company and driving the present administration\u2019s gas revolution among other innovations.\n\nAn elated Kyari said, \u201cIt is really a privilege to be recognised by LEADERSHIP as \u2018CEO Of The Year\u2019. To me, CEO means chief education officer, if you cannot educate you shouldn\u2019t be a CEO, and you can\u2019t execute if you don\u2019t have people to work with you.?\n\nHe described NNPC as the largest enterprise in the country, saying it hosts the brightest of people that can be found in the oil industry.\n\nHe said, \u201cThey (multinational oil companies) know that we have better-skilled people in NNPC than they do. They know that we have better capacity than they do.\n\n\u201cWe are very proud of this and any recognition anyone has here is to all of us. It would not have been possible without the collective efforts of all of us. And I congratulate our team for the recognition and we\u2019ll continue to execute in a critical manner, particularly in an area where we can get our economy supported by making sure that energy is available to all Nigerians in an affordable and sustainable manner so that prosperity can be generated in a bigger way and ultimately many of the indices that you have seen around including lack of security and peace would be minimised.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the gesture and the consideration and on behalf of all of us here, we thank you most immensely.\u201d\n\nKyari said the overall plan is to make NNPC operate as a multi-trillion naira company, the most capitalised company in the country, having the highest assets of any company in Africa and be the biggest company in Africa.\n\nHe admitted that the NNPC has had its constraints which were being addressed through the Petroleum Industry Act.\n\n\u201cIt simply means that this is the company that will compete with anyone else in any manner possible as allowed by the law, and we will do better than any other company. More than that we have a responsibility to be accountable to our shareholders, the over 200 million Nigerians and that is why we are doing very many strange things that companies don\u2019t do. One of them is that we are the only company that publishes its activities on monthly basis, it\u2019s not done anywhere in the world. We have challenged many companies to come out and do the same and no one can do this.\n\n\u201cSecondly, against all odds that you may think, we dared and published our audited financial statements and with the team spirit that we have, we were able to cut our costs and shape our business and we came out with positive numbers subsequently.\n\n\u201cWe are now publishing all the PMS evacuation from the depots. Every litre of product that has left the depot, we publish it and those that are available. Anyone can cross check it. We are also moving down to the level of the states, we will know for each state which area and which filling station it goes to and whether or not it was sold in the filling station. We have full data around every litre of product that comes into the country.\n\n\u201cNext, we are trying to refine so that we\u2019ll have refined product data. We can also tell Nigerians, what this subsidy conversation means and put numbers around it and publish for Nigerians to see\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the Editor-in-Chief of LEADERSHIP, Mr Azu Ishiekwene told the NNPC Management that the award was in recognition of Kyari\u2019s modest efforts in repositioning the NNPC and putting it on the path to profitability.\n\nMr Ishiekwene was accompanied on the visit by the group managing director, LEADERSHIP Group Ltd, Muazu Elazeh and director, LEADERSHIP Group Ltd, Mr Abraham Nda-Isaiah.\n\nThe formal presentation of the award and conference is scheduled to be held on 17th May, 2022 at the International Conference Centre.",

          "text": "Property mogul and Group Managing Director/CEO, Master Reality International Concepts Limited, Lai Omotola has threatened to sue Lagos State Attorney-General (AG) and Commissioner for Justice, Moyosore Onigbanjo for calling him a fugitive.\n\nOmotola had recently accused Onigbanjo of using forged police document to file criminal charge against him in court and tendered a document from the Inspector General of Police where it was stated that the document used in filing criminal charge against him at the High Court of Lagos was forged.\n\nOnigbanjo fired back, saying Omotola lied and that he is a fugitive running away from the law.\n\n\u201cThe allegations by Mr. Lai Omotola are therefore refuted and unfounded. Furthermore, by his actions, Mr. Lai Omotola is now a fugitive and anyone who has information about his whereabouts should inform the nearest Police station so that he can be arrested and brought before the court,\u201d he had said in a statement.\n\nHowever, Omotola\u2019s counsel, Lukman Imam in a letter to Onigbanjo, warned that the AG had seven days to retract the fugitive statement or face legal action.\n\n\u201cFinally, it is disheartening you referred (Onigbanjo) to our client as a fugitive when your office is not that of a law enforcement agency or the Minister of Interior. The office of the Hon. Attorney General is to prosecute, not to persecute.\n\n\u201cYour describing our client publicly as a fugitive has extensively damaged his image, destroyed his reputation and negatively affected his corporate image as a business executive.\n\n\u201cTake notice that unless you withdraw the offensive word and publicly apologise to our client within 7 work days of receiving this letter, we shall follow our client\u2019s instruction to institute a civil suit against you to redeem his image and business reputation,\u201d the letter said.\n\nAccording to the letter, contrary to misleading assertion in \u201cyour said response, it is an incontrovertible and well established fact that our client\u2019s purported signature on a statement allegedly made by him at Zone 2 Police Command, Onikan, Lagos was forged as confirmed by the Forensic Science Laboratory, Alagbon, Lagos.\n\n\u201cIt is also an unchallengeable fact that the said purported statement is part of the proof of evidence with which you filed the aforesaid suit against our client. The aforesaid forensic report was brought to your attention vide our letter dated 8th July, 2021.\n\n\u201cTherefore, our client\u2019s statement that your office filed charges against him with forged documents is not out of place. It is the hard truth. Our client was the Complainant at Zone 2 Police Command, Onikan, Lagos. How a Complainant suddenly metamorphosized into an Accused Person with forged statement and without a petition against him at the said Zone 2 continues to remain a mystery.\n\n\u201cContrary to mendacious allegations in your said response that our client in 2020 forcefully dispossessed one Mrs. Olabisi Olatokunbo of the piece of land, the subject matter of the purported charge, the same Mrs. Olabisi Olatokunbo in Suit No: ID/5319LMW/2017 (filed by her and pending before Hon. Justice Adebiyi of Ikeja\n\nHigh Court) has stated on oath that her predecessors in title actually dispossessed her of the land as far back as 2017.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, contrary to assertion in your said response that there was a petition against our client at Zone 2, Onikan, Lagos which gave rise to the charges filed against him by your office, reports of investigation (as contained in a letter dated 4th April, 2022 addressed to your office by the office of the Inspector General of Police) have revealed and categorically stated that no such petition against our client was submitted, not to talk of being approved, let alone being treated or investigated by the office of AIG Zone 2, Onikan, Lagos.\u201d\n\nThe letter added that contrary to the AG\u2019s claims that the DPP received a duplicate file of the case from Zone 2 for legal advice, investigations by the office of AIG Zone 2, Onikan, Lagos and those of AIG Force CID Annex, Alagbon, Lagos and the Inspector General of Police had revealed that no official letter was written not to talk of being forwarded by the office of AIG, Zone 2 to your office or that of DPP asking for any legal advice.\n\n\u201cWe hereby challenge the office of DPP to produce such letter and furnish us with a copy of same,\u201d it added.",

The former Deputy Senate President of Nigeria was recently appointed a visiting professor of Corporate and International Linkages by the British school.\n\n\u201cVisiting professors are often, as is in this case, non-resident at the university, unpaid and advisory,\u201d a Lincoln University spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned about the nature of these allegations, but as this is an active police investigation, we cannot comment further at this stage.\n\n\u201cWhilst this matter is subject to investigation, this person will not be undertaking any duties as visiting professor at Lincoln.\u201d\n\nDavid claimed he did not know he was in the United Kingdom to donate a kidney until he went for a hospital appointment with the Ekweremadus. A doctor at the Royal Free Hospital in Camden, London, was concerned that David might not be aware he was a kidney donor. The doctor also doubted that the minor was 21 as his passport claimed.\n\nWhile appearing in court on Thursday, the senator and his wife, who is a medical doctor, however, denied trafficking David to the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cThe victim was 15. In Nigeria, he was approached by both defendants. He was homeless on the streets of Lagos. They deceived him and promised him a better life in the UK. He was given a passport for a 41-year-old. The passport was illegally obtained by these defendants,\u201d Damla Ayas, the prosecutor, told the court during the couple\u2019s first hearing.\n\n\u201cHe was provided with a medical travel visa saying the purpose of the travel was to provide medical treatment for the defendants\u2019 daughter who was undergoing dialysis about several health issues.\n\n\u201cIt was premeditated; it was planned. Blood tests were obtained in Nigeria and he traveled to the UK in February this year.\n\n\u201cHe was taken to several medical appointments, in particular, a medical appointment at the Royal Free Hospital, and was spoken to by a consultant about the organ harvesting for a kidney transplant.\n\n\u201cThe consultant was concerned about his actual age and was concerned he was not aware he was the donor of the kidney. He only found out that the purpose of his visit was for an organ transplant when he visited the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe Ekweremadus was arrested at Heathrow Airport as they attempted to board a plane to Turkey.\n\nDavid is now under the care of safeguarding authorities and the Metropolitan Police.\n\nFresh twist\n\nDavid\u2019s (the young man who was to donate a kidney to Sonia , daughter of Senator Ekweremadu) passport has emerged, indicating that he is 21 years old.\n\nAccording to information on the data page of Nwamini\u2019s international passport, which Ekweremadu provided in an introductory letter in the medical visa application submitted to the British High Commission in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital, he was born on October 12, 2000.\n\nThe date of issuance of the passport is indicated as November 4, 2021 while his date of birth is October 12, 2000. This puts the age of the passport holder in question at 21.\n\nBut under British law, being above 18 is not enough to be an organ donor, as the question of consent is another burden the Ekweremadus will have to discharge.\n\nYet, questions would remain with respect to whether the birth date on the passport is indeed his real age.",

It is the political parties themselves that has been given the locus to submit this particular list and in this case, there is no personal interference between the commission and the political parties.\n\n\u201cWe open the portal \u2014 what we called \u2018candidate nomination portal\u2019 \u2014 and we give an access code to the national chairman of each of the political parties that conducted primaries with which they upload the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates.\n\n\u201cSo, if a political party has uploaded the list and personal particulars of a candidate that did not emerge from valid party primary, INEC is not under a constitutional and legal obligation to publish the particulars of such a candidate.\u201d\n\nThe INEC spokesperson added that a candidate who was validly nominated at a primary, but whose name was excluded by the party, can seek redress from a competent court.\n\nHe also said the list published on Friday is not the final document for the 2023 polls, adding that the final list will be published at a later date.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nExperts at a One-Day Interactive Workshop on Effective Customer Service Delivery for Tourism and Hospitality Professionals organized by the FCT Chapter of the Institute for Tourism Professionals of Nigeria, ITPN, have asserted the obvious fact that an effective service delivery in the sector was dependent on the quality of practitioners and their professional competence.\n\nIn the paper titled \u2018Effective Customer Service Delivery for Tourism and Hospitality Professionals\u2019 presented at the occasion, Alhaji Abdulmalik Hassan, an advocate for quality service, stated that excellent customer service delivered in the appropriate way, is a prerequisite for effective and efficient business management that guarantees customer satisfaction, patronage and retention.\n\nHassan said service delivery in the tourism and hospitality industry deserves much more than it has because, due to lapses in the manner and way personnel and staff of individual tourism and hospitality organizations conduct themselves with customers, they end up losing customer patronage and running down their businesses, noting that we take for granted the way the gateman and receptionist welcome guests, and that once the guest does not receive an amiable reception from the on-set at the entry point, the organization losses the ability to command customer satisfaction let alone retain customer patronage.\n\nIn his submission, the tourism expert advocated for more attention on training and equipping lower cadre staff with the necessary skills to deliver better customer service than the current trends in which most organizations spend huge resources training their top executives.\n\nAnother facilitator at the occasion, Capt. Emmanuel LordsGreat who delivered a paper on \u2018Re-Inventing Customer Experience for Tourism and Hospitality Industry\u2019 posited that businesses have changed from manufacturing dependence to providing timely and quality service, and that due to increase in technology and globalization, there has been a dramatic change in customer behaviour which service providers must understand and come to terms with.\n\nLordsGreat stressed that Customers are increasingly becoming aware of the need to get value for their money and will frown at poor quality service delivery from mediocre organizations. This therefore meant that hospitality and tourism organizations must work on customer satisfaction and retention efforts which were key to keeping them from running away.\n\n\u201d What drive customers away is rude and discourteous behaviour, inept, and incompetence dispositions of staff during service delivery,\u201d he added.\n\nHe alluded that knowing the obvious fact that customers are the most important people to an organization, and also that organizations depend on customers not the other way round and are in fact the lifeblood of an organization, taking measures to serve them to the best of their satisfaction was fundamental and should not be compromised.\n\nAlso the Director General of the National Institute for Hospitality and Tourism, Nura Sani Kangiwa, who was the special Guest of Honour at the occasion, represented by Dr. Taiwo Famogbiyele, Director, General Studies, Research and Development, delivered the keynote address in which he affirmed that the success of harnessing the country\u2019s tourism potentials through effective service delivery was highly dependent on the quality of professionals and practitioners in the sector, noting that there was urgent need for adequate sensitization in terms of education and impacting of relevant training and skills to the personnel and drivers of the industry such as the one organized by the FCT Chapter of the Institute for Tourism Professionals of Nigeria, ITPN.\n\nEarlier in her welcome address, convener of the workshop and Chairman of the FCT Chapter of ITPN, Dr. Mrs. Ebikaboere Seimodei said a flourishing tourism industry can only be achieved via quality service delivery which the country stands to benefit from its economic values such as generating income, providing job opportunities, ensuring foreign exchange earnings, increase in internally generated revenue via taxation and the attendant multiplier effects on other sectors of the economy, and when service delivery was poor, the result will be dwindling fortunes in the industry and low economic value to the national economy.\n\nSeimodei then called on practitioners in the industry to support efforts of the FCT Chapter of ITPN in capacity development for enhanced service delivery, particularly in this age of increased technological skills and changing visitor/consumer preferences as well as meet the expectations of tourists in conformity with global best practices.\n\nOther guests who gave goodwill messages at the occasion includes Chief Abiodun Odusanwo, National President of ITPN; Mrs. Susan Akporiaye, President of the National Association of Nigerian Travel Agents, NANTA and Barr. Funmi Kazeem, Hotel Owners Forum of Abuja, HOFA; who praised efforts of the FCT Chapter of ITPN by bringing to the front burner the issue of training and re-training of practitioners in the industry for better and quality service delivery by professionals in the sector.\n\nCertificates were later presented to participants at the workshop as testimony of attendance and acquisition of the requisite knowledge and skills in the ethics of customer service delivery as professionals in the travel tourism and hospitality industry.",

The ex-Lagos Governor also heaped praises on the Speaker for his contributions to his political ambition of becoming Nigeria\u2019s President and democracy, while extolling the virtues of his Deputy, Hon Idris Wase, for being a dependable ally.\n\nREAD ALSO: APC Ticket: When I Was Almost Fed Up, I Resorted To Prayers \u2013 Tinubu\n\n\u201cI could see a Deputy (Wase) sitting down there too, you are very good symbols of unity, dependability, and honesty, thank you. Thank you for both of you, you\u2019ve not rocked the boat. I will need to learn from both of you, how you made the pair work because I\u2019m still searching for my running mate,\u201d Tinubu said.\n\n\u201cWhat you did during my primary (APC presidential election) is a story for another day.

And no amount of parliamentary maneuvers or differences between parties would deviate him from this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe introduced the term legislative diplomacy. When there were issues between Nigerian and Ghanaian traders, he went to Accra and met with his colleagues and tried to resolve the issue.\n\n\u201cMr President is very proud of the fact that he did not need to interfere in how the National Assembly runs because he had trust in the capacity in the leadership of the Senate and House of Representatives and therefore he feels that with capable hands in both chambers of the NASS there is no need to interfere.\n\n\u201cIt is also a fact that under the Speaker and leader of the Senate, there is no automatic opposition and antagonism to the executive. The role of the legislature is not to be antagonistic as a matter of routine, but to be partners for good governance for the people of Nigeria.

          "text": "Russian missiles struck the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Sunday, a day after a key eastern city fell to pro-Russian forces in a major set-back for Ukraine and as world leaders gathered in Europe to discuss further sanctions against Moscow.\n\nUp to four explosions rang out in central Kyiv in the early hours, in the first such attack on the city in weeks. Two more blasts were heard on the southern outskirts of the city later in the day, a Reuters reporter said.\n\n\u201cThe Russians hit Kyiv again. Missiles damaged an apartment building and a kindergarten,\u201d said Andriy Yermak, head of the president\u2019s administration.\n\nUkraine\u2019s police chief, Ihor Klymenko, said on national television that five people had been wounded.\n\nAs Europe\u2019s biggest land conflict since World War Two entered its fifth month the Western alliance supporting Kyiv was starting to show signs of strain as leaders fret about the growing economic cost, including surging food and energy prices.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson, speaking as Group of Seven leaders gathered for a summit in Germany, said the West needed to maintain a united front against Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cIn order to protect that unity, in order to make it work, you\u2019ve got to have really, really honest discussions about the implications of what\u2019s going on, the pressures that individual friends and partners are feeling,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cBut the price of backing down, the price of allowing Putin to succeed, to hack off huge parts of Ukraine, to continue with his programme of conquest, that price will be far, far higher.\u201d\n\nLife had been returning to normal in Kyiv after fierce resistance held off Russian advances in the early phase of the war, although air raid sirens regularly sound across the city.\n\nThere had been no major strikes on Kyiv since June.\n\nThe city\u2019s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on the Telegram messaging app that Sunday\u2019s strike had partially destroyed a nine-storey apartment building and caused a fire.\n\n\u201cThere are people under the rubble,\u201d Klitschko said. \u201cThey have pulled out a seven-year-old girl. She is alive. Now they\u2019re trying to rescue her mother.\u201d\n\nExplosions were also heard on Sunday in the central city of Cherkasy, which has been largely untouched by bombardment so far, regional governor Oleksandr Skichko said on Telegram.\n\nRussia denies targeting civilians, but Ukraine and the West accuse Russian forces of war crimes in a conflict that has killed thousands, sent millions fleeing the Ukraine and destroyed cities.\n\nThe strategic eastern battlefield city of Sievierodonetsk fell to pro-Russian forces on Saturday after Ukrainian troops retreated, saying there was no longer anything to defend in the ruined city after months of fierce fighting.\n\nThe fall of Sievierodonetsk is a major defeat for Kyiv as it seeks to keep control of the eastern Donbas region, a key military objective for the Kremlin.\n\nMoscow says the Donbas\u2019 Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, where it has backed uprisings since 2014, are independent countries. It demands Ukraine cede the entire territory of the two provinces to separatist administrations.\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what the Kremlin calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to ensure Russian security and denazify the Ukraine. Kyiv and the West say the invasion was nothing more than a land grab.\n\nThe war has had a huge impact on the global economy and European security, driving up gas, oil and food prices, pushing the European Union to reduce reliance on Russian energy and prompting Finland and Sweden to seek NATO membership.\n\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo said he would urge his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts to start a dialogue during a peace-building mission to the warring countries and would ask Putin to order an immediate ceasefire.\n\n\u201cWar has to be stopped and global food supply chains need to be reactivated,\u201d Jokowi, as the president is popularly known, said before leaving to attend the G7 summit.\n\nThe United Nations has warned that a protracted war in Ukraine, one of the world\u2019s major grain exporters, threatens to cause a global hunger crisis.\n\nSeeking to further tighten the screws on Russia, G7 countries announced an import ban on new gold from Russia as they started their summit in the Bavarian Alps.\n\nNATO leaders will hold a June 29-30 summit in Madrid.\n\nThe fall of Sievierodonetsk \u2013 once home to more than 100,000 people but now a wasteland \u2013 transforms the battlefield in the east after weeks in which Moscow\u2019s huge advantage in firepower had yielded only slow gains.\n\nRussia\u2019s Interfax news agency cited a representative of pro-Russian separatist fighters saying Russian and pro-Russian forces had also entered Lysychansk across the river.\n\nThe two cities were the last major cities held by Ukrainian forces in the east.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed in a video address on Saturday that Ukraine would win back the cities it lost, including Sievierodonetsk.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a sense of how long it will last, how many more blows, losses and efforts will be needed before we see victory is on the horizon,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the Ukrainian-held Donbas town of Pokrovsk, Elena, an elderly woman from Lysychansk in a wheelchair, was among dozens of evacuees who arrived by bus from frontline areas.\n\n\u201cLysychansk, it was a horror, the last week. Yesterday we could not take it any more,\u201d she said. \u201cI already told my husband if I die, please bury me behind the house.\u201d\n\nReuters",

          "text": "Former Director-General of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), Julie Okah-Donli, has stated that a former President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu and his wife, Beatrice should have obtained a clearance certificate from the agency before travelling to the United Kingdom with a kidney donor.\n\nOkah-Donli, who is also the Chairperson of the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in Persons (UNVTF), also revealed that most cases of organ harvesting in the country \u201care often treated as ritual murder by law enforcement agencies that lack the institutional capacity to handle such cases.\u201d\n\nShe clarified on Saturday during an interview on ARISE NEWS, while also lamenting the rate at which body organs of Nigerians \u201care stolen in India and most countries in the Middle East when they go for procedures.\u201d\n\nThe London Metropolitan Police had arrested Ekweremadu and his wife, Beatrice at Heathrow Airport, over an allegation of bringing a minor to the UK for organ harvesting.\n\nThe police had claimed that the investigation was launched after detectives were alerted to potential offences under the Modern Slavery Act, 2015 aimed at preventing hidden labour exploitation, payment for work-finding services and harvest of human organs, among others.\n\nConsequent to this, Ekweremadu and his wife were arraigned before the Uxbridge Magistrates\u2019 Court which denied them bail, ordered their detention and deferred the case till July 7 for a hearing.\n\nFaulting Ekweremadu for not observing the laws regulating all forms of organ donation, Okah-Donli explained the basic requirements all citizens should fulfil under the Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition) Enforcement and Administration Act, 2015 before travelling out of the country with kidney donors.\n\nShe said: \u201cIn a case like this, there is a regulation in place. NAPTIP ought to have issued them a clearance certificate to travel out of the country. However, it looks like NAPTIP was not even aware of it.\n\n\u201cUnder the legislation, NAPTIP has the right to issue a clearance certificate to any person who is going for anything relating to organ donation. Ekweremadu ought to have gone to NAPTIP to get a clearance certificate.\u201d\n\nDuring the process of issuing a clearance certificate, Okah-Donli explained that NAPTIP would have exhaustively interacted with the would-be donor before a clearance certificate would be issued to that effect.\n\nShe added that if the case had been reported, NAPTIP would have been able to investigate the case further with \u201ca view to finding out whether the donor is an adult or a minor, whether the donor understands the consequence of what he is going for or not.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, all these things did not happen. The Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) will only issue passports based on the information they are given. They are not going to look for information that they are not given.\n\n\u201cIf they say the boy in question is 50, the NIS will write 50 on the passport. But NAPTIP will have investigated in-depth, spoken to the donor and issued a clearance certificate before travelling out of the country. Unfortunately, the case was not brought to the attention of NAPTIP.\u201d\n\nThe former NAPTIP boss, therefore, lamented that the case of organ harvesting \u201cis really bad in Nigeria. It is huge across the federation but we have not paid attention to it. We have such cases in which people were found with their organs ripped out all over the federation.\u201d\n\nShe added that the authorities were quick to tag it ritual murder, noting that organ harvesting \u201chas been going on for so many years undetected.\n\n\u201cNAPTIP has the mandate to curb organ harvesting. Unfortunately, we have other law enforcement agencies that want to deal with it. But those agencies do not have the capacity to deal with it. They do not have the training.\n\n\u201cThese issues are not even referred to NAPTIP for proper investigation. We have that bottleneck in this area not allowing the appropriate agency to deal with the issue of organ harvesting. This is a very specialised area. Rushing to the conclusion that it is ritual murder will not help.\n\n\u201cEven in countries like India, they actually steal your organs. You go there for a procedure. By the time you go back, they have removed another organ. Stealing organs is something that has been going on in the Middle East,\u201d she explained.",
