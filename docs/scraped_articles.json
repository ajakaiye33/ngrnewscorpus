Questions Commission\u2019s capacity to handle future elections\n\nBy Chris Ochayi, ABUJA\n\nThe Coalition of United Political Parties, CUPP, has expressed concerns over the failure of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to conduct a hitch-free, off-season gubernatorial election in Anambra State.\n\nChairman, Media Committee of CUPP, Barrister Chukwudi Ezeobika, who made the remarks, while reacting to INEC\u2019s decision to declare inconclusive the Saturday/Sunday governorship elections in Anambra State via a statement issued in Abuja, questioned the capacity of the Commission to handle future elections.\n\nThe CUPP noted that the massive and fundamental failure of BVAS machines deployed by INEC has clearly shown that the Commission lacks the capacity and or competence to conduct future elections in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cHaving commenced preparations for this election for over a year, it is indeed worrisome that many indigenes of Anambra State who turned out en masse to vote on Saturday, could not exercise their franchise due to gross incompetence on the part of INEC and its Staff.\n\n\u201cHaving extended the scheduled election to a future date, the cost implications of such extension on Security agencies and Stakeholders especially political parties, cannot be overemphasized and currently hangs on a balance.\n\n\u201cThe inability of INEC to organize and conduct a single gubernatorial election in one out of the 36 States of the federation calls for serious concerns and clearly confirms that the Independent National Electoral Commission (as currently constituted) lacks the capacity and or competence to conduct future elections in Nigeria.\n\nThis ineptitude on the part of Frof. Mahmood Yakubu led INEC has furthermore, exposed a disturbing level of lack of sincerity and trust in the Chairman of INEC despite several assurances from him, of a credible election in Anambra State.\n\n\u201cDeclaring the election as inconclusive has once more echoed our protracted concerns and calls for the removal of Prof. Yakubu Mahmood as the Chairman of the Commission as he remains grossly incompetent and uniquely unqualified to conduct future elections in Nigeria and or continue as the Chairman of INEC.\n\n\u201cHis continued disobedience to subsisting Orders and Judgments of Courts of competent jurisdictions shows Prof. Mahmood Yakubu\u2019s disdain and disregard for the Rule of Law as he is in contempt of the Court of Appeal Judgment which ordered the Commission to relist 22 political parties.\n\n\u201cThe effect of this wrongful exclusion of some political parties by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu and his disobedience to subsisting Court of Appeal Judgement has dealt a huge blow to and voided the entire exercise in Anambra State.\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing, we call for the resignation of Prof. Mahmood Yakubu as the Chairman of INEC as he no longer commands the respect attaching to such office and further demand a thorough investigation into the huge sums budgeted for the Anambra State gubernatorial election which has brought so much shame and embarrassment to Ndi Anambra in particular and the Nation at large.",

          "text": "Students\n\nDeputy Provost, Academics, Federal College of Fisheries and Marine Technology (FCFMT), Lagos, Mrs Aderonke Adebola has urged teachers, lecturers and parents, to set eyes on the students around to know when they are passing through depression and quickly attend to them.\n\nAccording to her, depression among students has led to many youths committing suicide over trivial issues that could easily be resolved if urgently attended to by teachers or parents.\n\nThe Deputy Provost Academic gave this charge while addressing students at the orientation organised for students of 2020/2021 academics session, held on the institution\u2019s campus, Victoria Island, Lagos.\n\nREAD ALSO:Liberation Set: Chief Olusegun Osoba, other classmates celebrate 60 years of graduation school\n\nAdebola who represented the Provost, Dr Onuoha, P.C. at the event said: \u201dThese days, you heard of students committing suicide, some because they failed, some because they could not meet up with whatever goals they have set for themselves.\n\n\u201dI believe strongly that a lot of these happened because our country has become individualistic. \u201dThe Nigeria we grow up in was a communal environment., such that if your parents were not available, there are other people that serve as parents that noticed what we were passing through.\n\nIf you as parents do not notice depression in your children, someone out there would draw your attention to it.\u201d\n\nFor example, a child that should normally greet you now walked past without greeting, in those days, someone will alert the parents. But in today\u2019s Nigeria, the story has changed. We are now individualistic.\n\n\u201dWe have the plan to have a professional come in to talk to our lecturers and student to arrest the trend of depression that often lead to suicide among our students.\n\n\u201dLecturers are pivotal to helping the depressed students because they are the people students see and relate to face to face. If the student is passing through depression while on campus, the lecturers will know if they are observant.\u201d\n\n\u201dTo the students passing through depression, she urged them to share their problems with the lecturers, adding that, a problem shared is half solved.\n\nAdebola said: \u201dOnce the burden of the student with depression is lifted, the mind of the student will be able to think about other options instead of suicide. We encourage students to speak out while going through a challenge.\n\n\u201dFor example, during the last session, a student of age 20 came to my office and I looked at him and discovered a different mood in him because I know him to be always active in class.\n\n\u201dI asked him what his problem was but he said nothing. So I sat him down and chatted with him for quite a while and he eventually told me that he was just coming from the clinic where they told him that his Blood Pressure (BP) was high. (200 plus). I said, how old are you? He said 20. I told him to go back to the clinic and tell them I said, they should keep him under observation until he\u2019s normalised.\n\n\u201dTwo weeks after when I called him, he disclosed his challenges, there we started working together as I keep looking for him to talk to.\n\n\u201dIf care was not taken, such a person could probably be working somewhere to get something and anything could have happened. \u201dTill he graduated, he became quite closed to me and he was free to walk up to my office to share his challenges.\n\n\u201dIf students can speak out the situation will be arrested and the chances of the student going into depression will become slim.\u201d\n\nShe further urged the students to know the reasons they are in school and focus on those reasons.\n\n\u201dWe pride ourselves here on holistic education. It is not all about classroom teaching, we want our students to go and learn in and out of the classroom.\n\n\u201dEducation is beyond academics or literacy, we want them to be exposed such that when they graduate, they would be good entrepreneurs, visioners and above all patriotic Nigerians. The student should focus and set a vision for himself. Plan towards it because magic won\u2019t happen, you have to study towards success, \u201d Adebola said.",

          "text": "*Launches \u2018I am alive\u201d software for S\u2019South\n\nBy Chioma Onuegbu, Uyo\n\nTHE Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate, PTAD, has reiterated its commitment towards ensuring that the welfare of its pensioners was sustained.\n\nExecutive Secretary of PTAD, Dr. Chioma Ejikeme, stated this weekend in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State capital, during a two-day Stakeholders Forum and the launch of, \u201cI am Alive\u201d Confirmation Solution, organised for South South geo-political zone.\n\nEjikeme explained that the online application\n\ndesigned to enable PTAD pensioners easily confirm their aliveness from the comfort of their homes or neighbourhood using either smartphone or a computer system.\n\nShe listed other steps so far taken by the Directorate to ensure the welfare of its pensioners was sustained to include Mop-up verification across all geo-political zones conducted for pensioners that missed the field verification exercise previously due to one reason or another.\n\nHer words: \u201cDespite the lockdown in 2020, PTAD continued to pay monthly pensions promptly, resolve compaints, and even cleared accrued arrears, death benefits to some Next-Of- Kin and one-off payments of some defunct agencies such as the Nigerian Aviation Handling Company (NAHCO), Ex-workers of Aluminum Smelter Company of Nigeria (ALSCON) and some pensioners of NITEL/MTEL.\n\n\u201cWe are consequently in collaboration with some of our stakeholders including the National Health Insurance Scheme, the National Senior Citizens Center and the Federal Ministry of Health, to see how making health insurance available to our pensioners can be a reality.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to prioritise the welfare of our pensioners, and we call on all the Pension Unions under the Defined Benefit Sheme, and other stakeholders for their support in achieving this feat. Today we have just launched \u201cI am Alive\u201d Confirmation Solution.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea behind this scheme is that we want to ensure it is going to give us accurate result, and convenience. Most importantly, we want to be sure that it is going to be user friendly for our senior citizens. This is an experiment, and 50,000 pensioners are on this pilot phase that we are using to conduct this experiment\u201d\n\nShe assured that the pilot phase of \u201cI am Alive\u201d which had already been launched for the North central would also be done in the Southeast, Southwest, Northeast, and North West zones, adding that on successful implementation of the pilot, PTAD would deploy the software on a full scale for all verified pensioners on the payroll.\n\nShe however, noted that Pensioners don\u2019t require their Bank BVN, ATM Card or Pin for the confirmation process, stressing that they require only Pension number, found on verification slip given to them by PTAD and the account number with which they receive pension from PTAD.\n\nPresenting his goodwill message at the two-day Stakeholders Forum, chairman House of Representatives committee on Pensions, Rt. hon. Alhassan Rumrum thanked PTAD leadership for introducing laudable initiatives into the country\u2019s Pension administration .\n\nRumrum who was represented by the deputy Chairman House committee on pensions, hon. Bamidele Salam, stressed that it was a gladdening experience for Nigeria to be moving further in the introduction of technology to various aspects of national life, especially one that has to do with the senior citizens.\n\n\u201cIt gives us joy that the country is making progress in the area of Pension. I commend the leadership of PTAD for especially leveraging on technology to make sure that we are globally competitive in our pension administration\u201d, He stressed.\n\nResponding to a question from newsmen on what the House committee was doing to also assist to address pension issues at the state level, he said they would appeal to state government to see the need to replicate the innovations put in place by federal agencies into their pension management system.\n\nOne of the pensioners, Mr. Chukwudi Adolphus from Delta State while responding to the introduction of the online application simply said, \u201cI am Alive\u201d Confirmation solution, I think is one of the best things that PTAD has done for us. The project is very easy, you do it without any stress. I thank PTAD for this initiative\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Awwal Gambo appeared before the committee to defend its 2022 budget.\n\nHe stated that the committee had observed the spillover of projects as against agreed timeframes, including some that spanned beyond three years, without any sign of completion.\n\nGagdi said that such projects were neither handed over to the Nigerian Navy nor was there any work in progress by the contractors.\n\n\u201cHenceforth, the National Assembly will not hesitate to call to order any government agency, and in this case the Nigerian Navy, where it fails to check any erring contractors\u201d, he added.\n\nHe said that those contractors, whose stock in trade was to waste taxpayers\u2019 monies by taking for granted the delivery of public goods and services within a time frame and quality of job, would not be spared.\n\nThe chairman also stated that, where necessary and in line with what the committee saw on the ground, it would certainly recommend an increased budgetary allocation to the Nigerian Navy.\n\nHe said that this was against the noted enormous problems of the Nigerian Navy, adding that there was a need for open and legal recommendations for doors and more windows.\n\nGambo called for more equipment for the Nigerian Navy, adding that although the Federal Government had boosted the morale of the Nigerian Navy with more platforms, more were, however, needed.\n\nHe said that the Nigerian Navy had expanded its sphere of influence by rising against internal security challenges, with operational efficiency, huge material, and personnel cost for maintaining barracks.\n\nHe listed the priority projects for 2022 appropriation to include fleet renewal, capital development, personnel welfare, among others.\n\nGambo stated that the initial total budget proposal for 2022 was N220.236billion, but that the Ministry of Finance reduced it to N25.8billion, which is equivalent to only 11 percent of the Navy\u2019s needs, NAN reports.",

          "text": "The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has vowed to continue its practice of remitting its operating surpluses to government, saying that the remittances were in line with global best practice, Dr Fabian Benjamin, Head, Public Affairs of JAMB has said.\n\nIn a statement to newsmen in Abuja, on Monday, Benjamin said that the board would continue its practice of remitting the constitutionally-mandated proportion of its operational surpluses, in line with extant government\u2019s directive on the remittances.\n\nAccording to him, it is a known fact that all unutilised funds by Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) should be returned to the public treasury.\n\nHe said that the board and public-spirited Nigerians were, therefore, at a loss as to the reasons for the various campaigns of calumny mounted by some individuals who feel that these remittances should not be made.\n\n\u201cThe board reiterates that it is not within the powers of MDAs to determine the uses for which the remitted funds are put to.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cTheirs is to comply with extant directive while those given the mandate to manage the national treasury have the responsibility of appropriating and channelling such remittances.\n\n\u201c This is in the overall interest of the public, to identify areas of need or rather whichever area of the national economy that they perceive to be in most need of resources,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201c It would be recalled that the humongous remittances are the first in the history of the four-decade-old agency.\n\n\u201cThe first landmark remittance was made in 2017 and the feat was repeated in subsequent years, in line with its belief that rules are made to be obeyed and, at any rate\n\n\u201cIt might interest these armchair critics that a direct fallout of the remittances was the decision of the Federal Government to reduce the cost of the purchase of the e-pin from N5,000 to N3,500, the cheapest globally.\n\n\u201c It is a truism in policy making that certain trends should be observed over a period of time before policy pronouncements are made.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the decision to reduce the price of application documents was contingent upon the observation that even if the price were to be slashed, the board would be able to conduct its examination unhindered.\n\n\u201cIn addition, it might also interest the public to know that never in the history of tertiary institutions in Nigeria have the institutions benefited from the Board\u2019s operations as they now do.\n\n\u201cFor instance, a huge chunk of these surpluses are ploughed back to the tertiary institutions through the National Tertiary Admissions Performance Merit Award and other platforms.\n\n\u201c Furthermore, many critical segments of the society, the intellectual community, the civil society groups, among others, have all been included in the management of the Board\u2019s operational processes not only to add value to its service delivery but also to make for inclusiveness.\n\n\u201cAll these, which were hitherto impossible, had been made possible as a result of the prudent management of resources which has enabled the Board to prosecute these aspirations,\u201d he added .\n\nHe maintained that the cost of obtaining the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination( UTME) or the Direct Entry (DE) e-pin today is the lowest globally, saying that the comparison was not even with developed countries but rather with countries with less per capital income than Nigeria.\n\nBenjamin added that the low cost of obtaining the board\u2019s application documents would be manifest if a comparison was made with similar examinations like IELTS where Nigerians pay as high as N80,000 to enrol.\n\nThe public affairs manager said that the present management of the board was determined to continue on the path of giving value for money, even as it continued to seek ways of further pruning down the cost of conducting the Board\u2019s flagship examination.\n\nHe said once these innovative measures which had led to these surpluses were institutionalised, the Board would further look at how to enhance the registration process to benefit the candidates and the general public.\n\n\u201c In as much as the Board is desirous of charging rock-bottom prices for its services, it is also mindful of the fact that a non-existent fee regime would only give room for abuses and confusion.\n\n\u201c This is as unscrupulous or other unserious elements, who had ulterior motives for obtaining the forms, would want to obtain them to explore opportunities for prosecuting unacceptable acts.\n\n\u201cAs an illustration, the huge number of candidates registering for the examination multiple times before the introduction of NIN was partly owing to the fact that it costs them almost nothing, financial or punitive, to register many times.\u201d Benjamin said.\n\nHe, therefore, urged the citizens to be mindful of lightweights parading as educational experts who are hell-bent on propagating falsehood to further their miscellaneous ends.

PDP and YPP won Ogbaru and Nnewi North respectively while election did not hold in Orumba North and Ihiala LGAs according to their collation officers.\n\nMeanwhile, a little drama played out during the declaration of the collated results of the election at the INEC headquarters in Awka, as the collation officer for Orumba North, Dr. Michael Otu alleged that he signed result of election under duress. He accused the Electoral Officer, Comfort Omoringe, who he worked with of playing double standards. He said he chose to announce the cancellation of the entire result because the entire process was not transparent.\n\nBut Omoringe dismissed the allegations as untrue. She, however, said collation officer had no idea of what his job entailed.\n\n\u201cHe does not know the difference between conducting election and collating election. How could I have carried 253 units to my office to be conducting election? It never happened.\u201d\n\nShe added that she escaped death by the whiskers as the police shot at her twice. She explained that the bullets did not hit her as they passed by her sides, miraculously.\n\nThe state collation officer, Prof. Florence Obi, vice chancellor of the University of Calabar, however, ordered that the Orumba North result should be reviewed by all concerned so that the result could be announced.\n\nMeanwhile, the APC has rejected the outcome of the election, demanding for its cancellation.\n\nChairman of the party in the state, Chief Basil Ejidike, in a statement, said: \u201cWhat is happening in Anambra is never an election but big time electoral fraud and malpractice. We want the whole world to hear our voice that we will never accept the outcome of the Anambra gubernatorial election.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile three civil society organisations (CSOs) have urged Nigerians to continue to support the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in its use of technology for elections.\n\nThe CSOs that monitored the election in Anambra gave the advice against the backdrop of the challenges witnessed in state\u2019s governorship election on Saturday.\n\nThey stated this in a joint statement issued in Abuja, yesterday, and signed by the Executive Director, Adopt A Goal, Dare Atoye; Chief Executive Officer of YSAD, Obinna Nwagbara; and the Executive Director, EaglePost, Dodoh Okafor.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the glitches recorded in the use of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) by INEC in the just concluded Anambra governorship poll, there was no alternative to the use of technology in elections,\u201d they said.\n\nThe organisations expressed optimism that the teething challenges could be overcome in future as Nigeria prepares for the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cAs partners on electoral governance, we note with great displeasure that despite weeks of preparations and commitments in terms of human and financial resources, the BVAS did not yield the optimal outcome leading to the extension of voting in several places and the disenfranchisement of others.\n\n\u201cWhile we insist that INEC ought to have sorted out these knotty issues before Saturday\u2019s election, our team would like to keep hope alive by believing that these teething challenges can be overcome as we prepare for the general election in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe would like to encourage Nigerians to support INEC to overcome these challenges as we work to move away from the old, fraudulent system of voting and recruiting leaders.\n\n\u201cWhile we concede to the people the right to be exasperated by what happened in several polling units today, we would caution against throwing away the baby with the bath water.\n\n\u201cElectronic accreditation and transmission of results are the way to go if we are to restore hope in our elections.\n\n\u201cWe must never move away from these critical objectives because of the challenges witnessed in the Anambra Decides 2021,\u201d the CSOs said.\n\nThe CSOs said they expect INEC, after Anambra election, to sit down with its IT and operational teams and other stakeholders to study the whole events of the election and find out what needs to be fixed to get things right ahead of the general election in 2023.\n\nThey also advised INEC to institutionalise the training and retraining of poll workers/volunteers and have them pooled in its reserves nationwide.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Soludo in Apparent Victory in Anambra Poll, Election to Hold in Ihiala Tomorrow",
          "text": "Nseobong Okon-Ekong, Chuks Okocha, Onyebuchi Ezigbo and David-Chyddy Eleke\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has declared Anambra election inconclusive, following the failure of the exercise to hold in Ihiala Local Government Area.\n\nThis followed the inability of the commission to deploy staff and materials to Ihiala, as a result of security threat.\n\nReturning officer in the election, Prof. Florence Obi, has however said the Ihiala election would now hold tomorrow, Tuesday, November 9, to complement the 20 local government areas election results, already announced.\n\nObi said, \u201cWe have collated results for 20 local government areas, and Ihiala is still outstanding as the commission was unable to deploy to the area.\n\n\u201cBased on constitutional provision, supplementary election will be held in Ihiala. So, we have to conclude the election in Ihiala to be able to conclude the process.\n\n\u201cI plead with you to support INEC, so we can bring this election to a conclusion, to the glory of God. The election for Ihiala will hold on November 9.\u201d\n\nBut the candidate of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Professor Chukwuma Soludo, has apparently already surpassed the constitutional threshold for him to be declared winner of Anambra election after winning 18 out of the 21 local government areas in the state.\n\nEven though his victory dance has been delayed by technicality, which forced INEC to declare the vote inconclusive, Soludo appears destined for Government House, Akwa with a comfortable lead well ahead of his closest rival, in distant second place.\n\nAlthough Soludo\u2019s lead is statistically unassailable, yet it is mathematically possible to catch him but extremely unlikely in the circumstance, looking at the turnout of voters statewide, put at 20 percent.\n\nNonetheless, a civil society coalition, the Situation Room, which monitored the election, said except for the malfunctioning of the Bi-Modal Verification Accreditation System (BVAS) and late commencement of voting in many areas, the governorship election was peaceful and without much rancour.\n\nIn a similar vein, the National Chairman of APGA, Chief Victor Oye, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the outcome of the election, saying his fatherly disposition provided the ground for a free, fair and credible exercise.\n\nWith 18 council areas in the bag for APGA, only Nnewi North Local Government Area for Ifeanyi Ubah\u2019s Young Progressive Party (YPP), and Ogbaru Local Government Area for Valentine Ozigbo\u2019s Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Soludo led his closest challenger, Ozigbo, with about 45,000 votes.\n\nBut, Ihiala alone, where voting was suspended, had over 148,000 registered voters.\n\nEarlier last night, collation officers for Ihiala and Orumba North had alleged at the INEC collation centre that elections did not hold in some places due to violence, while the other said he was forced to sign a result sheet.\n\nSpecifically, the collation officer for Ihiala said the election was marred by violence, while his counterpart in Orumba North, Dr. Michael Out, produced a signed result sheet collated by him, but claimed he signed it under duress. He said some political thugs, with the connivance of an electoral officer that was supposed to work with him, had forced him to sign the result sheet.\n\n\u201cI signed the result, but I do not believe in it because I did it under duress. I was tear-gassed, and my life was threatened,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the electoral officer denied the claim, forcing INEC to take a break to review the situation in the two local governments.\n\nWhile decision on Orumba was quick and conceded to Soludo, it was not the same with Ihiala.\n\nWhen INEC officials returned from their break, Chairman of Academic Staff Union of University, University of Calabar, Dr. Othong, who was appointed to look into the Orumba case, said, \u201cAfter looking at the matter, we saw no evidence of use of BVAS, we also discovered police crisis in the local government at the local government collation centre, and also, heavy mutilation of the result sheet.\n\n\u201cCommittee resolved to call for the BVAS machine used in the area, but that was not achievable as the BVAS were said not to be readily available.\u201d\n\nThe committee, after a long time, however, resolved the matter and read out the result as follows: PDP, 1847; APC, 2672 and APGA, 4787, making it the 18th local government won by APGA.\n\nBut with Ihiala still pending, many believed it was unlikely that INEC would disenfranchise more than 148,000 voters in the critical local government area and go ahead to declare a winner in the election.\n\nThat was why the commission declared the election inconclusive to enable it hold supplementary election in Ihiala, and also other polling units, where elections did not hold or were marred by incidences.\n\nHowever, with the results so far released, Soludo has secured the mandatory two-thirds majority votes and spread across the local governments in the state and might be coasting home to victory.\n\nThe former CBN governor, who experienced glitches from the new INEC Bi-modal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS) device before he could cast his vote at his Isuofia homestead in Aguata Local Government Area, triumphed over Uba and Ozigbo, who were also from Aguata.\n\nWhile Soludo polled 9,136 votes in the local government area, Uba came second with 4,773 votes, while Ozigbo had3,798 votes.\n\nAPGA\u2019s imminent victory is coming against strong odds, including the recent defection of the deputy governor, Dr. Nkem Okeke, six members of the Anambra State House of Assembly, and some members of the National Assembly, including numerous other stakeholders of the party.\n\nResults so far announced also showed that the three leading candidates, as profiled by popular opinion polls, turned out truly in the lead, running neck and neck in some of the local government areas.\n\nThough APGA, PDP and APC remained predominant winners in most areas, a few other political parties were able to put up a good fight, like the YPP, which overwhelmingly won Nnewi North Local government Area. There were others like the Zenith Labour Party, which performed well in some parts of the state, as well as the Accord Party.\n\nThe candidate of Accord Party, Dr. Godwin Maduka, however lost his local government area, Orumba South, to APGA. The Las Vegas, US-based medical doctor and foremost pain doctor, scored a mere 779 votes in his local government, which had 74,690 registered voters and 10,554 accredited voters.\n\nHe was also defeated by the other leading political parties in the race. Despite being very popular in his local government, APGA scored 4,394 to win the local government, and was followed by APC with 2,060, and PDP with 1,672 votes.\n\nIn Anaocha Local Government Area, APGA defeated PDP, the party of former governor, Mr Peter Obi, and Senator Uche Ekwunife, who is the senator for Anambra Central. Both are from Anaocha Local Government Area.\n\nA former National Chairman of APGA, Senator Victor Umeh, also hails from the local government area.\n\nMeanwhile, the Civil Society Situation Room, has hailed the general conduct of the election, describing it as peaceful.\n\nConvener of the group, Mrs. Ene Obi, who briefed journalists, said, \u201cThe election was generally peaceful. This was against the background of potential violence rhetoric leading up to the election, even though there were pockets of disturbances.\n\n\u201cOn a general note, citizens came out to vote, contrary to the initial apprehension that trailed the beginning of the electioneering process. Even though there were not large crowds of voters, it was still a relief to see citizens come out eventually to exercise their rights.\n\n\u201cWe call on the resilient people of Anambra to remain calm and law abiding as the election runs its course. We call on INEC to ensure the peaceful and transparent conclusion of this election. Situation Room also calls on security agencies to continue to maintain law and order through the remaining phases of this exercise.\u201d\n\nAs part of its observations, the Situation Room said officials of INEC and ad hoc staff arrived late with election materials in 67 per cent of the polling units (PU) and polls commenced between 10am and 12:30pm in 53.5 per cent of the voting locations observed.\n\nSituation Room said there were delays in the commencement of polls in locations, such as PU 001 and 008 in Amansea ward of Awka North Local Government Area, PU 017 and 018 in Uga I ward of Aguata Local Government Area, and several others.\n\nIt also noted that in some places, particularly, voting locations in parts of Ihiala, Idemili North and Idemili South local government areas, no INEC staff or material was deployed.\n\nOn the deployment of BVAS, Situation Room said reports from field observers indicated widespread malfunction of the technology, as it failed to authenticate voters\u2019 fingerprints and detect faces.\n\nAccording to the Situation Room, \u201cThis was the case in 59 per cent of the PUs observed, with a minimum of five minutes to accredit one voter in 65.8 per cent of the PUs observed. Furthermore, some of the ad-hoc staff experienced some difficulty in operating the machines. In some locations, the machines were working rather slowly and took as long as 10 minutes or more to accredit a single voter. This severely stalled the accreditation and voting process.\n\n\u201cThese challenges were observed in the following locations: PU 007 in Awka-Etiti II ward in Idemili South LGA, PU 013 in Nawfia II ward of Njikoka LGA, PU 017 in Uruagu I ward of Nnewi North LGA, amongst others.\u201d\n\nSituation Room also said security officials were present at most of the polling units visited and they were relatively civil in their conduct within and outside polling units.\n\nIt said it received reports of widespread vote buying by political party agents across the state.\n\nOn his part, the national chairman of APGA, Oye, who spoke to newsmen in Awka, yesterday, said Buhari had proven to be a father by giving INEC a free hand to conduct the election.\n\nOye said, \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has always been a father by allowing INEC to conduct free, fair and credible elections in the country. He will also insist on allowing the people\u2019s will to prevail and not the other way round. Left to some other people, the election will have been rigged in favour of another party. But he has always told them to allow the choice of the people to prevail, that is why APGA is winning the election.\u201d\n\nOye also commended residents of the state for the peaceful conduct of the election, saying, \u201cAnambra people are known to be peaceful. The violence we had some time ago was imported. Our people are not in any way associated with violence.\u201d\n\nOn the calls for a supplementary election in some areas affected by malfunctioning of INEC voting equipment or where violence marred the exercise, Oye said such an election would only enhance the victory of APGA.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Soludo\u2019s Imminent Victory: How Anambra Voted",
          "text": "David-Chyddy Eleke\n\nAll things being equal, the candidate of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Anambra State, Professor Chukwuma Soludo, is set for victory, having so far won 17 out of the 21 local government areas of the state.\n\nMany variables helped to sway the people\u2019s vote.\n\nIn 2017, outgoing Governor Willie Obiano, a member of APGA, won all the 21 local government areas in the state in what is today popularly referred to as \u201c21 over 21\u201d by the party. During the campaigns for last Saturday\u2019s election, Obiano had during a rally in Awka said, APGA was not only going to replicate the feat by winning all the local government areas, as it did in 2017, but would also go a notch higher to ensure victory in every ward in the state.\n\nBut, yesterday, from the results announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), APGA failed to clear all 21 local government areas. Yet, it put up an impressive showing by winning 18 out of the 20 local government areas, whose results were announced.\n\nFrom the results, the Young Progressives Party (YPP) won Nnewi North, where its candidate, Senator Ifeanyi Ubah, hails from, while the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) won in Ogbaru Local Government Area.\n\nBut INEC failed to declare result in two local government areas of Ihiala, where the collation officer claimed elections were marred by violence, and in Orumba North, where the collation officer, Dr. Micheal Out, insisted he signed the result sheet under duress.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that APGA has an overwhelming lead in the election with 18 local government areas, including Dunukofia, Awka South, Oyi, Ayamelum, Anambra East, Anaocha, Idemili South, and Onitsha South. Others are Njikoka, Orumba South, Onitsha North, Aguata, Idemili North, NNewi South, Awka North, and Anambra West. APGA also prevailed in the controversial Orumba North LGA poll which was declared in its favour late yesterday night. The result announced showed that PDP \u2013 184, APC \u2013 2672, APGA \u2013 4787 bringing APGA to winning18 local governments, out of the 21 council areas in the state.\n\nExcept for Nnewi North, where Ubah won overwhelmingly, and Ogbaru, where the PDP won, all other local government areas were taken by APGA.\n\nMany have attributed this level of success to both the popularity of APGA, which has come to be known as the predominant party in the state, the personality of Soludo, and the belief of the people in his ability to transform his dreams and ideas into reality, like he did at the Central Bank of Nigeria, when he was CBN Governor.\n\nLooking carefully at the result, Soludo garnered votes from every senatorial zone of the state, including winning some local government areas that were reputed to be the strongholds of the contestants. Though he hails from the same local government area as two other top contestants \u2013 PDP\u2019s Valentine Ozigbo and APC\u2019s Andy Uba \u2013 Soludo was able to win the local government area with a wide margin, after securing 9,136 votes, with the closest to him, Uba, standing far behind at 4,773.\n\nIn Anaocha, where the leader of the PDP, and former governor of the state, Mr. Peter Obi, and Senator Uche Ekwunife hail from, APGA and Soludo braced the odds to poll the highest votes.\n\nSoludo also won in Orumba South, where Dr Godwin Maduka of Accord hails from, and also in Idemili, where the chairman of United Nigeria Airline, Dr Obiora Okonkwo, comes from, and in Njikoka, where the Deputy Governor of Anambra, Dr Nkem Okeke, who recently defected to APC, comes from.\n\nThe state chairman of APGA, Chief Norbert Obi, once stated that APGA would rule Anambra for 50 years, but beyond such assertion, a public affairs analyst, Mr Okechukwu Eze, said the combination of APGA as a grassroots party, and the integrity and acceptability of Soludo were the reasons for the victory last Saturday.\n\n\u201cIf not so, why did Soludo not win in 2010, when he contested on the platform of PDP, when he was even still very fresh from the CBN?\u201d Eze asked.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "In 2017, outgoing Governor Willie Obiano, a member of APGA, won all the 21 local government areas in the state in what is today popularly referred to as \u201c21 over 21\u201d by the party.\nBut, yesterday, from the results announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), APGA failed to clear all 21 local government areas.\nYet, it put up an impressive showing by winning 18 out of the 20 local government areas, whose results were announced.\nOthers are Njikoka, Orumba South, Onitsha North, Aguata, Idemili North, NNewi South, Awka North, and Anambra West.\nExcept for Nnewi North, where Ubah won overwhelmingly, and Ogbaru, where the PDP won, all other local government areas were taken by APGA.",

          "text": "*Cuts naira printing costs to N58bn\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has disclosed that it recorded a significant reduction in the volume and cost of foreign exchange procurement in 2020, the year of COVID, when the entire world was on lockdown and businesses closed.\n\nThe bank said a total of $1.83 billion was procured over the period, representing a decline of $2.12 billion or 53.67 per cent compared to the $3.95 billion procured in 2019.\n\nAccording to the annual report by the apex bank\u2019s Currency Operations Department (COD) which was posted on its website, the CBN also slashed its expenditure on currency printing from N75.52 billion in 2019 to N58.61 billion in 2020.\n\nThe central bank explained that this was used to fund Bureaux De Change (BDC) operations, payment of estacode and Personal Travel Allowances (PTA) to Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).\n\nThe CBN stated that receipt and authentication of foreign currency deposits by Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) reduced significantly due to the downturn in global trade in 2020.\n\nThis represented a decrease of N16.91 billion or 28.84 per cent compared to the preceding year.\n\nAccording to the central bank, currency printing gulped N64.04 billion in 2018.\n\nSources said the reduction was in line with the policy objective of the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, to reduce the cost of printing bank notes and cash management, in the country.\n\nThe Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) also known as the eNaira, which was unveiled recently by President Muhammadu Buhari, is in line with the policy to further reduce the cost of printing the naira.\n\nAccording to the report, total stock of currency (issuable and non-issuable) in the vaults of the CBN stood at 2.75 billion as at December 2020 compared to 2.64 billion pieces in 2019, indicating an increase of 105.73 million pieces or 4 per cent.\n\nIn the period under review, total issuable notes (newly printed notes and Counted Audited Clean notes) was 592.94 million pieces, compared with 726.43 million pieces in 2019, representing a decrease of 133.49 million pieces or 18.38 per cent.\n\nThe central bank said it generated the sum of N6.50 billion as total income from currency management activities in 2020, compared with N13.24 billion in the preceding year, representing a decrease of N6.74 billion or 50.92 per cent.\n\nThe bank explained that the income generated was largely, from penal charges on unsorted banknotes deposited by Deposit Money Bank (DMBs) and charges for authentication of foreign currency deposits with the central bank.\n\nThe CBN, however, incurred a total of N67.21 billion as expenses on currency operations in 2020, representing a decrease of N17.96 billion or 21.08 per cent, less than N 85.18 billion in 2019.\n\nThe apex bank added that despite the limitations occasioned by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact in 2020, the bank nonetheless, concluded upgrade of the Cash Activity Reporting Portal (CARP) for transmission of currency management data from the financial industry to the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS).\n\nIt also completed the development of the Mint tracking system application, needs assessment on the infrastructure, user sensitisation, test run at five branches and end-to-end system tests with a view to instituting the pilot launch in 2021.\n\nThe CBN also commenced establishment of the currency lab for banknote quality assessment, authentication and independent investigations as well as to adjudicate cases of suspected counterfeit banknotes.\n\nIt also registered an additional Cash-in-Transit (CIT) company which brought the total to nine CIT companies, to further deepen the private sector participation in CIT services among others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Buhari Escapes Air Crash As Presidential Jet Develops Fault, Aircraft Taken To Germany For Repairs At N2.4Million Per Night For Parking\n\n\u201cThe Presidential Boeing Business Jet registration number 5N-FGT developed a fault during his trip from New York. He travelled to Saudi Arabia with a smaller jet. A Falcon 7X jet with registration number 5N-FGV. No picture of his departure to Saudi Arabia was released to avoid the public knowing about the jet he travelled with,\u201d a presidential source had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cThe one that developed (a) fault has been moved to EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg, Germany for repairs since September. It is registered and operated under another name AMACGND. They intentionally hid it and parked it under another name because it costs \u20ac5,000 for parking per night.\u201d\n\nThis means by Monday, November 08, the Muhammadu Buhari-led government has paid \u20ac195,000 (N92 million) as parking fee for the aircraft, which has spent 39 days there.\n\nThis excludes the millions of naira being spent on the repair of the jet.\n\nDespite promising to cut waste, the Buhari-led government has spent at least N41 billion on the presidential fleet.\n\nAfter taking office on May 29, 2015, the 2016 Appropriation Act signed by the President allocated N3.652 billion for the upkeep of the presidential fleet.\n\nIn 2017, the cost of maintenance of the presidential aircraft rose to N4.37 billion (19.6 per cent). The figure then skyrocketed to N7.260 billion (98.7 per cent) in 2018.\n\nIn 2019, the cost of maintaining the PAF again rose to N7.297 billion (99.6 per cent). The allocation, however, fell to N6.793 billion (86 per cent) in 2020. But in 2021, the budget for the presidential fleet saw its sharpest Buhari-era jump to N12.550 billion (243.6 per cent).\n\nBy comparison, the 2015 budget, which was in effect upon Buhari\u2019s inauguration, earmarked N5.190 billion for the presidential fleet. The appropriation for the Presidential Air Fleet in 2021 indicates a 243.6 per cent increase from the allocation six years prior.",

          "text": "South Africa-based MTN Group has announced plans to sell 575 million shares of its most profitable subsidiary MTN Nigeria, which went public in Lagos in 2019.\n\n\u201cToday we announce our intention to proceed with a public offer for sale of up to 575 million shares in MTN Nigeria, by way of a bookbuild to institutional investors and fixed price to retail investors,\u201d the company said in a notice filed with the Nigerian Stock Exchange.\n\n\u201cThe offer is anticipated to open in November 2021 with a bookbuild to institutional investors, after which a fixed price is expected to be announced for retail investors also in November 2021. The offer is expected to close in December 2021.\u201d\n\nThe transaction will see MTN Group rake in proceeds of about \u20a6101 billion ($245 million), based on MTN Nigeria\u2019s (MTNN) current share price of \u20a6175.60. Hours after the announcement, the stock rose around 8% to \u20a6191.\n\nA Bit of History\n\nThe planned sell-off is part of a broader intention, announced by MTN Group earlier, to sell down 14% of its current shareholding in the Nigerian unit. That will see its holdings in MTNN reduce from 76% to 62%.\n\nWhile MTN Nigeria is the group\u2019s largest and most profitable subsidiary, the telecom giant has had to deal with a number of billion-dollar disputes with the Nigerian government as well as faced significant macroeconomic challenges.\n\nLast year, the Johannesburg-based group was unable to repatriate its $280 million dividend from its Nigerian subsidiary due to the challenges of securing foreign currency, amid the country\u2019s forex liquidity crisis.\n\nThe share sale thus raises questions about the group\u2019s intentions as it appears to be a gradual exit from the Nigerian market due to a lack of confidence.\n\nAlthough the divestment helps the South African giant slightly reduce its exposure to headwinds in the Nigerian economy, the sell-down does not signal an exit from Nigeria, according to Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer.\n\n\u201cSince its 2019 listing by introduction, the group has planned to sell part of its stake but held on due to market conditions,\u201d Omole told TechCabal. \u201cThe sale is part of its asset realisation programme (ARP) meant to simplify its portfolio, focus on its pan-Africa strategy, and free up capital for improved allocation.\u201d\n\nBetween January and September 2021, MTN Group saw its revenue grow to $8.2 billion, driven by success in some of its main markets, including Nigeria.\n\nDespite the domestic challenges, MTN Nigeria has shown resilience. Within the same period, the local unit grew its profit after tax by 53% to \u20a6220 billion ($385 million).\n\n\u201cMTN Nigeria remains an important part of the Group and its fundamentals remain solid,\u201d Omole said, adding that the share sale \u201cgives local retail and institutional investors an opportunity to tap into MTN Nigeria\u2019s growth.\u201d\n\nAs part of its ARP, MTN Group is in the process of finalising a sale-and-leaseback of its South African telecom mast portfolio as well as list shares in the Uganda operation in Kampala.\n\nThe company recently raked in some proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) of telecom infrastructure company, IHS Towers, in New York last month.\n\nShare this article",

Their intention appears to be the targeting of small industries and traders seeking cross-border opportunities in new African markets.\n\nKenyan based Asante Financial Services Group, focused on supporting the growth of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME\u2019s), has raised 7.5 million US dollars in series A funding to scale business credit offering to small businesses in Kenya and Uganda access to new markets across Africa.\n\n\u201cThe investment enables Asante to scale its credit offerings to the underserved segment of MSMEs in Kenya and Uganda, and expand to Nigeria and Rwanda,\u201d the start-up said in a statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTala, with African Operations in Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania has begun a \u2018Rebuild Fund Business Program\u2019 targeting Kenya\u2019s hard-hit micro, small and medium-sized enterprises it say will help them build back better post-COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe program comes barely a month after Tala raised 145 million dollars in equity, hinting that part of the growth funds would go toward supporting its geographical expansion.\n\nThe World Bank puts the annual SME credit gap in Sub Saharan Africa at about 330 million US dollars, with traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d lenders turning a blind eye to small traders on account of lack of \u2013 among others \u2013 collateral, high costs of due diligence, customer acquisition, distribution and servicing.\n\n\u201cMSMEs\u2014particularly those in the informal sector\u2014are being held back by a lack of responsible lending from traditional financial services providers who are unable to run accurate credit checks and offer profitable loans to this segment of the market,\u201d said Bitta Wycliffe, Senior Investment Associate at Goodwell Investments.\n\nPan-Africa fintech firm, MFS Africa is also making inroads in Nigeria through the acquisition of Baxi, a Nigerian start-up with a 90,000-agent network. The October move gives Nigerian SME\u2019s listed on Baxi access to MFS Africa\u2019s multiple mobile money payment wallets, currently serving up to 320 million customers in more than 35 African countries.\n\nAnother Pan-African fintech venture, Yabx, with a presence in 12 African countries recently tapped a telecoms industry expert with over 15 years in experience as a new director for its business.\n\nEunice R. Gatama, who has worked for, among others, Kenya\u2019s Safaricom, in its mobile money (M-Pesa) division, as well as NCBA bank, has been tasked with pushing the growth of Yabx digital lending services in new African markets.\n\nUntil recently, a lack of local knowledge and access to trade and market information has been linked to low trade volumes and value. With more money pouring into the hiring of top regional talent, that scenario, too, is likely to change.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "There\u2019s a new exciting trend in the African tech ecosystem: African founders backing fellow founders especially in pre-seed and seed funding, which is an indication that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Payhippo, a fintech startup providing capital for small businesses in Nigeria, was another example of the existence of this trend when it announced that it has closed $3 million in seed funding led by a number of African tech founders.\n\nThe round was led by Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, co-founders Chipper Cash; Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola, founder Flutterwave; Bolaji Balogun, CEO Chapel Hill Denham; and Hakeem Belo-Osagie, founder Metis Capital Partners.\n\nAngel investors from Paystack, Brex and Tala also participated in the round. TEN13, VentureSouq, and Prodigio Capital were the only institutional ventures that wrote a check for this round.\n\nThis investment comes barely 5 months after the startup raised a $1 million institutional pre-seed. Besides the earlier undisclosed capital raised from friends and family, the company\u2019s total fundraised is now at $4 million.\n\nCapital is a lifeline of business\n\nThere are over 40 million small and medium businesses (SMEs) in Nigeria. These businesses account for 96% of its total companies, 84% of employment, and 48% of the national GDP. But only a few of these businesses have access to capital, mostly due to heavy collateral requirements and long time of loan processing.\n\nPayhippo is at the forefront of solving this problem. Founded by Zach Bijesse, CEO, Chioma Okotcha, COO, and Uche Nnadi, CTO, Payhippo provides small businesses with short-term working capital with average loan amounts of $1300. The company also allows SMEs to build their credit score based on their track record of repaying their loans on time. SMEs even become eligible for higher amounts of capital as their credit score goes up.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIf capital is a lifeline of a business, then it\u2019s safe to say Payhippo is guarding the lifeline of Nigerian SMEs.\n\n\u201cThis funding will allow us to invest in hiring more engineers and data scientists. We aim to improve our technology and enhance our lending offerings as we continue to address the persistent financing gap for small businesses in Nigeria,\u201d Okotcha, COO at Payhippo, said. \u201cAt Payhippo, our vision is to provide millions of small businesses with sufficient and available capital to run and grow their businesses.\u201d\n\nThe company said it has disbursed 5000 loans to SMEs since it launched in January 2020. In September 2021, the Payhippo reportedly earned $64,000 in revenue from $900,000 disbursed, experiencing 25% monthly growth with a 97% repayment rate on loans.\n\nCommenting on his investment in Payhippo, Bolaji Balogun, founder/CEO at Chapel Hill Denham said: \u201cWe\u2019re excited at how Payhippo is using technology to provide SMEs in Africa with access to finance required to run their business needs. By lending to small businesses, Payhippo is allowing business owners access to much-needed working capital to grow their businesses and create jobs in the economy.\u201d\n\nFor Serunjogi and Moujaled, the two co-founders of Chipper Cash, the African fintech which attained a unicorn status on Tuesday, they are bullish on supporting new financial technologies being developed and implemented to change the competitive landscape in the financial sector in Africa.\n\n\u201cAccess to credit is a critical necessity for small businesses to manage their daily challenges. Payhippo helps address this need through its innovative approach that provides loans to small businesses in less than three hours, enabling them to access sufficient working capital to grow.\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nPayhippo plans to use the new funding to improve its technology capabilities and expand its talent pool.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Chipper Cash valued at $2 billion after investment from FTX",
          "text": "When Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payment company, raised $100 million Series C funding in May this year, the CEO, Ham Serunjogi, without declaring the startup\u2019s current valuation said the company is the most valuable startup in Africa. That sparked a lot of mixed reactions in the ecosystem.\n\nFive months later, it looks like Serunjogi\u2019s claim might not have been far from the truth as today, Chipper Cash announced the extension of its series C and raised $150 million at a valuation little over $2 billion. The investment was led by FTX, the most valuable crypto derivatives exchange company owned by the youngest billionaire in the world, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nWith a valuation of over $2 billion, Chipper Cash has now attained a unicorn status. It joins the ranks of Nigeria\u2019s Interswitch, Flutterwave and Opay, Egypt\u2019s Fawry, Pan-African Andela, and Senegal\u2019s Wave, as the seventh African unicorn.\n\nFounded by Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled in 2018 to offer free cross-border payment service in Africa via a mobile app, Chipper Cash operates in seven African countries \u2014 Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa and Kenya. In May, after the initial $100 million series C round, the company expanded into the UK to power UK to Africa peer-to-peer remittance.\n\nLast month, the startup also entered the competitive U.S market and it\u2019s reported to have started the U.S to Africa remittance in Nigeria and Uganda, with more countries to be added soon. The company also plans to start Africa to U.S remittance in South Africa, Uganda and Ghana next year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarlier this year, Chipper Cash forayed into social payments by partnering with Twitter to offer payment for the social media platform\u2019s Tip Jar feature for African users. The Tip Jar feature was launched early this year to allow Twitter users receive money \u201ctip\u201d directly on the platform.\n\nChipper Cash is FTX\u2019s first investment in Africa. A move that hints that FTX is impressed by how Chipper Cash has been able to scale in the space of three years and its interest in the crypto space. Chipper Cash boasts of having over 4 million users across the world.\n\nThe investment will see FTX partner with Chipper Cash to make money transfer as simple as a text message and accelerate the adoption of crypto within Africa and beyond.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent growth in Africa, moving money across the continent is still slow and expensive. Unsurprisingly it is the fastest growing market with grassroots crypto adoption,\u201d Bankman-Fried, FTX CEO, told TechCrunch.\n\nAs a result of this partnership, FTX will increase its footprint in Africa and Chipper Cash will be integrated into the FTX product so that African users can fund their crypto wallet through Chipper Cash.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a compelling use case for both of our companies as we keep scaling and as FTX keeps scaling their geographical coverage. They do some of the most innovative work in the crypto space, so working with them is going to be quite exciting,\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "What does MTN and Airtel\u2019s PSB approval in principle licence mean for financial inclusion in Nigeria?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, November 8, 2021, telecom giants MTN and Airtel, in separate statements, revealed that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had granted them approval in principle to operate payment service banks (PSBs).\n\nSubject to meeting specific requirements over the next six months, the telecom operators would receive approval to operate PSBs. As expected, the announcements were greeted with support by Nigerians and hailed as an essential step in deepening financial inclusion in the country.\n\nSo what does this mean for financial inclusion in Nigeria? This article provides some answers but first, what are PSBs?\n\nAccording to Mondaq, payment service banks accept deposits from individuals and small businesses, carry out payment and remittance services within Nigeria, issue debit and prepaid cards, operate electronic purses, and other activities prescribed by the CBN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, MTN and Airtel would provide these services if they get the final approval. In doing so, they would be joining the likes of OPay and Paga in that space.\n\nSince 2012, an often-stated goal of the CBN has been to deepen financial inclusion in the country.\n\nThe World Bank defines financial inclusion as access to valuable and affordable financial products and services delivered responsibly and sustainably. These services include payments, savings, credit, insurance, and transactions.\n\nIt goes on to say that having a transaction account is the first step towards financial inclusion, as it provides individuals and businesses with a way to receive, send, and store money.\n\nConsequently, while the telcos would not offer a full suite of financial services, they would be able to provide users with an entry into the financial system.\n\nA significant reason for the optimism shown is the potential of telcos to fast-track the CBN\u2019s financial inclusion goal. This is mainly due to their comprehensive coverage of the country, especially in rural areas that house most of the unbanked population.\n\nWith the infrastructural cost of setting up branches and security, banks are not opening branches in new locations and, in some cases, are shutting down operations. According to the International Monetary Fund, Nigerian banks closed 234 branches and 649 Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) in 2020, bringing the number of banks in Nigeria to 5,158 in 2020 from 5,392 in 2019.\n\nFurthermore, MTN and Airtel have the largest and third-largest subscribers at 67.5 million and 42 million, respectively. Even accounting for multiple SIM cards as is common in the country, those figures are significantly higher than the top three Nigerian banks by customer base. According to data from the GSM Association, there were 97.5 million unique mobile subscribers in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nData from the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) puts the number of bank accounts in Nigeria at 160 million as of May 2021. At the same time, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) reports 190,854,069 active lines as of September 2021.\n\nHowever, the total BVN count as of October 31 was 50,728,469. Given that no one can have more than one BVN, it is safe to assume that the number of bank account holders in Nigeria is around the 50 million mark.\n\nWith the World Population Review putting the population of Nigerians over the age of 18 at 105,841,979, we could infer that there are about 55 million adult Nigerians without a bank account. This presents a huge opportunity for the new entrants and the millions of unbanked Nigerians.\n\nHaving successfully set up mobile money services in other parts of Africa, MTN and Airtel could replicate the success in Nigeria. This development bodes well for Nigeria\u2019s unbanked population as it would serve as a gateway into the financial services sector. While the PSBs cannot give loans, having a transaction account enables their users to access loans for their businesses and education.\n\nGranting PSB licences to the telcos is, however, just one step towards achieving financial inclusion. As we argued in a previous article, financial inclusion entails more than having a bank account.\n\nChallenges such as a lack of a unified identification system and increasing poverty rates remain. Opening an account is one thing but consistently funding that account is another. Admittedly, this is not a task for the telcos but is one they are bound to encounter.\n\nThere is no doubt that granting these telcos a PSB licence would boost the CBN\u2019s financial inclusion goals. However, for it to be truly impactful, it must go beyond adding numbers to the financial system to create tangible value for existing customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Yes, indeed. Two of Nigeria\u2019s biggest telecommunication companies MTN and Airtel, have been granted Approval-in-Principle for their proposed payment service banks (PSBs), Momo Payment Service Bank Limited and Smartcash Payment Service Bank Limited, respectively.\n\nThe pair announced this in regulatory filings on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) on Friday, November 5, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile this is a provisional licence, both companies can apply for final approval in six months.\n\nA long time coming: the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) first introduced the PSB licence in 2018 and has since given final approval to three PSBs \u2014 Hope PSB, Money Master PSB, and 9PSB.\n\nWhile all four Nigerian telcos \u2014 MTN, Airtel, Glo, and 9mobile \u2014 applied for PSB licences in 2018, only Glo (Money Master PSB) and 9mobile (9PSB) were successful on their first try.\n\nBut, what\u2019s a PSB? A payment service bank is a bank licenced by the CBN to operate in mostly rural areas, targeted at financially excluded persons. While they may accept deposits and can issue debit cards, in contrast with deposit money banks, PSBs cannot provide loans, mortgages, insurance, among other things.\n\nAccording to Enhancing Financial Innovation Access\u2019 (EFInA), Nigeria\u2019s financial exclusion rate is 35.9%. After failing to attain its 20% goal in 2020, the CBN revised its plans to a 95% inclusion rate by 2024.\n\nBut what does this move mean for financial inclusion in Nigeria? With a combined strength of over 100 million customers, how would the entry of MTN and Airtel affect the market? Is there any truth to a possible MTN dominance? There\u2019s quite a bit to unpack.\n\nWell, Chimgozirim, Bolu, and I will be talking about all this and more in the coming week. Please, keep your eyes peeled for our stories.\n\nBuilding collapses in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLagos State has recorded 296 building collapses \u2014 65% of all such incidents in Nigeria \u2014 since October 1974.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Monday, November 1, 2021, a 21-storey building collapsed in Ikoyi, Lagos.\n\nFrom Intelligence by Techpoint, here are the top 20 recorded building collapse incidents by state in Nigeria since October 1974.\n\nFor more insights like this, don\u2019t forget to follow @TechpointIntel on Twitter.\n\nMTN Nigeria to sell 14% shareholding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: <a href=\u201dhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/121302193@N07/17666012786/\u201d>USAID Digital Development</a> Flickr via <a href=\u201dhttp://compfight.com\u201d>Compfight</a> <a href=\u201dhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\u201d>cc</a>\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? MTN Nigeria, on Thursday, November 4, 2021, announced plans to launch its first public shares sale of over 575 million units two years after listing on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX).\n\nPer a statement by Uto Ukpanah, MTN Nigeria Company Secretary, the offer is expected to open in November 2021 and close in December 2021\n\nInstitutional investors \u2014 fund managers, commercial banks, insurance companies, among others \u2014 can purchase the shares through book building. This allows bidders to apply for shares in large quantities to get a price fairer than a predetermined one.\n\nHowever, individuals can also buy stock using the public offer option but at a fixed price.\n\nAt MTN Nigeria\u2019s current stock price \u2014 \u20a6175.6 per share \u2014 this move could make the company profit upwards of \u20a6100.9 billion ($245 million).\n\nWhat\u2019s all the fuss about? The move is part of a broader arrangement by the MTN Group to sell parts of its stake in African markets, including Zambia and Uganda.\n\nInterestingly, MTN Nigeria, although one of the group\u2019s most significant subsidiaries, has been a considerable source of headache. In 2018, Abubakar Malami, Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, said MTN owed the equivalent of $2 billion in unpaid duties and taxes dating between 2007 and 2017.\n\nAlthough charges were eventually dropped, in 2020 the company could not repatriate its $280 million Nigerian dividend due to the challenges of securing foreign currency.\n\nTechpoint Africa headlines\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nFacebook says groups will be a \u2018central part\u2019 of its metaverse vision.

          "title": "Afrobeats pays Nigerian artistes as the world listens",
          "text": "Nearly 45 years after Fela Kuti debuted Zombie, the album that gave the world a new music genre, Afrobeat, a new generation of proteges from Nigeria now has many music lovers around the world addicted. All thanks to a digital world where almost everything including music album launches takes place on a mobile phone.\n\nFor Kuti, building cult-like followership for Afrobeat meant tapping into the unspoken, visceral spirit of his audience through his lyrics and deeply interactive songs.\n\nHowever, for today\u2019s Nigerian artistes, it is mostly about plugging into a thriving streaming market backed by deep-pocket investors and a growing young population with an insatiable appetite for mobile gadgets and innovations that have simplified and even monetised music sharing.\n\nToday, Afrobeats sounds are not only breaking the ceiling on streaming services, gathering huge followers on social media platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, but it is also getting all the love from international music artistes like Robyn Rihanna Fenty known as Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles-Carter (Beyonce), Sean John Combs (P. Diddy), among others.\n\nThe year 2020 was particularly a defining moment for the Nigerian music industry in terms of announcing itself on the global stage. Hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, a lockdown, and economic meltdown, the industry sought an alternative. With concert venues shut for almost the entire year, the internet became the new stage, the venue, and the revenue collector.\n\nInterestingly, artistes heavily biased to Afrobeats thrived the most. David Adedeji Adeleke, known as Davido, Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun (Wizkid), Damini Ebunoluwa Ogulu (Burna Boy), and Olamide Adedeji (Olamide) led the industry\u2019s resurgence in the pandemic.\n\nBurna Boy, who shut into global consciousness in 2019 with his Outside and African Giant albums, a mixture of afrobeat, dancehall, pop, and hip pop, once again announced his genius with \u2018Twice as Tall\u2019 in 2020.\n\nThis time, Twice as Tall released in August 2020 broke many ceilings on various streaming platforms. In its first month, the album was streamed 175.3 million times across all platforms. It had 25 million streams on YouTube; 50.2 million on Audiomack; 34.5 million on Spotify; 18.4 million on Music Africa; 31 million on Music World, and Boomplay 10.5 million.\n\nIt was adjudged the most-streamed album of 2020 with 64 million streams by Spotify, double the 31 million streams garnered by second-placed Wizkid\u2019s Made in Lagos. As of November 4, 2021, all 15 songs on the Twice as Tall album have received about 1 billion views on YouTube.\n\nOn the global music boards, Twice as Tall topped various charts, peaking at No 1 in the World Albums category on Billboard charts.\n\nWizkid, however, took the record-breaking to a whole new level. Starting from 2016, when he was featured by Drake alongside Kyla on the hit song One Dance, Wizkid has seen a transformation unprecedented for any artiste in the Afrobeats genre. In 2019, he was recruited for Beyonc\u00e9 Brown Skin Girl from the Lion King: The Gift. The song also featured Blue Ivy Carter and SAINt JHN.\n\nThe two songs gave Wizkid his Grammy debut; a Grammy nomination (One Dance) and a Grammy win for best music video (Brown Skin Girl).\n\nWizkid\u2019s biggest strides however are on the charts and the streaming platforms his songs keep very busy. Essence, a song he released on October 30, 2020, has the entire music world hooked. The remix of the song featured Justin Bieber and Tems, another Nigerian music sensation. Essence entered the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 Chart making him the first African artiste ever to have a song in the Top 10 Billboard. The Billboard Hot 100 is the music industry standard rating in the United States for songs published weekly by Billboard Magazine.\n\nEssence became the song of the summer \u2013 a position that was conferred on it by RollingStone \u2013 an indication of the coming of age of afrobeats on the global music scene.\n\nOn Wednesday, November 4, 2021, Wizkid became one of the highest nominees for the Soul Train Awards, 2021 by BET. He bagged five nominations in the categories of Song of the Year (Essence), Album of the Year (Made in Lagos), Video of the Year (Essence), Best Collaboration (Essence), and The Ashford and Simpson Songwriter\u2019s Award.\n\n\u201cThese are significant because they are in the mainstream categories. African artistes used to get nominated in the \u201cworld\u201d or \u201cinternational\u201d or \u201cAfrican\u201d categories. So, it\u2019s a first. Breaking Afrobeats into mainstream (and that\u2019s without making music to fit their African stereotypes of war, suffering, poverty and dictatorship). The point is while these things exist, it\u2019s important to show that we also live normal lives \u2013 love, club, build family, build career, build businesses, etc. And that\u2019s the point this wave is making,\u201d says Temitayo Lawal, an African music expert.\n\nIn the beginning, was Fela, then others\n\nThe old Afrika Shrine located at Empire Hotel, Mushin, Lagos, in 1977, that housed Fela\u2019s Egypt 80 band and most of his performances was notorious for many things including becoming a Mecca of sorts for young people seeking to get \u2018high\u2019 on Marijuana.\n\nIts biggest product, however, was the songs \u2013 the trance-like beating of the drums, the perfect blend of the assorted percussion instruments, the trumpeters, the raw energy of the women dancers, and Fela\u2019s voice resonating always minutes after the symphony had begun and soaked the adulating crowd. Every song was like observing a solemn oblation to a deity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called the Shrine because he asks for a minute of silence to pay homage to the ancestors and the gods,\u201d says Dele Sosimi who was a member of the famous Egypt 80 band. He was also a part of the Positive Force band with Femi Kuti, with whom he performed from 1986 to 1994. In both bands, Sosimi was a keyboard player.\n\nFela\u2019s brand of afrobeat was hinged on heavy instrumentation and lyrics of resistance. Most of the songs start as simmering instrumentals, methodically layering little rifts and long-line melodies into a strong groove; they make way for the messages he sings, then surges ahead with even more urgency.\n\n\u201cFela was Afrobeat,\u201d a senior executive of a global record label told BusinessDay. He pleaded anonymity because he wasn\u2019t in a position to speak for the company.\n\nFela\u2019s creative genius was such that scholars from the UK, the US, and other parts of the world would travel down to Nigeria for research on afrobeat, says Excel Joab, a music executive, entertainment podcaster, and A&R Consultant.\n\nAfter his death, his sons Femi and Seun continued to push the genre and even introduced new adaptations to it. However, it is the new generation of artistes that has taken a little of Fela\u2019s genius, Femi and Seun\u2019s reformed versions, and different global sounds to create a completely new version of afrobeats.\n\nRead also: African music industry getting global recognition \u2013 Samprincepowers\n\nSome music experts now try to make a distinction between Fela\u2019s Afrobeat and those being performed by artistes like DBanj, Olamide, Davido, among others. Some experts have described the new afrobeats as \u201cComputer-driven pop-R&B\u201d due to the visible influence of these genres in the new songs.\n\nNonetheless, the new afrobeats movement has grabbed the attention of not just music lovers but also global investors.\n\nNew money for afrobeats\n\nWhile Afrobeat has become the biggest movement in the Nigerian music industry, it is not immune to the vagaries of the industry, one of which is generating income. The industry is faced with enormous challenges trying to ensure talents receive their due compensation.\n\nBefore streaming service happened, earning income would mean that artistes needed to take their Compact Disks to marketers at Alaba or Onitsha or Pound Road, Aba, to help push in the market or plead with radio stations to give it air time.\n\nAn artiste could hit the big time once listeners start demanding a repeat of the song on radio. Consistent playtime is usually the magic that unlocks the door to being invited to perform at different concerts and on some occasions headline a big show. Hence, artistes made money from performing at events, endorsements by brands, and going on tours.\n\nThe advent of streaming services has however changed how music is consumed and distributed. Importantly, it has presented the artistes with a new global market they could not access before and a new way to earn money from their sweat.\n\nWhile streaming services have now eliminated the problems in the industry, it has enabled investors to realise the untapped market potential in the Nigerian music industry.\n\nThe music streaming market in Nigeria is today dominated by providers such as BoomPlay, which hits 75 million African users in July 2020. In October 2021, the platform\u2019s data were added to the data that inform the Billboard Hot 100, Billboard 200, Artiste 100, and Billboard Global 200 charts, as well as all other Billboard US and global charts that include streaming data.\n\nSpotify, Google\u2019s YouTube Music, Audiomack, and Apple Music are also pushing up their investments in the market. At present, there are about 13 music streaming services in Nigeria.\n\nRevenue in music streaming in Africa is expected to reach $271 million in 2021 and $493 million by 2025, according to data from Statista. Ironically, it is also expected that most of the revenue will be generated from consumers in the US.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a rich musical heritage, cultural diversity, and multiple languages so this translates to a huge range of preferences in music that necessitates agility for any music streaming service to make relevant recommendations and enable discoverability across music genres, personal moods, and moments,\u201d Phiona Okumu, head of music, sub-Saharan Africa, Spotify, told BusinessDay.\n\nApart from streaming investors, the industry is also drawing the attention of global record labels such as Universal Music Group, which came into Nigeria in 2018.\n\nAn expert says it is obvious UMG has seen the potential in the market and as market leaders, that\u2019s why they came early. In comparison to other record labels, the global record label is the only one that has fully functional offices in Nigeria, which is a testament to the potential of this market. It also has offices in Ghana, South Africa, and East Africa.\n\nNew money, old problems\n\nThe arrival of investors and streaming services has not fully addressed the consumption and distribution challenges the market faces. The biggest challenge facing streaming in Nigeria is internet connectivity. The quality of the internet is still low and often does not encourage video streaming.\n\nIn Africa, South Africa has the largest market in terms of streaming numbers, although Nigeria has the most population and commands the biggest number of artistes on the continent.\n\nMobile broadband penetration in Nigeria is at 40 percent compared with South Africa that has achieved over 90 percent. Smartphone penetration is also at 46 percent, which means millions of Nigerians are not able to join the music afrobeat party or experience the growing strength of afrobeats artistes around the world.\n\nOkumu of Spotify says the challenges of low data consumption, network instability, and the use of older mobile devices contribute to the prevalence of piracy.\n\n\u201cTo counter these challenges, we created Spotify Lite: a smaller version of our unparalleled music experience, offering users a reliable way to fully enjoy their favourite music in areas with limited bandwidth, or if they have limited phone storage, and even if they do not have the latest smartphones,\u201d Okumu states.\n\nAfrobeat is not waiting for Nigeria\n\nDespite the challenges the industry faces, stakeholders say the dominance of Afrobeats is just beginning and does not necessarily need to wait for Nigeria to achieve new heights.\n\nLove Nwantiti, an Afrobeat song by Ckay, described as the biggest-ever hit song out of Africa by Bloomberg after it became the first song from Africa to top YouTube\u2019s list of the most-watched music videos with 104.7 million streams. Ckay is also the first African artiste to appear on any of the top 25 lists for Bloomberg\u2019s Pop Star Power Rankings in October.\n\nOn September 11, 2021, Love Nwantiti became the No 1 song on Shazam\u2019s global charts. The chart tracks the most-searched songs in the world and ranks them on a chart.\n\nExcel Joab told BusinessDay in September that Ckay could grow bigger than he already is. However, he thinks Wizkid could get a second Grammy for his song Essence. RollingStone also projects Wizkid\u2019s Essence as one of the top contenders for a major category in the Grammy.\n\n\u201cWizkid\u2019s Made in Lagos has cracked the US via the power of Essence, and the album is getting nominations within their local award circuit. It is been nominated for Album of the Year at the Soul Train awards, further cementing its place in the African music hall of fame,\u201d says Joey Akan, CEO of Afrobeats Intelligence.\n\nWhile the artistes rise globally, experts say Nigeria would only benefit if internet connection is addressed. But Fela wherever he is would likely sleep peacefully knowing the light he lit many years ago is burning more brightly than ever.",

RollingStone also projects Wizkid\u2019s Essence as one of the top contenders for a major category in the Grammy.\n\n\u201cWizkid\u2019s Made in Lagos has cracked the US via the power of Essence, and the album is getting nominations within their local award circuit. It is been nominated for Album of the Year at the Soul Train awards, further cementing its place in the African music hall of fame,\u201d says Joey Akan, CEO of Afrobeats Intelligence.\n\nWhile the artistes rise globally, experts say Nigeria would only benefit if internet connection is addressed.

          "summary": "The year 2020 was particularly a defining moment for the Nigerian music industry in terms of announcing itself on the global stage.\nIt had 25 million streams on YouTube; 50.2 million on Audiomack; 34.5 million on Spotify; 18.4 million on Music Africa; 31 million on Music World, and Boomplay 10.5 million.\nOn the global music boards, Twice as Tall topped various charts, peaking at No 1 in the World Albums category on Billboard charts.\nThe Billboard Hot 100 is the music industry standard rating in the United States for songs published weekly by Billboard Magazine.\nSmartphone penetration is also at 46 percent, which means millions of Nigerians are not able to join the music afrobeat party or experience the growing strength of afrobeats artistes around the world.",

          "text": "The global music streaming market has been a gold discovery for many Nigerian music artists as it presents limitless opportunities to reach a world they would have never thought possible. But challenges such as inadequate internet infrastructure, low income, and piracy remain hurdles in fully harnessing the potential of this new market.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers projects that Nigeria would be the world\u2019s fastest-growing entertainment and media market (E&M) with a 12.1 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over a five-year period (2017-2021).\n\nThe report also says that the total revenue that will be generated by all the players in Nigeria\u2019s E&M industry is expected to rise from $7.68 billion in 2021 to $9.03 billion in 2022, to $10.66 billion in 2023, and will increase further to $12.56 billion in 2024 before settling at $14.82 billion by 2025, culminating to an average growth rate of 18 percent during that period.\n\nThe streaming services such as Boomplay, Spotify, Audiomack, YouTube, etc are enabling an environment in which Nigerian creatives including music artists of all genres can not only reach a wide audience but also monetise their content. Before now the only way an artist could earn money was to be invited to perform in a music show or sell their songs to marketers at Alaba or Onitsha.\n\nAn expert in one of the streaming services who pleaded anonymity said streaming music started when a new group of artists that called themselves Alt\u00e9 Kids came on the scene. These artists started putting their songs on SoundCloud, a Swedish-founded audio distribution and music sharing platform. Their bold move made their songs popular and helped them reach more people compared to existing distribution channels. They later collaborated with blogs and magazines like Native Mag which had a diaspora audience. This proved to be a major turning point in music distribution and the streaming market which saw increased adoption.\n\nExperts have also noted the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the growth in the streaming market. The PwC report noted that the internet access revenue segment in Nigeria is expected to gain more market share in the next few years as a result of the growth in streaming adoption.\n\nRead Also: Spotify reveals Nigeria\u2019s top music cities, songs they love\n\nAdoption has brought visibility for many music artists in Nigeria. A list from Spotify puts Ckay the artist behind Love Nwantiti as the top streamed artist on Spotify in October 2021 with 7.62 million.\n\nOther artists in the top ten list include Wizkid (2.85 million); Burna Boy (2.83 million); Tems (1.72 million); Davido (710,500); Mr Eazi (619,100); Omay Lay (517,700); Rema (513,800); Joeboy (474,700); and Fireboy (417,000).\n\nCKay\u2019s Love Nwantiti remix with Joeboy and Kuami Eugene was the No 1 top song on YouTube with 69.6 million views as of the time of writing this article in November 2021. In the same month, Wizkid\u2019s Made in Lagos album peaked at No 4 on the Billboard World Albums Chart.\n\n\u201cIt peaked at No 1 and has expanded 51 weeks on the chart,\u201d Chart Africa, a firm that monitors the activities of African music across different platforms in the world, noted on Tuesday.\n\nFor many music artists in Nigeria music streaming is the best thing that happened to the industry and could be the future. Streaming, therefore, presents a lifeline to artists who continue to battle piracy.\n\n\u201cPiracy is one of the most common issues in the music industry, across almost all countries. As such, when Spotify enters new markets, education becomes a key driver. It is important for us to work with partners such as creators and the media to educate users on the benefits of legally streaming music and the positive impact that this has for creators and the economy,\u201d Phiona Okumu, Head of Music, sub-Saharan Africa, Spotify told BusinessDay.\n\nCurrently, the largest streaming service in Africa and Nigeria is Boomplay which has over 74 million users as of June 2021. However, the landscape is expanding with new investors like Spotify, Audiomack, and Amazon expanding their portfolio. Spotify, valued at $50 billion with over 345 million monthly active listeners, said launching in new markets like Nigeria is the next step to fulfilling its ongoing commitment to building a truly borderless audio ecosystem.\n\nDespite the boom, streaming however faces a difficult task in terms of conversion of consumers due to internet quality and dwindling income levels. Mobile penetration is at 40 percent with the coverage of 3G network below 60 percent and 4G at about 30 percent.\n\nNigeria is also on the list of countries where citizens work the most to buy 1GB of data. Nigerians have to work 33 hours 42 minutes to afford the cheapest broadband internet in a month, according to data from Surfshark. The global average is three hours 48 minutes a month.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics report on poverty puts the number of Nigerians living in extreme poverty at over 80 million. With the average Nigerian working 40 hours per week, it means they commit a total of 160 hours per month. In essence, 80 million Nigerians putting in about 160 hours to earn N30,000 per month, means each person earns an hourly wage of about N187.5. This is still less than the cheapest 1GB sold for N200.\n\nBut industry experts like Ogaga Sakpaide, a music executive and artist and repertoire consultant say streaming is the future of the music industry.\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing history and change and it is something that is amazing to watch. I just hope that in the future everyone will be able to stream music and everyone will be able to consume music,\u201d Sakpaide said.",

Buhari also used the opportunity to voice his deep-rooted desires to boost Nigeria\u2019s National Infrastructure Stock.\n\nBuhari made his feelings known in Glasgow at the COP26 high-level side event on improving global infrastructure hosted by President Joe Biden of the United States, EU Commission President, Von Der Leyen, and the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, on Nov. 2.\n\nAccording to Nigerian leader, over 1.5 trillion dollars is needed by Nigeria over a 10-year period, to achieve an appreciable level of the National Infrastructure Stock.\n\nBuhari, who had earlier delivered his national statement at COP26 Leaders\u2019 Summit in Glasgow, Scotland, on Tuesday, said:\n\n\u2018\u2018My administration has established a clear legal and regulatory framework for private financing of infrastructure to establish a standard process, especially on the monitoring and evaluation process.\n\n\u2018\u2018We look forward to working with you in this regard.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe also declared that his administration had taken infrastructure expansion in Nigeria seriously, conscious of the fact that new investments in critical sectors of the economy would aid lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty by 2030.\n\n\u2018\u2018There is a nexus between infrastructure development and the overall economic development of a nation.\n\n\u2018\u2018My administration identified this early enough as a major enabler of sustainable economic development and the realisation of other continental and global development aspirations particularly the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n\u2018\u2018On my assumption of office in 2015, Nigeria faced a huge infrastructure deficit and the total National Infrastructure Stock was estimated at 35% of our Gross Domestic Product.\u201d\n\nWhile delivering his national statement to world leaders, the President pledged that Nigeria would cut its emissions to net zero by 2060.\n\nHe said that attaining national and global climate change goals would require adequate and sustained technical and financial support to developing countries.\n\nAccording to him, greater effort should be channelled towards assisting developing nations to meet their \u2018\u2018Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) commitments through the pledges made by the developed countries to provide at least $100 billion yearly.\u2019\u2019\n\nBuhari noted that easier access to climate finance had become imperative in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, which really battered the economies of developing countries.\n\n\u2018\u2018I do not think anyone in Nigeria needs persuading of the need for urgent action on the environment.\n\n\u2018\u2018Desertification in the North, floods in the centre, pollution and erosion on the coast are enough evidence.\n\n\u2018\u2018For Nigeria, climate change is not about the perils of tomorrow but what is happening today.\n\n\u201dNigeria is committed to net zero by 2060.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe president had on Nov. 1 at an event, co-hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron, the Prince of Wales, and the Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, maintained that \u201dAfrica\u2019s ambition of restoring over 100 million hectares of degraded landscape for productive agriculture is achievable\u201d.\n\nThe president expressed optimism at the Climate Change Summit, COP26, side event on the Great Green Wall (GGW).\n\nThe Nigerian leader said it was noteworthy that the meeting was tailored towards ameliorating the problems of land degradation, desertification, depletion of the forest ecosystems and biodiversity in Africa.\n\nThe president, who was speaking on the theme of the event, \u201cAccelerating land restoration in Africa, the case of the Great Green Wall initiative\u201d, said:\n\n\u2018\u2018With all hands on deck and concerted efforts at land restoration by African leaders, I am optimistic that Africa\u2019s ambition of restoring over 100 million hectares of degraded landscape for productive agriculture is achievable.\n\n\u2018\u2018Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to inform you that Nigeria will soon be assuming the leadership of Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Pan African Agency of the Great Green Wall.\u201d\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that American billionaire and founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, had also on Nov. 1 in Glasgow, Scotland, commended Buhari\u2019s leadership role in restoring degraded lands in the country.\n\nBezos described the commitment of the Nigerian leader to restore 4 million hectares as exemplary.\n\nBezos joined Buhari, French President Emmanuel Macron, Prince Charles and the Mauritanian President, Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, at a COP26 side event entitled, \u201cAccelerating land restoration in Africa, the case of the Great Green Wall (GGW) initiative\u201d.\n\nWhile heaping praises on the Nigerian leader at the event co-hosted by the French President, his Mauritanian counterpart and the Prince of Wales, the Amazon founder said: \u201cWe are fortunate to have President Buhari of Nigeria with us today.\n\n\u201cNigeria plays a critical role in the restoration movement and has pledged to restore 4 million hectares of degraded lands.\n\n\u201cThis kind of ambition coming from Africa\u2019s largest economy underscores just how vital this issue is.\u201d\n\nThe Bezos Earth Fund has 10 billion dollars to allocate money to projects fighting climate change.\n\nBefore departing for the COP26 in Glasgow, Buhari had commiserated with families who lost loved ones in the 21-storey building collapse in Lagos.\n\nBuhari shared the sad moment with people and Government of Lagos State, calling on emergency institutions, including hospitals, to provide all the necessary support to safeguard the lives of the rescued.\n\nThe president had also hosted the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Sen. Bola Tinubu, at his official residence, State House, Abuja, on Oct. 31.\n\nSpeaking to State House correspondents after the closed door meeting, Tinubu dismissed the insinuation that he was in the presidential villa to discuss politics with the president.\n\nHe, however, stated that his Sunday\u2019s mission to the seat of power was to thank Buhari for visiting him when he was recovering from a surgery at his residence in London.\n\nHe said: \u201dI came only to thank, first of all, the president for his visit to my residence in London when I was \u2026\u2026after the surgery, and wishing me well, lifting my spirit.\n\n\u201dIndeed, what an exceptional leader will do.\n\n\u201dThat\u2019s what I came for and to welcome him back from the trip from Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201dNo politics, just courtesy call, thanking him in a big way, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nThe president had on Aug. 13 visited the APC chieftain in London.\n\nNAN reports that the president also received briefing from the Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Awwal Gambo, at the Presidential Villa on Sunday.\n\nOn Nov. 5, Buhari had expressed deep shock and grief over the killing of 69 people in Niger Republic by insurgents on the country\u2019s common border with Mali and Burkina Fasso.\n\nHe said: \u201dThis dastardly and callous attack on innocent people, including a mayor in Niger Republic, is a disturbing setback to the regional efforts to stem terrorist activities that have caused massive destructions in our countries.\u201d\n\nThe president on Nov. 6 also condoled with the government and people of Sierra Leone, following the fuel tanker explosion in Freetown, the country\u2019s capital, where at least 100 people were killed and many injured.\n\nThe tragic incident happened late on Friday when a fuel tanker exploded following a collision, and many people rushed to the scene to siphon petrol.\n\nThe Nigerian leader said: \u201dI\u2019m anguished by the unfortunate loss of lives and injury to so many.\u201d\n\nNAN also reports that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo had on Nov. 7 attended the meeting of the Nigeria-Cote d\u2019Ivoire Binational Commission where he signed agreements with Ivorian Prime Minister, Patrick Achi.\n\nThe signing of agreements was at the high level segment of the Second Session of the Nigeria-Cote d\u2019Ivoire Bi-National Commission on Saturday in Abidjan, Cote d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nOsinbajo thanked Achi for his excellent leadership in hosting and co-steering the 2nd session of the Nigeria-Cote d\u2019Ivoire Bi-National Commission to a successful outcome.\n\nHe said that Achi\u2019s opening remarks were certainly very important for setting the tone and ensuring that objectives of the meeting were achieved.\n\nThe vice president also expressed gratitude to President Alhassane Ouattara for granting him and his delegation audience earlier and for giving both sides very wise and insightful guidance on how to deepen relations between the two countries.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian delegation on its part is quite happy with the outcomes especially the Agreements that we have signed on this occasion,\u201d he added.\n\nNAN reports that Buhari will this week pay an official visit to Paris, France, to reciprocate an earlier one to Nigeria by the French President, Emmanuel Macron, and also attend the Paris Peace Forum 2021.\n\nThe Paris Peace Forum will be the fourth edition to be hosted by the French President.\n\n\u201dIt will have Heads of State and Government and CEOs of major multinationals as well as several civil society actors, gathering to advance concrete solutions to the enormous challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and to improve global governance in times of COVID-19.\n\n\u201dThe Summit will focus on spurring a more solid and inclusive recovery by addressing the various gaps in global governance, offering initiatives to better tend to the global commons and putting forward new principles of action for the post-COVID world,\u201d the president\u2019s media aide, Malam Garba Shehu, had said in a statement.\n\nHe revealed that while the president is in Paris, the Nigerian government would organise the Nigeria-Paris Forum.\n\nAccording to him, the event is expected to pull a crowd of Nigerian and French investors, government and business leaders, diplomats and the media in the hope of showcasing opportunities on both sides.\n\nShehu expressed optimism that the event would also bring enlightenment to bear on the prevailing security, economic and investment climate in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the presidential aide, Buhari is expected back in the country after the engagements.\n\n...",

          "title": "Nothing is working in Osun under APC administration \u2013 Sunday Bisi",
          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun State, Hon. Sunday Bisi has said nothing is working in the state in the last three years of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola\u2019s regime, as according to him, virtually all sectors have collapsed.\n\nHon. Bisi said the current APC leadership has put the state under security malady considering the incessant robbery attacks bedeviling her in the recent time.\n\nThe PDP Chairman who stated this while feilding questions from the journalist in Osogbo over the weekend, regretted that peace has deserted the state, as banks no longer function in most parts.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like peace in Osun State under this APC administration if we have to tell ourselves the truth. There are incessant armed robbery attacks. Iragbiji, Okuku, Ila, Iree, everywhere, there is no bank that\u2019s functioning there now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLook at what our people in Osun central are facing presently whereby they cannot do any banking transaction unless they come to Osogbo. Which kind of peace do we call that?\n\n\u201cUp till now, the governor and his men have not told us the location of the security helicopter which was purchased by tax payers money in Osun and which should have been deployed against dare devil armed robbers and banditry that have ravaged the state.We are using this medium to ask them to provide the helicopter they use our tax payers to procure.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking on the preparedness of his party to wrestle power from APC in the coming governorship election in the state, Hon. Bisi said with the successful conclusion of the recent state and national congresses, the end of the APC and Governor Gboyega Oyetola\u2019s tenure was near.\n\nBisi boasted that there was no doubt about the fact that the people of the state have seen the PDP as a better alternative because of what he described as \u201cpoor performance of the ruling All Progressives Congress in the last ten years\u201d.\n\nHe noted that for the past three years no any tangible project could be pointed out to by the present administration describing the three years of Governor Gboyega Oyetola as \u201cthree years of wasted resources\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe had a successful convention in Abuja and all of us were together. So talking about any rift again. We are now one big united family in PDP in Osun and in Nigeria. There is no rift in our party now, all those things have been settled and they are gone.\n\n\u201cAll issues concerning Osun PDP have been settled by the grace of God and decisions taken at the national convention. The Congresses held in Osun, which were earlier passed by the National working Committee, were also ratified at the national convention, the highest decision making level of the party.\n\n\u201cI can tell you for free that Osun PDP is now one big family. All components of the party from bottom to top are all working together as we speak. All members of national assembly under the banners of our party are all working together with me to move the party forward.\n\n\u201cWe are going to defeat APC in the coming gubernatorial election in the state. We are going to rescue the people of Osun State. I want to urge the people of Osun to please continue to endure because it remain just a year.\n\n\u201cThree years of wasteful resources, even the projects they inherited from Aregbesola, they have never done anything on it. The Ilesa Garage , Dele yessir road, they have been on that road for the past ten years .\n\n\u201cOyetola was there as one of those who bastardized Osun State in all the years of APC misrule. He was there when Pensioners and workers were owed 33months without any sign of paying the the people concerned. So he has no basis to exonerate himself from whatever destruction his party perpetrated against the state.\n\n\u201cThe bridge at Olaiya is another disaster being foisted on Osun by Oyetola and the Apc administration contrary to what was promoted in the media with all sorts of graphics. Osun State cannot afford to continue with such a fraudulent Government.\n\n\u201cThe bridge they are constructing is just a one way bridge. We have never seen that kind of bridge in our lives. It had never happened in any state. We had traveled far and wide I mean in this country, I have gone to so many places, I have never seen this kind of bridge.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the recent Endorsements by various groups, Osun PDP Chairman said: \u201cIt\u2019s because there is nothing concrete to show as achievements that why Governor Gboyega Oyetola is begging People to come and endorse him.\n\n\u201cFor good three years Oyetola doesn\u2019t have things that he could show as his achievements nothing to showcase for the person who have been in the Government for three years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not feeling intimidated by his endorsement at all. You are in Osun State through out last week when the pensioners were protesting the non payment of their pension Arrears , won\u2019t that affect him in the Election? You are talking about the people that have been induced to come and stagemanage a kind of endorsement is that one endorsement.\n\n\u201cForget about this induced Endorsements that we are having here and there. Where were those people in 2018 when he was floored. He is going to be defeated again flat . He would be defeated hands down\n\n\u201cWhat happened in 2018 cannot happen again, because we\u2019re going to defeat him with wide margin. You can only rig when you\u2019re popular . This time around we would win them with wide margin,\u201d he affirmed.\n\nOn the rumoured defection of party members to the ruling APC, Hon Bisi posited that no right thinking person will leave PDP and go and join APC in the state.\n\n\u201cNo one with his senses will leave PDP for APC. The party that\u2019s in disarray. As we\u2019re speaking now, they have two party Chairmen. Alhaji Abdulrasak Salinsile and Prince Gboyega Famodun are both laying claim to the Chairmanship position in the state.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if PDP was still strong enough to defeat APC come 2022, Hon Bisi insisted, he said: \u201cThe last time after the exit of former Governor Isiaka Adeleke, PDP presented Senator Ademola Adeleke for senatorial Election and we won with margin. We won nine out of the ten local governments when Aregbesola was the sitting Governor of the state.\n\n\u201cAnd the last Gubernatorial election in 2018 , Senator Ademola Adeleke contested again against Oyetola, the incumbent, and he defeated him at the first ballot before the inconclusive thing was introduced. Something we had never heard before.\n\n\u201cWe defeated them that time and President Muhammad Buhari said PDP was defeated in Osun through the use of remove control. So, we are virile, we are able , we are agile and I\u2019m promising you that comes July 16 we are going to floor APC in the next Governorship election,\u201d he concluded.",

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nIt is getting increasingly likely that the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Chukwuma Soludo will emerge as the winner of the yet-to-be concluded Anambra State governorship election which commenced on Saturday.\n\nSoludo, who had earlier amassed more votes in each of the earlier announced six local government areas, has also led his opponents in two additional local government areas \u2013 Agwuata and Orumba North.\n\nHe won Andy Uba of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Valentine Ozigbo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Aguata LGA, the three top contenders\u2019 native council. But the three gladiators had won in their respective polling units.\n\nIn a very likely event of the direction of victory remaining till the announcement of the final result, Soludo will begin to receive congratulatory messages for realizing an age-long dream of occupying the number one political office of Anambra State.\n\nIn a clime where corruption scandal is a common tag for public office holders, maintaining a spotless public image years after a five-year term of overseeing Nigeria\u2019s number one treasury house is not a common feat. That is the story of the last but one governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nSince leaving the CBN top job, the 60-year old professor of Economics has remained a star, meaning different things to different people who view him from the angles of excellence, integrity, performance or the rest of his core values.\n\nAs CBN governor, he demystified the banking sector, performing what most Nigerians thought was impossible, including the banking sector reform, a revolutionary recapitalization exercise that pruned operators with less than N25 billion capital base off the nation\u2019s banking landscape. The motive was to put an end to hitherto recurring bank liquidations that saw customers losing hard-earned deposits.\n\nThere is no gainsaying that the multiplier effect of that historic step was phenomenal as thousands of people secured jobs in the bigger banks that eventually emerged; many more jobs were created in companies financed by these bigger banks just as thousands of small, medium and large enterprises saw opportunities to access credit facilities from the banks. Also, hundreds of people that now have bureau de change and microfinance bank licenses, among others, owe their gratitude to the ingenuity of this radical economic thinker.\n\nSoludo served the federal government as chief economic adviser to former President Olusegum Obasanjo and chief executive officer of National Planning Commission during which he authored the economic agenda of the government called NEEDS.\n\nMany years down the line, the nation has not stopped tapping from his wealth of experience. Soludo currently serves as a member of the Economic Advisory Council (EAC) appointed by President Mohammadu Buhari, to replace the Economic Management Team of the federal government.\n\nEAC\u2019s mandate is to advise the president on economic policy matters, including fiscal analysis, economic growth and a range of internal and global economic issues working with the relevant cabinet members and heads of monetary and fiscal agencies.\n\nAn eminent patriot, Soludo has continued to contribute to nation building, taking positions on issues of serious national importance and proffering solutions to economic problems. For instance, in 2017, he insisted that Nigeria must take steps to eliminate the regime of multiple exchange rates, advising that the difference between the then official and parallel market exchange rates of the naira must be reduced to three to five per cent.\n\nOn the ravaging Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the erudite professor argued that it was wrong to adopt the \u2018cut and paste\u2019 approach to mitigating the pandemic in Nigeria and Africa. He advised African leaders to re-assess the total lockdown, insisting that the continent could not sustain a total economic shutdown. Arguing that the structures to support the lockdown in most African countries do not exist, he maintained that African leaders cannot continue to shut in citizens without food.\n\nWith a distinction in the West African School Certificate (WASC) from the Uga Boys Secondary School in Anambra State, a first class honours in Economics, MSc, PhD in Economics from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka and promoted professor at the age of 38, having met the requirements to be professor at 32, Soludo has proved to be a gifted solution provider to social and economic problems of the world in general and Nigeria in particular.\n\nA world class technocrat and scholar, Soludo had lived in Ethiopia, United Kingdom, USA and travelled to 45 other countries around the world as consultant to countries and about 20 international development and financial institutions even before the federal government called him to serve Nigeria. His advice saved many countries and created millions of jobs. His is a story of a man who has earned his place as a global citizen and still remains a humble village boy as he prefers to call himself.\n\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that the world has honoured him with scores of awards among which was the best governor of the central bank in Africa and in the world at the time. Even many years after leaving office, Soludo is still recognized as one of the 100 most influential Africans. In Nigeria, he has received over 100 awards and honours, including the third highest national honour, Commander of the Order of the Federal Republic (CFR).\n\nFormer President Obasanjo once described him as \u201cone of the leading lights of our nation whose leadership qualities are admirable and his willingness to listen and learn is simply infectious\u201d.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

What happened in the Anambra State governorship election is a confirmation of the fact that the party vied off the original plan but all that can be remedied,\u201d Nwosu stated.",

Apart from that, technology and digital transformation is not just a megatrend, it underpins all the other megatrends in finance, engineering, and climate action which is topical right now.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn the Bank\u2019s disbursement, she informed that \u201cThe Bank has since it started operations in 2017 given out loans to over 180,000 small businesses amounting to over N400b in various sectors of the economy and a lot of that is to tech-based start-ups. In 2020, DBN disbursed N190 billion, and 7,000 of those SMEs were accessing funding for the first time. This shows how important this event is to us, and the commitment of the Bank to alleviating the financing constraints faced by MSMSEs.\u201d\n\nOzulumba added that \u201cOur three-fold mandate is lending, providing partial credit guarantee, and capacity building. The capacity-building aspect is why we are having this summit today,\u201d\n\nDelivering his keynote address, serial investor and MD/Co-founder, Trans-Sahara Investment Corporation, and newly appointed MD/CEO Africa Operations, Inlaks Limited, Kyari Bukar tasked Nigerian techie minds and techpreneurs on developing knowledge-based local solutions that have a universal appeal and can put Nigerian on the global technology table.\n\n\u201cTechnpreneurship is about finding solutions, and the solutions better be local and should also have universal appeal. What is happening globally is that factor-based economics are becoming irrelevant, I don\u2019t mean they are dead, I am saying they are not exciting as they used to be. Today, everybody talks about a knowledge-based economy. The beauty of tech is that it is the number one catalyst in changing the way we do things. An example is the digitalization of the way we conduct business today,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting the exploits of India in the global technology landscape, the renowned investor, who started his career at the famous Silicon Valley further stated that Nigeria needs to stop relying on the wealth derived from mineral resources.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe need to change our dependence on what we pick or drill from the surface of the earth and believe that will make us wealthy, it is wrong. India is exporting $60b a year in software solutions and services. Though Africa is coming late to the party, we can develop unique solutions ourselves. The whole world is watching us and ready to invest in us. Whether the government is there or not, when you have the will to create and sell convenience, all you need are strong believers and support.\u201d\n\nBukar who is also an Independent Director on the Board of DBN, appreciated the Bank for organizing the Techpreneur Summit, saying it showed the Bank\u2019s readiness to partner techpreneurs in the county.\n\n\u201cFor DBN, I say this Summit is the coming-out party in the tech space. This is one space I believe in, and we would continue to be a partner to Techpreneurs. And DBN is ready to be such a partner to all Techpreneurs in the country. This is the first DBN Techpreneur Summit, and I know that we will continue this every year. Additionally, when I asked around, I found out that this summit is not just about having a conversation like this, it is for Techpreneurs to find the necessary network, and more importantly access to finance on both sides of debt and equity. This shows that DBN is ready to be such a partner to all Techpreneurs in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nOther discussants at the summit include Iyin Aboyeji (Founder, Future Africa); Yemi Keri (co-Founder, RisingTideAfrica/ Independent Non-Executive Director, FCMB); Charles Anyanwu (Director, Strategy, Funding & Stakeholder Management, LSETF); Temie Giwa-Tubosun (Founder, Life Bank) and Judith Okonkwo (Founder, Imisi 3D).\n\nThe Development Bank of Nigeria Plc is a wholesale development finance institution, established by the Federal Government of Nigeria in collaboration with global development partners (The World Bank, AfDB, KfW, AFD, and EIB) to address the major financing challenges facing Micro, Small, and Medium Scale Enterprises (MSMEs) in Nigeria.",

          "text": "Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), believes no one knows what the future holds for Nigeria or the 2023 elections.\n\nHe said this to the crowd during the church\u2019s November Thanksgiving ceremony on Sunday.\n\nAdeboye questioned politicians who are already planning for the 2023 elections, emphasizing that the future is in God\u2019s hands.\n\nThe pastor questioned why someone would declare their ambition is to become president when they have no idea what will happen tomorrow or whether the country would continue to exist.\n\nAdeboye said, \u201cThis is 2021, some people are already getting ready to kill themselves over 2023. They don\u2019t even know whether there will be 2023, they don\u2019t even know whether they will still be around. There is nobody here who can say for sure that he will still be around by tomorrow. It is God who determines who will still be around by 2023.\n\n\u201cSomeone said to me, sir, who do you think will be president in 2023, I said the president of where? He said the president of Nigeria. How are you sure there will be Nigeria in 2023? How are you sure? Can you swear? I pray there will be Nigeria, so you don\u2019t misquote me. But are you sure?\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking on the topic, \u2018Great Expectations\u2019, Adeboye said his expectation would be to see many members of his church in heaven, while hoping that a section would be earmarked for them.\n\nHe said, \u201cMy greatest expectation is that I will see you in heaven. The members of Redeemed will occupy a particular section that the angel will say you tried. Without holiness, there is no Heaven. Which Heaven are you going to?\u201d\n\nAdeboye also prayed for those who are currently under the rubble of the 21-storey building that collapsed in the Ikoyi area of Lagos State last Monday and also prayed for consolation for the bereaved.\n\nThe 79-year old preacher stressed that having lost a family member, he has a clearer picture of what it is to mourn.\n\n\u201cIt is easy to say you will see the person again because I have tasted it.

          "text": "Following many allegations of severe misconduct and abuse of power, the Speaker of the Imo State House of Assembly, Paul Emeziem, was impeached on Monday.\n\nThe previous Speaker was, however, illegally impeached, according to reports.\n\nHe was claimed to have been impeached when only 8 members of the House of Representatives voted to do so.\n\nKennedy Ibeh, the member representing the Obowo State Constituency, was sworn in as Speaker of the Imo State House of Assembly immediately.\n\nThe development comes amid growing efforts to restore Amarachi Chyna Iwuanyanwu, the impeached Deputy Speaker.\n\nOn Tuesday, November 2, 2021, 18 of the 27 lawmakers in the chambers impeached Iwuanyanwu.\n\nAccording to SaharaReporters, Iwuanyanwu invaded the House on Monday with some security agents to guarantee the Speaker, Emeziem, was impeached.\n\nAccording to sources, when the Speaker learned of the intended removal, he rushed to the House of Assembly but was denied entry by security officers.\n\nOne of the sources said, \u201cThe Speaker has been impeached. The Impeached Deputy Speaker, Iwuanyanwu and some security operatives stormed the House\n\n\u201cOnly 8 lawmakers removed the Speaker in a House of 27 lawmakers. Iwuanyanwu is close to the governor and believed to have the governor\u2019s backing. And that was why the security operatives were even with the deputy speaker, and stormed the House together with him.\n\n\u201cThey removed the speaker with 8 lawmakers and put Kennedy Ibeh of Obowo state Constituency there.\u201d\n\nEmeziem was allegedly tear-gassed and beaten up by the security operatives on the order of Iwuanyanwu who is said to have the backing of the governor, Hope Uzodinma.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the impeachment of the Deputy Speaker had been in the offing for a long time after reports of gross misconduct and insubordination levelled against him by some of his colleagues.\n\nSources said Iwuanyanwu, representing Nwangele State Constituency, was generally seen as bringing disrepute to the House because of his numerous pending cases with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.\n\n\u201cAlso, he does pride himself as the de-facto Speaker,\u201d one of the sources had told SaharaReporters.\n\nHe was also accused of being high-handed and brash.\n\nHe was said to have used his closeness to Governor Uzodinma to obstruct other lawmakers from accessing executive council members and truncating the passage of populist bills.\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported how Iwuanyanwu\u2019s impeachment was preceded by the recall of six suspended lawmakers after about four months.\n\nThe suspended six lawmakers who were recalled were Hon Uche Ogbuagu (APC, Ikeduru), Dominic Ezerioha (APC, Oru West), Micheal Crown (APC, Ihitte Uboma), Kennedy Ibe (APC, Obowo) Anyadike Nwosu, ( PDP, Ezinihitte Mbaise), and Phillip Ejiogu (PDP, Owerri North).\n\nTheir recall also had to with insinuations that the former Deputy Speaker made attempts to hijack their allowances and salaries while they were on suspension.\n\nAfter his impeachment, there have been moves by Iwuanyanwu to return to his former position through the backdoor, sparking outrage in the state, the sources added.\n\nIwuanyanwu is said to be fighting hard, especially using his connections in the Imo State Government House, to restore his position.\n\nReacting to the controversial issue, a former media adviser to Ex-governor Rochas Okorocha, Sam Onuwemedo said, \u201cIwuanyanwu could only return as deputy speaker if any court of competent jurisdiction quashes the impeachment, or, 2/3 of the Assembly members re-electing him as Deputy Speaker.\n\n\u201cAgain, since the impeachment followed the constitutional requirement of two-thirds of the members signing, the provision could also be used in giving him relief or, bringing him back.\n\n\u201cTwo-thirds of members could also sign and come up with a motion, to vitiate or eclipse or submerge or upturn or reverse the impeachment. These are some of the processes, the man could come back as deputy speaker.\n\n\u201cComing back as the Deputy Speaker of the House, without any of the aforementioned processes being followed, could be threatened with litigations or could give room for a plethora of court actions, even by non-members of the Assembly.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some lawmakers who spoke to SaharaReporters on condition of anonymity insisted that the removal of Iwuanyanwu followed due process, while vowing to resist any attempt to return the impeached Deputy Speaker through the backdoor.\n\nOne of the lawmakers said, \u201cAmarachi stands impeached. Any attempt to foist him on us will be met with stiff resistance. If he feels aggrieved over his removal, he should approach the courts for a reprieve. But, as it is, I can tell you confidently that he won\u2019t smell that position again because his removal is popular in the House, and also across party lines.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision to remove him is unilateral and cannot be reversed. Any attempt to get the governor to reinstall him will fail woefully. He should return to the House and stop distracting us from the legislative business we were elected to do.\n\n\u201cThere is a resolution where 18 lawmakers agreed and signed to impeach him. It was raised as a point of order. What this means is that all legislative requirements to impeach him were strictly adhered to and cannot be faulted.\n\n\u201cBut, if he feels he has a case, he should head to a competent court of law instead of trying to force his way back into the position,\u201d Another lawmaker told SaharaReporters.\n\nA Government House source added that the embattled former Deputy Speaker had been a regular face in the seat of power in the last few days.\n\nIwuanyanwu is said to be putting pressure on the governor to arm-twist his colleagues to accept him back as the number two man in the House.\n\n\u201cOne of the Governor\u2019s closest aides and the former Deputy Speaker has continued to threaten and in some cases offer money to some of the 18 members of the House who signed the impeachment to rescind their signatures,\u201d the source told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cDespite the pressure, the governor is being careful not to disrupt the relative peace in the House by insisting on the reinstatement of Amarachi. One thing is clear, the lawmakers are hell-bent on sticking to their decision and this has put the governor in a dilemma.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me, Amarachi should accept that he is no longer popular among his colleagues and he better accepts his fate and works towards repairing the damages he has done in the House. If push comes to shove, Hope will abandon him and move on.\u201d",

          "text": "The governorship candidate of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), Professor Chukwuma Charles Soludo, has won 17 out of twenty-one local government areas (LGAs) of Anambra state, according to results of November 6 poll announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Sunday in Awka.\n\nSoludo won in Anambra East, Ayamelum, Oyi, Dunukofia, Anaocha, Awka South, Idemili South, Onitsha South, Njikoka, Orumba South, Awka North, Anambra West, Nnewi South, Ekwusigo, Idemili North, Onitsha North, and Onitsha South LGAs.\n\nBut the candidates of Young Progressive Party (YPP), Senator Ifeanyi Ubah, won in his home local government area-Nnewi North, just as his counterparts in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Valentine Ozigbo won at Ogbaru local government area where Senator Stella Odua, who recently defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) hails from.\n\nThere were no elections at Ihiala local government area due to late arrival of voting materials and other related issues, whereas results for Orumba North LGA was not announced following allegations by the Collation Officer, Dr Michael Otu that he was forced to sign it under duress.\n\nINEC also revealed that there were other polling units across all the local government areas where elections were either cancelled or not held due to pockets of violence, manipulations, absconding with result sheets, over voting and failures of Bio modal voting machines among other challenges.\n\n\u2018I signed under duress\u2019\n\nThe Collation Officer for Orumba North LGA, which has 18 polling units and 93,608 registered voters, Dr Otu alleged he was forced to sign the results at Ajalli, the local government headquarters, under duress and coercion, even as he accused the EO of conniving with those that forced him to sign results against his wish.\n\n\u201cI signed the document under duress and coercion. I was surrounded by enemies who brought thugs to kill me. It was a very pathetic experience. First was police crisis that took place at the place, BVAS issues and mutilation of results sheets. I was held hostage in the toilet. At a time, a woman, the LG Chairman came and told me that I have to sign it because if she loses the election she will lose her job,\u201d Otu stated.\n\nHe lied \u2013 Umeh\n\nSenator Victor Umeh, the APGA state collation agent, however, refuted his claims and urged the INEC to declare the result, as according to him, election was conducted in the area without any issue and his party won.\n\nResponding, the INEC Returning Officer and Vice Chancellor, University of Calabar (UNICal), Professor Florence Obi, directed the Chairman of Academic Staff Union of University (ASUU) UNICal, Dr John Edong and others to re-collate the results before the very eyes of the collation agents and bring back the results to be announced.\n\nFinal results and pronouncements on the election were being awaited as at press time.\n\nPolice thumb up electorate\n\nMeanwhile, Anambra state Commissioner of Police Echeng Echeng has commended the people of the state for the peaceful conduct of Saturday\u2019s governorship election.\n\nEcheng told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Awka Sunday that he was impressed by the overall peace in the state during the election.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that we have witnessed one of the most peaceful elections in recent times in the country. I can beat my chest on that,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said there were no security breaches during the election.\n\n\u201cThe election was peaceful, and we had no incident of violence, ballot snatching or fighting in any polling unit in the state,\u201d he said.\n\nEcheng thanked security agencies in the state and said the seamless collaboration among them was the main reason for the peace experienced during the election.\n\n\u201cWe synergised with sister security agencies and made sure it was incident-free, we held meetings over a long period of time preparing for the election and it paid off,\u201d he said.\n\nThe police boss said the peaceful conduct of the election had proven that Anambra was one of the most peaceful states in the country.\n\n\u201d Prior to the election, I have been telling people that Anambra is one of the most peaceful states in the country and the peaceful conduct of the election has proven that,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, acknowledged that there were some hitches during the election due to the malfunctioning of some INECgadgets.\n\n\u201cWherever you have hitches during the election, it was not based on security problem, rather it was based on problems associated with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) equipment. I think we deserve commendation,\u201d he said.\n\nCSOs score NSCDC high\n\nSimilarly, a coalition of civil society and non-governmental organisations under the aegis of Coalition of Civil Society Organisations for Transparency and Accountability has commended the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and its leadership for the professional conduct of its officers and men deployed to Anambra state for the polls.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen in Abuja Sunday, spokesperson for the coalition, Comrade Sunday Attah, said the officers and men of the NSCDC engaged with voters, other security agents and citizens in the state with dignity, mutual respect and proficiency.\n\nThe coalition comprises several other sister organisations including; the Stand Up Nigeria Movement, Save Humanity Advocacy Centre, Nigeria Unite Against Corruption, Voice for Change Congress and Arewa Youths Federation.\n\nIt commended NSCDC Commandant General Dr Ahmed Audi for his top-to-bottom exemplary leadership style which puts professionalism, dedication to service and sacrifice at the forefront of his vision since assuming office.\n\nAttah, who led a team of CSOs to monitor the elections, noted that \u201cwith the preliminary reports from our officials on election monitoring and observation assignment in Anambra, we are satisfied that officers and men of the corps on ground in Anambra to forestall attacks on voters and ensure a hitch-free electoral process adhered strictly to the warning of the NSCDC boss that they should avoid excessive use of force and abide by all rules of engagement.\n\n\u201cWe recall that during a situational assessment visit to Anambra state ahead of the election, Dr Audi made it clear to his 20,000-strong NSCDC operatives deployed for the election to observe the highest level of professionalism, civility, decorum and respect for the rights of all voters coming out to exercise their franchise in order to elect the next governor for the state\u201d.\n\nAccording to Attah, \u201cIt is heart-warming; therefore, to note that the warning did not fall on deaf ears as men of the corps conducted themselves at the realm of professionalism throughout the election day.\u201d\n\nNYCN lauds corps members, others\n\nAlso, the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has commended the National Youth Service Corps members that served as ad-hoc electoral officials and security agencies during the election for their role in strengthening democracy in Nigeria.\n\nNYCN Vice President Akoshile Mukhtar gave the commendation Sunday in Abuja while speaking on the peaceful conduct of the election.\n\nHe said the corps members had proven that the youths can take charge of any national responsibility assigned to them at the state and national levels.\n\nHe said \u201can on- the- spot information has it that the election was conducted in a free and fair manner, while the corps members deployed for the election showed the highest level of professionalism and moral uprightness.\n\n\u201cNo NYSC member was fingered for any malpractice or unethical behaviour. On behalf of the NYCN, l appreciate the corps members and refer to them as a true ambassadors of the Nigerian Youth.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, NYCN also commend our gallant men and women of the Nigeria Police Force for protecting Nigerians, especially the corps members during the electioneering process.\u201d\n\nAPGA leader lauds INEC\n\nIn a related development, a former National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Victor Umeh, has commended the INEC for the introduction of Bimodal Verification Accreditation System (BVAS).\n\nUmeh, who was the agent of the party\u2019s gubernatorial candidate in Saturday\u2019s election, said the deployment of the device made the process seamless.\n\nHe made the commendation in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Awka.\n\nUmeh said though the BVAS has its challenges, the device was good when compared to the card reader machine.\n\n\u201cYesterday, the BVAS device could not capture the fingerprints of older people and that reduced the number of people who apparently would have voted,\u201d he said.\n\nThe party chief said APGA was grateful to INEC and security operatives for the provision of a conducive environment for the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to God that the election was largely peaceful except for Ihiala where the Commission was unable to distribute the election materials due to some hiccups,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Umeh said he was at INEC state headquarters for the collation of election results, adding that the party was thankful to Anambra people for believing in her.\n\nBelow is the official INEC results of the exercise on local government by local government basis:\n\n(1) Dunukofia LGA\n\nAPC 1991\n\nAPGA 4124\n\nPDP 1680\n\nYPP 1360\n\n(2) Awka South LGA\n\nAPC 2595\n\nAPGA 12,891\n\nPDP 5498\n\nYPP 919\n\n(3) Oyi LGA\n\nAPC 2830\n\nAPGA 6133\n\nPDP 2484\n\nYPP 900\n\n(4) Ayamelum LGA\n\nAPC 2409\n\nAPGA 3424\n\nPDP 2804\n\nYPP 407\n\n(5) Anaocha LGA\n\nAPC 2085\n\nAPGA 6911\n\nPDP 5108\n\nYPP 868\n\n(6) Anambra East LGA\n\nAPC 2034\n\nAPGA 9747\n\nPDP 1380\n\nYPP 559\n\n(7) Idemili South LGA\n\nAPC 1039\n\nAPGA 2312\n\nPDP 2016\n\nYPP 752\n\n(8) Onitsha South LGA\n\nAPC 2050\n\nAPGA 4281\n\nPDP 2253\n\nYPP 271\n\n(9) Njikoka LGA\n\nAPC 3216\n\nAPGA 8803\n\nPDP 3409\n\nYPP 924\n\n(10) Nnewi North LGA\n\nAPC 1278\n\nAPGA 3369\n\nPDP 1511\n\nYPP 6485\n\n(11) Orumba South LGA\n\nAPC 2060\n\nAPGA 4394\n\nPDP 1672\n\nYPP 887\n\n(12) Ogbaru LGA\n\nAPC 1178\n\nAPGA 3051\n\nPDP 3445\n\nYPP 484\n\n(13) Onitsha North LGA\n\nAPC 3909\n\nAPGA 5587\n\nPDP 3781\n\nYPP 682\n\n(14) Aguata LGA\n\nAPC 4773\n\nAPGA 9136\n\nPDP 3798\n\nYPP 1070\n\n(15) Ihiala LGA\n\nNo election\n\n(16) Idemili North LGA\n\nAPC 2291\n\nAPGA 5358\n\nPDP 2312\n\nYPP 902\n\n(17) Ekwusigo LGA\n\nAPC 1237\n\nAPGA 2570\n\nPDP 1857\n\nYPP 727\n\n(18) Nnewi South LGA\n\nAPC 1307\n\nAPGA 3243\n\nPDP 2226\n\nYPP 1327\n\n(19) Orumba North LGA\n\n(Result contested.

Hon. Ayuba Abok.\n\nThe coalition which is an umbrella body of about 74 civil society organisations, expressed concern at the turn of events in the aftermath of impeachment of the former Speaker, which it said was unhealthy for the much-needed peaceful atmosphere in the state.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Abuja yesterday, the Convener of the coalition, Comrade James Dauda who was flanked by other members maintained that attempt to whip up sentiment through spurious allegation that Governor Lalong was behind the impeachment of the former Speaker was not only condemnable but unacceptable in a democratic setting.\n\nThe group noted that the governor, who is the chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, NGF , was the first to grant judicial and legislative autonomy in Nigeria which the former Speaker enjoyed the privilege.\n\nIt wondered how members of the State House of Assembly, which is independent of the executive arm of government in the state, turned out to impeach its Speaker for reasons best known to them, yet the governor is being accused of \u2018behind the scene\u2019 role.\n\n\u201cGentlemen of the press, we are aware that Plateau State House of Assembly was the first out of 36 States of the Federation to enjoy legislative and judicial autonomy, even when Hon. Ayuba Abok held sway as Speaker.\n\n\u201cThe lawmakers decided to impeach their leader based on reasons best known to them and elected Hon. Yakubu Sanda as new Speaker, which we consider as democracy in action, hence, peace should be allowed to reign at all cost,\u201d the convener stressed.\n\nA\u00e7cording to him, \u201cthe embattled Speaker had once refused confirmation of nominees as commissioners when he has opportunity to do so for the state to move forward, yet the governor who was an ex-lawmaker played along given that in democracy, each arms were at liberty to take decision on their own.\u201d\n\nThe group further bemoaned the ex-Speaker\u2019s recalcitrance in cooperating with the All Progressives Congress, APC structure in Plateau which has degenerated to factionalization during the recent state congress.\n\nIt, however, commended Governor Lalong for his maturity and leadership that has ensured peace and tranquility as well as socio-economic and infrastructural development of the state, while calling on the citizens, particularly the youths not to allow themselves to be used.",

Godswill Akpabio has disclosed that over N359billion has so far been expended on the 657km dual carriage East-West Road stretching from Calabar in Cross River State, to Effurun in Delta State since it was initiated in 2006.\n\nAkpabio said bearing in mind the objectives of President Muhammadu Buhari on the completion of ongoing projects, the Niger Delta Ministry was considering raising funds from other sources to ensure the completion of section I-IV of the road before the end 2023.\n\nThe minister made this statement during the Ministry\u2019s 2021 Budget Performance Review and 2022 Proposed Budget Consideration to the House of Representative Committee on Niger Delta Affairs on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking during the presentation, Sen. Akpabio noted that the preparation of the ministry\u2019s budget was conceived in line with the Federal Government\u2018s2022 Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability premised on repositioning the economy on the path of growth and resilience.\n\nWhile presenting a total budgetary proposal of the sum of N28,131,295,396 allocated to the Ministry comprising, personal (N1,692,591,184) overhead (N877,089,120) and capital (N25,561,615,092), the minister noted that, \u201cthe Ministry ensured that core projects were consistent with the Administrations Agenda Policies/strategies contained in the Medium Term National Development Plan (MTNDP), 2021-2025, according priority to on-going projects\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe 2022 Budgetary Allocation is meagre and significantly inadequate in the face of the mandate and goals of the Ministry to meet the yearnings and aspirations of the people. The volume of the outstanding liabilities with underfunding has affected ongoing projects/programmes of the Ministry across the region and this is gradually contributing to the resurgence of problems in some areas of the region,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking earlier, during the budget presentation the Chairman House of Representative Committee on Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs Hon. Essien Ekpeyong, assured that the Legislature is committed to the security of lives and investment in the Niger Delta region and for economic and social activities to strive. Therefore, he said, the budget proposal of N25.56 billion would be given due attention in line with the 2021 budgetary review.\n\nHe explained that there was need for the Executive and Legislature to work together to ensure that thousands of uncompleted projects scattered across the region are completed for the betterment of the life of the people.\n\nHe also noted that the House would also consider if there were challenges that would require legislative intervention, particularly in the area of funding in respect of the East-West Road by setting up committee to work with the ministry in this regard.",

          "text": "The Lagos State Government says a robust vaccination strategy has been established to ensure four million residents of the state are fully vaccinated before the end of December 2021.\n\nThe state Commissioner for Health, Akin Abayomi who disclosed this in a statement on Sunday explained that the mass vaccination is important to prevent a fourth wave of the deadly Coronavirus in the state.\n\n\u201cThe Lagos State Government has developed a robust vaccination strategy leveraging on both the strengths of the public and private sectors of our healthcare system with a full understanding that a substantial proportion of the population will need to be vaccinated to mitigate the impact of the fourth wave in Lagos and reduce the impact of the ongoing spread of the COVID-19 virus and prevent the re-emergence of the catastrophes witnessed during the previous waves.\n\n\u201cThis strategy dubbed \u2018Count Me In! 4 million Lagosians Vaccinated Against COVID-19\u2019 is aimed at targeting the full vaccination of four million Lagos residents before the end of December 2021; and was launched by the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu alongside the Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi and the Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, Dr. Faisal Shuaib, in a side event of the 7th African Conference on One Health and Biosecurity which focused on Vaccine strategies,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nThe Commissioner said once this is achieved, it will bring the State closer to the state governor\u2019s mandate to vaccinate 30% of the Lagos population within one year which started in August of 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is a concerted effort to achieve the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) target of vaccinating 40% of the world before the end of this year. Lagos thus far has only been able to fully vaccinate just under 3% of its population,\u201d Abayomi added.\n\nHe stressed that a partnership between public and private companies is essential to achieve the goal.\n\nAbayomi said the State Government, through the Primary Health Care Board, does not have the capacity alone to ramp up vaccination to this massive level in such a short time and before the deadline, hence the need to include the private sector.\n\n\u201cThe public-private partnership is similar to the strategy deployed for escalating COVID-19 testing which resulted in a dramatic increase in testing done in Lagos from an average of 200 a day to over 2,000 a day culminating in a total of 800,000 tests in less than a year and Lagos State accounting for more than 30% alone of all COVID-19 PCR tests done in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis demonstrates the power of public-private partnerships, with the inclusion of the significant capacity of the private sector but government retaining strict regulatory oversight and quality function.\n\n\u201cWith this approach, we intend to ramp up our vaccination strategy using the existing public facilities as well as the inclusion of some private facilities. It is imperative to emphasize that the vaccines administered in public facilities is free and would remain free to the public as they were contributed to us by the Federal Government and our donor partners, those wishing to receive the vaccines can go to any of the designated 206 government facilities and receive their dose totally free of charge.\u201d\n\nThe Commissioner said those that wish to receive the vaccines within the comforts of a private facility can do so \u201cat a minimal administrative cost of N6,000 for two doses which cover the cost that the private sector will incur to facilitate the administration of the vaccine which includes logistics, personnel, quality oversight, administrative and overhead costs. The cost will be proportionally lower for single-dose or those wishing to take a single booster dose.\u201d\n\nHe said no one is compelled to receive their vaccines at any private facility as the vaccines in both are of the same quality and brand.\n\n\u201cThe decision to leverage the private sector is based solely on our resolve to include private health facilities and corporate institutions as additional sites for the COVID-19 vaccination administration.\n\n\u201cThis is in furtherance of the effort to increase the reach and access to the available vaccines provided through the generous contributions and donations by the Federal Government and our donors,\u201d he added.\n\nThose that require their vaccination at any of the public facilities should visit the national platform at https://publicreg.vaccination.gov.ng to register and schedule their vaccination or register on arrival at any of the 206 public sites.\n\nThose requiring vaccination at any selected private facilities should please, in addition, visit https://lagosvaccine.com to book and pay for their vaccination, either before or after registering on the national platform.",

          "text": "Sudan\u2019s army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has said he will not participate in any government that comes after a transitional period and denied that the army was responsible for the deaths of protesters rallying against the military takeover.\n\nNationwide anti-coup protests have taken place since the October 25 power grab by the army, but have been met by a deadly crackdown.\n\nAt least 14 demonstrators have been killed and about 300 wounded, according to the independent Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors.\n\n\u201cIt is our pledge \u2013 a pledge we made to ourselves, the Sudanese people and the international community \u2013 that we are committed to completing the democratic transition, holding elections on time, and committed to not stopping any political activity as long as it is peaceful, and within the bounds of the constitutional declaration and the parts that have not been suspended,\u201d al-Burhan told Al Jazeera in comments broadcast on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to handing over power to a civilian government of national competency and we pledge to preserve the transition from any interference that can hinder it,\u201d he continued.\n\nAl-Burhan also denied the army was responsible for the deaths of protesters.\n\n\u201cThe Sudanese army does not kill citizens, and there are investigation committees to reveal what happened,\u201d he said.\n\nThe interview was broadcast as anti-coup rallies continued in the capital, Khartoum and several other towns, ramping up the pressure against the military amid the continuing political crisis.\n\nDozens of teachers rallied against the army outside the education ministry in Khartoum. According to the teachers\u2019 union, at least 80 protesters were arrested in Khartoum on Sunday. There were no reports of casualties.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Resul Serdar, who spoke with Burhan, said the general said people have the right to protest peacefully.\n\n\u201cBurhan said the talks are underway with political parties and figures including the ousted prime minister Abdalla Hamdok [regarding] reaching a consensus to forming a government,\u201d Serdar said, speaking from Khartoum.\n\n\u201cHe said he hopes to reach a deal within the next 24 hours, despite several obstacles.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Sudanese security forces fired tear gas at several anti-coup rallies, with protesters in several cities joining a call for two days of civil disobedience and a strike campaign to protest against last month\u2019s military takeover.\n\nThe calls for civil disobedience were led by the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), an umbrella of unions which were also instrumental in the protests which led to the removal of longtime strongman Omar al-Bashir in April 2019.\n\n\u201cThe Sudanese people have rejected the military coup,\u201d the SPA said, vowing \u201cno negotiation, no partnership\u201d.\n\nThe SPA\u2019s appeals for civil disobedience were circulated via text messages, to bypass internet outages in place since the putsch.\n\nHundreds of anti-coup protesters rallied in Khartoum, as well as in its twin city of Omdurman, Wad Madni to the south, and the northern city of Atbara.\n\n\u201cThe authority belongs to the people,\u201d they chanted and \u201cno, no to military rule\u201d as they demanded a \u201ccivilian government\u201d.\n\n\u201cProtesters barricaded the streets, set car tyres ablaze, called out against the military rule, and chanted that civilian government is the people\u2019s choice,\u201d said Hoda Othman, who witnessed protests in Omdurman.\n\nThe military takeover sparked international condemnation, including punitive aid cuts and demands for a swift return to civilian rule.\n\nAl-Burhan insists it \u201cwas not a coup\u201d but a move to \u201crectify the course of the transition\u201d.\n\nThe commander of the powerful Rapid Support Forces, who is the No. 2 man in Sudan\u2019s military, came out in support of the takeover in a midnight speech posted on Facebook.\n\nGeneral al-Burhan\u2019s moves \u201ccame to correct the course of the people\u2019s revolution, and preserve the security and stability of the country,\u201d said General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, Burhan\u2019s deputy on the now-dissolved Sovereign Council.\n\nSeparately on Sunday, a high-level Arab League delegation held separate talks with al-Burhan and the deposed civilian leader, Abdalla Hamdok, on \u201cthe importance of the partnership between the military and civilians\u201d and ways to \u201cresolve the disagreements\u201d.\n\nHamdok, who is still under house arrest in his residence in Khartoum, has insisted on releasing government officials and politicians detained in connection with the coup. He also wants \u201cguarantees\u201d that the military would return to the pre-coup power-sharing arrangements, the official said.\n\nOn Thursday, the military released four civilian members of the government but key officials are still detained.",

          "text": "Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen took a dominant victory in the Mexico City Grand Prix to strengthen his chances of a first World Championship.\n\nVerstappen\u2019s title rival Lewis Hamilton was second, the Mercedes driver holding off a charge from Verstappen\u2019s team-mate Sergio Perez in the closing laps.\n\nPerez was on Hamilton\u2019s tail on the last lap but was not able to pass.\n\nVerstappen\u2019s ninth win in 2021 gives him a 19-point lead with four races and a total of 107 points remaining.\n\nHamilton\u2019s team-mate Valtteri Bottas deprived the Dutchman of the point for fastest lap on the final tour.\n\nOne of the most imposing victories of the year, therefore, puts Verstappen in a commanding position in the championship.\n\nAnd a one-three finish moved Red Bull to just one point behind Mercedes in the constructors\u2019 championship.\n\nAfter Mercedes surprisingly locked out the front row on Saturday, Verstappen immediately put himself in a position to win by taking the lead at the first corner.\n\nBenefiting from the tow behind the two Mercedes, and then slotting into a gap left by Bottas on the outside on the run from the grid, Verstappen braked later than both Mercedes drivers and swept around their outside into a lead he never looked like losing.\n\n\u201cIt was all about braking late,\u201d Verstappen said. \u201cI kept it on the track and that basically made my race.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of the move, Bottas was tipped into a spin by McLaren\u2019s Daniel Ricciardo, relegating him to the back and taking him out of the picture. To add insult to injury, Bottas rejoined from a pit stop for tyres on lap one behind Ricciardo and could not pass him for the next 30 laps or so.\n\nMercedes stopped him late in the race to set the fastest lap and limit Verstappen\u2019s haul by one point.\n\nVerstappen pulled away from Hamilton so commandingly that the suspicion was he would have won even if he had not taken the lead at the start.\n\nAs it was, he had an untroubled drive, pulling nearly 10 seconds clear of Hamilton by the time the world champion made his pit stop on lap 29.\n\nMercedes stopped Hamilton on that lap because he was beginning to come under threat from Perez and they wanted to \u2018bank\u2019 track position.\n\nRed Bull then left Perez out for a further 11 laps to give him fresher tyres with which to come back at Hamilton in the second stint.\n\nPerez was within a second of Hamilton with 11 laps to go.\n\nThere were a few nervous moments as Hamilton came up to lap McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris but was not close enough to pass until the younger Briton eventually got some blue flags. But once clear of Norris Hamilton always looked to have Perez under control.\n\nHamilton said: \u201cTheir car was so superior this weekend that there wasn\u2019t really anything we could do about it. I am just happy to have second.\u201d\n\nIt was a largely uneventful race behind the leaders.\n\nPierre Gasly had a strong but lonely race in the Alpha Tauri, starting fifth and running fourth throughout.\n\nHe had the measure of the Ferraris behind. For a long time, the lead red car was Charles Leclerc, but his team-mate Carlos Sainz made a later pit stop even than Perez and Leclerc let him by in the later laps to give him a shot at chasing down Gasly.\n\nWhen the Spaniard was unable to catch him, the Ferraris swapped back with a handful of laps to go, promoting Leclerc back to fifth ahead of Sainz.\n\nAston Martin\u2019s Sebastian Vettel took seventh, ahead of Alfa Romeo\u2019s Kimi Raikkonen, Alpine\u2019s Fernando Alonso and Norris.",

          "text": "This is a country which is starting to feel the very real fear of hunger. The weather is turning from early autumn warmth to a sharp chill. Several areas are reporting drought, which adds to the sense of growing catastrophe.\n\nAt Maidan Wardak, 50 miles west of Kabul, a crowd of several hundred men had gathered in the hope of getting flour from an official distribution point. The flour was provided by the World Food Programme.\n\nTaliban soldiers kept the crowd reasonably quiet, but people who were told they weren\u2019t eligible for a hand-out were angry and frightened.\n\n\u201cThe winter is nearly here,\u201d said one old man. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll get through it if I can\u2019t make bread\u201d.\n\nThe WFP is faced with having to raise its supplies to Afghanistan to help more than 22 million people.\n\nIf the weather is as bad as experts are predicting this winter, the expectation is that large numbers will be threatened with acute hunger and widespread famine.\n\nI spoke to the executive director of the WFP, David Beasley, when he paid a visit to Kabul on Sunday.\n\nHis analysis of the situation was alarming.\n\n\u201cIt is as bad as you possibly can imagine,\u201d said Mr Beasley. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re now looking at the worst humanitarian crisis on Earth.\n\n\u201cNinety-five percent of the people don\u2019t have enough food, and now we\u2019re looking at 23 million people marching towards starvation,\u201d he added. \u201cThe next six months are going to be catastrophic. It is going to be hell on Earth.\u201d\n\nBefore the Taliban took power in Afghanistan in August, there was confidence that the government of President Ashraf Ghani would be able to cope with the threat of a bad winter, given the help of the international community. That help evaporated when Mr Ghani\u2019s government collapsed.\n\nWestern countries have cut off their aid to the country, since they don\u2019t want to be seen to help a regime which bars girls from education and is in favour of reintroducing the full range of sharia punishments.\n\nBut will those countries just stand by now and allow millions of innocent people to face acute hunger?\n\nMr Beasley challenges the governments and the billionaires of the developed world to face up to the urgent need for help.\n\nA Taliban fighter stands guard as women wait in line during a World Food Programme food distribution in Kabul\n\n\u201cTo the world leaders, to the billionaires: imagine that this was your little girl or your little boy, or your grandchild about to starve to death,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would do everything you possibly could, and when there\u2019s $400 trillion worth of wealth on the earth today, shame on us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe let any child die from hunger. Shame on us. I don\u2019t care where that child is,\u201d he adds.\n\nIn the city of Bamiyan in central Afghanistan, where in 2001 the Taliban destroyed the ancient and beautiful statues of the Buddha, carved into the cliff side in the sixth century, we went to meet a widow, Fatema, and her seven children aged from three to 16.\n\nHer husband died of stomach cancer not long ago.\n\nThey are wretchedly poor, and live in a cave close to the huge alcove in the cliff where one of the Buddhas used to stand.\n\nUnder the last government Fatema was able to get fairly regular supplies of flour and oil, but those stopped directly the Taliban took over.\n\nFatema used to make a little money weeding the soil for a nearby farmer. Now, though, the drought which has been afflicting this area means that fewer crops have survived, and there is no work for her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m frightened,\u2019 she says. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to give the children. Soon I\u2019ll have to go out and beg.\u201d\n\nSome parents have sold their daughters off to older men in marriage. Fatema has refused to do that. But unless the supply of food resumes, she and her children face actual starvation.\n\nNow the snow is beginning to settle on the nearby mountain-tops and there is a new sharpness in the air.\n\nThe winter will very soon be here, and huge numbers of people like Fatema and her family will be on the very brink of catastrophe.\n\nBBC",

          "text": "There are more delegates at COP26 associated with the fossil fuel industry than from any single country, analysis shared with the BBC shows.\n\nCampaigners led by Global Witness assessed the participant list published by the UN at the start of this meeting.\n\nThey found that 503 people with links to fossil fuel interests had been accredited for the climate summit.\n\nThese delegates are said to lobby for oil and gas industries, and campaigners say they should be banned.\n\n\u201cThe fossil fuel industry has spent decades denying and delaying real action on the climate crisis, which is why this is such a huge problem,\u201d says Murray Worthy from Global Witness.\n\n\u201cTheir influence is one of the biggest reasons why 25 years of UN climate talks have not led to real cuts in global emissions.\u201d\n\nAbout 40,000 people are attending the COP. Brazil has the biggest official team of negotiators according to UN data, with 479 delegates.\n\nThe UK, which is hosting the talk in Glasgow, has 230 registered delegates.\n\nSo what counts as a fossil fuel lobbyist?\n\nGlobal Witness, Corporate Accountability and others who have carried out the analysis define a fossil fuel lobbyist as someone who is part of a delegation of a trade association or is a member of a group that represents the interests of oil and gas companies.\n\nOverall, they identified 503 people employed by or associated with these interests at the summit.\n\nThey also found that:\n\nFossil fuel lobbyists are members of two country delegations, Canada and Russia\n\nThe fossil fuel lobby at COP is larger than the combined total of the eight delegations from the countries worst affected by climate change in the past 20 years\n\nMore than 100 fossil fuel companies are represented at COP, with 30 trade associations and membership organisations also present\n\nFossil fuel lobbyists dwarf the UNFCCC\u2019s official indigenous constituency by about two to one\n\nOne of the biggest groups they identified was the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) with 103 delegates in attendance, including three people from the oil and gas company BP.\n\nAccording to Global Witness, IETA is backed by many major oil companies who promote offsetting and carbon trading as a way of allowing them to continue extracting oil and gas.\n\n\u201cThis is an association that has an enormous number of fossil fuel company as its members. Its agenda is driven by fossil fuel companies and serves the interests of fossil fuel companies,\u201d Mr Worthy said.\n\nWhat is COP26, and why does it matter?\n\nCOP26 is a United Nations climate change summit.\n\nCOP stands for Conference of the Parties. The 26 indicates this is the 26th conference.\n\nThe 200 countries going to the conference in Glasgow, Scotland, are being asked for plans to cut emissions by 2030.\n\nClimate change is causing more extreme weather. The past decade was the warmest on record, and governments agree urgent change is needed.\n\nAt the Paris climate conference in 2015, countries agreed to keep global warming well below 2 degrees celsius \u2013 with a target of 1.5 degrees celsius.\n\nAt this conference every country will be asked to say how they will help cut emissions.\n\nDecisions made at COP could change our future. From boilers to cars and how you power your home, it\u2019s all up for discussion.\n\n\u201cWhat we seeing is the putting forward of false solutions that appear to be climate action but actually preserve the status quo, and prevent us from taking the clear, simple actions to keep fossil fuels in the ground that we know are the real solutions to climate crisis.\u201d\n\nThe IETA says it exists to find the most efficient market-based means of driving down emissions. Members include fossil fuel companies but also a range of other businesses.\n\n\u201cWe have law firms, we have project developers, the guys who are putting clean technology on the ground around the world, they\u2019re also members of our association as well,\u201d says Alessandro Vitelli, an IETA spokesman.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not coming to a shuddering halt today and tomorrow, and suddenly there\u2019s going to be no emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a process to transition that\u2019s under way, and carbon markets are the best way to make sure that transition takes place.\u201d\n\nCampaign groups argue that the World Health Organization didn\u2019t get serious about banning tobacco until all the lobbyists for the industry were banned from WHO meetings. They want the same treatment for oil and gas companies at COP.\n\n\u201cThe likes of Shell and BP are inside these talks despite openly admitting to upping their production of fossil gas,\u201d said Pascoe Sabido of the Corporate Europe Observatory, who were also involved in the analysis.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re serious about raising ambition, then fossil fuel lobbyists should be shut out of the talks.\u201d\n\nBBC",
