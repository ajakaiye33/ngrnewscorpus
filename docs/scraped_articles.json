          "title": "Umahi, security expert differ on insecurity in S\u2019East",
          "text": "A security expert, Col. Hassan Stan-Labo (retd.), and a former chairman of the South-East Security Committee, General Obi Umahi (retd.), have differed on the increasing level of insecurity in Imo, Anambra, Enugu, Ebonyi and Abia states.\n\nWhile Stan-Lanbo insisted that the continued breach of security in the South-East should be blamed on years of marginalisation of the region by the government, Umahi stated that governors in the region should take the blame for the killings and kidnapping.\n\nSpeaking with Saturday PUNCH, Stan-Lanbo said, \u201cWe need to see the efforts from the government to make the average person on the street to feel safe and have a sense of belonging. Those in authority should try to see that there is enough inclusiveness in the way they go about things.\n\n\u201cEverything should be done to bring in those who feel that they no longer want to be part of the family. They should get them back to the family. It should be by appeasing them and not by using force.\n\n\u201cThe year 2023 is coming around; we shall have a fresh set of leaders as well. There will be a new set of appointments. We hope we will not have a situation where those appointed will come from a particular region.\n\n\u201cSuch act does not make my country safe for any of us. Those who are creating these problems have two or three passports. As we speak, their children are abroad, but we are here killing each other.\n\n\u201cSolving the problem of insecurity in the South-East will call for a multifaceted approach, including political solutions. It goes beyond the formation of Ebubeagu to enjoy peace in the region. How have you tried to make the Igbo man have a sense of belonging in the Nigerian state?\n\nThey say IPOB should be called terrorists. If you ask me, I don\u2019t think they should be called terrorists. The solution is that we should look for a way to bring some of these people to the negotiation table.\n\n\u201cWe must talk to several other stakeholders; we must talk to elders in the communities, we must be talking with political leaders. You have to talk to people who these boys can listen to.\u201d\n\nHowever, Umahi said some politicians and elites from the South-East region were exploiting the fragile security situation in the region for their selfish gains.\n\nHe asked Nigerians to blame the sitting governors of the region for the carnage that had characterised the recent development in the South-East.\n\nSpeaking during a programme on TVC and monitored by Saturday PUNCH, Umahi said if the governors were honest with their fight against insecurity in the region, they should have strengthened the regional security outfit, Ebubeagu, with enough finance and moral support to address the menace.\n\nThe South-East Governors\u2019 Forum had on August 31, 2019, appointed Umahi as the chairman of the committee.\n\nThe committee was asked to draft a framework for the establishment of a South-East joint security outfit to cater to the security needs of the zone.\n\nHowever, most of the South-East governors were said to have refused to fund the security outfit, a development that made Umahi to resign on June 4, 2021, as chairman of the committee.\n\nThe retired soldier noted, \u201cThere are some political elites that leverage the security situation in the South-East for their selfish gains. They thought they could use the situation to their advantage during the election. But if the governors were proactive, all of these would have been avoided.\n\n\u201cThe issues of insecurity in the South-East were orchestrated by the Indigenous People of Biafra. When some politicians want to settle scores, they begin to look for bandits.\n\n\u201cWhen it was brewing, as the chairman of the security committee, I noticed that some clerics were propagating IPOB and I condemned it. But people were afraid and refused to speak out against it.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cI knew what to do, but the means to do it was not available. A General does not like a situation where he knows that he can deal with a thing but does not have the resources to deal with it. That is frustration.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Since the time of Chief James Ibori, no Governor has been able to surpass what he has done for the State.\n\n\u201cAll the roads he constructed when he was in government are still the roads we are seeing today. What successive governments have been doing all these years is only rehabilitation of these roads.\n\n\u201cToday all the roads constructed by the state government have are not done without any standard. All of them are failing already and the people are the ones who suffer the consequences.\n\n\u201cThis is the time to allow another set of hands to take control of the reigns of power from the present crop of politicians in this state today.\n\n\u201cThis is the time to give somebody like Chief Great Ogboru a chance to become the governor of this state. He is the only politician that we know that does not have a godfather.\n\n\u201cIf we fail to do this today nothing will change in this state. So we are pleading with Deltans to give Ogboru a chance to be our Governor. If We can recall what was said by one of the persons seeking to rule the state today in one of his interviews some years back when the candidate of one party in the state said Ogboru won most of the elections he contested but only punched out the by tribunals.

Dapo Abiodun.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Sanni, the custodian of the popular Olumo Rock, died on June 1 at the age of 137.\n\nThe commissioner said that tourists, who visited the site had always sought \u201cMama Olumo\u201d out to get facts and history about the rock and Egbaland as a whole.\n\n\u201cAnd as such, she had become a tourist site herself,\u201d Taiwo said.\n\nHowever, the governor, in his letter to the deceased family, as read by Taiwo, expressed the compassion of the state government toward the demise of \u201cMama Olumo\u201d.\n\nHe promised to keep supporting the family as it had always done.\n\nAbiodun in the letter, said that many of the histories heard from \u201cMama\u201d had been documented and available at the ministry for reference.\n\n\u201cWhen we heard of mama\u2019s passing, as a government, we have to show up here and identify with the family at this moment to condole with them.\n\n\u201cMama is a custodian of our histories, culture and tradition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to miss her greatly in terms of the history and truth of Egbaland and in terms of the tourism.\n\n\u201cThis is because mama herself has become a tourist centre, in view of the way people justle to see and heard from her,\u201d he said.\n\nOn immortalising mama, Abiodun said, \u201cyou should be sure that if somebody have made an impact on humanity, the government is going to do the needful.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the death of her mother, Mama Olumo\u2019s first child, Mrs Mosinat Amusa, said though her mother died at a riped age, she was still saddened by her passing.\n\nAmusa, who said she has passed the age of 90, however, expressed satisfaction at the life her mother lived.\n\nShe expressed confidence that some of her children would continue from where mama stopped.\n\nAlso, Mama Olumo\u2019s grandson, Mr Samad Sanni, told journalists that mama was buried on Thursday night according to Orisa Egun traditional rites.\n\nHe said, though her family is not from Orisa Egun, but her barreness took her to the deity, which she served for the rest of her life.\n\nAccording to him, she was buried in her room at the family house behind the Olumo Rock.\n\n\u201cWe buried her on Thursday night, according to Orisa traditional rite. Mama belongs to Orisa Egun, and there is nothing we can do than to bury her in that rite.\n\n\u201cAnyone who is an Orisa Egun cannot be buried outside, they are buried inside their houses, so mama was buried inside her room. All other activities will follow after the burial rite,\u201d he said. (NAN)",

If the law says do this, do so. We cannot continue to have illegality, it will serve us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned in the past several months, NDDC has been violating the law and so not serving the Niger Delta, so the federal government should quickly constitute the board properly so that the NDDC will do its statutory job.\u201d\n\nResidents losing patience \u2013 HRM Whiskey\n\nParamount ruler of Idjerhe kingdom in Delta state, HRM King Obukowho Whiskey, avowed: \u201dThe continuous running of NDDC in the past three years without a statutory board is the height of illegalities that the President must stop because illegalities can only bread lawlessness and huge financial recklessness as it is today in the NDDC.\n\n\u201cBillions of naira budget/allocated for development have been diverted and mismanaged by few selfish appointees to the detriment of the people and government of the day.\n\n\u201cThe federal government\u2019s decision to cancel all previously awarded contracts is a welcome development but Mr. President has to take urgent steps to inaugurate the already screened and confirmed board of the NDDC under the chairmanship of Dr. Pius Odubu and Olorogun Bernard Okumagba as managing director.\n\n\u201cAnything short of this now will be taking illegalities beyond human understanding. The cartel running NDDC should be made to return all monies mismanaged to the coffers of commission. The patience of our people is fast running out,\u201d he said.\n\nPublish white paper \u2013 Senator Essien, PANDEF chair\n\nNational Chairman, PANDEF, mouthpiece of monarchs, leaders and stakeholders of coastal states of Niger-Delta, Senator Emmanuel Essien, who bared his mind to Saturday Vanguard at Uyo, Akwa Ibom state, said: \u201dWe demand the constitution of NDDC board, the publication of the Forensic Audit that was done. Those are the key things that we demand from the President.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso President Buhari should immediately appoint a credible Niger-Delta sone as Minister of Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs to replace Akpabio. We are praying that the president should constitute NDDC board immediately\u201d.\n\nCommission failed the people \u2013 Hon Egbodor\n\nFormer lawmaker, Hon. Peter Egbodor, who represented Ogoja / Yala Federal Constituency, Cross River state, in the House of Representatives, voiced out: \u201cOur people are suffering and smiling that the commission was set up to alleviate their sufferings but as it is , I do not think it is fulfilling the reason why it established.\u201d\n\nCommunities distressed \u2013 Chief Etti, village council leader\n\nFormer Chairman, Village Council, Afaha Atai, in Eket local government area, Akwa- Ibom State, Chief Sam Etti, lamented: \u201cSo many Niger Delta communities have suffered as a result of abandoned projects. Mr. President should immediately reconstitute the board of NDDC. For some years now that the governing board was not inaugurated, the problem of the communities have not been addressed.\n\n\u201cIt is only a commissioner on the board of NDDC that can properly channel the problems of each of the states under the NDDC to the Port-Harcourt headquarters for deliberation\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe need a minister to be appointed into the Niger Delta Affairs Ministry, who will come and look into this issue of abandoned projects and who can see that those projects are completed.\u201d\n\nWe want to know the thieves- Chief Sara-Igbe, elder\n\nIn Rivers state, Coordinator, South-South Elders Forum, Chief Anabs Sara-Igbe, bellowed: \u201cFormer Minister of Niger-Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, could not give us the white paper on what happened in NDDC, which made some of us begin to doubt his credibility. We want to really know what transpired, whether he is still there or not, whether he resigned or not.\n\nHe will be accountable to what happened in the NDDC. We will continue to hold him accountable with all his cronies, all the persons he appointed in the interim management must account for what happened in NDDC.\n\n\u201cThis is where we hold President Buhari to task, unless the white paper is published and we know those who are implicated and who impoverished the region. The region wants to know all those who embezzled all the monies for them. That is what we stand and everybody wants to know in the region.\n\n\u201cLet us see the anti-corruption crusade of President Buhari in NDDC, otherwise we will doubt his credibility in the fight against corruption\u201d.\n\nNDDC not operated in people\u2019s interest \u2013 Abolo, media expert\n\nEdo state-based media veteran and political commentator, Mr. Tony Abolo, said: \u201cOne hopes that the presidency can go back to the basis, go back and reformat the NDDC because it has not worked in anybody\u2019s interest.\u201d\n\n\u201dI think it is time that the board is either reformed, that is, all those who were appointed sworn in, let them perform their constitutional duties or create another fresh invitation to create a new board, give them orders to get works done, pay for contracts that were executed and recover money that was paid for contracts not executed.\n\n\u201cLet us go back to the master plan of the NDDC so that perhaps, development can start. I hope that a trust worthy Niger Deltan is located and appointed to handle the Ministry, someone who would see the development of the region as his focus.\u201d\n\nAppoint Keyamo N\u2019Delta minister- Ofoni, UYLA\n\nPresident of Urhobo Youth Leaders\u2019 Association, UYLA, in Delta state, Chief Anthony Ofoni, in a statement, urged President Buhari to promote the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, SAN, to substantive Minister of Niger Delta Affairs and urgently constitute the substantive board with Benard Okumagba as managing director for development, peace, fairness, justice and equity.\n\nSwear- in governing board- Nowinta, Kanji, Imeabe, Etaluku, Idi, Ebri\n\nExecutive Director, Nigeria Good Governance Research Center, Benin City, Edo state, Igbotako Nowinta, say the way forward was for President Buhari to reconstitute the board NDDC with \u201cmen and women of great positive characters and records of astonishing public records\u201d\n\nBenin- based media practitioner, Mr. Joseph Kanji, advised: \u201cBuhari should immediately inaugurate the board NDDC as required by the extant law establishing the commission.\n\nNational President, South-South Youths Initiative, Saviour Imeabe, said: \u201cWe call on President Buhari to appoint a Minister that will work for the people of Niger Delta. We want the report of the audit to be released immediately. We want to see a new beginning in NDDC and the Niger Delta Affairs Ministry.\u201d\n\nPresident, Isoko National Youth Assembly, INYA, Delta state, Amos Etaluku, said: \u201cNow that Akpabio has resigned from the Ministry, we urge Buhari to appoint a substantive board for the NDDC. This is due to the fact that having placed the commission under the ministry, the minister was controlling it.\u201d\n\nNational Secretary, Ndokwa National Youth Movement, NNYM, similarly in Delta state, Presley Idi, also asserted: \u201cWe hereby urge President Buhari to do the needful and immediately appoint someone, who truly has the best interest of the Niger Delta at heart and also approve the inauguration of a substantive board.\u201d\n\nIn Cross River state, Mr. James Ebri, entrepreneur, politician and younger brother to ex- governor of Cross River state , Clement Ebri, told Saturday Vanguard: \u201c It is a statutory position, everything the interim board has done remains unknown to the laws establishing the NDDC, so, whatever they put in place never had a legal backing.\u201d",

          "title": "Survivors recall horror scenes at Port Harcourt church stampede",
          "text": "I watched my daughter shout for help till she passed out, says widow\n\nHow my five-year-old son slipped off my hand and was marched to death\u2019\n\nI nearly lost my life trying to save a child \u2014 Survivor\n\nMrs. Jennifer Jackson has been grappling with nightmares since May 28. Jennifer, whose husband died in 2020, saw death on that day but cheated it by divine grace.\n\nHer 15-year-old daughter, Precious, was however not as fortunate. The fragile soul, who would have turned 16 in October, was marched to death and her feeble bones crushed during the stampede that happened at Polo Club, Port Harcourt, in the early hours of that day.\n\nJennifer said amid sobs: \u201cI can no longer sleep. I have been having nightmares since the incident occurred.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t received any medical treatment myself. On Sunday, I almost died because I fainted but my mother brought me back to life.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have money to go to the hospital after surviving that stampede. My face is swollen and I have injuries all over my body.\n\n\u201cI was busy trying to save my daughter. But I lost her.\u201d\n\nThe journey that snuffed life out of her daughter and almost took hers started when a member of the King\u2019s Assembly, a new generation church based in Port Harcourt, informed her about a give-away programme tagged \u2018Shop-for-Free, which the church organised at the Polo Club in GRA.\n\nShe said: \u201cOne lady on our street just saw me. We moved into the area newly. She told me they had something to share in their church.\n\n\u201cOn Friday last week, I went to her and asked her about the time for the programme. She said they would open the gate by 4 am on Saturday.\n\n\u201cShe said some people were already there on Friday night to sleep over. She advised me to go on time so that I would be able to enter.\n\n\u201cI told my daughter and my younger brother that the three of us would go to the place together. So, on that Saturday, I woke up at about 3 am and woke my daughter also and we left before 4 am.\n\n\u201cWhen we got there, the crowd was not much. They didn\u2019t open the gate, so we stood there and others were worried that the gate was not opened.\n\n\u201cAs we stood there, many other people were coming. After some time, a car came and someone asked us to form a line.\n\n\u201cAfter we formed a line, more people were still coming. Then we saw some people entering the venue and we wondered where they passed through.\n\n\u201cSome people suggested that we should move closer. When we got closer, we discovered that the gate was still shut but people were inside.\n\n\u201cWe later discovered that there was small gate behind that those people used to gain access to the place. But I told my daughter we should wait.\n\n\u201cI held her hand. We were at the middle of the line. But many people were behind us and were also at various corners.\u201d\n\nJennifer recalled that as the line started moving, there was a sudden surge of the crowd from different corners towards the gate. She fell down with her daughter as the crowd pushed with ferocity. While she cried out faintly gasping for breath, she heard a cacophony of weary voices begging for help. Her daughter let out a dying outcry.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe fell and I saw myself dying. I heard my daughter shout faintly. Others on the ground were shouting. I shouted too. I discovered that I was dying but I kept praying inside of me. I told God that I came because of food and that he should not allow His servant to die.\n\n\u201cI called on the Holy Spirit to give me strength. \u2018Holy Spirit, help me. I am your worker, give me strength. I don\u2019t want to die here,\u2019 I prayed.\n\n\u201cBy that time, I didn\u2019t hear my daughter\u2019s voice again. I didn\u2019t feel her shaking too. But I kept praying for help. As I opened my eyes, I saw a crowd of dead bodies lying on the ground.\n\n\u201cI saw my daughter\u2019s face come down. But I had no strength to carry her. I kept saying, \u2018My daughter, please wake up. Both of us came together, you cannot leave me. Please wake up. You are the only helper I have even the food we came to collect, we haven\u2019t seen anything, please wake up\u2019.\n\n\u201cI had lost my strength so I couldn\u2019t carry her.\u201d\n\nJennifer said people came to pick their loved ones and a man helped her to carry Precious out of the gate. She lamented that vehicles evacuated her daughter and other victims to the hospital, but there was no immediate medical treatment. She said all the victims were kept in an open field but no medical personnel did anything to revive the dying victims.\n\nShe said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t hold my daughter because my hands were weak. But the man helped me to carry the girl out of the gate.\n\n\u201cI had no money to carry her out of the place. Some cars came and took us to the hospital. But as we got there, they dropped us on the field. There was no emergency treatment.\n\n\u201cThey lay them on the field. I said, \u2018You brought us here but you are not trying to see whether you can revive these people.\u2019\n\n\u201cI was begging them to help me revive my daughter. I wanted to call my mother but I had no phone. I started calling my daughter.\n\n\u201cI screamed for help to remove her from there to either my house or to my pastor, Ibiyeomi. I didn\u2019t have money.\n\nbegged a man who gave me N1,500 to call a cab. I called a taxi and asked him to take me to my pastor.\n\n\u201cAs we reached, I wanted to carry the girl into the church and shout to see whether my pastor would hear my voice, but they didn\u2019t allow me to enter. We waited and the pastors came, prayed and anointed her.\n\n\u201cThey asked me to carry her to the church\u2019s Save Our Life Hospital. As I got there, a doctor checked her eyes, but I said nothing would happen to her.\n\n\u201cI took her home and started calling her repeatedly. I called another pastor who came and prayed for her, but he told me that the girl was already gone.\u201d\n\nJennifer, who was still inconsolable, said her late daughter was preparing to write the external examination conducted by the West African Examination Council (WAEC) when the incident occurred. She could not also wear the uniform she sewed to mark the Children\u2019s Day programme at the church on May 29.\n\n\u201cI have been suffering to raise my daughter. We live in poverty, no money or food, and that was why we went there to see whether we could get food.\n\n\u201cI have not received any good treatment since the incident occurred because I have no money,\u201d she said.\n\nJennifer\u2019s mother, Comfort Belema, is also a widow. Her husband died in 2019. She lamented the loss of her granddaughter and prayed for help to enable Jennifer get proper medical attention.\n\nAnother victim, Friday Eugine, said the military hospital they were taken to after the incident only gave them first aid. Eugine said he fractured his left leg and that after waiting in vain for the hospital to commence full treatment, his family relocated him to the state-owned Braithwaite Memorial Hospital (BMH).\n\nRecalling the incident, he said he was able to save a child who was trapped, adding that he almost lost his life in the process of saving the child.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy brother told me of a programme organised by a church holding in Port Harcourt that he heard over the radio that I should try and attend. I was curious to know about the things I could shop for free so I went early to the venue.\n\n\u201cAs I got there, I saw people gathered in huge numbers at the gate. I was thinking that everything was over, so I rushed in to ask some people that were standing.\n\n\u201cThe question had not dropped from my mouth when people started pushing to enter through the gate.\n\n\u201cI saw a little child that fell and I dragged the child out. It was just God that saved me as I pulled with all my strength and my legs were entangled with those of other people and I managed to drag it out broken.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the parents of the child, but I handed the child over to the people that took us to the hospital.\n\n\u201cAlthough the bones of my left leg are fractured, I thank God for my life and that of the child I saved.\u201d\n\nOther horror tales\n\nMadam Abigail travelled all the way from her village in Ahoada to attend the programme. But the poor woman only ended up with a dislocated waist after the stampede. She had since gone back home to look for a professional masseuse to fix her waist after waiting in vain for medical treatment.\n\nShe said: \u201cI specifically came to Port Harcourt from Ahoada for the programme because of the good stories my neighbour\u2019s told me.\n\n\u201cI slept over at my sister\u2019s place to arrive in time because I was told that many people came last year and there was no space to accommodate them.\n\n\u201cI got there by 5:30 am but quarreled with the gatemen for not allowing us in since there were still seats yet to be occupied.\n\n\u201cI just sat at a corner waiting when the gatemen shouted that we should move away from the gate; that it was not yet time to admit people.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what or how it happened, but the wood I was sitting fell on the ground and I hit my waist. That was when I realised that I should have gone back home after the qaurrel.\n\n\u201cI could not stand because of the pains. I have gone for massage but the pain is still there. I didn\u2019t attend the programme but my waist is dislocated.\u201d\n\nEyewitnesses blame security operatives\n\nSamuel Orji-Eke has been in severe pains since the incident happened. His five-year-old son was among those that died in the stampede. But he said his son would not have died if he had received medical attention on time.\n\nEke would have lost more than the son because he went there with three of his children as well as his wife. He blamed the church for the incident, saying there was no arrangement for crowd management.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy son was five years old. Around 6:30 am, I attended the church programme with my three children. I was holding my son and carrying my six-month-old daughter in my arm and my wife was holding the other one.\n\n\u201cWhen we got there, the gate was locked and the crowd was not much. People were refused entry, and in such a church event, the gate was not supposed to be locked.\n\n\u201cThis made the crowd to swell and it became too much that the entire road was blocked. That was when they opened the gate and there was a mad rush to enter. It was in that process the stampede occurred.\n\n\u201cWe had entered the gate properly when people started to fall and the ones coming behind trampled on them. That was when they marched me and broke my hand, and my son slipped off and was marched to death.\n\n\u201cAt the time the incident happened, there was no presence of police officers but only ushers. It was when the place became rowdy that policemen came and started shooting in the air to disperse the crowd after the damage had been done.\n\n\u201cMy son did not die immediately but when it happened, there was no help, no first aid. I am calling for justice for a church to openly invite people and no proper logistics.\u201d\n\nFelix Sylvester Emizibo,a taxi driver, said he was at the scene when the stampede occurred, having conveyed one of his customers to the venue of the programme.\n\nThe customer, Patience Emesiobi, whom he described as a friend, died after the stampede. He, however, said it was the gunshots that were fired in the air by security operatives that triggered the stampede.\n\nHe said some operatives of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) later arrived at the scene when a mammoth crowd was struggling to enter the venue. He said there was pandemonium after the gunshot.\n\nEmizibo said: \u201cAfter dropping off my family friend, Patience Emesiobi, I had to stay around a little further to see the items the church was going to give and how they really wanted to do it.\n\n\u201cAbout 10 minutes after I dropped my friend, who is also a neighbour, I saw the crowd trying to access the premises through a pedestrian gate, pushing themselves in the process.\n\n\u201cNot quite long after that, we heard gunshots from the security personnel there.\n\n\u201cAfter we got there, it didn\u2019t take more than four to five minutes before men of the civil defence came. The police came later than the civil defence. I think the first set of security operatives that arrived at the venue was the civil defence, followed by the police.\n\n\u201cI really never got a glimpse at the security operatives that fired the shots, but I heard it was the civil defence personnel that fired three shots.\n\n\u201cThere was pandemonium immediately after the gunshots. There was this mad rush of people with children, some of them pregnant ladies and the elderly. They were all rushing through the gate to get into the premises, and in the process, the stampede happened.\n\n\u201cI saw a lot of dead bodies. Many of them were lifeless. Children were marched by the crowd. When I finally found my friend Patience, she was equally lifeless. \u201cThose of us that had vehicles conveyed the victims to the military hospital. I took my friend Patience Emesiobi to the military hospital, where a doctor confirmed her dead.\u201d\n\nHe, however, said the hospital attended to the victims based on its capacity. He said many could not be admitted because on their arrival, they were pronounced dead, adding that his friend was confirmed dead on a stretcher and could no longer be admitted in the hospital.\n\nHe said others, whose loved ones were pronounced dead, took them to other hospitals for confirmation. He said although the church tried to put measures in place for crowd management, its efforts were not adequate.\n\n\u201cI think the church did not expect that a lot of persons would come, and that was why they even hired Polo Club as the venue.\n\n\u201cThe church must have thought that Polo Club was wide enough to accommodate the crowd they were expecting, but the church failed in managing that crowd in good time,\u201d he said.\n\nFelix insisted that though the incident happened before the 9 am the church scheduled to commence the programme, they should have started their crowd management earlier.\n\nHe said: \u201cI will first and foremost blame our attitude as a people, as Nigerians generally. When it comes to issues like this, they rush.\n\n\u201cAt least we need to have some level of self control, show some kind of dignity whenever we find ourselves in public places.\n\n\u201cI will also blame the church. If you give an open invitation to a number of persons like this, you should expect that things like this are possible.\n\n\u201cArrangements ought to have been on ground to control the crowd to avert a stampede of this kind.\n\n\u201cI will blame the government too. The government has never taken the welfare of the people seriously. I think there is hunger in the land.\u201d\n\nBlack Saturday\n\nMay 28th was, indeed, a black Saturday. Although the police said 31 persons including children died in the stampede, the death toll, it was later gathered, was more than 50. Their lifeless bodies littered the ground of the Polo Club.\n\nThe victims had gone in search of free food and other gift items promised them by the church, but they died even before the distribution of the items could begin. Individuals who escaped with injuries like Jennifer had been abandoned to cater for their medical needs.\n\nThe acting Police Public Relations Officer, Iringe Grace Koko, said the police would probe the incident to determine its remote and immediate causes. The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, also vowed to constitute a panel to probe the tragedy.\n\nDespite the promises, nothing has been said of the tragedy about one week after it occurred. People have since been going about their normal activities as if nothing had happened.\n\nKing\u2019s Assembly, whose outreach programme caused the stampede has only regretted the disaster but has not taken further steps to ameliorate the pains of the victims and deceased families.\n\nThe church, in a statement, signed by its Director of Administration, Chimeka Elem, tried to give an excuse that the stampede happened before the commencement of its \u201cbenevolent and outreach programme called Shop-for-Free\u201d.\n\nElem described the programme as nondenominational and said its purpose was to share with the less privileged the gifts provided by members of the church, friends and partners.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, lives were lost and several people sustained varying degrees of injuries,\u201d he said.\n\nElem added: \u201cWhile the incident has been reported to the Nigerian Police Force, the church has commissioned a team of safety specialists to establish the immediate causes of the stampede to enable us provide the authorities all required information in compliance with public safety laws.\n\n\u201cOur Shop-for-Free programme was started in 2014 as our annual benevolent outreach and our choice of the large venue, Polo Club, was to accommodate the projected attendance.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s turnout, buildup and the attendant circumstances were absolutely unanticipated. The crowd converged overnight long before the security team for the event took formation.\u201d",

          "text": "The suspended priest in the Catholic Diocese of Gboko who left the ecclesiastical temple, Hyacinth Alia, will be flying the flag of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as its gubernatorial candidate in Benue State.\n\nHis victory at the party\u2019s primary election reverberated like a bolt of thunder.\n\nAlia wrestled divinely and spiritually perhaps to get the mandate from other gladiators in the party including Terlumun Paul Ikya; a university don, Prof. Terhemba Shija; Chief Steven Lawani; Dr. Sam Ode; Dr. John Tor Tsuwa; Senator Barnabas Gemade; Barr. Herman Iorwase Hembe; Mark Tersoo Hanmation; Engr Nick Wende and a former minister of Justice, Chief Mike Kaase Aondoakaa.\n\nAs activities intensify for the 2023 general elections, Alia\u2019s emergence as the APC gubernatorial candidate sends a signal that Benue is one of the states to watch in the 2023 election.\n\nTo observers, Alia is a first timer and has no political structure, but he shockingly made giant steps and has been identified as \u201cYes Father.\u201d He has wormed his ways into the heart of many.\n\nHe had previously said that his divine mission is to wake the state from coma and alleviate the sufferings of people. \u201cAfter preaching the gospel on the pulpit for 32 years, I decided to extend it to governance\u201d he said.\n\nIt will be recalled that Alia was suspended from celebrating public Eucharistic mass by the Catholic Bishop of Gboko Diocese, William Avenya, due to his participation in partisan politics.\n\nBishop Avenya announced his suspension from public ministry \u201cafter series of admonitions\u201d to him. Avenya noted in the letter that \u201cthe Mother Church does not allow her clerics to get involved in partisan politics on their own.\u201d\n\nReacting, Alia described his suspension as a normal practice by the Church. He also noted that the sacrifice of his suspension was a worthy cause because his mission is to save the soul of the people as well as the state and deliver it from imminent collapse.\n\nRegardless of the church\u2019s position, Alia forged ahead and won 12 out of the 23 local government areas of the state with a total of 464,391 votes.\n\nHe defeated his rivals, Mathias Byuan, who won in one local government and a former Minister of State for Niger Delta, Sam Ode, who won in five LGAs.\n\nArmed with his seven-point agenda for the development of Benue, Alia said his mission was to ensure that the government continued to prioritize the needs of residents and the people of the state.\n\nAlia will face Titus Uba, the Speaker of the Benue State House of Assembly who also emerged as the flagbearer of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the state\u2019s governorship election.\n\nBorn on May 14, 1966, Alia attended St. Francis Primary school, Gboko, from where he proceeded to St. James Minor Seminary, Makurdi and then St. Augustine Major Seminary, Jos. He also went to Fordham University, USA for a Master of Arts Degree in Religious Education (Psychology and Counseling). He also schooled in Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, USA for another Masters and Doctorate Degree in Biomedical Ethics.",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nFew days to the all-important Special Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to elect its presidential candidate, confusion and anxiety has continued to reign supreme both in the camps of the aspirants and the national secretariat of the party.\n\nThe apprehension is not unconnected with the recent report the presidential screening committee submitted to the party\u2019s national leadership on Friday, which disqualified no fewer than 10 of the aspirants, clearing 13 out of the 23 that purchased the party\u2019s N100 million expression of interest and nomination forms. Fresh facts however emerged within the week that 17 of the Progressive governors have agreed to support whoever preferred aspirant President Buhari presents.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nSaturday Sun further gathered that two governors from North West rejected the idea of President Buhari picking one aspirant for endorsement outright, even as two South West governors and one other from the North West are sitting on the fence on the matter.\n\nOur sources also disclosed that there is a 50-50 chance that the three governors who are neutral now may go either way, adding: \u201cIt is expected that by Sunday, the preferred aspirant would be unveiled to the governors, ahead of the Monday, June 6, 2022 special national convention.\u201d\n\nAlthough the party had commenced activities for the conduct of the presidential primary activities scheduled to hold between Monday to Wednesday, with the composition of various committees, the aspirants have been in the dark over how the candidate of the party will emerge.\n\nHowever, while the permutations have continued to favour one aspirant or the other, the recent appeal from President Muhammadu Buhari to the Progressive Governors to allow him anoint the party\u2019s candidate contributed in escalating the apprehension of the aspirants.\n\nIn fact, the appeal from President Buhari was yet to sink well in the minds of many of the aspirants when the John Odigie-Oyegun-led screening committee released the satanic report, disqualifying former President Goodluck Jonathan on the grounds that he did not appear before it for screening, among nine others whose identities were yet to be revealed.\n\nSpeaking during a meeting with members of Progressive Governors Forum in Abuja, President Buhari had told them that he would want to pick his successor, urging the governors to give him their support.\n\nExpectedly, the appeal from the President, the disagreement over zoning and consensus have sharply divided the ranks of the governors, with 17 of them backing Buhari on his preferred aspirant.\n\nA top source close to the governors told Saturday Sun that the those proposing zoning had insisted that if the ticket must be zoned to the North, then it must be micro-zoned to the North East, or to the South East if it must be zoned to the South, hinging the choice of the two zones on fairness and equity since they have not produced president in the past.\n\nAlthough Odigie-Oyegun did not reveal the identity of the disqualified aspirants, there are strong indications that the committee laid emphasis on the agility, capability and age of the aspirants.\n\nSpeaking while submitting the report, Oyegun said: \u201cEvery single aspirant that presented himself qualified because it was basis and simple. But we are the governing party and we are keen on continuing the process of replacing, at proper time, our president with another member of the party and so the ability to lead, your background, your experience, your understanding of the Nigerian situation, your ideas as to how issues, difficulties and the rest can be addressed and how the country can move forward to begin a critical consideration.\n\n\u201cIt is on that basis we made our final shortlist. I don\u2019t want to read the names, I think I would leave that to you (Chairman), but we have a shortlist which brought the number severely down to 13. We could have cut it a little shorter, but we wanted deliberately the younger elements to surface for them to be seen, for them to be noticed and no noise. We would hand them over to the party and it is for the party to decide whom their candidate will be.\n\nSpeaking further, Oyegun said: \u201cOne thing I have to emphasize is: we engage every aspirant on the issue of consensus and it was a pleasant surprise that 99 per cent agreed that the party is supreme and whatever the party finally decides with proper consultations, they were likely to accept.\u201d\n\nAsked whether former President Jonathan appeared before his committee, he said: \u201cNo, Jonathan did not appear.\u201d\n\nResponding, the party\u2019s national chairman, Adamu, warned the aspirants that the decision of the party is very supreme, urging them to abide by whatever outcome.\n\nCuriously, protesters, seeking one form of attention or the other from the national leadership of the party, held the national secretariat of the ruling party, in Abuja, in the early hours of Friday, practically to a standstill.\n\nAlthough former President Jonathan was technically missing in the list of the aspirants cleared, the protesters under the platform of Goodluck Jonathan Support Group had stormed the party\u2019s national secretariat, drumming and dancing for hours. While the pro-Jonathan protesters were still disrupting activities, another group of protesters from Abia State had joined them to inform the leadership that they were not in support of the primaries conducted in the state that produced some of the candidates of the party for next year\u2019s elections.\n\nComplicating the situation, a colony of Persons Living with Disability equally arrived the secretariat to drum support for the presidential aspiration of the governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello.\n\nWhile the protest lasted, vehicular and human movement was grounded, making impossible for those on genuine mission at the secretariat to gain entrance.\n\nEarlier around 10.30am, the leadership of the party had beefed up security, deploying more police and other security personnel in anticipation of a possible breakdown of law and order in the secretariat.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

He said 45 per cent of the riders were youths between 30 and 39 years.\n\n\u2018\u2019So, taking Okada off the roads is helping our young ones to stay alive, it is not hurting our people.

Saraki, in a statement signed by the head of his Media Office, Yusuph Olaniyonu, in response to the speech by Tinubu in Abeokuta on Thursday claiming that Saraki and others opposed his desire to be running mate to President Mohammadu Buhari in the 2015 elections, noted that he will oppose any plan that causes a religious crisis in a multi-religious country like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhen I and other leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2014 stood against having a Muslim-Muslim ticket, it was not a decision targeted at any individual or group but one taken in the national interest.

          "title": "Tinubu: My Ogun Statement Lost in Translation, Respect for President Buhari High, Unfailing",
          "text": "\n\n*Bagudu, Sule meet with President, Femi Adesina says Buhari didn\u2019t tell govs to pick consensus presidential candidate for party\n\n*Kano court clears APC\u2019s statutory delegates to vote, may be too late\n\n*Court asked to disqualify Tinubu for \u2018questionable educational background, date of birth\u2019\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential aspirant and former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, yesterday moved fast to douse the anger created by the speech he delivered last Thursday while on a consultation visit to the delegates of the party in Abeokuta, Ogun State, during which he bragged about installing President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and Governor Dapo Abiodun.\n\n\n\nOn the same day, President Buhari returned to Abuja after a three-day state visit to Spain and shortly after met with a two-man delegation of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) led by its Chairman and Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu.\n\nIn a statement he pushed out yesterday, Tinubu said his comments had been misinterpreted by the media and that he did not disrespect President Buhari.\n\nThe APC Presidential aspirant in the statement he signed declared that his respect and regard for Buhari as Commander-in- Chief of this nation, and as a person, are high and unfailing.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cMy respect and regard for President Buhari as Commander-in- chief of this nation and as a person are high and unfailing. I shall never denigrate him. I certainly did not do so in Abeokuta. We have been political partners for a long time and I hope that partnership continues well into the future. I would do nothing to jeopardize it. I believe our party is the best hope for the nation to right itself. I believe I have a future role larger than the one I now have. I also believe President Buhari has a continuing and important role to play even after his tenure as president is over.\n\n\n\n\u201cIndeed, I consistently supported the president and his administration. Even when the administration has come under intense criticism, my feet have always been planted solidly in defence of the president. The president personally nominated me to coordinate his re-election campaign in 2019. He did this not because I opposed him or because I was indifferent. He did so, because I was firmly with him in 2015 and has stood firmly beside him ever since.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I publicly announced my aspiration to seek the party nomination for the upcoming presidential election, I stressed that my strategic objective was to build on the foundation laid by the Buhari administration. In fact, I believe I was the first aspirant to inform President Buhari of this presidential intention. It was a sign of the respect I have for him and his office. It is unthinkable that I would aspire to be the leader of the party for which I hope to be the next flag bearer. It makes no sense at all to do such an indelicate, unseemly thing.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am proud of my role in the advent of the APC and its electoral successes. But President Buhari, of course, stands as the main driver of this success. He was elected president twice. He has borne the weight of national governance for seven years. Nothing can rival that. I would not dare belittle what he has done and what he has meant to the party and nation.\u201d\n\n\n\nTinubu described Buhari as a Nigerian patriot and a man of integrity and that these qualities won him tremendous mass support leading to electoral victory in 2015 and 2019.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am proud to have been his partner in the political merger that became the APC and in making history by ousting an incumbent president for the first time in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cI make no apologies for seeking the party\u2019s nomination. I believe I have something important to offer Nigeria that the other aspirants do not have, although I see them as good and committed Nigerians in their own rights. While I want this office, there are certain things I will not do and certain lines I shall not cross. I shall never belittle myself by denigrating the president or his office. I dare not seek an office and disrespect it at the same time.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuhari Back from Spain\n\nPresident Buhari yesterday returned to Abuja after a three-day state visit Spain.\n\nShortly after his return, the President met with a two-man delegation of the PGF, led by its Chairman and Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu.\n\nBagudu and the Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, met behind closed-door with President Buhari.\n\nSources told THISDAY last night that the meeting was a follow up to the one held on Tuesday before the President travelled to Spain when he appealed to the 22 APC governors to allow him determine who among the 23 aspirants will flag the party\u2019s presidential flag during 2023 general elections.\n\nIt was gathered that Bagudu told President Buhari that the APC governors had met this week to review their Tuesday meeting with the President.\n\n\n\nHe was said to have also told the President that the PGF would still meet this weekend ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primaries convention scheduled for next Monday.\n\nPresident Buhari, sources said, will this weekend meet with critical stakeholdees in the APC with a view to carrying everybody along on what format the party\u2019s presidential primaries will take.\n\nMeanwhile, the President is expected to leave Abuja today for Accra, Ghana to attend an extra ordinary meeting of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).\n\nPresident Buhari who will be accompanied by some Ministers and top government officials is expected back in Abuja later today.\n\n\n\nSaraki, Babachir Lawal Chide Tinubu\n\nAPC chieftain, Babachir Lawal and former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, yesterday came down hard on Tinubu over his Abeokuta speech in which he talked about how he enthroned political leaders.\n\nIn his response to Tinubu, Saraki stated that when he opposed the plan to foist a Muslim-Muslim presidency on Nigeria in 2014 he acted in the national interest and believed Nigeria was bigger than anybody\u2019s ambition, including that of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nSaraki, in a statement signed by the head of his Media Office, Yusuph Olaniyonu, in response to the speech by Tinubu in Abeokuta, claiming that Saraki and others opposed his desire to be running mate to President Buhari in the 2015 elections, noted that he would oppose any plan that causes a religious crisis in a multi-religious country like Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I and other leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2014 stood against having a Muslim-Muslim ticket, it was not a decision targeted at any individual or group but one taken in the national interest. Asiwaju knows this and he is just being mischievous by presenting this decision as something aimed at stopping his ambition.\n\n\u201cLet me make it clear that the decision to oppose the plans by some people to make APC present a Muslim-Muslim ticket in 2015 was in the national interest and I will take the same stand today, tomorrow, and any other day. My stance is based on the fact that such a ticket is not good for the unity of the country and will further accentuate one of our fault lines.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe opposition to a Muslim- Muslim ticket was not targeted at Tinubu or any other person. It was a decision that even all party leaders know helped the victory of the party and also worked for the unity of the country. That decision is not about self but national and collective interests. It is a decision which served the purpose of the people of Nigeria and I have no regret supporting it\u201d, Saraki stated.\n\nWhile expressing surprise that Tinubu refused to move on and still sulked over what happened in 2014, the former Governor of Kwara State added that the APC presidential aspirant had become so fixated on the Muslim-Muslim ticket issue of 2014 that he worked so hard to stop the emergence of Saraki as Senate President in a move he considered as retaliatory.\n\n\n\nSaraki also stated that after he was elected Senate President, Tinubu maintained an adversarial position against the eighth National Assembly, initiated covert and overt measures aimed at undermining the federal legislature, and set the executive against the legislature.\n\nFormer Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal declared that it was very difficult supporting a Yoruba person in national politics, following Tinubu\u2019s outburst.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey have a way of making you regret your support because they eventually make you seem like a traitor to your own people. Now all these comments about Bola\u2019s Yoruba presidency and his support of Buhari without which Buhari would not have been president is bulshit.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t the only one whose support made a difference. There were many others from all around the country and they are not bragging about it. You may wish to know that all of us Buhari supporters are shocked and pissed off by Bola\u2019s speech on this occasion. It is unlike him.\u201d\n\nThe former SGF said Tinubu\u2019s speech was massively trending in the North \u201cand being given a negative connotation as you can well imagine.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said he first read it on an Adamawa group platform \u201cand the anger is palpable and all round.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill Tinubu win Monday\u2019s APC primaries without Northern support? You would think Yorubas will resist the temptation of joining in the northerners-bashing game at this very critical time \u2013 the primary election is only three days away. It is unfortunate that Bola himself chose to join in this bashing game \u2013 choosing to speak in the Yoruba language and in Yoruba land in a manner that seems to denigrate Buhari. I could vividly imagine the discomfort of all the northerners sitting beside him on that podium.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis appears to be the Abiola saga being replayed. Abiola won the election with majority Northern votes but they took the brunt of the post-election protests that followed.\n\n\u201cJust survey all the people that are doing more meaningful practical things to enthrone Bola as president and you will find that almost all are northerners while his kinsmen engage themselves in social media activism and Northern bashing.\n\n\u201cWhen Yorubas vilify the North like this, our sense of fear and insecurity under a Yoruba presidency gets heightened and in the end, pushes us to rethink our support for not only Bola but any Yoruba as president for that matter. Please, do not join our opponents to destroy our chances of clinching Monday\u2019s primary elections.\u201d\n\n\n\nCourt Asked to Disqualify Tinubu\n\nSome members of the APC under the platform of the Gaskiya Youth Movement have dragged Tinubu to court over what it alleges as discrepancies in the academic qualifications submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), in aide of his qualification for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe plaintiffs, Umar Iliyasu, Suleiman Baba, and Abubakar Adama, in the suit filed on June 2, 2022, are claiming that the educational history of Tinubu \u201cis not consistent with the earlier forms C.F. 001\u201d he filled in preparation for the Governorship election of Lagos State in the year 1999.\n\n\n\nOutside the academic issue, plaintiffs are also alleging discrepancies in the age as well as the indigeneship of the former Lagos State Governor and as such want the court to stop Tinubu from participating in the June 7 primary election from the selection of the APC\u2019s candidate in the 2023 presidential poll.\n\nThe APC, Tinubu, and INEC are 1st to 3rd defendants respectively in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/774/2022.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs are accusing the APC presidential aspirant of giving false information in contravention of the electoral laws and constitution.\n\n\n\nIn a 31 paragraph affidavit deposed to by one Miracle Udeaja in support of the suit, the plaintiffs submitted that \u201cThe 2nd defendant presented an incorrect educational history and inconsistent dates of birth in his forms and ought to be disqualified from seeking or contesting for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended)\u201d.\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs further submitted that any person seeking an elective position under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), who presents a false document is disqualified from that election or any subsequent elections\n\nAmongst the issues for determination are; \u201cwhether, upon the due consideration of Section 131 of the Constitution, section 84(3) of the Electoral Act 2022, Article 20(111) and (iv) of the Constitution of the APC and Articles 9, 13 and 17 of the guidelines for the nomination of candidates for the 2023 general election issued by the APC, the 2nd defendant can participate or contest in the primary election on the platform of the 1st defendant.\n\n\n\n\u201cGiven the questionable educational background and date of birth of the 2nd defendant, amongst other questionable issues, whether the 1 st defendant can allow and/or permit the participation of the 2nd defendant in the primary election for the office of the president.\n\n\u201cWhether the 2nd defendant can participate by presenting himself in any primary elections with any political party in Nigeria to be nominated as a presidential aspirant for the 2023 general election scheduled to take place in June 2022.\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs urged that where the court answers the above questions in the affirmative, then the following reliefs should be granted: A declaration that \u201cgiven the questionable educational background and date of birth of the 2nd defendant, amongst other questionable issues, the 1 st defendant cannot allow and/or permit the participation of the 2nd defendant in the primary election for the office of the president.\n\n\n\n\u201cA declaration that the 2nd defendant cannot participate by presenting himself in any primary elections with any political party in Nigeria to be nominated as a presidential aspirant for the 2023 general election scheduled to take place in June 2022.\n\n\u201cAn order disqualifying the 2nd defendant from contesting in the primary elections on the platform of the 1 st defendant scheduled for June 7, 2022, or any other day as may be fixed by the 1st defendant having not met the statutory requirements.\n\n\n\n\u201cAn order of perpetual injunction restraining the 2nd defendant from participating or presenting himself in any primary elections with any political party in Nigeria to be nominated as a presidential aspirant for the 2023 presidential election.\u201d\n\nBuhari Didn\u2019t Tell Govs to Pick Consensus Presidential Candidate\n\nPresidential spokesperson, Femi Adesina, yesterday faulted claims that the President Buhari asked members of the PGF to pick a consensus presidential candidate for the APC.\n\nHe said that contrary to reports, the President only met with the governors and gave them his \u201cexpectation\u201d for the forthcoming presidential primary of the party.\n\n\n\nAdesina stated these in a piece titled, \u2018Visit to Spain: Let\u2019s Buga for Mr. President\u2019.\n\nMaking clarifications on what transpired during the meeting, the presidential spokesperson explained that Buhari never discussed issues bordering on zoning, consensus, or imposition of candidates during his conversation with the governors.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, Buhari told them what he would like to see at the APC presidential primary to elect a presidential candidate early next week.\n\n\u201cHe said no word about zoning, consensus, or imposition of candidate. He just charged them to let their plans converge, so that the party would put its best foot forward. Shortly after the meeting, we headed for the airport.\n\n\n\n\u201cA short time into the about five hours flight, I went on social media, to see that all hell had broken loose. Trust some Nigerians. When there\u2019s no controversy, they simply create one. They will die of boredom if they don\u2019t have something to wail or ululate about.\n\n\u201cWhat were they bellyaching on? Oh, he used the words \u2018my successor,\u2019 instead of \u2018APC candidate.\u2019 That means he wants to rig the election.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, he talked about Governors who performed well being given opportunity to get a second term, for continuity. That means he wants to impose someone from within the government to succeed him. Consensus is what he wants. Puerile.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs consensus not one of the acceptable ways of choosing candidates, according to the Electoral Act? So the party can jolly well decide on the method it wants.\n\n\u201cOh, he didn\u2019t talk about zoning. APC wants to give its ticket to the North. Really? Did you see anything like that in the speech?\n\n\u201cI tell you. When some Nigerians don\u2019t see what they expect in a speech or statement, they simply conjure and create their own. And the wailing starts.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuhari had while addressing the governors on Tuesday ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primary taking place on Monday, said he would be seeking reciprocity from the governors ahead of the presidential primary.\n\n\u201cIn keeping with the established internal policies of the party and as we approach the convention in a few days, therefore, I wish to solicit the reciprocity and support of the governors and other stakeholders in picking my successor, who would fly the flag of our party for election into the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023,\u201d the President added.\n\n\n\nHe asked the governors to ensure that all interests \u2018converge\u2019 as regards the outcome of the presidential primary. The President added that the person who emerges as the presidential candidate must be one who could give Nigerians a sense of victory even before the polls.\n\n\n\nKano Court Clears APC Statutory Delegates\n\nA federal High Court in Kano yesterday declared statutory delegates of the APC eligible to vote at the June 6 National Convention in Abuja.\n\nThe judgement by Justice A.M Liman was sequel to an originating summons dated May 23, 2022 and filed on the 24th day of May, 2022.\n\nThe decision of the court allows senators and House of Reps members to vote during conventions, congresses and meetings.\n\n\n\nThe Suit No FHC/KN/CS/137/2022 had prayed the court to declare that Section 84(8) cannot be interpreted to have excluded statutory delegates from voting at the convention, congress or meeting by virtue of Section 223 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and Article 20(iv)(c) of the APC Constitution, which allow statutory delegates to vote at conventions, congresses or meetings.\n\n\n\nThe suit, which was filed by Senator Mas\u2019ud El-Jibrin Doguwa, Hon. Habibu Sani and Hon. Bilyaminu Yusif Shinkafi, had The Senate President, National Chairman of the APC, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as defendants.\n\nHowever, the court judgement may be difficult to implement as necessary parties to the case, like the National Chairman of the APC, were not served.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says \u2018it\u2019s the turn of Yoruba, and therefore my turn\u2019 to be president\n\n*Vice president meets Adamu, five governors\n\n*APC governors to convey their suggestion to president today\n\nDeji Elumoye, Emameh Gabriel in Abuja, Gboyega Akinsanmi in Lagos and James Sowole in Abeokuta\n\nIn a clear sign of desperation and fear that the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) might be slipping from his grasp, presidential hopeful and former governor of Lagos State, Senator Bola Tinubu, yesterday, declared, unequivocally, that he made Muhammadu Buhari President of Nigeria, nominated Professor Yemi Osinbajo as his running mate, and got Mr. Dapo Abiodun elected as Governor of Ogun State.\n\n\n\nTinubu insisted it was his turn to be president. Analysts are of the view that Tinubu may have decided to go for broke, after sensing he may be losing the opportunity to achieve his \u2018lifelong ambition\u2019 to be president of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe outburst in Abeokuta today is a sign of frustration with the refusal of President Buhari to endorse him publicly. It is significant that he said what he said in the home state of the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, another frontline contender for the APC ticket\u201d, an observer who pleaded anonymity noted.\n\nTinubu\u2019s assertions came as Osinbajo hosted the national chairman of APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and five governors of the ruling party.\n\n\n\nHowever, the governors said they would convey their collective decision regarding suggestions on Buhari\u2019s successor to the president today or tomorrow.\n\nBut former President of Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Chief Joseph Daudu (SAN), faulted Buhari\u2019s recent request to be allowed to choose his successor, describing it as patently unconstitutional and akin to a coup d\u2019etat.\n\n\n\nTinubu, who visited Ogun State in continuation of his tour to persuade delegates ahead of the APC presidential primary, declared that he facilitated the ascension of Buhari, Osinbajo, and Abiodun to their current positions.\n\nAccompanied on the tour by a retinue of serving and former governors, ministers, deputy governors, senators, and a host of others, Tinubu said he was making the revelations for the first time because there was need for him to talk.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf not for me talking to you today, Buhari would not have been president. It is over 25 years that I have been serving them. This one sitting behind me, Dapo Abiodun, he could not become the governor without me.\n\n\u201cSince the time we started with the Action Congress (AC), Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), and now, the All Progressives Congress (APC), I wanted to contest for president since those times.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is me telling you between my life and God Almighty, Buhari called me to be his vice president. He said because the first time he contested, he picked Okadigbo, flamboyant, Catholic, but Nigerians didn\u2019t vote for him.\n\n\u201cThe second time, he picked another Igbo, Ume Ezeoke, Nigerians didn\u2019t vote for him; that if he goes to bring the Pope to run as his vice, Nigerians won\u2019t vote for him, but you, Bola Tinubu, you have six governors, you have never lost an election before, come and be my vice.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe knew all the calculations then favoured us, that was why he wanted me as his vice, but I told him to let us build the party first. And when we finished building the party, after we brought in people from the PDP, Saraki now saw that those from the PDP will not get anything if Buhari, a Muslim, becomes the president and me, also a Muslim, becomes his vice, he won\u2019t get the senate president and the senate president cannot also be a Muslim, that was how they started the campaign of calumny against me.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd I told them that I have a candidate that is a Christian that I can nominate so that the party will not break, that was how I nominated Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. I surrendered my right to him (Osinbajo).\n\n\n\n\u201cI was asked to submit three names: Yemi Cardozo, Wale Edun, and Yemi Osinbajo, but I said that if I submitted three names, it is like opening your door for a thief. They may add the fourth name and choose that one. So, I insisted on only one name. You are hearing this thing from me for the first time.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is my time. I\u2019m educated, I\u2019m experienced. I have been serving you for a long time, bring me the presidency, it is my turn. When Atiku was being flogged out of the PDP by Obasanjo, he ran to me for help, I got the ticket for him. Nuhu Ribadu came to me and I backed him.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has been over 25 years now that I have been serving them.\n\nThis one sitting behind me, Dapo, can he say he can be the governor without me? We were together at the MKO Abiola Stadium, he was intimidated, they didn\u2019t want to give him the party\u2019s flag. I was the one that handed the flag to him. He knows that he cannot be the governor without the help of God and my support.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf not for me that stood behind Buhari, he wouldn\u2019t have become the president. He tried the first time, he failed, the second time, he failed, the third time, he failed. He even wept on national television and vowed never to contest again but I went to meet him in Kaduna and told him he will run again; I will stand by you and you will win, but you must not joke with Yorubas and he agreed.\n\n\n\n\u201cSince he became the president, I have never got ministerial slots, I didn\u2019t collect any contract, I have never begged for anything from him, it is the turn of Yoruba; it is my turn.\u201d\n\nTinubu, therefore, asked Ogun State delegates to vote for him at the forthcoming primary of the party, saying,\n\n\u201cPlease, stand by me, you delegates that are here, from Ogun State, you shall not become delicates. Don\u2019t be carried away by \u2018he is our son\u2019.\u201d\n\n\n\nResponding, Abiodun said the people had listened to Tinubu and heard all he said. The governor described Tinubu as a fighter, bold strategist, mentor, and dogged politician.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is a crucial time in the history of our nation. We shall do the needful and will justify why power must come to the South-west.\u201d\n\n\n\nOsinbajo Meets APC Chairman, 5 Governors\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday, played host to the chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and five governors.\n\nAdamu led the governors, whose identities could not be immediately ascertained, to the meeting with the vice president at the Akinola Aguda official residence of Osinbajo within the precincts of the State House, Abuja.\n\nAlthough the agenda of the meeting was not made public, there were speculations it might not be unconnected with the presidential primary of APC, scheduled to commence on Monday, June 6.\n\n\n\nSources told THISDAY that the meeting might have discussed the consensus option being canvassed by Buhari.\n\nAttempts to access the vice president\u2019s official residence on Thursday evening was refused by security men, who claimed they were on instruction not to allow anybody in, except on invitation.\n\nEfforts to also get information on the outcome of the meeting from the media aide to the vice president, Laolu Akande, also hit a brick wall, as he neither picked calls nor replied text messages.\n\nAPC Governors to Convey Their Suggestion to Buhari Today\n\nGovernors of the ruling APC resolved to convey their proposal on President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s successor to him when he returns from Madrid. This followed their meeting with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, one of the presidential hopefuls of the party, which held Wednesday night, ahead of Buhari\u2019s return to the country today.\n\nA presidential aide told THISDAY that the meeting centred around the party\u2019s presidential primary slated for next week Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n\n\nAt the meeting, which lasted till 3am on Thursday, Osinbajo was said to have passionately appealed to the governors to see him as someone that could be trusted with the APC ticket, and one capable of winning the election for the ruling party.\n\n\n\nThe meeting also came at a time when there was apparent pressure on one of the national leaders of APC, Bola Tinubu, to shelve his presidential ambition.\n\n\n\nAPC sources confirmed that the Kano State governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, one of Tinubu\u2019s close allies, was directed to have a word with him, in an attempt to advise Tinubu to align with the president\u2019s decision to pick a nominee of his choice as the party\u2019s candidate for next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\n\n\nA party source told THISDAY that only a few governors of the party were opposed to the president\u2019s resolve to choose a successor. This was confirmed by a senior party official, who craved anonymity, but disclosed that since the meeting, most APC governors loyal to the president had visited the State House to affirm their readiness to work with Buhari\u2019s candidate.\n\n\n\nThe source said, \u201cThe governors on their own decided to go and discuss the matter and promised Mr. President they will revert. After a long meeting into the night, they resolved to adjourn; at that point, the majority were ready to align with Mr. President.\n\n\n\n\u201cSince after the meeting, many of the governors have been coming to the villa one by one to express readiness to work with Mr. President\u2019s choice. They will all report their decision to the president anytime from tomorrow. Everyone of them already knows who the president is talking about.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe presidential aide said Buhari had taken his decision and was not ready to go back on it.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe president has said his mind and the governors know what is at stake at this moment. He was even democratic in his approach not to have put it straight to them that this was his candidate, like others would have done.\n\n\u201cGovernor Ganduje, to the best of my knowledge, has been asked to speak with Tinubu to drop his ambition for the sake of peace and progress of the party.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Key Choices Before Buhari",
          "text": "\n\n\n\nOlawale Olaleye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, Monday, tinkered with the mood in his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), and, indeed, the nation, when he hinted at the possibility of a consensus in the choice of the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\n\n\nBuhari had at a meeting with the 22 governors of the party, in the presence of the National Chairman, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, cleverly stated that he wanted \u201creciprocity\u201d in the process leading to the choice of his successor.\n\nHe simply asked to be allowed to determine who the fellow would be, as the governors, (so it was presumed), too, determined successors in their respective states.\n\n\n\nThe idea of seeking to be allowed to determine his successor did not come about by chance. The president was believed to have been mulling his options and, especially, how to go about it in the past few weeks.\n\nSources within the party had also hinted of a discreet committee long set up by the president to look at the options before him from the array of aspirants currently jostling to fly the flag of the ruling APC.\n\nThe committee, which sources claimed, had long submitted its report, did so with some of the options deemed suitable from the lot and also offered explanation on each, allegedly.\n\n\n\nWhile the sources declined to divulge the options presented to the president and why, the Monday meeting during which the president hinted at a possible consensus, was a follow-up to the committee report and, by extension, a clue on what would happen next week, when APC holds its presidential convention.\n\n\n\nVery importantly, too, Buhari\u2019s meeting with the governors, which held on a day the screening of the presidential aspirants of the party came to a close, was considered strategic to send home the right message. This is more so, as one critical question asked the aspirants during screening was what their reaction would be if the party embraced the consensus option for its primary election.\n\n\n\nSince Buhari dropped the bombshell, shortly before departing for Madrid, Spain, on an official visit, discussions have continued almost endlessly, as to who his choice might be, even though he would not pick outside of the 22 men and a woman screened by the committee led by a former national chairman of the party and erstwhile governor of Edo State, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun.\n\n\n\nBut Buhari, typically, has managed to keep sealed lips, while keeping everyone guessing and the nation in suspense. Buhari\u2019s choice is today the best kept secret, as no one can claim knowledge of the choice.\n\nFor a while, former President Goodluck Jonathan seemed like the beautiful bride. And with an eagle eye, the press kept vigil and made headlines of any scrap of information from that camp. But events that have played out thus far, have excluded him as a tantalising prospect. Could it still be him? Well, not that it\u2019s just impossible, but it is now highly improbable.\n\n\n\nYet, if Jonathan was out of the race or was never in it in the first place, these men are not. The president is believed to have narrowed his choice to these 10 men from the 23 aspirants. They are Bola Tinubu, Yemi Osinbajo, Ibikunle Amosun, Kayode Fayemi, Chibuike Amaechi, Godswill Akpabio, Ken Nnamani, Ogbonnaya Onu, Ahmed Lawan, and Abubakar Badaru.\n\n\n\nThis, however, is notwithstanding the new thinking in the party, which seeks to broaden the space to allow for more options before the party journeys to its presidential convention next Monday, even though stakeholders are still sharply divided over zoning of the party\u2019s ticket in order to face the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.\n\n\n\nBut the question remains: who amongst these men will Buhari pick? Who is the president\u2019s choice hiding in plain sight? In 72 hours or less, the nation shall know that which is hidden in the mind of the president.\n\nBelow are the possible contenders profiled in no particular order.\n\nBola Tinubu\n\nTheir paths to a promising political partnership first crossed in the run-up to the 2011 general election, when an alliance was proposed between Buhari and Tinubu, including running on a joint ticket, although a Muslim-Muslim blend. But the intrigues of that era were a bit too much for their proposal to fly and so, the idea was rested.\n\nIt was, therefore, not difficult to pick up from where they stopped, when the lead up to the 2015 elections also demanded some kind of partnership, stronger than the alliance proposed in 2011. Tinubu provided the grounds for the merger and joined other forces to raise the team that sent an incumbent government packing.\n\n\n\nAlthough Tinubu came to the merger with the mindset of the 2011 understanding of paring with Buhari, what was at stake in 2015 was bigger than the minced meat of 2011. So that understanding died a natural death. But Tinubu would not stop talking about it and if he ever falls in the consideration of Buhari, it would be a compensation for his lifelong ambition.\n\nYemi Osinbajo\n\nTheir first ever meeting was the night he was introduced to him as his co-pilot for the Nigerian project. He could barely even remember his name in their first-ever outing together after that, when he erroneously referred to his running mate as \u201cOsinbande\u201d during an introduction. But seven years after, all that is history.\n\n\n\nAs dependable allies, Buhari and Osinbajo, have walked through the thick and thin of addressing many of Nigeria\u2019s challenges. In his capacity as vice president, he has stepped forward to the demands of his office without reservation from any quarters. As acting president, Osinbajo made good the opportunities, which came a couple of times, to prove the stuff he is made of.\n\n\n\nTherefore, after almost eight years together as a seemingly indivisible duo, Osinbajo ordinarily stands out as a good successor, who would easily sell the agenda of the ruling party. But there are much deeper considerations beyond being his current deputy and this would be part of the factors to juggle, when his name eventually comes up.\n\nIbikunle Amosun\n\nHis relationship with Buhari comes in two parts. One, as family and, two, as political ally. But he is closer as an adopted member of the Buhari family, who has been with him for many years. No doubt, he is the closest to Buhari in the South-west. Little wonder, he is the only \u201cstranger\u201d allowed to see Buhari\u2019s surviving sister. The two also flaunt their relationship without minding whose ox is gored.\n\n\n\nAmosun has often taken it upon himself to do some political clean-up for the president, evidently, without prodding. It is personal for him. Even more, as a two-term governor of Ogun State, a state he rescued from the throes of economic and social maladies, Amosun\u2019s management of security in the state at a time banks could not open for business for fear of robbers and how he marked up the state\u2019s IGR are clear indications of capacity, competence, and ability to think outside the box.\n\n\n\nWhichever angle his consideration comes from as Buhari\u2019s likely choice, Amosun stands firm and able to take up the challenge, of course, with the support of the party and other stakeholders.\n\nKayode Fayemi\n\nTelling the story of the formation of the APC and the young men, who burnt their energies to make it happen, without acknowledging the role Fayemi played would be history in poor revision. From how the name, APC, came about to the first announcement that introduced the \u201cbaby party\u201d to the people of Nigeria, whoever is writing the story of the APC would not be seen as having done justice to it without properly documenting how Fayemi fared.\n\nFrom his appointment as Minister of Steel, to his current office as not just the governor of Ekiti State, but also the governor of governors, the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), Fayemi has helped both Buhari and the party to manage his colleagues, to the admiration of the president, without crossing the lines on either side.\n\n\n\nA progressive, young and promising mind, Fayemi\u2019s development focus puts him in good stead. That\u2019s in addition to sound academic background and choice of war studies for his PhD study, which are indications of palpable competence and capacity to cause change to happen. Thinking Fayemi, clearly, puts these and more into account.\n\nChibuike Amaechi\n\nThe former Rivers State governor wormed his way to the heart of the president long before the election of 2015. Based on personal conviction, even though he had no clue what the future held for him, Amaechi had told everyone, who cared to listen that the only person, who could win the election for APC was Buhari. His conviction was further given fillip by two things: the need to fight corruption and insecurity.\n\n\n\nThus, Amaechi, working with like-minds, went all out and gave everything, even at personal expense, to make sure Buhari emerged, not just as the candidate of APC at its 2014 presidential convention in Lagos, but also emerged victorious at the general election.\n\n\n\nAside boasting enviable record, both as governor and Minister of Transportation, Amaechi, also has to his credit, the experience of having managed his colleagues at the level of speaker and as governor of governors for eight years. This puts him, too, in a vantage position. And as one of those who have done the administration proud with his railway revolution, he is standing pretty strong in the current equation.\n\nGodswill Akpabio\n\nWearing the badge of uncommon transformation as governor of Akwa Ibom State for eight years, the immediate past Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, is the second person, aside Amaechi, from the South-south, who is being penciled in for the job of the president as a result of the current confusion in APC.\n\n\n\nAlthough a second-class APC member by reason of the time he joined the party, Akpabio is also a latecomer to the \u201cconference of presidential aspirants\u201d owing to the time he enlisted in the race. But, as a lawyer with potential for political novelties, he has claimed a slot in the race, as the party and president struggle to pick a consensus candidate acceptable to all.\n\n\n\nWith these in view, Akpabio is another South-south possibility, should Buhari resolve to go to the oil producing part of the country, as part of the balancing act to even out the power equation.\n\nKen Nnamani\n\nVery few people from the South-east enjoy the kind of admiration that the former senate president gets from the president. Buhari is said to have a thing for him, especially, his maturity and capacity to manage people and relationships, irrespective of their contrasting dispositions.\n\n\n\nCuriously, his tenure as senate president has remained one abiding testimonial that he takes about. He stood against the alleged third term agenda of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, and followed it up till the federal legislature killed it and paved the way for the 2007 elections.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the debate about his knowledge of the country does not arise, if the ability to manage his colleagues, is a factor to reckon. And coming from the South-east, which is desperately seeking to produce the president in the interest of equity, justice and fairness, Nnamani is not standing badly in the consideration, if the dice rolls up South-east.\n\nOgbonnaya Onu\n\nTalk about an Igbo man, who commands genuine respect from the president, the former Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu, has no rival. He has maintained a good relationship with Buhari since the early years of the country\u2019s return to civil rule, when their paths crossed in the All Progressives Party (APP) \u2013 a camaraderie they enjoyed till the APC merger in 2015.\n\n\n\nAlthough Onu\u2019s placement in the cabinet is largely attributable to what he brought to the merger table, that he has kept his job has also been because Buhari has a personal relationship with him, which he considers more important than whatever new thing their political romance mighty have birthed.\n\n\n\nA respectable southeasterner and elder statesman, Onu\u2019s presence in the race for presidency is another pointer to the clamour for a president of the Igbo extraction. And with a resume that speaks to experience and capacity, although acceptability is debatable, Onu is equally strong in consideration, should the president decide to go to the east.\n\nAhmad Lawan\n\nWhat was first thought to be a child\u2019s play has turned around to pose one of the biggest threats to southern presidency in the APC. At least, so it is believed. Lawan\u2019s presidential bid was said to be an idea conceived out of the many extrapolations that envisaged what direction the opposition PDP might go. Same thinking has given rise to new ideas.\n\n\n\nBut cashing in on the confusion on the turf and the rigidity of the multiple southern aspirants, Lawan\u2019s choreographed idea has come to reality, standing conspicuously in the way of the southern agenda, which seeks power shift after Buhari\u2019s eight years in office by May 2023.\n\n\n\nLawan might not have particularly impressed a majority of Nigerians with his performance as President of the Senate. That\u2019s almost a consensus. His tenure pandered too much to virtually everything Buhari wanted, whether or not it sat well with the people. Particularly, his leadership made a mess of the amendment to the 2022 Electoral Act, which has continued to count against him. But all these have not reduced his place as a major contender to the nation\u2019s top job.\n\nAbubakar Badaru\n\nHere comes the dark horse in the true sense of it. The only thing many people can recall about the Jigawa State governor, Abubakar Badaru, is that he bought the presidential expression of interest and nomination forms and submitted them as others did. Not that he had been seen anywhere or caught on camera consulting with delegates or leaders in different parts of the country.\n\n\n\nAlthough a colleague of his from a neighbouring state was said to be preferred after some of the party\u2019s analyses were contextualised. However, because the fellow was said to have some issues with the United States government, then, the idea of encouraging Badaru became inevitable for reasons of realpolitik, when the threat posed by the opposition was all thrown on the table.\n\n\n\nThus, if the decision of the president is to go to the north, then, Badaru is said to come first before even before Lawan. That he has maintained a radio silence is not unintentional but part of the script meant to evolve and materialise at the nick of time.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The ruling All Progressives Congress presidential aspirants from the South-West are expected to hold a final meeting in Abuja today (Saturday) to decide on the way forward, Punch reports.\n\nThe seven presidential aspirants from the South-West are Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; APC leader, Bola Tinubu; Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State; former Ogun State governor, Ibikunle Amosun; Deputy Majority Leader of the Senate, Ajayi Boroffice; a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole; and fiery Lagos cleric, Pastor Tunde Bakare.\n\nAlso expected at the meeting are governors; Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Gboyega Oyetola (Osun) and Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo). Some ministers of South-West extraction are also expected to attend the parley.\n\nThe meeting would hold at the Abuja home of a former governor of Ogun State, Chief Olusegun Osoba, around 8pm.\n\nImpeccable sources told Punch that the discussion would border on South-West unity and reach a possible consensus.\n\nOne of the aspirants, who wished to remain anonymous, said, \u201cWe will all be meeting at Chief Osoba\u2019s home by 8pm in Abuja. Everyone is expected to be present. We will all sit together and discuss the need to ensure that the South-West gets the ticket.\n\n\u201cHowever, all of us will be asked to be truthful with one another and see who among us has the best chance of winning the primary. Then if anyone is willing to step down to boost the chances of the South-West, then this will be encouraged.\u201d\n\nIntense lobbying by some northern governors to ensure that the APC gives its presidential ticket to a northerner had unsettled the South-West bloc of the party.\n\nThis was said to have caused Tinubu\u2019s outburst at a meeting with Ogun State delegates on Thursday, where he insisted that the APC must give its ticket to a Yoruba man and that he must be the favoured candidate.",

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from May",
          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Founder of Babymigo speaks on reducing maternal deaths in Africa",
          "text": "Kemi is the co-founder of Babymigo, a Nigerian femtech startup founded in 2017 to expand access to quality information on pregnancy and parenthood. It works by providing a digital platform where expectant, pregnant, and nursing mothers can connect with their peers and experts as well as find local health and welfare services. Overall, it creates an inclusive support system for new and expecting parents to help make informed decisions during pregnancy and parenthood.\n\nTechCabal had a conversation with Kemi about Babymigo\u2019s background, challenges, motivation, and future plans.\n\nBabymigo website\n\nBabymigo\u2019s background\n\nHannatu Asheolge: How did the idea of Babymigo come about?\n\nKemi Olawoye: As a physiotherapist, I worked at a hospital where it was my job to lead antenatal classes, which included exercise. In my interactions with the pregnant women there, I discovered that a lot of them were misinformed on maternal health issues and were also subscribed to harmful cultural beliefs. When I met my co-founder, who also worked in the health sector, we decided to do something to combat this misinformation.\n\nHA: It\u2019s been 4 to 5 years since your company launched, and it has accomplished a lot. As CEO and co-founder, what have your key achievements been?\n\nKO: We\u2019ve seen a steady increase in the number of users since our launch. Now, we have up to 250,000 users on our platform, including pregnant women and new parents. We also raised our pre-seed in this period, which led to a lot of international partnerships and recognitions. Some notable ones include the Google Black Founders Fund and the GIST Initiative by the US Department of State.\n\nHA: What are some of your biggest challenges?\n\nKO: There are two major challenges we\u2019ve faced. The first one is human resources. Finding the right people who are committed to our vision of reducing maternal and child mortality rates was quite difficult, but I believe we\u2019ve managed to get past that. We now have built a team of passionate people.\n\nThe second challenge was more about an error in our initial plan. We didn\u2019t involve our users in our solutions, and this led to some dissonance between what we were working on and what our users actually needed us to work on.\n\nHA: What motivates you?\n\nKO: The statistics on child and mother mortality rates in Nigeria are my biggest motivation. Nigeria is currently one of the worst places in the world to have a child. Statistics show that 1 in 22 women that will get pregnant in Nigeria will most likely die from pregnancy-related complications due to misinformation and lack of adequate support.\n\nKemi Olawoye\n\nThe role of tech in improving maternal healthcare\n\nHA: How big of a role do you think tech can play in improving maternal health in Nigeria?\n\nKO: There\u2019s a growing number of people in Africa now with access to the internet. We can leverage this internet access to spread healthy information to them. Also, providing a community with millions of other moms is a great way to counter harmful cultural beliefs around pregnancy. It\u2019s easier to learn and believe something when there are millions of other women who are learning with you and confirming these beliefs.\n\nHA: What singular aspect of maternal healthcare in Nigeria do you think needs the most urgent intervention?\n\nKO: If I had to pick one, I\u2019d say addressing the inaccurate information on these cultural beliefs.\n\nHA: If you could describe the Nigerian femtech sector in one word, what would it be?\n\nKO: I\u2019d pick \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d.\n\nHA: What are the things you believe will accelerate the growth of the maternal health sector in Nigeria?\n\nKO: The first thing will be to identify policies and interventions that affect outcomes in terms of maternal and child health. The second thing will be restructuring or improving our current healthcare system. About 50% of Nigerians are already living below the average income level. This means that more than half of the female population cannot afford to pay for antenatal care in a regular hospital. The government needs to provide quality healthcare for free or at affordable rates for these women in order to lower the child and maternal mortality rates.\n\nHA: You\u2019ve mentioned quite a number of solutions. How do we incorporate technology into these solutions? How can tech help?\n\n\n\nKO: There can be digitising of some routine healthcare services. These can be in the form of online consultations or even digital classes which can go a long way. For a number of women, visiting a clinic is time-consuming and being able to reach a doctor online will go a long way to help women gain access to health services.\n\nNew services and future plans\n\nHA: Babymigo recently launched the Mamacare plan. Can you tell us more about that?\n\nKO: Mamacare is a maternity plan that allows mums to access antenatal child delivery and baby care services in about 120 multi-partner hospitals across Nigeria.\n\nHA: What are some of the things to expect from Babymigo in the next 5 years?\n\nKO: The plan is definitely to continue empowering more mums across Africa. In the next 3 years, we hope to provide healthcare services to 10 million mums across the African continent.\n\nWe\u2019re also looking at geographical expansion, as maternal health issues are not peculiar to Nigeria. We\u2019re looking at expanding to Ghana and Kenya within the next 5 years. Another thing we\u2019re looking at is expanding our services. We hope to be able to partner with telecom service providers to provide information via SMS for mums in rural areas who do not have access to the internet.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Patricia\u2019s CEO on taking risks and building for impact",
          "text": "Hanu Fejiro may today, at 26, sit atop a crypto exchange company boasting of 30,000 daily transactions and 660,000 users, but only a few years ago, he knew little about cryptocurrencies. The company in question, Patricia Technologies\u2014or just Patricia\u2014was originally registered in Nigeria as a gift card exchange after Fejiro fell into the hands of fraudsters.\n\nHe\u2019d received a gift card worth \u20a630,000 (~$73), in 2015, from his uncle in the US, in lieu of a monthly allowance. Needing to exchange the gift card for cash, he went online to transact with a gift card exchange, only to fall victim to a scam. Gift card scams are commonplace: users are asked to disclose the card\u2019s number, unwittingly granting the scammer access to its funds. After his experience, Fejiro figured that if he was getting scammed, others were too; building an exchange where people could safely exchange their gift cards for cash was an obvious opportunity. And he seized it.\n\nFor the next 2 years, from 2017 through 2018, Patricia would operate as a gift card exchange. But not for long.\n\nIn 2019, Fejiro transitioned Patricia from gift card exchanging to a line that he found to be blossoming in popularity and demand: crypto trading. Nigeria was on the cusp of being identified, within the next 2 years\u20142020 and 2021\u2014as a leading crypto economy. The stats thrown around about this development functioned as both news headlines and high praise for the country\u2019s crypto adoption rate. The highest number of Google searches for \u201cbitcoin\u201d came from Nigeria. Twenty-three-point-seven percent of Nigerians online owned some form of cryptocurrency. Businesses were adding crypto plugins to their payment options. Trading volumes were surpassing $1 million per day on Binance.\n\nIf an economy could be a crypto heaven, Nigeria was looking like it. But the country\u2019s government did not share the enthusiasm. Soon, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) would descend its regulatory hammer on crypto trading, and Fejiro would have to think fast to save his young business.\n\nThinking fast, moving faster\n\nFejiro is speaking to me from Dubai. It has taken me and his team 5 weeks to schedule this interview; there\u2019d been a scheduling conflict in February and a long silence after that, until April, when he gets on a call with me, 6 minutes late, battling a cold that sometimes fogs up his voice. And yet, the story he tells me over the course of an hour, about himself and Patricia, is clear and does not stumble. It\u2019s a story he\u2019s told so many times he knows it backwards\u2014which comes as no surprise; he will write his memoir someday, he assures me, and is already shooting footage of his life for a future documentary.\n\nAs an undergraduate at the University of Port Harcourt, studying mathematics and statistics, he\u2019d done everything he could to make some extra change. He sold noodles, then popcorn, then started a clothing company, and had even attempted to start a taxi business. The list of start-and-stop businesses to his credit would eventually stretch from 5 to 13\u2014all before his hit venture: Patricia.\n\nI wonder at his going bullish on several entrepreneurial ventures while still in school. I ask as delicately as I can manage: was he poor? He says no. He\u2019d lost his dad when he was 8 and his mum when he was 16, just before university, but he hadn\u2019t lacked anything; his extended family took good care of him. He just had always been entrepreneurial, he says. When he was in primary school, growing up in Warri, south-south Nigeria, he distributed candy to 4 primary schools in his neighbourhood, earning enough profit to pay his family\u2019s rent for 2 years.\n\nFejiro has an uncomplicated relationship with executing his ideas; he does not overthink them. In his world, if it sounds like a plan, it probably is. He\u2019d christened his company by its curious name on a whim: his mother\u2019s name was Patience, but his grandfather preferred to call her Patricia, to annoy her, and start an argument\u2014every time. Many years later, when Patricia popped into Fejiro\u2019s head as a suggestion for his company\u2019s name, he didn\u2019t think about it twice.\n\n\u201cYou may spend so much time thinking and not acting fast enough,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd the market is actually moving. You need to be able to move as fast as the market. When you spend too much time thinking, you end up losing everything.\u201d\n\nAnd so, when the CBN suddenly banned commercial banks from facilitating crypto transactions, Fejiro knew he had to think\u2014and act\u2014 quickly.\n\nNews of the ban had dropped on February 5, 2021, a Friday afternoon. Reactions to it on social media were riotous, angry, and pained. The apex bank had not only proscribed banks from servicing crypto transactions, it had ordered them to close all accounts found to be used for crypto trading. Worse, the following week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) banned crypto use altogether.\n\nWhen it became clear that the country\u2019s regulations had a hostile attitude towards crypto use, Fejiro relocated Patricia\u2019s headquarters to Estonia, a country in northeastern Europe, famous\u2014at the time\u2014for its liberal crypto regime. This was 5 months after the ban in Nigeria.\n\nThe Estonian business environment is famously progressive. The country has an e-residency programme\u2014the first country in the world to introduce this; a young entrepreneur can easily incorporate their startup there, in a process that takes less than an hour and costs less than \u20ac5,000\u2014all based on a residency permit that is entirely digital. The country had even considered introducing its own national cryptocurrency, the estcoin, in 2017.\n\nBut the Estonian crypto party would not last long. Three months after Patricia\u2019s relocation, the Estonian government opened discussions to tighten its crypto regulations; in March this year, the tightening became law, a move directed at combating rising fraud and money laundering issues associated with its earlier liberal crypto regulations.\n\nAlthough Fejiro supports the tightened regulations, it would seem that he is cautious about camping his business too close to regulatory quick fire. He moved Patricia\u2019s headquarters to Lithuania.\n\n\u201cWe moved out of Estonia when the law became too stringent for us to operate,\u201d he says.\n\nWay bigger than him now\n\nFejiro rises at 7:30 AM, every day. Three times a week his day begins with him receiving management updates from a team he had gradually built from 2 to over 350 employees spread across Ghana, Lithuania, the UK, Nigeria, and China. The management meetings set the tone of his day. Although he describes himself as a risk taker, building a thriving business may have given that trait an altruistic edge. When he started Patricia, he\u2019d invested all his personal money in the venture, but he tells me now that that kind of risk taking is well behind him. \u201cWhen you start a company, you really have nothing to lose except your life savings\u2014and that\u2019s just my life savings. I will take risks, though,\u201d he cautions, lest I get it twisted, \u201cbut at the scale we\u2019re at now, I wouldn\u2019t take a bet-the-company risk, because Patricia is way bigger than me now.\u201d\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "Russia-Ukraine war slows economic recovery of Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 IMF",
          "text": "Ari Aisen, IMF resident representative to Nigeria has said that Subsaharan Africa was in the recovery process from the Covid pandemic when they suffered a second shock from the Russian-Ukraine war. This has reduced the pace of the region\u2019s growth, and elevated debts.\n\nAisen made this known during an interview on Arise TV monitored by business day. He said that \u201caccording to the Economic Outlook by the IMF, growth for the region is expected to be much slower at 3.8 percent compared to an estimated growth of 4.5 percent in 2021. Oil and agricultural commodities importers in this region are suffering the negative effects of the war, coupled with inflationary pressures\u201d.\n\nSpeaking further, Aisen said that \u201ccountries in this region are having an already exposed and very high debt position because they had used up the limited fiscal space that they could to support their economies during the pandemic and pray there shouldn\u2019t be a third shock which would offset the whole world and individuals.\u201d\n\nGrowth in Africa\u2019s largest economy is estimated at 3.4 percent in 2022, and its debt is expected to increase to 100 percent in 2026, also an estimation of N6 trillion to be spent on fuel subsidies.\n\n\u201cThings are complicated in Nigeria regarding debt service to revenues of the federal government and if nothing is done it might reach 100 percent,\u201d Aisen added.\n\nHe attributed the high debt service to low revenue intake by the federal government and the fact that some of the expenditures like subsidies that are being deducted from the revenues, could actually be dealt with in a different way which would leave more revenues.\n\nRead also: IMF: Nigeria to pay N6trn for oil subsidies in 2022\n\nTo address the economic turmoil, the IMF resident representative to Nigeria said that the top priority of the government should be to enhance and strengthen existing mechanisms to bring more revenue and reprioritize spending more on social investments, infrastructures, education, nutrition, and health rather than on subsidies. \u201cRestoring fiscal sustainability and reducing deficits should hinge on efforts to mobilize more revenues not to reduce spending which is already very low,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, Aisen advised that everyone should be accountable for the good use of resources being accumulated and there needs to be the support for the program by the ministry of finance of raising the revenue to GDP ratio through better tax administration, more enforcement of digitalization, and a better incentive for people and companies to pay their dues.\n\nAisen stated that Nigeria is a very strong economy that still will be able to sustain her level of debt. GDP is growing now at a moderate level so Nigeria doesn\u2019t suffer solvency issues. The priority for the new administration come May 2023, would be to restore fiscal sustainability, by mobilizing more revenues, and not relying on debt to finance those critical expenditures.\n\nHe added that the fuel subsidies are aggressive and that the rich benefit more from fuel subsidies than the poor.\n\nThe first thing to do is to fix this situation by compensating the most vulnerable that would be affected by the elimination of the fuel subsidies.\n\nHe further stated that the Ministry of Finance is working along with the IMF in creating a mechanism for recognizing and transferring funds that will compensate for the losses of these most vulnerable and that the removal of subsidies should be done with consensus in order to restore fiscal sustainability.",

          "title": "Towards the 2023 general election: A grammar intervention",
          "text": "The events and activities surrounding the forthcoming 2023 election have been evaluated from different analytical perspectives. This piece will appraise the electoral procedure from a linguistic standpoint by shedding light (not, shedding more light) on the wrong use of words.\n\nMost trending in the process is the juicy reward of the privileged delegates who have been hand-picked to represent the other party faithfuls in the selection of candidates among the several aspirants. Worthy of note in the previous sentence is the wrong use of \u2018privileged\u2019 and \u2018the\u2026 faithfuls\u2019.\n\nPrivilege is often erroneously spelt with letter \u2018d\u2019 to generate the wrong form: privilege. This is an error of generalisation born out of the similarity of the word with other words such as knowledge. Also, all of the people who have been loyal members or supporters of a political party, for a long time, are collectively called the party faithful, not the party faithfuls.\n\nThe difference between an aspirant and a candidate is also worthy of mention. It should be mentioned that those who compete for the ticket of a party are aspirants, whereas candidates are the representatives of the different parties in an election.\n\nMoving on, many Nigerians have described as undemocratic the electoral process which allows some paid delegates to present their choices to the electorate. Be in the know that all of the people allowed to vote in a country are collectively called the electorate (not, the electorates).\n\nIt is now the case that affluence, not credibility, integrity and personality, is the parameter for fielding candidates. It should be mentioned that political parties field (not, fill or file) candidates for election.\n\nThe delegate-based primary election in Nigeria will automatically disqualify up-and-coming politicians who are not so rich, especially the young ones. People likely to achieve success in the near future are said to be up-and-coming (not, upcoming).\n\nThe adjective \u2018upcoming\u2019 is used to refer to an event which is about to happen. We can say, therefore, that up-and-coming politicians do not stand a chance in the upcoming general election.\n\nWith the huge sum that those contesting elections would have spent on electioneering, one really wonders if the citizens can anticipate good governance. As used in the foregoing sentence, people \u2018contest\u2019 elections; they do not \u2018contest for\u2019 elections. Be that as it may, \u2018contest\u2019 can attract the preposition \u2018for\u2019 when used as a noun, as the example sentence below shows:\n\nThe contest for the presidency will be between two major candidates.\n\nAlthough we cannot \u2018contest for\u2019 an office, note that we can \u2018vote for\u2019 or \u2018vote against\u2019 a person. Also, the activities that politicians and their supporters carry out in order to persuade people to vote for them or their political parties during elections are described as \u2018electioneering\u2019, not \u2018electioneering campaign\u2019.\n\nRead also: Organisation sensitises Nigerians on peaceful elections\n\nA major worry is that, upon assuming office, some of these politicians will likely embark on white elephants. A white elephant is something that costs a lot of money but serves no useful purpose. This phrase should not be extended as \u2018white elephant projects\u2019.\n\nWe will be optimistic that social and economic infrastructure will not suffer for what delegates have collected from politicians. We can only hope that several money laundering scandals (not, money laundry) will not follow this electoral jamboree.\n\nAgain, maybe a number of aspirants will fetch up in hospitals by the time their appeasements to delegates yield nothing. Note that to arrive somewhere, especially without intending to, is to fetch up.\n\nOne will wonder if the aspirants are really spending so much just to serve their fatherland (not, father\u2019s land). With all that the delegates are gifted in cash, we can only hope that the country is not sitting on a powder keg (not, keg of gun powder).\n\nOf course, many a politician is an orator, and we anticipate the season of promises after the primary elections. They should bear in mind that actions speak louder than words (not, voice).

He shouted across the car as I made my way to the entrance door of my house. Na me you dey shout for? I asked beginning to get angry. No\u2026 he said, as I half turned.

We have some new blood who seem almost more vicious in disenfranchising us and focusing on what\u2019s in it for me. Then we have some yesterday politicians; same old. For me there has to be a new orientation and people who honestly mean to improve our lives and take us to the promised land. So a mix should really be the answer. Those with ideas who can rescue us. And if the person is young and foolish, we are finished. If they are in the older generation and vacuous then we are cooked.

We need relief. That makes this election a break or make affair.\n\nMany elections ago, I received a note from foremost economist, Chief Rasheed Gbadamosi.

It was an election year and I had written about political posters and psychological profiling of candidates and politicians in the race.\n\nIt gives me the greatest pleasure to paraphrase some of my thoughts as it was those many elections ago. And it applies to that election as it is with this one. The posters. What do we see. Look closely at the pictures. Look into their eyes. Which ones present a fraudulent look? Which ones are bloodthirsty? Which ones are going to molest us? Which ones won\u2019t keep their promises? Which ones are returning to complete our impoverishment which they started in the last election? Which ones are deranged and need help? The posters are here.\n\nThey are on bridges. On walls on billboards everywhere. Look closely. Even at the words. Which ones mean well and which ones don\u2019t? And politically deviant behaviour is not gender-selective. It\u2019s as bad with some female politicians as it is with some men. As the election fever heightens, let us be wary. Let us stay awake. Let us pick wisely.

          "title": "Dear Nigerian entrepreneur: The law applies to you too",
          "text": "Three years ago, while presenting my show \u201cRed Tape Africa\u201d on Africa Business Radio, I hosted Eke Urum, then CEO of a company called Cash Estates. You might be more familiar with the name Risevest, which it later morphed into.\n\nOn that episode, I was talking about the Kenyan government\u2019s decision to shut down two popular ride-hailing services in Nairobi for not operating under the proper licence. My position was simple:\u201cAfrica needs jobs and innovation creates jobs. Under no circumstances should a regulator ever stand in the way of job-creation in Africa.\u201d\n\nI expected Eke, as the founder of a fintech startup to share my position 100 percent. Instead, he adopted a significantly more cautious, middle-of-the-road tone. It was true, he said, that operators should obtain the correct licences and obey the law, but the government should also try to work with them to assist them attain compliance, instead of merely wielding the big \u201cban\u201d hammer against them.\n\nAt the time, I thought he was merely being diplomatic, given that his startup was in the process of obtaining regulatory approval from the SEC to morph into what later became Risevest, but in the intervening three years, I have grown to understand his viewpoint better.\n\nEveryone is a Libertarian until\u2026\n\nAnyone who regularly reads this column or follows my stream of consciousness on Twitter knows that my economic and political ideologies are very much pro-market, anti-state overreach, and pro-individual freedom. The evidence my eyes have showed me in my 32 years of being a Nigerian, is that markets are much better at delivering prosperity and better living standards to the majority of people than overbearing, incompetent nanny states like Nigeria\u2019s federal and state governments.\n\nIn my lifetime, I have seen ownership of a telephone go from being a status symbol that once marked my family out as part of Nigeria\u2019s 1 percent, to a completely unremarkable fact of literally every Nigerian\u2019s everyday life. Once upon a time in the late 1990s, my dad\u2019s Nokia mobile phone with the exposed antenna and the Multilinks CDMA connection regularly drew gasps from bystanders. Nowadays, a five-year-old child in Orile-Iganmu would wrinkle their nose at such an ancient technological relic before pulling out their Android smartphone to play Cocomelon on YouTube.\n\nOnly the market could have performed such a miracle in 20 years, and I often make reference to the game-changing, economy-redefining impact of market-driven telecoms as an example of how states need to stay out of the market\u2019s way at all cost. I do believe that markets are generally quite efficient at allocating resources and ensuring that effort is rewarded proportionally, but between 2019 and now, I have learnt something else about markets that has changed my position on the importance of regulators and regulations.\n\nTake my recent investigation into Chinese loan sharks in Nigeria, for example. Going by my 2019 position, these loan sharks should simply be left alone. They are after all, creating debt collection and accounting jobs in an area where jobs are in short supply. They are also filling a gap in the market \u2013 easily accessible, unsecured consumer credit. The banks certainly want nothing to do with that market space, and using the efficient market theory, you cannot hold it against them.\n\nThe market for consumer credit in a fundamentally black market-oriented economy like Nigeria, is unattractive from a bank\u2019s point of view. Nobody has ever been able to build a proper credit scoring system that realistically captures the creditworthiness of anyone from a vulcaniser in Owerri to a salaried worker in Abuja. Ethical debt collection may likely not yield much success due to a huge trust/behavioural deficit in our broken society.\n\nFrankly, the effort expended in trying to offer proper consumer finance to 100 million+ Nigerians will likely exceed the reward.\n\nEnter the Chinese loan sharks who mitigate all these risk factors using ingenious but completely unethical and horrifying tactics. The lack of credit history and proof of creditworthiness is mitigated by offering loans to anything with a pulse and using the threat of disgrace before their entire social group as a sort of collateral. Collection rates are inevitably much higher than anything the banks would have achieved using their ethical methods. From a market point of view, this is efficiency \u2013 a more competitive player stepping in to create value that a less competitive player is unwilling or unable to do.\n\nAnd yet it does not take a genius or a Communist to work out that substituting unregulated, unlicensed criminal loan sharking syndicates for actual consumer finance from a country\u2019s official banking system is the furthest thing from a desirable outcome that anyone would wish for. Whenever you receive one of those awful messages informing you that one of your contacts is a child rapist or a dangerous criminal because they did not pay their usurious N30,000 loan on time, the market is working efficiently. Which clearly means then, that the market and its form of efficiency have limits in any kind of livable civil human society.\n\nRead also: NGX Regulation urges public, private sector to implement initiatives against Climate Change\n\nThe rules exist for a reason\n\nIn the aftermath of the Enron collapse in the early naughties, a passing comment from the prosecutor handling the resulting case became something of an iconic quote. It went something along the following lines: \u201cThese individuals were smart enough to break the rules, but not smart enough to understand why the rules exist in the first place.\u201d In the three years since my conversation with Eke that day in Ikoyi, I have started to understand his caution in greater depth.\n\nThe reality is that humans are selfish and greedy. Capitalism and markets are broadly positive and productive ways of channelling human greed and selfishness into outcomes that broadly favour the entire species. The catch is that it is like hitching a ride from Point A to Point B on the back of a hungry tiger chasing an antelope located at Point B. If the process is well managed and regulated, there is a quid pro quo. We get to Point B where we safely dismount the tiger as it tears into its meal. Everyone is happy. If, however, it is not properly regulated, there is always the risk that the tiger will abandon getting to Point B and simply turn us into its meal.\n\nWhether it is the rules guiding issuance of consumer credit and debt collection methods, or the rules guiding who is permitted to solicit and gather investor funds for collective investment schemes, or the rules guiding who is permitted to gather consumer data and how such data is used, these rules came into being for specific purposes. It can definitely be argued that in Nigeria, regulators often come up with regulations for no reason bigger than simply extorting productive areas of the economy and this is certainly true. It does not mean, however, that rules and laws are to be circumvented altogether \u2013 because that would be a much worse state of being.\n\nOver the past two weeks, we have seen breaking stories concerning Chinese criminal loan sharks like Sokoloan, which are linked to Hong Kong\u2019s Triads, and collective investment platforms like GetEquity, which have no regulatory licences whatsoever and operate entirely outside the law selling unrecognised financial instruments that are unenforceable in court. One hopes that both the insiders and the public stakeholders involved in such operations understand the same thing that the Enron prosecutor articulated all those years ago.\n\n\u201cThese individuals (are) smart enough to break the rules, but not smart enough to understand why the rules exist in the first place.\u201d",

Ikomi and others made appearances for the Prosecution.\n\nAt the resumption of proceedings, Ikomi told the court that he had another application to be allowed to take evidence by oath to make for faster proceedings.\n\nThis application was vehemently opposed by the defence counsel, Chief Otomewo arguing that there was no provision for the use of Statement on Oath at the Magistrate\u2019s Court.\n\nCounsel to Prosecution informed court that the provisions of Section 255 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law, Delta State as well as the Evidence Act to which it refers allow it.\n\nAccording to the Prosecution counsel, the prosecution witness was on a security assignment and so could not appear in court and the matter was consequently adjourned for rulings as shown in the records of the court.\n\nFollowing the prosecution\u2019s submission, Otomewo said that, there were some lawyers whose names were not in the Fiat stressing that they always come to court because they had no job to do.\n\nAngered by Otomewo\u2019s comment, Chief Robinson Ariyo who is a Chief at the Palace of the Olu of Warri with traditional title of the \u201cEgogo (Mouthpiece) of Warri Kingdom warned Chief Otomewo never to make such insinuating remarks about him or he would receive an insult.\n\nIn a swift response, the Magistrate asked if Chief Ariyo had any case in the court and if not he should leave insisting that she would not recognize Ariyo as a Chief.\n\nResponding, Chief Ariyo informed the Court that he was one of the nominal complainants in the matter\n\nbeing a Chief in the Palace and the Council of Chiefs being the body that wrote the Petition.\n\nIt will be recall that ever since the matter commenced, the Magistrate had continued to target Chief Ariyo refusing to either call him a Chief or record him with the suffix Chief.\n\nIt is also on record that the Magistrate had never recorded Chief Ariyo as a Chief even though Chief Ariyo announces himself as such.\n\nAccording to the prosecution counsel, the refusal of Magistrate Diejomaoh to recognise Ariyo as a Chief while according Otomewo as a Chief was an indication that she was playing ethnic politics having served as a Lawyer under Chief Otomewo.\n\nThe Prosecution counsels, however, said that they had tried to distinguish between an objection arising from the lack of neutrality of a court and other forms of objection.\n\nAccording to them, this goes to the root of lack of fair haring arising from the developments and decisions in the case.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "2022: Why PDP candidate, Ademola Adeleke may not govern Osun, By Elugbaju David",
          "text": "\u2018Dancing\u2019 Senator Ademola Adeleke of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has once again picked up his ambition of governing Osun State after his initial attempt failed in 2018.\n\nHe contested against incumbent Governor Adegboyega Oyetola in a tight and tension soaked race in 2018. Being in an off-season electoral circle, the state is once again preparing for another governorship election and interestingly, Adeleke and Oyetola are major contenders under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC) respectively.\n\nUndoubtedly, Ademola Adeleke who only became a politician by accident some five years ago after his brother and political patriarch of the Adeleke Family in Osun State, Senator Isiaka Adeleke died, put up a good show that unsettled the then outgoing administration of Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola who had to invite political heavyweights to help solve the riddle of not losing the state he meticulously laboured on for eight years to a \u2018jester\u2019. That explains why the APC courted the man who now holds sway as the party\u2019s General Secretary, Iyiola Omisore whose bloc votes in Ile Ife as the Social Democratic Party (SDP) governorship candidate helped broke Adeleke\u2019s weighty back.\n\nHowever, four years has passed and the electoral atmosphere in Osun has changed. Oyetola is now a force in the state. His performance has endeared him into the hearts of many and that explains why he survived the tsunami that nearly upturned the state during the buildup to the APC governorship primary in the state. He not only won, but won overwhelmingly despite the force put up by the immediate past governor and now Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Aregbesola to install another aspirant on account that Oyetola did not carry him along with governance in the state. Therefore the PDP will be shooting itself in the leg if it hopes that it can \u2018cash out\u2019 on the political uncertainty that obtained pre-2018 within the ruling party in the state that allowed Ademola Adeleke easy access to almost becoming a governor.\n\n*Petitions to disqualify Ademola Adeleke*\n\nAside the initial \u2018spoiler game\u2019 played by another of the Adeleke sons, Bamidele to contest the PDP governorship ticket which almost torn the family apart with super star David \u2018Davido\u2019 Adeleke taking sides with his uncle, Ademola, there has been intense calls for the party (PDP) not to field Ademola.\n\nIn a letter dated January 27, 2022, those against the flag bearer forwarded a petition to the national chairman, Dr. Iyorcha Ayu, alerting him to certain dangers ahead. They anticipated litigation, unless certain issues about eligibility of the flagbearer are resolved.\n\nA group, \u2018Concerned Members of PDP in Osun State,\u2019 had appealed against the decision of the National Working Committee (NWC), which gave Adeleke the nod to stand as candidate, following the reports of the screening and appeal committees.\n\nOther aspirants were Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi, Alhaji Fatai Akinbade, Prince Dotun Babayemi, Mr. Dele Adeleke and Sanya Omirin. Two of them have defected and emerged as governorship candidates of smaller parties.\n\nEarlier on January 10, 2022, the group, led by Akinloye Adeyi, had written a petition to the Osun State Gubernatorial Screening Committee.\n\nCopies of the petition were sent to the chairman and members of PDP Board of Trustees (BoT), chairman of PDP Governors\u2019 Forum, Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde and other PDP governors, Deputy National Chairman (South) and Vice Chairman (Southwest).\n\nBut, the group lamented that the petitioners were not invited by the Screening Committee to substantiate and prove their allegations against Adeleke. Thus, the flag bearer was not confronted with the allegations.\n\nAccording to the group, the allegations were not properly scrutinised and evaluated by the Screening Committee, adding that the committee came to the wrong conclusion that when the petition was reviewed, it was found to be speculative.\n\nHowever, the committee in a response said the allegations had been determined by the court, which discharged and acquitted the aspirant.\n\nThey (Appeal Panel) unanimously agreed that the petition had failed to address substantial issues to warrant the disqualification of the senator. It also stated that Adeleke has the constitutionally required educational qualification to contest the election.\n\nAdeleke\u2019s Baggage\n\nIt is not on record if Adeleke has any basic skill needed to manage the diversities of the over 4.7 million (as of 2016) population of the state. His only selling point might be his dancing skills, relationship with one of the biggest music artiste out of Africa David \u2018Davido\u2019 Adeleke and his Adeleke lineage. His stay in the ninth Senate (to complete his late brother\u2019s term) which would have broadened his grip and understanding of governance was short-lived by his desire to govern Osun.\n\nA close scrutiny of Ademola Adeleke\u2019s updated credentials submitted to INEC showed several discrepancies on the information supplied. This includes name, date of birth, admission number, number of O\u2019Level subject sat for and his PDP membership card number.\n\nThe senator who relocated to the United States almost immediately after losing his first attempt at the governorship election in 2018 did not include any certificate apart from the O\u2019Level certificate of May/June 1981 from Ede Muslim High School, Ede, Osun State.\n\nHowever, in what appears like a premeditated reinforcement in 2022, the former senator added a \u2018High School Diploma\u2019 from Penn Fooster High School and Bachelor of Science degree in \u2018Criminal Justice\u2019 from the Atlanta Metropolitan State College without a stipulated time of commencement and completion. Interestingly, both schools are United States based and the programmes were started and completed in 2021 according to the information he provided. How that is possible is still a mirage until appropriate agencies of government launch investigations.\n\nWhile the PDP maybe highly desirous of winning the state, however, fielding questionable candidates is not the way to go. Even if the APC loses the state to the PDP in July, the party (APC) will explore all the legal loopholes in Ademola Adeleke\u2019s candidacy and the court might surprisingly favour the party. It has happened before in Nigeria and elsewhere. It might happen again in Osun.\n\nElugbaju David wrote from Osun",

          "title": "3 DAYS TO APC PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY: Screening Panel Recomends \u2018Safe List\u2019 Of 13 Aspirants",
          "text": "The seven-member presidential screening committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has shortlisted 13 aspirants to participate in the presidential primary election billed to hold on Monday.\n\nLEADERSHIP had reported exclusively on Thursday that the committee was preparing a shortlist of nine for the consideration of the party APC leadership.\n\nThe committee chaired by former national chairman of the party, John Odigie-Oyegun, confirmed the story while submitting its report yesterday to the party\u2019s national chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, at the party\u2019s national secretariat in Abuja.\n\nEarlier Friday, speculations about \u201cdisqualification\u201d of some of the presidential aspirants were rife following the failure of Oyegun, who briefed journalists after submitting the report, to name the 13 aspirants on his committee\u2019s shortlist.\n\nBut dependable sources in the presidency who have seen the full report however told our correspondent last night that the said media reports suggesting that ten candidates had been disqualified were not true.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to one of the sources, all 23 aspirants screened were cleared and qualified, but the committee recommended a \u201csafe list\u201d of 13 names.\n\nThose recommended in the list are APC national leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; former minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi; Senate President Ahmad Lawan; Kogi State governor, Yahaya Bello, and Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi.\n\nOthers include former minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba; former minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu; former Ogun State governor, Ibikunle Amosun; Ebonyi State governor David Umahi, and his Jigawa State counterpart, Abubakar Badaru.\n\nTwo other aspirants, former minister of the Niger Delta, Godswill Akpabio and Mr Tein Jack-Rich, were also believed to have made the list after the committee submitted its report yesterday afternoon.\n\nThe ten aspirants excluded from the shortlist are Pastor Tunde Bakare; former Imo State governor Rochas Okorocha; Cross Rivers State governor, Ben Ayade; former Zamfara State governor, Sani Yerima, and former Senate president, Ken Nnamani.\n\nOthers are former Minister of Information and Culture, Ikeobasi Mokelu; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Demeji Bankole; US-based Pastor, Felix Nicholas, and the only APC female aspirant, Uju Ken-Ohanenye.\n\nOur source who did not want his name in print because he is not authorised to speak on the matter said, \u201cThe committee did not disqualify anyone. I don\u2019t know where the news about disqualification came from. The report made it clear that all the aspirants had been cleared and were qualified to contest in their own right.\u201d\n\nAnother source close to the committee said the decision of the committee to recommend a \u201csafe list\u201d was based on the large number of aspirants who appeared for screening.\n\nThe source said, \u201cDuring the screening, the aspirants told the committee that they were ready to accept a consensus candidate in the interest of the party. The only exception out of the 23 was Tinubu, who said he would only accept consensus if he was the beneficiary. That being the case, what is the point of going into the primary, which is only a few days away, with a horde of aspirants?\u201d\n\nOn the basis for making the \u201csafe list,\u201d the source said electability and the complexity of the country\u2019s makeup were considered, among other things.\n\n\u201cApart from these two criteria, the committee also tried to avoid the potential of litigation and also the extent and degree of field work that the aspirants undertook,\u201d the source noted, adding that \u201cthis last point weighed heavily on the committee\u2019s mind because the committee wanted to recommend people who had actually gone out there to work.\u201d\n\nThe source added that the party or President Muhammadu Buhari, who is its leader, was free to go outside the committee\u2019s list to add or remove aspirants.\n\nMeanwhile, chairman of the screening committee, Odigie-Oyegun yesterday the reasons why his committee pruned the number of presidential aspirants from 23 to 13.\n\nWhile submitting the report to the party leadership at the national secretariat, Oyegun said the committee would have gone a little shorter than 13 but chose to allow the party to decide who their preferred candidate will be.\n\nHe said: \u201cFirst, we had 23 member aspirants that we interacted with. And my first comment is that we were very occupant. Those were 23 that presented themselves. We had a lot of others, prominent Nigerians both within and outside the country that had applied but for whatever reason, could not proceed with their applications.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second point I want to make is that we were surprised at the active participation of the youthful members of the party. Some of them surprised us with what they have accomplished in life, their understanding of the situation in this country and why they want to have the privilege of governing this country.\n\n\u201cWhat was important was that they so believed in the country and the party that they were able to pay the sum that some of us considered princely handsome to participate in the process. And I think the party ought to pat itself on the back for them.\u201d\n\nOn the criteria relied on to screen the aspirants, Oyegun said. \u201cAside from the basic background, experience and understanding of the Nigerian situation, the ideas as to how issues, difficulties and problems can be addressed were key factors that were considered.\n\n\u201cOur report is simple and short. I don\u2019t want to beat the bush. There were two aspects to it: The basic constitutional qualifications for you to aspire to be a president of the Federal Republic to of Nigeria. That was simple.\u201d",

          "title": "Tinubu Expresses Respect For President Buhari",
          "text": "National leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu has expressed high respect for President Muhammadu Buhari, coming after comments he insists were misinterpreted.\n\nTinubu in a statement her personally signed said blamed the backlash for his comments on entering the peak period of the primary season.\n\nHis campaign team, led by former Borno governor, Kashim Shettima have also come in his defence.\n\nThe Lagos governor in the statement released on Friday said, \u201cSensationalism and wilful inaccuracy tend to push aside truth during such moments. I make this statement so that truth and accuracy may have a chance.\n\n\u201cIt is important that people truly know what I said and where I stand. Whatever view you have of me is within your right to make. But let it be based on truth and not on falsehood or reckless exaggeration.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said, \u201cThere have been gross misinterpretations in some sectors of the media regarding comments I made on Thursday in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. To a degree, the erroneous interpretations may be somewhat innocent given that I spoke in Yoruba.\n\n\u201cThose who do not understand the nuances of this richly layered and subtly language may have inadvertently yet erroneously missed the true meaning of what I said while attempting to translate my statement.\u201d\n\nTinubu said instead of weighing what he said carefully, the media translated so quickly and thus inaccurately in an attempt to meet deadlines. He said there are also those who knew better but they conveyed these inaccuracies because the sensationalism suits their political purposes.\n\nHe said, \u201cAgain, such propaganda and misinformation becomes daily fare in the heat of the political season. Let\u2019s just state what needs to be stated. My opponents want to present a narrative that I made comments disrespectful of President Muhammadu Buhari in hopes that such a narrative would convince President Buhari to oppose my aspirations regarding the approaching primary.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari is an experienced and accomplished leader. I do not believe he will be taken by the tricks of such people. Let me also erase any doubt. My respect and regard for President Buhari as Commander-in- chief of this nation and as a person are high and unfailing.\u201d\n\nTinubu said, \u201cI shall never denigrate him. I certainly did not do so in Abeokuta. We have been political partners for a long time and I hope that partnership continues well into the future.\n\n\u201cI would do nothing to jeopardize it. I believe our party is the best hope for the nation to right itself. I believe I have a future role larger than the one I now have. I also believe President Buhari has a continuing and important role to play even after his tenure as president is over. \u201c\n\nIn Abeokuta, he said, \u201cI spoke to the unwarranted attacks against my person that have been part of the campaign of others. I also recounted the history of the party for those whose memories need repair.\n\nThere are many who had no role in the birth of the APC and in its many victories. Now that the party has climbed the political summit, they want to claim credit for something they had no part in.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, this cannot be said of President Buhari. I am proud of my role in the advent of the APC and its electoral successes. But President Buhari, of course, stands as the main driver of this success. He was elected president twice. He has borne the weight of national governance for seven years. Nothing can rival that.\u201d\n\nAlso the Tinubu presidential campaign team yesterday moved in defence of the presidential aspirant, saying his remarks were misinterpreted by the media and were not meant to ridicule President Buhari.\n\nA statement issued by director, Media and Communications, of the Bayo Onanuga, noted that media reports on Tinubu\u2019s remarks were \u201cerroneous, misleading and mischievous\u201d, adding that what the former Lagos State governor said, which are already in the public domain, are facts which had been analysed for years.\n\nHe said Tinubu\u2019s remarks were twisted by the opposition in the APC to discredit him.\n\nOnanuga stated: \u201cThe attention of the Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu Presidential Campaign Organisation has been drawn to the erroneous, misleading and mischievous interpretation of his address in Abeokuta, capital of Ogun State on Thursday. It is on record that the leading presidential aspirant in the forthcoming primary of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, addressed the national delegates of the party in Ogun State, with Governor Dapo Abiodun in attendance.\n\nOn the WhatsApp message posted by former secretary to government of the federation, Babachir Lawal, the Tinubu campaign team further said the presidential aspirant did not speak on tribal lines in Abeokuta.\n\nOnanuga continued: \u201cWhile we recognise that recent unexpected interventions in the timetable and the heat generated by the proximity of the event might have led to some anxiety, this campaign organisation believes that the main thrust of Asiwaju\u2019s presentation was that, his huge contributions to the formation and electoral success of the All Progressives Congress should count in his favour as a true party man who desires to be the flag bearer.\n\nOn his part, former governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima, and top campaigner for Tinubu\u2019s presidential ambition yesterday declared that the former Lagos State governor will not step down from the race.\n\nHe expressed confidence that Tinubu will win the presidential primaries on Monday, noting that he has contested elections in the past in difficult circumstances.\n\nHe said Nigeria needs an experienced leader, who understands the dynamics of the country at this time.\n\nShettima maintained that the issue of stepping down does not arise, saying \u201che (Tinubu) is the elephant in the room,\n\n\u201cAn elephant won\u2019t step down for Lilliputians,\u201d he stated, adding that Tinubu has paid the price to demand to succeed Buhari.\n\n\u201cHe should be given the right of first refusal. He should not be excluded from expressing his fundamental human rights by contesting the primaries,\u201d the former governor noted.\n\nHe said as much as nobody has doubted the competence of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as a cerebral person, as far as intellect, capacity and reach to win the 2023 presidential election for APC is concerned, the best candidate is Tinubu.\n\n\u201cThe dynamics have changed with Atiku\u2019s emergence. We need someone who can match and overshadow him. That is why we are pushing Tinubu,\u201d Shettima said, adding that the party has to be sensitive to the diversity of the nation with regards to making Senate President Ahmed Lawan to emerge the party candidate.\n\nHe said Lawan does not have the political capacity to beat Atiku in a presidential contest.\n\nReacting to Tinubu\u2019s declaration that his support for Buhari made him president in 2015, the former Borno governor said, \u201cCan anyone dispel what he has said?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal has expressed disappointment in Tinubu over the comments he made about President Muhammadu Buhari and the north.\n\nLawal, in response to the comments by Tinubu made in Abeokuta, expressed shock and said the north may have to rethink support for a Tinubu and Yoruba presidency.\n\nWhen Yorubas vilify the North like this, the former SGF said, \u201cour sense of fear and insecurity under a Yoruba presidency gets heightened and in the end, pushes us to rethink our support for not only Bola but any Yoruba as president for that matter.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cSometimes it is very difficult to support a Yoruba person in national politics if you are not one.\n\n\u201cThey have a way of making you regret your support because they eventually make you seem like a traitor to your own people.\n\n\u201cNow all these comments about Bola\u2019s Yoruba presidency and his support of Buhari without which Buhari would not have been president is bullshit.\u201d\n\nLawal said Tinubu wasn\u2019t the only one whose support made a difference and many others from all around the country and they are not bragging about it.\n\nHe said, \u201cYou may wish to know that all of us Buhari supporters are shocked and pissed off by Bola\u2019s speech on this occasion. It is unlike him.\n\n\u201cAnd this speech is massively trending in the North and being given a negative connotation as you can well imagine.\n\nWill Tinubu win Monday\u2019s APC primaries without Northern support?\n\nHe said you would think Yorubas will resist the temptation of joining in the northerners-bashing game at this very critical time \u2013 the primary election is only three days away.\n\nLawal added, \u201cIt is unfortunate that Bola himself chose to join in this bashing game \u2013 choosing to speak in the Yoruba language and in Yoruba land in a manner that seems to denigrate Buhari.\n\n\u201cI could vividly imagine the discomfort of all the northerners sitting beside him on that podium.\u201d",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has released the legal framework that will guide the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe guidelines stipulated that only ballot papers with the official watermark and stamp prescribed by the Commission shall be counted by the presiding officer.\n\nOn the use of phones during voting, the guidelines said telephones and other electronic devices capable of taking pictures are not allowed in voting cubicles.\n\nOn overvoting, the guidelines stated that if the total number of votes cast at a Polling Unit exceeds the number of accredited voters at the Polling Unit, the result of the election for that Polling Unit shall be declared null and void, and a report in that regard shall be made to the Collation Officer.\n\nAlso, on the margin of lead principles, the guidelines stated that \u201cwhere the margin of lead between the two leading candidates in an election is not in excess of the total number of voters who collected their Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs) in Polling Units where elections are postponed, voided or not held in line with Sections 24(2 & 3), 47(3) and 51(2) of the Electoral Act 2022, the returning officer shall decline to make a return for the constituency until polls have been conducted in the affected Polling Units and the results collated into the relevant forms for Declaration and Return.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis is the Margin of Lead Principle and shall apply wherever necessary in making returns for all elections in accordance with these Regulations and Guidelines.\u201d\n\nINEC chairman Prof Mahmood Yakubu presented the guidelines yesterday in Abuja at a special meeting of the Inter-agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES) to Review Security arrangements for the Ekiti Governorship election.\n\nYakubu said with the presentation of the Regulations and Guidelines, the Commission has concluded formal preparations for the polls.\n\nWith the coming into force of the Electoral Act 2022, he said it has become necessary to review the Commission\u2019s Regulations and Guidelines to govern the conduct of elections.\n\nHe said the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), the Electoral Act 2022 and the Regulations and Guidelines constitute the electoral legal framework.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOn several occasions, the Commission has assured Nigerians that we are finalizing the Regulations and Guidelines for the elections. I am glad to announce that the document is ready and will be presented to Nigerians shortly. The soft copy will be uploaded to our website with the link shared on our social media platforms.\n\n\u201cWith the release of the Regulations and Guidelines today, and the publication of the Strategic Plan (SP) 2022-2026 and Election Project Plan 2023 earlier, the Commission has virtually concluded the planning processes for the 2023 General Election nine months ahead of the election.\u201d\n\nIn the next couple of weeks, he said the training manual will also be presented to Nigerians.\n\nGoing forward, he said the Commission will focus on election administration which includes logistics, training, voter education, technology, sensitization against vote-buying, inclusivity measures, and, above all, security.\n\nHe stressed that ICCES will continue to play a critical role and the Commission appreciates the support of all security agencies.\n\nWith only 15 days to the Ekiti Governorship election, he said all the major activities that are supposed to be carried out at this stage have been successfully undertaken.\n\nHe said, \u201cI led a team of INEC National Commissioners to Ekiti State early this week to assess the Commission\u2019s preparations for the elections. We visited our offices in several Local Government Areas, held meetings with our staff, had audience with the Council of Obas to solicit the support of their Royal Majesties for peaceful elections and met with the security agencies.\n\n\u201cWe also observed the ongoing training of ad hoc staff and the deployment of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) for mock accreditation of voters in some Polling Units across the three Senatorial Districts of the State.\n\n\u201cWe will again return to Ekiti State shortly to meet with the stakeholders and for the signing of the Peace Accord by political parties and candidates under the auspices of the National Peace Committee.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said as the Commission is getting ready for the Ekiti State Governorship election, the Commission has also gone far with similar preparations for the Osun State Governorship election holding next month i.e. Saturday 16th July 2022.\n\nAt the same time, he said the Commission continues with preparations for the 2023 General Election.\n\n\u201cOn this note, let me seize this opportunity to address two critical aspects of our preparations for the forthcoming General Election.\n\n\u201cNigerians may recall that the ongoing CVR started a year ago. For the first time, the Commission introduced online pre-registration as well as physical registration at designated centres.\n\n\u201cAs the deadline for the suspension of the CVR i.e. 30th June 2022 approaches, long queues are building up, especially in some states in the South East, Lagos, Kano and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\n\u201cThe Commission had anticipated the last-minute surge and therefore established additional centres and deployed more machines to register citizens,\u201d he said.\n\nUnfortunately, he said the security situation in many parts of the country has not allowed full deployment as planned. In some states of the Federation, INEC registration officers were attacked resulting not only in the unfortunate destruction of buildings and loss of equipment but even worse, the death of a staff.\n\n\u201cThis has forced the closure of some of the registration centres.\n\n\u201cHowever, in view of the surge, additional machines will be deployed to some of the most congested areas to ease the surge. Similarly, the Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) have been directed to liaise with the security agencies and stakeholders on the possibility of reopening some of the centres earlier closed because of insecurity, but in doing so, they must always bear in mind the safety of registrants and registration officials,\u201d he said.\n\nFurthermore, he said the RECs are directed to do more to provide information, increase awareness of the processes, and more promptly respond to genuine complaints by citizens.\n\n\u201cThe Commission appreciates the support of partners and critical stakeholders in mobilising citizens to register. We look forward to such partnership to encourage registered voters to collect their PVCs and for increased voter turnout on Election Day,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) standard-bearer in the forthcoming 2023 governorship election in Enugu State, Barrister Peter Mbah, has promised to uplift the living standard of the citizens of the State through the implementation of socio-economic programmes if voted as the next governor of the state by the electorate.\n\nThe former Chief of Staff to former Enugu governor, Chimaraoke Nnamani, who disclosed this in an interactive session with journalists in Lagos, said he left his comfort zone in the oil and gas sector to politics to be able to bring the greatest good to the greatest number of people still living in or at the edge of poverty in the state.\n\nMbah, who also served as commissioner for Finance during the administration of Nnamani, said he will be unveiling his manifestoes and development blueprint that would make the state one of the most economically viable states in the country, to the electorate in the state very soon.\n\nAware of the importance of finance in the implementation of government policies and programmes, the outgoing founder and chief executive officer of Pinnacle Oil and Gas Limited, an indigenous oil and gas company, said his administration, when voted to govern the state, would give priority attention to growing the economy of the state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said, \u201cWe hope to move the economy of the state from N4.4 billion that we are today to N30 billion. That seems impossible, that is why I said it is disruptive because we are going to interrogate the status quo. We are going to disrupt the status quo, the sort of growth strategies we had in the past. We are going to interrupt that and we are going to do something different and grow the economy but this time around our strategy will be different , we are going to build on what has been achieved.\u201d\n\nHinting on his development programme for the state, Mbah said the urgent need for development of infrastructure in the state cannot be over emphasised.\n\nHe said, \u2018\u2019Becoming just an oasis of peace in the eastern region of the country is not enough because you cannot be an island. It is my hope that we are going to be able to work together with other chief executives in the region to ensure that the bordering states whether it is Anambra, Ebonyi, Abia and Imo states are well connected and in peace, we are going to ensure that there is regional integration in the region.\n\n\u2018\u2019I hope that in a few weeks\u2019 time when we unveil our manifestoes and development blueprints, you will be led into what we want to do. Actually there are two documents that we have. One is the manifestoes which speaks to our short to medium term plans, we also have the development blueprint that speaks to a 24 -year development programmes that we have designed for the state and that includes others states in the South East, so a whole lot of work has gone into that, we actually went granular to touch everyone, you will appreciate the granularity and we are clear about the execution, we have strong plans for regional development and we are going to be unveiling it soon.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe added that he has been in the forefront in the development of the state saying, \u2018\u2019Before now I also ran a foundation, the Peter Mbah Foundation, the foundation has intervened in a lot of communities in Enugu State. We have done a whole lot, we have built hospitals, we built a 40 bed hospital , these hospitals are functional and we continue to make sure that anyone that is sick is treated whether they have money or not and we are servicing a whole lot of communities. We have created access to quality healthcare.\n\n\u2018\u2019Through the foundation, we have built roads, engaged in education where we ensure that indigent students are able to pay for the West Africa Examination Council (WAEC) examination fees. Those who could not go to school , we provided them funds for them to continue their education. In all of these adopted community based strategy, we go to those communities we asked them what they need and we intervene in those their priority areas.\u2019\u2019",
          "summary": "ADVERTISEMENTHe said, \u201cWe hope to move the economy of the state from N4.4 billion that we are today to N30 billion.\nThat seems impossible, that is why I said it is disruptive because we are going to interrogate the status quo.\nWe are going to disrupt the status quo, the sort of growth strategies we had in the past.\n\u2018\u2019I hope that in a few weeks\u2019 time when we unveil our manifestoes and development blueprints, you will be led into what we want to do.\nThose who could not go to school , we provided them funds for them to continue their education.",

We need to start investing in gas which is more sustainable and greener. We need to take actions on sustainable goals as this helps the environment to be save. I urge everyone here to start and lead the sustainable goals conversations in their various companies because sustainability is key\u201d, she expressed.\n\nSpeaking on the broker\u2019s perspective, AlhajiSaheedEgbeyemi of Hogg Robinson Nigeria Limited, noted that, opportunities abound for the sector to tap into and flourish but the issues of rate cutting and unhealthy competition have to be addressed.\n\nHe added that underwriters and brokers need to collaborate more to push the tenets of sustainable insurance.\n\nOn his part, the former president of the Institute of Loss Adjusters of Nigeria (ILAN), Mr. Ralph Opara, representing the loss adjusters, said, ILAN is doing a lot to ensure sustainability because the arm remains the life wire of the insurance value chain.\n\nSpeaking on the academic community perspective, the rector, College of Insurance and Financial Management (CIFM), Dr.YesideOyetayo, said ESG risks are now a criteria to determining a company that is sustainable, hence, trainings and programmes on sustainable risks need to be factored into the insurance industry academic curriculum and the industry needs to collaborate with other sectors.\n\nConcluding the panel session, the managing director and the chairman of the occasion, Mr. Olusegun Omosehin, emphasised that, collaborations and innovation are the way to go for the industry as regards sustainability.\n\n\u201cOpportunities are before us as underwriters so we need to transition into green insurance so we can sustain the businesses and future of insurance in Nigeria\u201d, he said.\n\nDelivering his speech earlier, the president of CIIN, Sir MuftauOyegunle, said the event was a new and free programme of the CIIN focused on giving back to its members and the insurance community in general.\n\n\u201cThe objective of this programme among other things is to bring all stakeholders from the different arms of the insurance industry together, to discuss the business environment and how it affects the operations of the sector as well as charting the way forward for insurance to thrive in the country,\u201d he pointed out.",

          "text": "Nigeria is hosting the maiden edition of the \u2018Nigeria-Africa Natural Resources and Energy Investment Summit\u2019, a three-day Summit with the theme \u2018Towards a Greener Africa\u2019, in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nSpeaking in his keynote address at the event, President Muhammadu Buhari represented by the Hon. Minister of mine and steel Arc Olamilekan Adegbite on Wednesday said Africa needs to join the rest of the world\u2019s shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources.\n\nArc Olamilekan Adegbite, pointed that Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s convention is indeed important. Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development, even as the world shifts away from fossil fuel to clean and renewable energy sources, in the fight against climate change. In the midst of this energy transition lies many challenges and opportunities for a continent yearning for development.\n\n\u201cI believe this should spur us as a continent of diverse people to co-operate and collaborate more, initiate innovative solutions to the challenges that are peculiar to us, come up with technologies and products that will lead to the growth and industrialization of Africa in a more environment friendly manner while encouraging the development and financing of green energy projects.\n\n\u201cOur meeting today provides the opportunity to share views on natural resources and energy market developments. Additionally, the morning session will focus on Maximizing Mineral Potentials and Attracting Private Investments. Our esteemed speakers will discuss the opportunities within the Nigerian Mining Sector, the underexplored minerals which are key to clean renewable energy, the success stories and the strides towards driving Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the Sector.\n\n\u201cParticipating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation would strengthen their cooperation, through joint assessment and viewpoints, with the aim to financing sustainable African Natural Resources and Energy Projects that are key to the transition, for the benefit of producers and consumers and to regularly review at technical and ministerial levels the status of our cooperation,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn policies and framework, Buhari stated that, \u201cOur joint meetings and activities will support us in formulating favorable policy and strategy development for the natural resource sector as the world looks towards a greener future. A policy that is less subject to extremes, both today and in the future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Group Managing Director, African Industries Group, Alok Gupta, who was represented by Partha Ghosh spoke on opportunities on Nigeria\u2019s mining sector. African Natural Resources and Mines Limited, ANRML, is a group company of the African Industries Group.\n\n\u201cNigeria is heavily endowed with solid minerals with 44 minerals found in over 500 locations including all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, have more than one mineral type which indeed is a rare occurrence.\n\n\u201cWith the view of maximizing these opportunities, to create wealth, grow the GDP and expand opportunities available to Nigerians. The mining sector is the backbone of industrialization of the economy.\n\n\u201cHe also pointed various incentives rolled out n the Buhari-led administration to promote ease of doing business in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe mining implementation and stability is strategically focusing on steel. Nigeria has the 12th largest steel deposits in the world with more than 3 billion tonnes resources in Kogi, Enugu, Zamfara and Kaduna States.\n\n\u201cAnnually $3.3 billion is still spent on steel imports which impact the economy. With focusing on steel Nigeria can reduce dependency on imports and the economy would become a major player in global markets.\n\nHowever, he disclosed that his company has established a fully integrated mining and steel processing plant in Gujeni Village in Kagarko Local Government Area of Kaduna State, with 5 million tonnes per annum, which is Nigeria\u2019s largest foreign direct investment of $600 million, and will be employing over 4000 Nigerians, including good community development projects and schemes ongoing.",

Based on our yield measurement of 66 m2 for each variety in Abuja, the calculated yields per hectare of Faro 44, GAWAL R1 and Mayun 1 are 5.6 mt, 7.0 mt and 8.7 mt respectively with the transplanting method. GAWAL R1\u2019s yield is 25% higher than that of Faro 44 and Mayun 1 is 55% higher than Faro 44\u201d.\n\nHe said the company was also looking at the establishment of rice extension system and improvement of rice research system in collaboration with the agriculture research institutes such as National Cereal Research Institute (NCRI), National Agricultural Seeds Council(NASC), IITA, Bwari Area Council and agricultural research and extension services in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are aiming to introduce and register many more good quality and high-yield new rice varieties to Nigerian rice farmers\u201d, he said.\n\nHe said that apart from the traditional rice transplanting technique, the company has also been promoting the new technique of broadcasting rice production for large and small-scale farming and the result shows that the rice yield is relatively high as well.\n\nHe said the company was a professional seed company, that not only sell seed but teach farmers advance planting technique for optimum yield.\n\nGAWAL was established in Nigeria in 2006 and has\n\nbeen committed to the agricultural development of Nigeria through the production and supply of quality crop seeds.\n\nAs one of the large-scale seed companies in Nigeria, it has supplied over 20,000 mt rice and maize seeds to Nigeria farmers in over 30 states.",

          "title": "Nigeria Committed to Energy Transition, Reducing Gas Emission \u2013 Silva",
          "text": "Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, HE Chief Timipre Sylva has disclosed that Nigeria made a strong commitment to embracing energy transition while pledging to significantly reduce its greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\n\nThe Minister stated this yesterday at the Nigeria-Africa natural resource and energy summit in Abuja\n\nHe said that that was in addition to the commitment Nigeria made through President Muhammadu Buhari, at COP 26 in 2021 to attain carbon net-zero by 2060.\n\nSylva who explained that Nigeria is following a transition pathway that combines technology, investment, business strategies, and government policy that will enable Nigeria to transit from its current energy system to a low-carbon energy system with natural gas playing a pivotal role, added that the country needs affordable, reliable and sustainable energy resources to eradicate the prevalent energy poverty in the shortest time possible, and propel economic growth.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe only viable option currently on the table is natural gas, considering vast proven gas endowments, put at 209 TCF, with 600 TCF potential reserves. We cannot ignore this resource, especially when energy poverty is viciously starring at us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal of Nigeria\u2019s gas policy is to ensure that gas development is undertaken in accordance with our socio-economic development priorities. The aim is to guarantee long-term energy security in the country, and boost the domestic gas market, hence the declaration of 2021-to-2030 as the \u2018Decade of Gas\u2019 by Mr. President. We have embarked on a critical pathway to ensuring that our abundant Natural gas resources are marshalled to engender domestic economic growth and development.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the Ministry of Petroleum Resources has launched the National Gas Expansion Programme NGEP as part of the National Gas Policy to expand Nigeria\u2019s Domestic gas utilization; the National Gas Flare Commercialization Programme; as well as specific provisions in the new Petroleum Industry Act PIA that elevates LPG as the fuel of choice compared to other competing fuels and the usage of solar energy is already being vigorously promoted across the country, while the use of hydro, wind and other natural resources are also being expanded.\n\nThe Minister who lauded the theme of the Summit \u2018Towards a Greener Africa\u2019 observed that it is very apt and timely at this challenging time in the energy industry globally. However, he explained that at the core of this challenge is the issue of climate change that is eliciting clamour for transition to greener energy sources to reduce carbon emission.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that every nation and region comes up with a green initiative to foster a collective combat against the incessant threat to the planet caused by CO2 emission. Such initiatives must be bold, decisive and on target.\n\n\u201cIt should however be borne in mind that such initiatives should reflect the realities and conditions prevailing in these places, particularly the socio-economic development and energy needs.\n\n\u201cThe key consideration in every country\u2019s energy policy should be pivoted on energy security. This constitutes a very high priority goal for nations all over the globe. The reason is not far-fetched: Energy propels economic growth.\n\n\u201cThat makes energy security synonymous with optimum and sustainable economic growth. Energy is an indispensable ingredient for human development and socio-economic prosperity. It is central to jobs creation, security, health, and other challenges facing humans.\n\n\u201cThis is why access to energy is prominently addressed in the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals. In particular, SDG 7 focuses on access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, as a fundamental right.\n\nHe said that as at today, energy poverty is still much prevalent in the world, especially in Africa where millions of people still do not have access to electricity or clean cooking fuels.\n\nBased on the UN data, about 760 million people lack access to electricity worldwide, with three out of four of them living in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFurthermore, one-third of the world\u2019s population \u2013 about 2.6 billion people \u2013 have no access to clean cooking fuels, with over 900 million of these in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nOn the average, only 48% of sub-Saharan Africa population have access to electricity, while only 18% have access to clean cooking fuels, compared with a global average of 90% and 70%, respectively.\n\nIn relation to CO2 emission, World Bank statistics shows that the world average of CO2 emissions was 4.48 metric tons per capita in 2018, with some regions and individual countries recording five to seven times this value. Emission by sub-Saharan Africa in total was only 0.76 metric tons per capita.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe implication of the above is that the issues surrounding energy poverty, climate and sustainable development are not mutually exclusive.

          "text": "A presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has said he holds President Muhammadu Buhari in high regard.\n\nReactions had trailed Mr Tinubu\u2019s comments in Abeokuta on Thursday where he said he deserves to lead the nation after helping President Buhari win the 2015 election.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Tinubu said his comments were not meant to disrespect the President and had been taken out of context.\n\nHe said reactions suggesting he had been disrespectful were sensational and incorrect.\n\nSee Mr Tinubu\u2019s full statement below:\n\nI HAVE HIGH REGARD AND RESPECT FOR PRESIDENT BUHARI\n\nWe have entered the meat of primary season. Sensationalism and wilful inaccuracy tend to push aside truth during such moments. I make this statement so that truth and accuracy may have a chance. It is important that people truly know what I said and where I stand. Whatever view you have of me is within your right to make. But let it be based on truth and not on falsehood or reckless exaggeration.\n\nThere have been gross misinterpretations in some sections of the media regarding comments I made on Thursday in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. To a degree, the erroneous interpretations may be somewhat innocent given that I spoke in Yoruba. Those who do not understand the nuances of this richly layered and subtly language may have inadvertently yet erroneously missed the true meaning of what I said while attempting to translate my statement. Instead of weighing what I said carefully, they translated so quickly and thus inaccurately in an attempt to meet media deadlines. Of course, there are also those who knew better but they conveyed these inaccuracies because the sensationalism suits their political purposes.\n\nAgain, such propaganda and misinformation becomes daily fare in the heat of the political season. Let\u2019s just state what needs to be stated. My opponents want to present a narrative that I made comments disrespectful of President Muhammadu Buhari in hopes that such a narrative would convince President Buhari to oppose my aspirations regarding the approaching primary. President Buhari is an experienced and accomplished leader. I do not believe he will be taken by the tricks of such people.\n\nLet me also erase any doubt. My respect and regard for President Buhari as Commander-in-Chief of this nation and as a person are high and unfailing. I shall never denigrate him. I certainly did not do so in Abeokuta. We have been political partners for a long time and I hope that partnership continues well into the future. I would do nothing to jeopardize it. I believe our party is the best hope for the nation to right itself. I believe I have a future role larger than the one I now have. I also believe President Buhari has a continuing and important role to play even after his tenure as president is over.\n\nIndeed, I consistently supported the president and his administration. Even when the administration has come under intense criticism, my feet have always been planted solidly in defence of the president. The president personally nominated me to coordinate his re-election campaign in 2019. He did this not because I opposed him or because I was indifferent. He did so, because I was firmly with him in 2015 and has stood firmly beside him ever since. When I publicly announced my aspiration to seek the party nomination for the upcoming presidential election, I stressed that my strategic objective was to build on the foundation laid by the Buhari administration. In fact, I believe I was the first aspirant to inform President Buhari of his presidential intention. It was a sign of the respect I have for him and his office. It is unthinkable that I would asperse the leader of the party for which I hope to be the next flag bearer. It makes no sense at all to do such an indelicate, unseemly thing.\n\nIn Abeokuta, I spoke to the unwarranted attacks against my person that have been part of the campaign of others. I also recounted the history of the party for those whose memories need repair. There are many who had no role in the birth of the APC and in its many victories. Now that the party has climbed the political summit, they want to claim credit for something they had no part in. However, this cannot be said of President Buhari. I am proud of my role in the advent of the APC and its electoral successes. But President Buhari, of course, stands as the main driver of this success. He was elected president twice. He has borne the weight of national governance for seven years. Nothing can rival that. I would not dare belittle what he has done and what he has meant to the party and nation.\n\nPresident Buhari is a Nigerian patriot, a man of integrity. These qualities won him tremendous mass support leading to electoral victory in 2015 and 2019. I am proud to have been his partner in the political merger that became the APC and in making history by ousting an incumbent president for the first time in Nigeria.\n\nI make no apologies for seeking the party\u2019s nomination. I believe I have something important to offer Nigeria that the other aspirants do not have, although I see them as good and committed Nigerians in their own right. While I want this office, there are certain things I will not do and certain lines I shall not cross. I shall never belittle myself by denigrating the president or his office. I dare not seek an office and disrespect it at the same time.\n\nMy aspiration to be President of Nigeria is based on my want to serve the nation and not that I feel some personal entitlement to high office. Governance of this nation is a sacred and solemn duty. It is neither to be given as a favour to someone who is unqualified nor should people be motivated by personal reasons to prevent the most qualified person from attaining the office. The wellbeing of over 200 million souls is at stake. Let us all realise this and act accordingly, I only desire a level-playing ground for all aspirants and an adherence to stipulated rules and due process. If in the fairness of such a process, I do not emerge as the party\u2019s candidate, I shall have no complaints regarding an honest primary and will accept the fair outcome as a true democrat.\n\nAsiwaju Bola Tinubu\n\nJune 3, 2022.",

          "text": "Leading Presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has described POresident Muhammadu Buhari as someone he has high regard and respect for.\n\nThe former Lagos governor stated in a statement he personally signed and made available to newsmen on Friday.\n\nRead the full statement below:\n\nWe have entered the meat of primary season. Sensationalism and willful inaccuracy tend to push aside truth during such moments. I make this statement so that truth and accuracy may have a chance. It is important that people truly know what I said and where I stand.\n\nWhatever view you have of me is within your right to make. But let it be based on truth and not on falsehood or reckless exaggeration.\n\nThere have been gross misinterpretations in some sectors of the media regarding comments I made on Thursday in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. To a degree, the erroneous interpretations may be somewhat innocent given that I spoke in Yoruba. Those who do not understand the nuances of this richly layered and subtly language may have inadvertently yet erroneously missed the true meaning of what I said while attempting to translate my statement. Instead of weighing what I said carefully, they translated so quickly and thus inaccurately in an attempt to meet media deadlines. Of course, there are also those who knew better but they conveyed these inaccuracies because the sensationalism suits their political purposes.\n\nAgain, such propaganda and misinformation becomes daily fare in the heat of the political season. Let\u2019s just state what needs to be stated. My opponents want to present a narrative that I made comments disrespectful of President Muhammadu Buhari in hopes that such a narrative would convince President Buhari to oppose my aspirations regarding the approaching primary. President Buhari is an experienced and accomplished leader. I do not believe he will be taken by the tricks of such people.\n\nLet me also erase any doubt. My respect and regard for President Buhari as Commander-in- chief of this nation and as a person are high and unfailing. I shall never denigrate him. I certainly did not do so in Abeokuta. We have been political partners for a long time and I hope that partnership continues well into the future. I would do nothing to jeopardize it. I believe our party is the best hope for the nation to right itself. I believe I have a future role larger than the one I now have. I also believe President Buhari has a continuing and important role to play even after his tenure as president is over.\n\nIndeed, I consistently supported the president and his administration. Even when the administration has come under intense criticism, my feet have always been planted solidly in defence of the president. The president personally nominated me to coordinate his re-election campaign in 2019. He did this not because I opposed him or because I was indifferent. He did so, because I was firmly with him in 2015 and has stood firmly beside him ever since. When I publicly announced my aspiration to seek the party nomination for the upcoming presidential election, I stressed that my strategic objective was to build on the foundation laid by the Buhari administration. In fact, I believe I was the first aspirant to inform President Buhari of this presidential intention. It was a sign of the respect I have for him and his office. It is unthinkable that I would asperse the leader of the party for which I hope to be the next flag bearer. It makes no sense at all to do such an indelicate, unseemly thing.\n\nIn Abeokuta, I spoke to the unwarranted attacks against my person that have been part of the campaign of others. I also recounted the history of the party for those whose memories need repair. There are many who had no role in the birth of the APC and in its many victories. Now that the party has climbed the political summit, they want to claim credit for something they had no part in. However, this cannot be said of President Buhari. I am proud of my role in the advent of the APC and its electoral successes. But President Buhari, of course, stands as the main driver of this success. He was elected president twice. He has borne the weight of national governance for seven years. Nothing can rival that. I would not dare belittle what he has done and what he has meant to the party and nation.\n\nPresident Buhari is a Nigerian patriot, a man of integrity. These qualities won him tremendous mass support leading to electoral victory in 2015 and 2019. I am proud to have been his partner in the political merger that became the APC and in making history by ousting an incumbent president for the first time in Nigeria.\n\nI make no apologies for seeking the party\u2019s nomination. I believe I have something important to offer Nigeria that the other aspirants do not have, although I see them as good and committed Nigerians in their own right. While I want this office, there are certain things I will not do and certain lines I shall not cross. I shall never belittle myself by denigrating the president or his office. I dare not seek an office and disrespect it at the same time.\n\nMy aspiration to be President of Nigeria is based on my want to serve the nation and not that I feel some personal entitlement to high office. Governance of this nation is a sacred and solemn duty. It is neither to be given as a favour to someone who is unqualified nor should people be motivated by personal reasons to prevent the most qualified person from attaining the office. The wellbeing of over 200 million souls is at stake. Let us all realise this and act accordingly, I only desire a level playing ground for all aspirants and an adherence to stipulated rules and due process. If in the fairness of such a process, I do not emerge as the party\u2019s candidate, I shall have no complaints regarding an honest primary and will accept the fair outcome as a true democrat.\n\nAsiwaju Bola Tinubu\n\nJune 3, 2022.",

          "text": "The person Nigeria needs is a leader who understands how to deal with current global economic dynamics and someone who will be acceptable in all parts of the country.\n\nThose were the words of the Director General of the Tinubu Campaign Organisation, Kashim Shettima, while speaking on TVC\u2019s current affairs programme, Journalist Hangout.\n\nHe insists that the All Progressives Congress will be doing itself a lot of good by picking an aspirant who has the capacity to march the candidate of the leading Peoples Democratic Party.\n\nThe former governor of Borno state described the reception and acceptability of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as overwhelming. He described their visits to Ibadan and Abeokuta on Thursday thunderous. \u201cThe reception accorded to our candidate has been very wonderful. We were in Ibadan yesterday. The thunderous ovation in Oyo and Ogun state and actually with the emergence of Atiku Abubakar, the dynamics has completely changed. Asiwaju is the only candidate with the pedigree, with the brand name that stand shoulder to shoulder with Atiku or even more, because if his stature. By God\u2019s grace our candidate will emerge the flagbearer of APC in the next 72hours. It\u2019s not a subject of dispute but a question of time.\n\nIn what he described as deliberate misrepresentation and distortion, Senator Shettima said: \u201cAnd Yesterday, in Abeokuta, he made some remarks that were deliberately distorted and quoted out of context. And this is something we have been saying repeatedly. Those that have nothing to show want us to go low. Whether the opponent of Tinubu want to know and accept his roles not only in the emergence of Buhari as APC candidate but in his victory in 2015, Asiwaju was instrumental to Buhari\u2019s victory in 2015.\u201d\n\nSenator Shettima stated further: \u201cIn 2011 presidential election as a CPC candidate, Buhari scored 2689 votes in Ekiti, 17,600 in Ogun, 6,997 in Osun. But in 2015, President Buhari got 30,8290 in Ogun, 383,603 in Osun, 120,133 in Ekiti. Of course, the president has been performing very well in the north, but despite this he couldn\u2019t win in 2003, 2007 and 2011. Tinubu deserves to be treated with dignity and decorum because he has paid his dues. Without the bloc votes the South gave us in 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari wouldn\u2019t have emerged as president.\u201d\n\nMr. Shettima who comes from the North Eastern part of Nigeria believes that giving every part of the country a sense of belonging is more important than regional demands.\n\n\u201cMy own take on this is simple. APC itself is an amalgam of contested interests. It was a child of necessity. It was born out of ANPP, ACN, CPC, APGA and of course the new PDP. Power has resided in the north for the past 8years, justice, equity demand power should move to the South. Some people say anything goes in politics, but believe me, not everything that goes in politics. There\u2019s no clear guaranty that picking candidate from the north APC we\u2019ll win in 2023. Apart from my governor, Professor Zulum, there\u2019s nobody in the north that can win 2million votes on its own.\n\nThe north and the south are the Nigeria\u2019s political configuration. The northeast is a constituent part of northern Nigeria. For me as a Kanuri man, there a very thin line that divides me with someone from Katsina or Jigawa. I am a Kanuri with Fulani blood in my vein, so we are essentially one people having the same culture and religion.\n\nOn consensus, the former governor said: \u201ca lot of water has passed under the bridge. We are approaching the primaries in the next 72hours. Certainly, there are some aspirants that will step down for others where our candidate will emerge.\n\nIn fairness to the president, most of us governor when we were leaving the scene, we had input in who becomes our successor. The president is a democrat and he will allow the delegate to do needful.\n\nPeople are underrating his friendship with Tinubu. They have come a long way. If there\u2019s anyone with the array of contestants, Asiwaju is the leader among his mentees, If at all President Buhari will endorse anyone, it will Bola Ahmed Tinubu. This is the pay pack time. I believe our dear president.\n\nSpeaking on the fitness and wellness of Asiwaju Tinubu, the campaign director general said: \u201d Asiwaju is mentally elicit and alert. Leadership is not the ability to carry bags of cement but mental ability to come up with solutions. We are not preparing for the Olympics but governance.\n\n\u201cTinubu is physically and mentally fit to lead this country. He had knee injury but what is wrong about that. Asiwaju is even more fit than I am. I am diabetic, I cannot eat certain things but Asiwaju can.\u201d Senator Shettima said.",

          "text": "The seven-man All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Screening Committee headed by the former national chairman of the party, Chief John Oyegun on Friday announced that it had cleared 13 of the 23 aspirants screened, while recommending10 for disqualification ahead of the party\u2019s Presidential primary election scheduled for next week.\n\nOf the 13 aspirants cleared, five of them are regarded as the frontrunners, with Vice President Yemi Osibanjo leading. The next four in order of their strengths are Senate President, Ahmad Lawan; Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi; former Governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu and the former Minister of Niger Delta, Godswill Akpabio.\n\nOyegun revealed the recommendation to disqualify 10 presidential aspirants when he led other members of the committee to submit their screening report to the Abdulahi Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC) of the party.\n\nOyegun said: \u201cMy first comment is that we are indeed a very lucky party. We had a lot of others, prominent Nigerians both within the country and outside that had applied, but for whatever reasons, could not proceed with their applications. The point I want to make is the quality of the people that want to govern this country.\n\nThe committee\u2019s chairman said there were two aspects or criteria for the screening, which included the constitutional qualification to aspire to be a president, saying every single aspirant that presented himself qualified in that regard.\n\n\u201cAnd so the ability to lead, background, experience, understanding of the Nigerian situation, ideas as to how issues; difficulties, problems and the rest can be addressed and how the country can be moved forward became principal considerations.\n\n\u201cWho are you? What have you achieved? What is the understanding of your nation? And what do you think you can contribute to move the nation forward? It was on the basis of that that we made our final short list. I don\u2019t want to read the names, I think we leave that to you. But we have a short list, we brought the number severely down to 13.\n\n\u201cWe could have cut it a little shorter, but we wanted, deliberately, the younger element to surface; for them to be seen, for them to be noticed. It\u2019s for the party to decide the preferred candidate. It is also an opportunity to showcase the kind of people that exist within the party.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of consensus, Oyegun revealed that 98 to 99% of the aspirants agreed that the party is supreme and that whatever the party finally decides with proper consultation, they would accept.\n\nAlso, on the issue of zoning, Oyegun urged the party to address it, which he said was already creating division between the North and the South in the ruling party.\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe flag does not belong to me, it doesn\u2019t belong to any of us, it is the flag of the party, a corporate body called the APC and it is my hope that that spirit will be obeyed. Various court decisions have affirmed this position, it is the party that is being represented and not individuals.\n\n\u201cSo, whoever emerges to be the flag bearer of the party is only the symbol of the party and I hope that the spirit which we approach the convention with will guide everyone of the contestants, guide us and leaders of the party. We will do the best we can in the circumstances the party finds itself.\u201d",

          "text": "Presidential spokesperson, Femi Adesina, on Friday faulted claims that President Muhammadu Buhari asked members of the PGF to pick a consensus presidential candidate for the APC.\n\nHe said that contrary to reports, the President only met with the governors and gave them his \u201cexpectation\u201d for the forthcoming presidential primary of the party.\n\nAdesina stated these in a piece titled, \u2018Visit to Spain: Let\u2019s Buga for Mr. President\u2019.\n\nMaking clarifications on what transpired during the meeting, the presidential spokesperson explained that Buhari never discussed issues bordering on zoning, consensus, or imposition of candidates during his conversation with the governors.\n\nAccording to him, Buhari told them what he would like to see at the APC presidential primary to elect a presidential candidate early next week.\n\n\u201cHe said no word about zoning, consensus, or imposition of candidate. He just charged them to let their plans converge, so that the party would put its best foot forward. Shortly after the meeting, we headed for the airport.\n\n\u201cA short time into the about five hours flight, I went on social media, to see that all hell had broken loose. Trust some Nigerians. When there\u2019s no controversy, they simply create one. They will die of boredom if they don\u2019t have something to wail or ululate about.\n\n\u201cWhat were they bellyaching on? Oh, he used the words \u2018my successor,\u2019 instead of \u2018APC candidate.\u2019 That means he wants to rig the election.\n\n\u201cOh, he talked about Governors who performed well being given opportunity to get a second term, for continuity. That means he wants to impose someone from within the government to succeed him. Consensus is what he wants. Puerile.\n\n\u201cIs consensus not one of the acceptable ways of choosing candidates, according to the Electoral Act? So the party can jolly well decide on the method it wants.\n\n\u201cOh, he didn\u2019t talk about zoning. APC wants to give its ticket to the North. Really? Did you see anything like that in the speech?\n\n\u201cI tell you. When some Nigerians don\u2019t see what they expect in a speech or statement, they simply conjure and create their own. And the wailing starts.\u201d\n\nBuhari had while addressing the governors on Tuesday ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primary taking place on Monday, said he would be seeking reciprocity from the governors ahead of the presidential primary.\n\n\u201cIn keeping with the established internal policies of the party and as we approach the convention in a few days, therefore, I wish to solicit the reciprocity and support of the governors and other stakeholders in picking my successor, who would fly the flag of our party for election into the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023,\u201d the President added.\n\nHe asked the governors to ensure that all interests \u2018converge\u2019 as regards the outcome of the presidential primary. The President added that the person who emerges as the presidential candidate must be one who could give Nigerians a sense of victory even before the polls.",

          "title": "Tinubu: My Comments in Ogun Lost in Translation, My Respect for President Buhari High, Unfailing",
          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential aspirant and former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, on Friday moved fast to douse the anger created by the speech he delivered Thursday while on a consultation visit to the delegates of the party in Abeokuta, Ogun State, during which he bragged about installing President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and Governor Dapo Abiodun.\n\nOn the same day, President Buhari returned to Abuja after a three-day state visit to Spain and shortly after met with a two-man delegation of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) led by its Chairman and Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu.\n\nIn a statement he pushed out Friday, Tinubu said his comments had been misinterpreted by the media and that he did not disrespect President Buhari.\n\nThe APC Presidential aspirant in the statement he signed declared that his respect and regard for Buhari as Commander-in- Chief of this nation, and as a person, are high and unfailing.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy respect and regard for President Buhari as Commander-in- chief of this nation and as a person are high and unfailing. I shall never denigrate him. I certainly did not do so in Abeokuta. We have been political partners for a long time and I hope that partnership continues well into the future. I would do nothing to jeopardize it. I believe our party is the best hope for the nation to right itself. I believe I have a future role larger than the one I now have. I also believe President Buhari has a continuing and important role to play even after his tenure as president is over.\n\n\u201cIndeed, I consistently supported the president and his administration. Even when the administration has come under intense criticism, my feet have always been planted solidly in defence of the president. The president personally nominated me to coordinate his re-election campaign in 2019. He did this not because I opposed him or because I was indifferent. He did so, because I was firmly with him in 2015 and has stood firmly beside him ever since.\n\n\u201cWhen I publicly announced my aspiration to seek the party nomination for the upcoming presidential election, I stressed that my strategic objective was to build on the foundation laid by the Buhari administration. In fact, I believe I was the first aspirant to inform President Buhari of this presidential intention. It was a sign of the respect I have for him and his office. It is unthinkable that I would aspire to be the leader of the party for which I hope to be the next flag bearer. It makes no sense at all to do such an indelicate, unseemly thing.\n\n\u201cI am proud of my role in the advent of the APC and its electoral successes. But President Buhari, of course, stands as the main driver of this success. He was elected president twice. He has borne the weight of national governance for seven years. Nothing can rival that. I would not dare belittle what he has done and what he has meant to the party and nation.\u201d\n\nTinubu described Buhari as a Nigerian patriot and a man of integrity and that these qualities won him tremendous mass support leading to electoral victory in 2015 and 2019.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am proud to have been his partner in the political merger that became the APC and in making history by ousting an incumbent president for the first time in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI make no apologies for seeking the party\u2019s nomination. I believe I have something important to offer Nigeria that the other aspirants do not have, although I see them as good and committed Nigerians in their own rights. While I want this office, there are certain things I will not do and certain lines I shall not cross. I shall never belittle myself by denigrating the president or his office. I dare not seek an office and disrespect it at the same time.\u201d\n\nBuhari Back from Spain\n\nPresident Buhari yesterday returned to Abuja after a three-day state visit Spain.\n\nShortly after his return, the President met with a two-man delegation of the PGF, led by its Chairman and Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu.\n\nBagudu and the Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, met behind closed-door with President Buhari.\n\nSources said Friday night that the meeting was a follow up to the one held on Tuesday before the President travelled to Spain when he appealed to the 22 APC governors to allow him determine who among the 23 aspirants will fly the party\u2019s presidential flag during 2023 general elections.\n\nIt was gathered that Bagudu told President Buhari that the APC governors had met this week to review their Tuesday meeting with the President.\n\nHe was said to have also told the President that the PGF would still meet this weekend ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primaries convention scheduled for next Monday.\n\nPresident Buhari, sources said, will this weekend meet with critical stakeholdees in the APC with a view to carrying everybody along on what format the party\u2019s presidential primaries will take.\n\nMeanwhile, the President is expected to leave Abuja today for Accra, Ghana to attend an extra ordinary meeting of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).\n\nPresident Buhari who will be accompanied by some Ministers and top government officials is expected back in Abuja later today.\n\nSaraki, Babachir Lawal Castigate Tinubu\n\nAPC chieftain, Babachir Lawal and former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, on Friday came down hard on Tinubu over his Abeokuta speech in which he talked about how he enthroned political leaders.\n\nIn his response to Tinubu, Saraki stated that when he opposed the plan to foist a Muslim-Muslim presidency on Nigeria in 2014 he acted in the national interest and believed Nigeria was bigger than anybody\u2019s ambition, including that of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nSaraki, in a statement signed by the head of his Media Office, Yusuph Olaniyonu, in response to the speech by Tinubu in Abeokuta, claiming that Saraki and others opposed his desire to be running mate to President Buhari in the 2015 elections, noted that he would oppose any plan that causes a religious crisis in a multi-religious country like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhen I and other leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2014 stood against having a Muslim-Muslim ticket, it was not a decision targeted at any individual or group but one taken in the national interest. Asiwaju knows this and he is just being mischievous by presenting this decision as something aimed at stopping his ambition.\n\n\u201cLet me make it clear that the decision to oppose the plans by some people to make APC present a Muslim-Muslim ticket in 2015 was in the national interest and I will take the same stand today, tomorrow, and any other day. My stance is based on the fact that such a ticket is not good for the unity of the country and will further accentuate one of our fault lines.\n\n\u201cThe opposition to a Muslim- Muslim ticket was not targeted at Tinubu or any other person. It was a decision that even all party leaders know helped the victory of the party and also worked for the unity of the country. That decision is not about self but national and collective interests. It is a decision which served the purpose of the people of Nigeria and I have no regret supporting it\u201d, Saraki stated.\n\nWhile expressing surprise that Tinubu refused to move on and still sulked over what happened in 2014, the former Governor of Kwara State added that the APC presidential aspirant had become so fixated on the Muslim-Muslim ticket issue of 2014 that he worked so hard to stop the emergence of Saraki as Senate President in a move he considered as retaliatory.\n\nSaraki also stated that after he was elected Senate President, Tinubu maintained an adversarial position against the eighth National Assembly, initiated covert and overt measures aimed at undermining the federal legislature, and set the executive against the legislature.\n\nFormer Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal declared that it was very difficult supporting a Yoruba person in national politics, following Tinubu\u2019s outburst.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey have a way of making you regret your support because they eventually make you seem like a traitor to your own people. Now all these comments about Bola\u2019s Yoruba presidency and his support of Buhari without which Buhari would not have been president is bullshit.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t the only one whose support made a difference. There were many others from all around the country and they are not bragging about it. You may wish to know that all of us Buhari supporters are shocked and pissed off by Bola\u2019s speech on this occasion. It is unlike him.\u201d\n\nThe former SGF said Tinubu\u2019s speech was massively trending in the North \u201cand being given a negative connotation as you can well imagine.\u201d\n\nHe said he first read it on an Adamawa group platform \u201cand the anger is palpable and all round.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill Tinubu win Monday\u2019s APC primaries without Northern support? You would think Yorubas will resist the temptation of joining in the northerners-bashing game at this very critical time \u2013 the primary election is only three days away. It is unfortunate that Bola himself chose to join in this bashing game \u2013 choosing to speak in the Yoruba language and in Yoruba land in a manner that seems to denigrate Buhari. I could vividly imagine the discomfort of all the northerners sitting beside him on that podium.\n\n\u201cThis appears to be the Abiola saga being replayed. Abiola won the election with majority Northern votes but they took the brunt of the post-election protests that followed.\n\n\u201cJust survey all the people that are doing more meaningful practical things to enthrone Bola as president and you will find that almost all are northerners while his kinsmen engage themselves in social media activism and Northern bashing.\n\n\u201cWhen Yorubas vilify the North like this, our sense of fear and insecurity under a Yoruba presidency gets heightened and in the end, pushes us to rethink our support for not only Bola but any Yoruba as president for that matter. Please, do not join our opponents to destroy our chances of clinching Monday\u2019s primary elections.\u201d\n\nCourt Asked to Disqualify Tinubu\n\nSome members of the APC under the platform of the Gaskiya Youth Movement have dragged Tinubu to court over what it alleges as discrepancies in the academic qualifications submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), in aide of his qualification for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe plaintiffs, Umar Iliyasu, Suleiman Baba, and Abubakar Adama, in the suit filed on June 2, 2022, are claiming that the educational history of Tinubu \u201cis not consistent with the earlier forms C.F. 001\u201d he filled in preparation for the Governorship election of Lagos State in the year 1999.\n\nOutside the academic issue, plaintiffs are also alleging discrepancies in the age as well as the indigeneship of the former Lagos State Governor and as such want the court to stop Tinubu from participating in the June 7 primary election from the selection of the APC\u2019s candidate in the 2023 presidential poll.\n\nThe APC, Tinubu, and INEC are 1st to 3rd defendants respectively in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/774/2022.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs are accusing the APC presidential aspirant of giving false information in contravention of the electoral laws and constitution.\n\nIn a 31 paragraph affidavit deposed to by one Miracle Udeaja in support of the suit, the plaintiffs submitted that \u201cThe 2nd defendant presented an incorrect educational history and inconsistent dates of birth in his forms and ought to be disqualified from seeking or contesting for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended)\u201d.\n\nPlaintiffs further submitted that any person seeking an elective position under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), who presents a false document is disqualified from that election or any subsequent elections\n\nAmongst the issues for determination are; \u201cwhether, upon the due consideration of Section 131 of the Constitution, section 84(3) of the Electoral Act 2022, Article 20(111) and (iv) of the Constitution of the APC and Articles 9, 13 and 17 of the guidelines for the nomination of candidates for the 2023 general election issued by the APC, the 2nd defendant can participate or contest in the primary election on the platform of the 1st defendant.\n\n\u201cGiven the questionable educational background and date of birth of the 2nd defendant, amongst other questionable issues, whether the 1 st defendant can allow and/or permit the participation of the 2nd defendant in the primary election for the office of the president.\n\n\u201cWhether the 2nd defendant can participate by presenting himself in any primary elections with any political party in Nigeria to be nominated as a presidential aspirant for the 2023 general election scheduled to take place in June 2022.\n\nPlaintiffs urged that where the court answers the above questions in the affirmative, then the following reliefs should be granted: A declaration that \u201cgiven the questionable educational background and date of birth of the 2nd defendant, amongst other questionable issues, the 1 st defendant cannot allow and/or permit the participation of the 2nd defendant in the primary election for the office of the president.\n\n\u201cA declaration that the 2nd defendant cannot participate by presenting himself in any primary elections with any political party in Nigeria to be nominated as a presidential aspirant for the 2023 general election scheduled to take place in June 2022.\n\n\u201cAn order disqualifying the 2nd defendant from contesting in the primary elections on the platform of the 1 st defendant scheduled for June 7, 2022, or any other day as may be fixed by the 1st defendant having not met the statutory requirements.\n\n\u201cAn order of perpetual injunction restraining the 2nd defendant from participating or presenting himself in any primary elections with any political party in Nigeria to be nominated as a presidential aspirant for the 2023 presidential election.\u201d\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale and Alex Enumah in Abuja",
