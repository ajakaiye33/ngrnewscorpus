          "title": "IMF raises Nigeria\u2019s growth forecast by 0.1%",
          "text": "The International Monetary Fund has increased Nigeria\u2019s growth prospect by 0.1 to 2.6 per cent in 2021 and 2.7 per cent in 2022, despite reducing the rate of global growth prospect due to the COVID-19 Delta variant.\n\nThis is according to the October 2021 World Economic Outlook Report, which was released on Tuesday.\n\nIn the July 2021 World Economic Outlook, the forecast for Nigeria was at 2.5 per cent in 2021 and 2.6 per cent in 2020.\n\nThis suggests an upward review of Nigeria\u2019s growth prospect.\n\nHowever, in view of the 3.7 per cent 2021 and 2022 growth forecast for Sub-Saharan Africa, Nigeria is 1.1 per cent behind in 2021 and 1 per cent behind in 2022.\n\nDespite the slight positive outlook for Nigeria, the IMF has slightly downgraded global growth projections for 2021.\n\nThe projection for 2021 was downgraded by 0.1 percentage points to 5.9 per cent, while the global growth forecast for 2022 remained unchanged at 4.9 per cent.\n\nThe IMF justifies this, stating that supply chain disruptions negatively affect recovery in the advanced economies, while lack of access to Covid-19 vaccines holds back prospects for the emerging economies.\n\nIn the Forward to the report, the Economic Counsellor and Director of Research at IMF, Gita Gopinath, said that risks to the economy have increased due to the Delta variant, with the pandemic disrupting supply chains and fuelling inflation.\n\n\u201cThe momentum has weakened, hobbled by the pandemic. Fueled by the highly transmissible Delta variant, the recorded global recovery continues but the COVID-19 death toll has risen close to 5 million and health risks abound, holding back a full return to normalcy. Pandemic outbreaks in critical links of global supply chains have resulted in longer-than-expected supply disruptions, further feeding inflation in many countries. Overall, risks to economic prospects have increased, and policy trade-offs have become more complex,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added, \u201cCompared to our July forecast, the global growth projection for 2021 has been revised down marginally to 5.9 per cent and is unchanged for 2022 at 4.9 per cent. This modest headline revision, however, masks large downgrades for some countries. The outlook for the low-income developing country group has darkened considerably due to worsening pandemic dynamics.\n\n\u201cThe downgrade also reflects more difficult near-term prospects for the advanced economy group, in part due to supply disruptions. Partially offsetting these changes, projections for some commodity exporters have been upgraded on the back of rising commodity prices. Pandemic-related disruptions to contact-intensive sectors have caused the labour market recovery to significantly lag the output recovery in most countries.\u201d",

          "text": "The Coalition of Northern Youth Groups (CNYG) has completely disagreed with the position of Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) should further devalue the naira for the economic benefit of the country.\n\nThe coalition observed that the naira has lost its value so much that it no longer has exchange value compared to other currencies in Africa especially neighbouring countries that Nigeria was once better than.\n\nIn a statement issued by the convener of the Coalition, Mallam Yusuf Amoke, the group explained, \u201cWe have carefully listened to the position of the Vice President and we have critically analysed his positions on monitory policies. His position is limited seeing to the fact that he is not an economist but a lawyer, if the path of the Vice President were to be taken, soon the Naira will be nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cIn his presentation and opinion, he opined that the CBN should further devalue the Naira for an economic benefit we are yet to understand. The Naira has lost its value so much such that it does no longer have exchanged value compared to other currency in Africa, most especially the neighbouring countries that we were once better of.\u201d\n\nThe group observed that the Vice President was the chairman of the National Economic Management Team Committee from the beginning of this government up until it was recently dissolved by the President, stressing that the President\u2019s action must have had a lot to do with the poor understanding of the Vice President.\n\nIt noted that during the period of his leadership of the team, the dollar was devalued a number of times either deliberately or forcefully by elements of the market, saying that surprisingly, there has been no economic prosperity to commensurate the devaluation of the currency.\n\nIt said that it is obvious that there is no magic the CBN governor or any other person could do to improve the economy, pointing out that the economy is an importation economy, with less dollar within the system but high demand to import and go for medical and educational tourism.\n\nOsinbajo clears air on calling for Naira devaluation\n\nIt lamented that only oil brings dollars into the system and the subsidy regime and the importation of the refined product, adding that it further takes away the dollar that is supposed to support the economy.\n\nThe statement explained that the Vice President stressed that for the country to get dollar inflow there is a need to devalue the naira to as much as the market determines, but the coalition opined that it showed complete ignorance of the economy and its operations.\n\nThe statement said that the Vice President made it clear that unemployment, loss of jobs, and poor foreign investment inflow are a result of the exchange rate, stressing that it shows the Vice President\u2019s lack of grasp and a good understanding of the economy.\n\nIt observed that both the CBN and other MDAs have acted on laws that guide their powers, rules, regulations, dos, and don\u2019ts, saying that if the Vice President thinks certain things are wrong with the mode or interventions by the CBN, there should be a referral to the laws guiding the activities of the bank with respect to those MDAs.\n\nIt enjoined Mr. President to not contemplate bringing back the Economic Management Team (EMT) headed by the Vice President for any purpose, saying that he is a good lawyer but a bad economist.\n\nThe forum advised President Buhari to encourage the position of the CBN governor not to devalue the naira, but instead create ways that will strengthen the currency.\n\nIt noted that President Buhari should distance the VP from commenting and or interfering on anything that has to do with the economy of this country because he has over time proven to be a bad economist.\n\n\u201cWe shall not allow anybody to use his or her office to project unpopular policies that will plunge Nigerians into further poverty, the one the masses are faced with is enough. Further devaluation of Naira means more poverty, more insecurity, more restiveness, and more death in the land. We say NO to the devaluation of Naira,\u201d the group emphasized.",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu, Romanus Ugwu, Fred Itua, Ndubuisi Orji, Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nApplause and knocks have greeted the decision of the Senate to give the Independent National Electronic Commission the green light to transmit results of elections electronically in the conduct of the 2023 general elections and the adoption of direct primaries method.\n\nThose who hailed the lawmakers included the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), Ebonyi Professionals Forum (EPF), Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, former Senate deputy president, Ike Ekweremadu, former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Kingsley Moghalu and\n\nThe upper legislative chamber had reconsidered its earlier position and gave the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) the nod to determine the mode to transmit election results: either electronically or manually.\n\nIt also reversed its earlier position and approved that all political parties must use the direct primary mode in picking candidates. This, however, drew the ire of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) and Governor Wike.\n\nIn its earlier amendment passed in July, Senate had approved both direct and indirect methods.\n\nThe landmark moves came barely 24 hours after Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, met with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Villa on Monday.\n\nThe decision of the Senate, followed the re-committal of some clauses of the Electoral Act 2010 to the Committee of the Whole.\n\nIn July, the Senate, rejected its committee\u2019s report, which had approved electronic transmission of results by INEC. The House of Representatives, however, approved it.\n\nThe Senate, said: \u201cAfter critical examination of the Bill by the Senate Committee on INEC, some fundamental issues which require fresh legislative action on clauses 43, 52, 63 and 87, were observed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDesirous of the need to address the observations by the committee and make necessary amendments, and relying on Order 1(b) and 53(6) of the Senate Standing Order, accordingly resolves to rescind its decision on the affected clauses of the Bill as passed and re-commit same to the Committee of the Whole for consideration and passage,\u201d Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi stated while moving the motion.\n\nThe Senate, had in July, while rejecting the position of its Committee on INEC, opted for a position, which was outrightly rejected by Nigerians.\n\nThe senate approved four clauses in the electoral act amendment bill. Part of the clause amended, read: \u201cSubject to section 63 of this Bill, voting at an election and transmission of results under this Bill shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the Commission (INEC), which may include electronic voting.\n\n\u201cA political party seeking to nominate candidates for elections under this Bill shall hold direct primaries for aspirants to all elective positions, which shall be monitored by the Commission.\u201d\n\nDaily Sun had reported that plans were underway to force direct method of conducting primary elections on political parties.\n\nGovernor Wike said the resolution of the National Assembly joint committee to allow the electoral umpire transmit election results electronically is a good development for Nigeria and democracy.\n\n\u201cI think it is a good news to hear that the Joint Committee of the House of Representatives and the Senate agreed for INEC to transmit result electronically. That is a good news to hear. Like I have always said, what is important now is what do people want. The moment you do what the people want you\u2019ll see happiness everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who has been a proponent of transparent electoral system, observed that many nations have moved beyond manual result declaration and Nigeria cannot afford in the 21st century to be left behind.\n\nOn the amendment of the Electoral Act, Governor Wike stated that the issue of direct or indirect primaries should be the exclusive decision of the political parties in the country.\n\nGovernor Wike insisted that National Assembly prescribing how political parties conduct their primaries is tantamount to interference in the internal politics of the parties.\n\nIPAC also believe that electronic transmission of results would go a long way in deepening the nation\u2019s political process critical for inclusive, free, fair, credible, transparent and generally acceptable elections.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary, IPAC, Ambassador Agbo Major, in a statement released said: \u201cReversing itself is a giant step forward in making Nigeria a great arsenal of democracy in Africa. Manipulation of election results, ballot box snatching, violence, vote buying and selling are the bane of the nation\u2019s electoral process.\n\nFormer VP Atiku, in a statement by his media office, yesterday, said the harmonisation of positions between the parliament and the electoral body was an indication that the country\u2019s democracy is growing.\n\nHe also commended individuals and groups, especially the various pro-democracy advocacy groups that participated in the public discourse on the controversial issue.\n\n\u201cBy this outcome, I am convinced that public institutions in Nigeria will continue to play their roles as guardians of public policy.\u201d\n\nSpokesman of ADF, Abia Onyike and National Secretary of Ebonyi Professionals, Ugochukwu Hanks-Ezekiel, described it as a progressive move indicative that power belongs to the people. They said it would go a long way to guarantee free and fair elections in Nigeria.\n\nOn the issue of direct primaries, Onyike said: \u201cIt is equally a welcome development because the members of political parties would have a say in who their candidates for elections should be. The power is being removed from few delegates who can be easily bought over by money bags.\u201d\n\nFor Hanks-Ezekiel, it is a sign of the people\u2019s power to stand together. He also noted that direct primaries would end Godfatherism in the nation\u2019s polity.\n\nEkweremadu said the Senate\u2019s action justified his assurances to Nigerians in July that all hope was not lost for electronic transmission of 2023 election results despite the initial setback.\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Uche Anichukwu, Ekweremadu said: \u201cI want to specially commend the Senate for setting aside narrow partisan interests to correct the mistake of July 15, 2021 by reversing itself on the issue of electronic transmission of election results.\n\n\u201cThis clause, though not originally part of the Bill, was introduced by the Joint National Assembly Committee on the Independent National Electoral Commission, which I am part of, to save the nation the troubles of ballot box snatching, electoral violence, and manipulations that happen between the polling booth and collation centres. Although I was representing Nigeria at an international parliamentary session in Montenegro and therefore unavoidably absent during the passage of the Bill in July, I had assured Nigerians that we would work with the progressives across party lines to dialogue with our colleagues and other critical stakeholders to ensure that electronic transmission of results was restored in the Bill. It is, therefore, heart-warming that my confidence in the capacity of my colleagues to dialogue and rise above narrow partisan interest on this matter was not misplaced.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

Hon Chinedum Orji and Chairman/CEO, Marco Polo Group of Companies, Chief Frank Okafor, have described The Sun awards as a great honour to them and their organisations.\n\nThey also described The Sun as an example of purposeful journalism, saying the newspaper has done a lot to give Nigerians a voice.\n\nSpeaking at separate meetings with a delegation of The Sun Publishing Ltd, led by the Managing Director/ Editor-in-Chief, Mr. Onuoha Ukeh, who visited them in Umuahia and Lagos to present letters notifying them of their emergence as winners of The Sun Public Service Award 2020 and The Sun Investor of the Year 2020, Orji and Okafor commended the newspaper for revolutionalising journalism in Nigeria.\n\nThey expressed happiness for being recognised by a platform which respects the ethics of journalism in its operations.\n\nThe Sun Awards, Abia Speaker said, will spur him to further contribute more to the development of the state.\n\nOrji said he had declined several awards offered him by some organisations, but said he had to accept that of The Sun because of the credibility and reputation of the newspaper.\n\nThe Speaker said The Sun has endeared itself to Nigerians because of its insistence on recoganising excellence.\n\n\u201cI have perused the list of those given awards by your organisation in the past and came to the conclusion that the awards are not for all comers, but for those who have excelled in their various endeavours. \u201cI like constructive criticism and that\u2019s exactly what The Sun Newspaper is doing. You criticise individuals who are not doing well in their areas of concern, including the federal government and even world bodies, when they derail. You also praise those who deserve it. I believe that is what journal- ism is all about.\u201d He admonished The Sun \u201cto continue to critically appraise politicians so that we can be on our toes, be up and doing so that the society will be better for all. \u201cI\u2019m not the type who always like to face the press but I must say here that because of the credibility of The Sun Newspaper and the respect I have for its editorial team, it was the first newspaper I granted an interview.\u201d Orji dedicated the award to his colleagues in the House whom he said have continue to stand by him. \u201cIf I did not get the support of my colleagues and the House did not do well, there\u2019s no way we will receive this honour,\u201d he said. On his part, Okafor expressed happiness that his efforts in the business world are being recognition. \u201cI have witnessed a couple of The Sun Awards with friends and business associates. I am proud of the previous awards winners. I must say, however, that I\u2019m very surprised about this honour being given to me. My surprise is that I do not know how the management of The Sun got to know so much about my business and me. The Sun management seems to know me more than myself.\u201d Earlier, Ukeh praised Orji and Okafor for excelling in their different areas of focus . Listing some outstanding achievements of Orji, The Sun MD said: \u201cThe Speaker is part of the Abia House of Assembly that passed the anti grazing bill into law, long before the South came out with a decision on that. The Assembly could be said to have seen tomorrow and acted promptly. \u201cThe Speaker, among other things, has shown leadership as well as doing much to uplift humanity. As part of his pro- gramme for talent hunt, he is constructing nine mini-stadia in his constituency. He gave members of the House excellent environment by remoulding the House of Assembly to a world class environment.\u201d For Okafor, he said: \u201cAside from importation and real estate, you have invested also in hospitality sector with Marco Polo Hotels and Suites.\u201d Hesaid Okafor\u2019svision of providing housing for all made Marco Polo Properties develop houses for different classes: low, medium and high individual. The Sun Awards ceremony holds on Saturday, October 16, 2021 at the Expo Convention Center, Eko Hotels and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos.

          "text": "By Henry Akubuiro\n\nFresh revelations have emerged on how former President, Olusegun Obasanjo, tried to tinker with the Nigerian Constitution to enable him run for a third term, contrary to denials by him.\n\nIn his new book, Standing Strong: Legislative Reforms, Third Term and Other Issues of the 5th Senate, former Senate president, Ken Nnamani (2005-2007) said the battle against the third term bid in 2006 was the most defining task of his tenure as senate president.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cThe bill to amend the 1999 Constitution was titled \u2018Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 Amendment Bill, 2006.\u201d It has 116 clauses. The proposal of an amendment to accommodate a third term of four years for the president and governors was only one of these 116 clauses proposed in the bill. But this provision was so contentious that the whole bill became known as the \u2018Third Term\u2019 by the Nigerian public.\u201d\n\nHe said in the course of his position as the Senate president, he was a regular visitor to the Presidential Villa and was also having one-on-one discussions with Obasanjo as well as phone calls.\n\nThough the president never mentioned his third term agenda to him, he said Obasanjo made references of how his legacies needed to be sustained, and never mentioned having a successor to sustain those legacies.\n\nDisclosing how Senator Ita Giwa tried to lure him to support the third term bid, he recalled: \u201cAt one of the breakfast meetings I attended at the Presidential Villa, the president\u2019s Special Adviser on National Assembly Matters, Florence Ita-Giwa, spoke so glowingly of her boss\u2019 achievements and why the bill that gives him extra term had to be passed. Many of the presidential aides also lobbied passionately to see that the bill was passed to give \u2018Baba\u2019 the needed extra years to cement his legacy and grow the country.\u201d\n\nYet he did not buy into their plans as the bill was subjected to debates, and could not survive the second reading, to the jubilation of most of the senators. Senator Nnamani noted that Obasanjo, in his book, My Watch, struggled without success to rewrite history.\n\n\u201cHe was mostly incoherent, bumbling from one place to the other, desperately searching for an anchor to hang his argument upon and finding nothing stable or strong enough. It was sad to see how hard he was trying to give alternative explanations to what many Nigerians knew to be the facts about the third term, and failing woefully,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe said further that Obasanjo claimed that he never told anyone that he wanted a third term, but \u201cthat\u2019s not exactly true, because \u2018he discussed it with people quietly and privately. Of course, he told his close aides who were the footsoldiers in the fight to get the third term, and he told the party leader, including the Chairman of the party\u2019s National Executive Committee and Chairman, Board of Trustees, who became the chief enforcers of the third term.\u201d\n\nSenator Nnamani also wrote that some of the senators who were offered N50 million bribe to vote in favour of the third term bill told him \u201cit was filled with brand new notes of N1,000, packaged in bundles of 10, amounting to N1 million per package. Each package of N1 million wrapped and sealed in transparent nylon. There were 50 wraps of the N1 million packages in the box, amounting to fifty million naira.\u201d\n\nHe was, however, sad that Nigeria lost an opportunity to change aspects of the contentious 1999 Constitution because the third term clause was smuggled into the bill, and everything died with it.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "By Chinelo Oboogo\n\nThe Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has claimed that the Federal Government would be hampered in funding the N16.9 trillion 2022 budget because Nigerians were not faithful in tax remittances.\n\nChairman of the agency, Muhammad Nami, in a television interview, yesterday, said only N4.2trillion was collected as taxes in nine months, a figure he said, was insufficient to fund the budget presented to the National Assembly last week by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe said were Nigerians tax payers acted as envisaged, the country would have generated sufficient funds to execute the N16.9 trillion budget.\n\nHe said government was having challenges with the oil sector, and that from the N4.2 trillion collected in nine months, N3.3 trillion came from non-oil related taxes, while the balance N950 billion came from oil related taxes.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening now is an issue of attitude and a reflection of what we are. Nobody in the oil or non-oil sector wants to pay tax. We do know that there are challenges in the oil sector, but that will open up in another discussion. Because of our tax paying culture, we haven\u2019t been able to get much from some of these companies, but with the technology that we are going to deploy, we will be able to monitor everything these companies do. We will do tax assessment, collection, accounting and also enforce tax administration, that is one of the major breakthroughs we got from the 2020 Finance Act, so that going forward, every company would be able to pay the right taxes.\n\n\u201cWe now have the power to monitor tax incentives and monitor businesses that will operate in export processing zones. We have generated N3.3 trillion from non-oil taxes alone, and if all things were equal, the oil taxes used to account for over 55 to 60 per cent of the total taxes that FIRS used to collect in the past. If everything were to be okay, we should have been talking about N7 trillion already because if the non-oil is already at N3.2trillion and it used to be about 40 per cent in a year in some cases, and if it is at a level we want it to operate, Nigeria would have been better for it.\n\n\u201cAbove all, this is a confirmation of the fact that Nigerians do not like paying taxes. If we were to be paying taxes, we would have been able to generate enough money to be able to fund a N16.9 trillion budget that was submitted to the National Assembly last week by the President. Why did I say Nigerians are not paying taxes, and the other sector is not cooperating at a level that we ordinarily should be? I said at the budget presentation, Saudi Aramco, the NNPC equivalent in Saudi Arabia, generated over $50 billion, which is over N20 trillion far more than we require to fund a budget of over 200 million people,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also revealed that the FIRS will pay more attention to taxes that it claimed have been ignored for long.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "\u2022Directs SGF to convene quarterly meetings to review govt\u2019s priority areas\n\n\u2022Okonjo-Iweala: Cost of Nigeria\u2019s trade too high to attract investments\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nWith just 19 months and two weeks to finishing his two terms of eight years tenure, President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, directed ministers and permanent secretaries to redouble their efforts and work in synergy towards total delivery of his administration\u2019s set target to improve the livelihood of all Nigerians.\n\nThe president, who gave the charge at Abuja, during his closing remarks at the end of a two-day Mid-term Ministerial performance review retreat, also instructed the ministers to, \u201cramp up implementation\u201d of their mandates along the nine priority areas of his administration.\n\nThis is just as the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who spoke during one of the sessions at the retreat, lamented that cost of Nigeria\u2019s trade was too high to attract foreign investors\n\nBuhari, who further mandated the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha to convene quarterly meetings to enable them further review the administration\u2019s priority areas, stressed the need for synergy between the fiscal and monetary authorities in the country to keep the economy on the trajectory of growth.\n\nIn the same shared spirit, the president directed the Head of Service, Dr. Folashade Yemi-Esan, to as a matter of urgency, invest in capacity strengthening of the Planning, Research and Statistics departments in all MDAs.\n\nBuhari noted that intensive discussions at the retreat provided an opportunity to reflect on what this administration had done and the areas it needed to improve and refocus attention.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe retreat provided an opportunity for us to undertake an objective assessment of our stewardship in line with the contract we signed with the Nigerian people to deliver on our electoral promises. From the assessment report and discussions at this retreat, I am glad to note that progress has been made towards the achievement of our objectives.\n\n\u201cThe independent performance assessment report presented on day one of the retreat, indicates that significant progress has been achieved in the delivery of the Ministerial Mandates. Distinguished participants, the discussions at the retreat have prompted the need for us to ramp up implementation on the deliverables.\n\n\u201cWe must close the gaps in our implementation efforts to ensure that we attain set targets by 2023.\u201d\n\nIt was against this backdrop that the president directed Mustapha to immediately begin the process of convening quarterly coordination meetings for each priority area based on the collaborative results framework.\n\nHe explained that the aim of the meetings was to ascertain status of implementation across the nine priority areas, identify bottlenecks, and proffer immediate solutions.\n\n\u201cAll Ministers and Permanent Secretaries must be in attendance. These are not meetings to delegate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President also instructed the Office of the SGF to immediately commence engagement with stakeholders to agree and push forward a framework for the institutionalisation of the Central Delivery Coordinating Unit.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAll Ministers and Permanent Secretaries are to promote a robust performance culture across the Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) by setting up intra-ministerial delivery task teams.\u201d\n\nDirecting the Head of Service to as a matter of urgency, invest in capacity strengthening of the Planning, Research and Statistics departments in all MDAs, Buhari added that the initiative should be done in collaboration with the Central Delivery Coordinating Unit.\n\nWhile underscoring the need for synergy between the fiscal and monetary authorities, the President assured Nigerians that his administration would continue to implement fiscal measures to improve domestic revenues and mobilise external funding support to build a more resilient economy.\n\nHe pledged that issues around expanding access to quality education, affordable healthcare and productivity of Nigerians would be given priority attention within the period of this administration.\n\n\u201cWe will sustain all on-going efforts in rebuilding our health system through targeted investment in the health sector, especially, our vaccination drive to halt the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cThis administration remains committed to providing the education and training required for employment and entrepreneurship, particularly using technology to impact the relevant skills on our youths.\n\n\u201cOur Social Investment Programmes will be sustained in the coming years. We will continue to reach out to the poorest and most vulnerable households through the National Cash Transfer Programme and other initiatives of government.\u201d\n\nThe president further directed the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, to come up with a legislative framework for social protection that also guaranteed its funding stream.\n\nAlso, in view of the critical role of micro, small and medium scale enterprises (MSMEs) in economic growth and development, he added that, efforts would be geared towards removing all bottlenecks that militate against access to government support schemes by MSMEs.\n\n\u201cGovernment will adopt a holistic approach to industrialisation that is aligned with Nigeria\u2019s aspirations and requirements, working closely with key stakeholders in the private sector. We will continue to support SMEs in view of their multiplier effect on the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the National Single Window Project, the President also directed the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning to ensure all relevant MDAs involved in the implementation of the projects complete all processes needed for effective take-off of the National Single Window platform by first quarter of 2022.\n\nHe spoke on the administration\u2019s determination to build systems to fight corruption and improve governance, saying, \u201cWe will continue to address the issues that foster corruption and impair transparency in the management of public resources. Efforts will be geared towards improving coordination and synergy between anti-corruption agencies.\u201d\n\nOn infrastructure, the president promised that the federal government would prioritise funding and ensure that all high-priority ongoing infrastructure projects were completed before the end of his administration.\n\nHe announced that the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund would continue to support the delivery of legacy infrastructure projects across the country.\n\nAccording to Buhari, the nine priority areas set out by the administration included building a thriving and sustainable economy, enhancing social inclusion and poverty reduction, enlarging agricultural output for food security and export as well as attaining energy sufficiency in power and petroleum products.\n\nOthers were expanding transport and other infrastructure development, business growth, entrepreneurship and industrialisation; access to quality education, affordable healthcare and productivity of Nigerians.\n\nThe administration has also prioritised building a system to fight corruption, improve governance and create social cohesion as well as security for all.\n\nMeanwhile, Okonjo-Iweala, a former Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of Economy under the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan, spoke of the need to improve the nation\u2019s security in order to attract foreign and domestic investments.\n\nThe WTO DG said the country must cut down not only its trade cost, but also infrastructure cost, linkage cost, regulatory cost, customs cost, and all costs associated with moving goods from the factory to the final consumer to complement investment facilitation.\n\nShe pointed out that Nigeria\u2019s trade cost was equivalent of 306 per cent tariff, one and half times higher than the cost in high income countries.\n\nAccording to her, congestion, capacity constraints and high costs at Nigerian ports do not encourage investment as they make it difficult to build supply chain operations in the country.\n\nShe said: \u201cImproving security and lowering transaction cost for foreign investment, even for domestic investment, would be necessary. And Nigeria is part of a group of countries negotiating an agreement on investment facilitation at the WTO.\n\n\u201cOnce this agreement is negotiated, ratified and is being implemented, it could be instrumental in attracting additional trade-oriented investment.\n\n\u201cTo complement investment facilitation, Nigeria has to cut down on trade cost, infrastructure cost, linkage cost, regulatory cost, customs cost, basically, all costs associated with moving goods from tie factory or farm gate to the final consumer.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s trade costs are too high.

          "title": "With e-Transmission, Direct Primaries, Senate Gives Power Back to the People",
          "text": "\u2022Excitement over electronic transmission, many hail direct primaries as PDP kicks\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Juliet Akoje in Abuja and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nThe Senate, yesterday, yielded to intense public pressure to reverse its earlier decision to subject electronic transfer of results to the discretion of Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and gave the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) the sole right to the innovation. There was palpable excitement as many celebrated the Senate action as reassuring.\n\nAlso, despite appeals from different quarters, the upper chamber of the National Assembly, approved direct primaries for aspirants seeking election in all the registered political parties in the country.\n\nBy these decisions, however, the INEC has not only been empowered to electronically transmit election results, the Senate has also given power back to the people in the choice of their representatives at different levels of leadership.\n\nWhat these landmark decisions means is that apart from taking away attraction and concentration of power and influence from the state governors in the choice of who runs for what office, it might have dealt a huge blow to godfatherism factor from the power equation. What it all comes down to is that it gives power back to the electorate. It means people will simply go and queue behind the poster of the candidate they support. The votes are counted and result declared for all to see, It will effectively end imposition of unpopular candidates on the party by godfathers. It\u2019s like Option A4 all over again. For long, governors had wielded enormous influence of the parties and were the principal determinants of who runs and who doesn\u2019t. With direct primaries, they have lost that vital influence.\n\nReacting to the development, a former Vice President and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 election, Atiku Abubakar, commended the resolution of the disagreement between the National Assembly (NASS) and INEC on electronic transmission of election results.\n\nA press statement by the media office of the former Vice President on Tuesday, said the harmonisation of positions between the two institutions was an indication that Nigeria\u2019s democracy was growing and getting stronger.\n\nOn his part, Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike also lauded the National Assembly for its decision to allow the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), determine the use of electronic voting and transfer of results, but disagreed with the Senate on the issue of direct primaries.\n\nIn the same vein, a former Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, lauded the red chamber for heeding people\u2019s opinion by reversing itself on the contentious issue of electronic voting.\n\nBut, disappointed with some of the senate decisions, the PDP, yesterday, described the approval of direct primary for the nomination of candidates for election, in all political parties by the senate, as a retrogressive provision that sought to wipe off all the gains achieved in the electoral practice since 1999.\n\nThe Senate had shortly before proceeding on a two-month annual vacation on July 15, 2021, during the consideration of a report on the 2010 Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, submitted by its Committee on INEC, amended clause 52(3) as recommended.\n\nWhile the clause as presented in the committee report stated that INEC could transmit election results electronically, where and when practicable, the Senate had passed the amended version which stated that, \u201cINEC can transmit election results electronically subject to confirmation of Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) of adequacy and security of National Network.\u201d\n\nThe upper chamber in Clause 52 of the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill passed almost three months ago, had also approved that, \u201cthe Commission (INEC) may consider the electronic transmission of results, provided the national coverage is adjudged to be adequate and secure by the National Communications Commission and approved by the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nThe Senate, however, revisited the issue at yesterday\u2019s plenary sequel to the presentation of a motion by the Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, for the re-committal of some clauses of the Electoral Act No 6 2010 (Repeal and Re-enactment) Bill (SB122) to the Committee of the Whole.\n\nHe explained that the decision to subject the amended clauses of the bill to re-committal was reached after critical examination by the Senate Committee on INEC.\n\nHe added that some fundamental issues, which required fresh legislative action were observed by the Senator Kabiru Gaya-led Committee in the bill.\n\nSeconding the motion, Senator Adamu Alero, said the motion would strengthen the electoral process and give Nigerians more power to select their desired leaders.\n\nHe said the motion, if adopted would help the electorate to ensure that questionable characters were not elected in governance.\n\nAccording to Alero, the motion would discourage money bags from taking over and determining the outcome of elections in the country.\n\nOn his part, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele cited Clause 87, which has to do with conduct of primaries, saying: \u201cDirect primary is a way of giving power to the people since every member will enjoy that right of selecting a candidate.\u201d\n\nHe said if democracy must grow, direct primary should be adopted.\n\nHe said the recommendation in Clause 87 (4) states that the guidelines for the conduct of the primary must be submitted to INEC, adding that sub-section 7 states that every aspirants shall be entitled to have a copy of the guideline at least 14 days to the primaries.\n\nSenator Smart Adeyemi, however, spoke against the amendment of Clause 87 to introduce direct primary election, saying the motion to amend the clause to introduce direct primaries would make the electoral process burdensome to the people.\n\nSenate Minority Leader, Senator Eyinnaya Abaribe said Clause 52 (3), which talked about electronic transmission of election results should be made clear for the electoral umpire to decide.\n\nHe said in the original bill, political parties were allowed to decide the mode for their primaries, adding that political parties who have the capacity to organise either a direct or indirect primaries should do so.\n\nAccording to him, the political parties may not have the financial capacity, because direct primaries will demand more money.\n\nThe Chamber thereafter went into the Committee of the Whole during which it passed the motion for re-committal by re-amending certain aspects of the bill contained in Clauses 43, 52, 63 and 87, respectively.\n\nThe Senate at the Committee of the Whole chaired by Dr. Ahmad Lawan, amended Clause 52(2) of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill to read: \u201cSubject to section 63 of this Bill, voting at an election and transmission of results under this Bill shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the Independent National Electoral Commission, which may include electronic voting.\u201d\n\nClause 87(1) of the Electoral Bill Amendment Bill, which was also passed as recommended states: \u201cA political party seeking to nominate candidates for elections under this Bill shall hold direct primaries for aspirants to all elective positions, which shall be monitored by the Independent National Electoral Commission.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Senate Conference Committee on the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, were expected to meet with their counterparts in the House of Representatives to harmonise the two versions passed by both chambers.\n\nAtiku Reacts, Says Civil Societies are Watchdogs of Public Policies, Institutions\n\nAtiku, in his reaction, said the harmonisation of positions between INEC and the National Assembly was an indication that Nigeria\u2019s democracy was growing and getting stronger.\n\nHe also commended individuals and groups particularly, the various pro-democracy advocacy groups that participated in the public discourse on the controversial issue, saying, \u201cby this outcome, I am convinced that public institutions in Nigeria will continue to play their roles as guardians of public policy.\n\n\u201cThe civil societies are the watchdogs of public policies and the institutions. Probably, we would not have come to this path without the active engagement of the civil society agents. This outcome should further encourage Nigerians and the civil society to do more in order to guarantee good governance in the country.\u201d\n\nWike Commends Senate on Electronic Transmission, Disagrees on Direct Primary\n\nWike, in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Mr Kelvin Ebiri, said the resolution of the National Assembly joint committee to allow the electoral umpire transmit election results electronically was a good development for Nigeria and democracy.\n\n\u201cI think it is a good news to hear that the Joint Committee of the House of Representatives and the Senate agreed for INEC to transmit result electronically. That is a good news to hear. As I have always said, what is important now is what do people want. The moment you do what the people want, you will see happiness everywhere.\n\n\u201cI think it is a good development for Nigeria and democracy. And I will urge them \u2013 the two chambers, the House of Representatives and the Senate \u2013 to abide by that recommendation by the joint committee of the two Chambers, because it is for their own interest.\n\n\u201cAnd I commend the Senate President and the Speaker, House of Representatives, all the principal officers and members who felt that they must listen to what is good for Nigeria and what is good for Nigerians. They must listen to the people.\n\nSpeaking further on the amendment of the Electoral Act, Wike disagreed with the Senate that parties must conduct direct primaries. He stated that the issue of direct or indirect primaries should be the exclusive decision of the political parties in the country.\n\nHe maintained that it will be unfair for the National Assembly to prescribe for political parties how to conduct their primaries.\n\n\u201cA party could adopt a method , procedure in electing who represent them at various level, that is not the for the National Assembly to dictate that you must do it by direct or indirect method. That is not democracy. That should be an internal affair of the party.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike insisted that National Assembly prescribing how political parties conduct their primaries is tantamount to interference in the internal politics of the parties.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly should realise that doing that is interfering in the internal politics of the parties and that will not augur well.\u201d\n\nThe governor also faulted the bill sponsored by the Deputy Senate President seeking for the establishment of two Nigerian Law School campuses in each of the six geopolitical zone.\n\nHe stressed that the proposal is not in tandem with current reality, as the existing Nigerian Law School campuses are grossly underfunded.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly have not been able to give them the money to fund the Law School, and you are saying they should establish two Law School in each zone.\u201d\n\nEkweremadu: Action Justifies Assurances to Nigerians\n\nEkweremadu, while commending the Senate for reversing itself on electronic transmission of results, said the action justified his assurances to Nigerians in July, that all hope was not lost for electronic transmission of 2023 election results despite the initial setback.\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Uche Anichukwu, Ekweremadu added: \u201cI want to specially commend the Senate for setting aside narrow partisan interests to correct the mistake of July 15, 2021 by reversing itself on the issue of electronic transmission of election results.\n\n\u201cThis clause, though not originally part of the Bill, was introduced by the Joint National Assembly Committee on the Independent National Electoral Commission, which I am part of, to save the nation the troubles of ballot box snatching, electoral violence, and manipulations that happen between the polling booth and collation centres.\n\n\u201cAlthough I was representing Nigeria at an international parliamentary session in Montenegro and therefore unavoidably absent during the passage of the Bill in July, I had assured Nigerians that we would work with the progressives across party lines to dialogue with our colleagues and other critical stakeholders to ensure that electronic transmission of results was restored in the Bill.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, heart-warming that my confidence in the capacity of my colleagues to dialogue and rise above narrow partisan interest on this matter was not misplaced. I must also commend the Civil Society Organisations and Nigerians for standing up for what is right for the nation and our democracy.\u201d\n\nPDP Warns Senate against Rolling Back Democratic Gains\n\nThe leadership of the PDP has said the decision by the APC-controlled Senate was a humongous blow to the development of democratic norms and a plot to introduce anarchy during internal party elections as currently obtainable in the APC.\n\nA statement by the party\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, held the view that the provision was aimed at increasing the costs of nomination procedures thereby surrendering the processes to money bags against the wishes and aspiration of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cOur party makes bold to state that with the exception of the APC, which intends to deploy looted funds in future election, hardly will there be any political party that will be able to raise the cost of conducting internal elections under a direct primary process.\n\n\u201cThis is why the decision of the Senate has elicited widespread rejection from Nigerians across board,\u201d the PDP said, urging the Senate to immediately deploy its appropriate legislative instrument to reverse itself on the direct primary as it was not operable and did not reflect the wishes and aspiration of majority of Nigerians.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Says timely dispensation of justice will enhance Nigeria\u2019s financial stability\n\nBy Alex Enumah\n\nThe Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad on Tuesday, said that the timely dispensation of justice will enhance financial stability in Nigeria.\n\nHe made the remarks while declaring open a Two-Day Workshop for Judicial Officers on Recent Reforms of Banking and Financial Services Law and Practice.\n\nThe workshop was organized by the National Judicial Institute (NJI) in collaboration with Juris Law and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nJustice Muhammad who stated that it is almost impossible to avoid disputes in commercial ventures, remarked that investors are more concerned about dispute resolution mechanism put in place to quickly resolve disputes that may arise in the course of business transactions between disputants.\n\nLamenting the length of time it takes to hear and decide a commercial case from trial court up to the Supreme Court, the CJN said that \u201cno investor will be happy to tie down his capital for an uncertain period of time, which may have been occasioned by commercial disputes bogged down in court\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe journey to the Supreme Court in a commercial dispute could last for as long as eight to twenty years.\n\n\u201cThis is quite disheartening and the effect of this is that the investment at stake or money in dispute would have depreciated in value such that the successful party would gain no benefit from the judgment\u201d.\n\nMuhammad however stated that if the judiciary must play its role in financial stability in Nigeria, cases of delay must be aggressively and frontally addressed so that parties will get justice at the end and the resultant effect of this will raise public confidence in the judiciary.\n\n\u201cIt suffices therefore to say at this point, that timely dispensation of justice by the judiciary is a critical factor that will enhance financial stability in Nigeria\u201d, he added.\n\nThe CJN further stated that the theme of the workshop: The Role of the Judiciary in Financial Stability in Nigeria is apposite, because it will sensitize and keep Judicial Officers abreast with new developments in this specialized area of banking law.\n\n\u201cThis workshop once again presents valuable opportunity to exchange ideas on the provisions of BOFIA 2020, as it seeks to promote a stronger, more transparent and efficient financial system in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, it represents a milestone, expected to boost investors\u2019 confidence.

B.

          "title": "202 Nigerian varsities, 11 female VCs \u2014 case for gender inclusion in HE headship",
          "text": "All through Nigeria\u2019s higher education (HE) history, it is surprisingly easy to keep a mental count of females that have been university vice-chancellors (VCs), unlike what is obtainable with men. As of October 2021, Nigeria has at least 11 incumbent women VCs of the 202 federal, state, and private institutions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClearly, women are underrepresented by a wide margin. Teaching in Nigeria, albeit largely male-dominated, boasts of many female practitioners. But this hardly extends to the headship of tertiary institutions in most cases. Why?\n\nVCs in Nigeria undergo a rigorous selection process. In federal and state varsities, pioneer VCs are appointed by fiat by the visitor, usually the president or state governor respectively. In private varsities, it\u2019s the proprietor. Ahead of subsequent appointments, a vacancy ad is put in newspapers six months to the end of the tenure of the incumbent.\n\nThe eligibility criteria are stated, many including a number of years of post-professorial qualification; academic and leadership qualifications; and experience in various capacities. The candidates are then shortlisted and interviewed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn many cases, like that which preceded the advent of Lilian Salami as VC of the Lagos State University (LASU), crisis due to vested interests, disagreements, and corruption claims by disgruntled factions might disrupt the process.\n\nFrom one perspective, the general shortage of women at the topmost managerial level of the system can account for why there are a few women VCs in Nigerian universities since not many female practitioners even make it up to the point where they have enough academic achievements to scale through the eligibility criteria when ads are put out. Another is the burden of nurturing a winning career while simultaneously catering to family life and motherhood.\n\nMany women distinguish themselves but more, perhaps, might assume they\u2019re not cut out for the stiff competition, strife, and internal politics that mark the selection process \u2014 not while they have children to raise and a home to keep. It can be argued that women in Nigeria\u2019s tertiary institution system have not been equally competitive and for good reasons too. Yet, one can\u2019t discount the place of Nigeria\u2019s context and the general perception of women as leaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFEMALE VCs IN NIGERIA AS OF OCTOBER 2021\n\nThe database of the National University Commission (NUC) accounts for 54 state, 49 federal, and 99 private universities. Of this number, at least 11 varsities are run by women.\n\nProf. Lilian Salami \u2014 University of Benin\n\nProf. Florence Obi \u2014 University of Calabar\n\nProf. Achilike Akah \u2014 Imo state University\n\nProf. Chinedum Babalola \u2014 Chrisland university\n\nProf. Elisabeta Olarinde \u2014 Afe Babalola University\n\nProf. Nnenna Oti \u2014 Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO)\n\nProf. Ibiyemi Olatunji-Bello \u2014 Lagos State University (LASU)\n\nKaletapwa G.

If you have 200 and just 10 are female, in that 10, most are entry-level academics. It\u2019s going to take time before we get to that level where we have many women at the top level. As it is now, no department can claim they have a gender balance in staff,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIn contesting the VC\u2019s seat, you can have 10 candidates but nine are men and only one is a woman. What are the odds of scaling through? We need to start from scratch, having a balanced workforce. We can have an intentional system that specifies male-female ratio in the university workforce. Maybe four slots for females and six for males.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn lecturing, men have more mentors but there\u2019s always the sexual assault fear for females. Many don\u2019t even want to put themselves in that position where they\u2019re very close to their superiors, It makes it harder. We\u2019re progressing since we now have women as directors in various capacities. It will take years. We just have to keep working hard.\u201d\n\nThe minimum entry-level into lecturing is a master\u2019s degree. Once married, many women are at the mercy of their husbands as to whether or not they can further their education.\n\nOn her part, Foluke Adeosun, a lecturer at Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti (ABUAD), argued that many men don\u2019t support their wives\u2019 ambition to climb the academic ladder, despite the high cost of postgraduate studies.\n\nWORKFORCE DISCRIMINATION, FAMILY COMMITMENTS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWomen are prone to be discriminated against on the basis of gender roles. Many employers prefer to employ men who wouldn\u2019t be absent due to circumstances created by family needs. For instance, the woman may be absent from work if her child takes ill; if she suffers morning sickness in pregnancy. She could also take time off to attend antenatal clinics and even ask for maternity leave. All these factors contribute to reduced employment numbers for women.\n\nSexism, misogyny, and a culture hostile to family commitments are some structural barriers aspiring female leaders in varsities go through. With these discouragements, Adeosun argued that there will be fewer women at the helms of affairs.\n\n\u201cI believe the VC\u2019s seat is highly political in public schools. This may not favour women. For private universities, it could be a 50/50 chance if the female candidate is qualified for the position and is willing to give full dedication to the job. The women-to-men ratio at the entry point is also a fact that can\u2019t be ruled out,\u201d the sociology lecturer said.\n\nIt is one thing to identify the challenges but do varsity stakeholders consider this a problem that needs fixing?\n\nA source within the NUC, when asked if the regulatory body has a framework for gender inclusion in staffing, said decisions bordering on this lie with respective varsity authorities who announce vacancies, not the commission.\n\nAjagun suggested that NUC can have guidelines and policies in what she termed a system of slots to better the odds.\n\nBENEFITS, PROSPECTS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nApart from the gain of leadership style that accompanies female headship of universities, it is a no-brainer that economically and socially disempowered women bear negative consequences for the global fight against poverty.\n\nGender equality in the varsity workforce mirrors the progress toward gender inclusion in postgraduate education so much so that more female PG candidates will mean more women qualified for such leadership positions as the VCs.\n\nResearch has associated companies that shifted from a corporate structure composed of no women to 30 percent women with a 15 percent increase in profitability. On how this translates to the university system, Lilian Salami, the VC of the University of Benin (UNIBEN), said: \u201cWomen drive the system with so much passion and emotion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also the subtle pressure to deliver and not fail. Whether you like it or not, we are in a society that is still male-dominated and chauvinistic. The woman is also put under some level of pressure to be sure that she delivers and does not fail. It also means a lot as you mentor a lot of girls with many more looking up to you,\u201d the VC added.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the numbers, we\u2019ve gradually crossed from one. There was a time that we didn\u2019t even have any female VC in Nigeria. So between the state, private universities, and federal, we\u2019ve gone over 14. We\u2019re doing very well. For me, it\u2019s the right thing to do. We\u2019re coming. We haven\u2019t gotten there but there is hope that we will. It takes time.\u201d\n\nThe place of intentional and solution-oriented policies to tackle the prevalent gender imbalance in appointments cannot be overstated. Orientation for all stakeholders and acknowledging imbalance as a problem will also help.\n\nWomen, husbands, fathers, employers and the government must be actively involved in changing the narrative of females being at the mercy of men. Women must be more empowered with scholarships if willing to further their studies. Employers should also begin to give equal opportunities to both men and women. All hands must be on deck.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This report was updated to include Adenike Kuku of Kings University, Odeomu, Osun state \u2014 bringing the captured number of female VCs to 11.\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

          "title": "Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber",
          "text": "In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nAccording to court documents, the contract stipulated that the plaintiffs would transport Uber\u2019s Kenya customer base at a minimum of $0.54 per kilometre, with a minimum fare of $2.71. Under this agreement, Uber Kenya Limited retained a 25% cut of overall profits from each ride.\n\nIn July 2016, Uber reduced the minimum rate per kilometre to $0.32 and the minimum fare to $1.81 per trip. This, claimed the drivers-turned-plaintiffs, was a breach of contract that left them unable to earn profits as Uber drivers and maintain vehicles purchased to adhere to Uber standards.\n\nUber Kenya Limited had a different story. They claimed that the group of 34 drivers had not entered into contracts with them but had done so with Uber BV, a private LLC registered in Amsterdam. Because of this, Uber Kenya Limited said they were not liable for the breach of contractual obligations.\n\nAfter years-long litigation in the High Court of Kenya, during which the drivers fought to prove that Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV are one and the same, the High Court of Kenya has finally issued its ruling on the issue this week highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry.\n\nThe Corporate Veil\n\nUber BV is an Amsterdam-based company that owns the rights to the Uber app. Uber Kenya Limited acts as a subsidiary that contracts Uber drivers in Kenya. While Uber BV claimed it was a separate entity from Uber Kenya Limited, the High Court of Kenya concluded that there was an intricate link between both companies.\n\nEvidence presented to the court revealed that the group of Ubers shared the same email address and hired the same council to litigate disputes in court.\n\nThis, stated Milimani court justice, Francis Tuiyott, lifted the \u201ccorporate veil\u201d off of the conglomerate, making Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV liable to the plaintiffs.\n\nUber and Its Drivers\n\nUber, as a company, maintains the claim that it does not employ drivers but acts as an intermediary between the drivers and clients. This murky relationship has landed the company in court cases across the world.\n\nIn April, a group of South African lawyers partnered with a UK law firm to file a class action suit against Uber that would force the company to recognise drivers as employees with benefits rather than independent contractors.\n\nUber has also been in and out of UK courts over how it classifies its drivers. In February, the company finally agreed to treat drivers as workers after losing in front of the Supreme Court. More recently, The Court of Amsterdam struck down Uber\u2019s intermediary status ruling that drivers are, in fact, employed by the company.\n\nIn Kenya, the line between Uber as an intermediary and employer becomes even blurrier.\n\nUber employed over 12,000 drivers in Kenya as of November 2020. While some of Uber\u2019s fleet owns their vehicles, many do not.\n\nDrivers who cannot afford their own cars are employed by private sub-contracted companies that run their own group of cars. Others act as private chauffeurs whose employers allow them to drive their vehicles as Ubers between pickups.\n\nThis sub-contracted third-party relationship means that returns to Uber drivers in Kenya are even lower than the cut they receive from Uber itself.\n\nFuel to the Fire\n\nAdding to reduced incomes are Kenya\u2019s ongoing petrol price hikes that have placed fuel prices in Kenya at a historic high.\n\nDavid Muteru, Chairman of the Digital Taxis Association of Kenya, claims that after the fuel price hike, Uber failed to cushion the financial blow for drivers\n\n\u201cThey did not raise fares. Instead, they introduced new cheaper products,\u201d said Muteru in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Muteru claims he has been deactivated from the Uber app as a result of his activism.\n\nUber has consistently lowered its prices to suit the needs of the Kenyan market. For over two months, the rideshare app has been offering weekly 25% discounts to loyal customers, competing against Bolt who is also making inroads in the Kenyan market. The reduction in fare is then shirked to the driver.\n\nBottoms Up\n\nUber cannot be blamed for this alone. Its strategies in rapidly expanding African cities are permitted by policymakers who see Uber\u2019s entry as a red stamp of approval for on-track development. The ability for a city to Uber everywhere also delays the need to address and urgent need for reliable public transportation.\n\nKenya\u2019s Uber drivers recognise the company\u2019s important presence in the nation\u2019s transport infrastructure. David Muteru and his colleagues do not want an all-out ban of Uber in Kenya but better regulation that yields a more transparent relationship between the company and its contracted drivers.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s opaque,\u201d said Muteru of the current situation. \u201cUber should start by recognition of driver representation from registered bodies\u2026the end goal is compensation for losses incurred\u201d.\n\nBut, will it be worth it in the long run? While powerhouses like Uber can keep up in a foot race, local tech companies with little capital in their early stages cannot. If this trend continues, large multinationals may price out drivers, as well as local tech companies hoping to cash in on Kenya\u2019s digital revolution.\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author",

          "text": "In 2013, M-Pesa, Africa\u2019s largest mobile money platform, was faced with a major challenge: Its users couldn\u2019t settle insurance premiums and make bank payments in real-time. Payments made to Kenya Power took 48 hours before reflecting in the company\u2019s systems; other payments, like the one to the National Hospital Insurance Fund, experienced longer delay times, often taking three days before they were acknowledged.\n\nAmong the many reasons for these lengthy settlements and transfer times was the fact that M-Pesa\u2019s mobile money platform could only handle between 200 to 300 transactions per second. But that needed to increase by at least tenfold to make transactions more seamless.\n\nDesperate for a way out, the Vodacom and Safaricom-owned M-Pesa turned to Chinese tech giant Huawei, which helped migrate M-Pesa\u2019s 12.8 million active users over the space of 18 months to a better-performing mobile money platform.\n\nEight years later, M-Pesa has scaled operations to cater for its 50 million active users in the seven African countries it operates in \u2013 Kenya, Tanzania, Lesotho, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Mozambique and Egypt. It now processes over a billion transactions every month.\n\nMostly working in the background, Beijing Murong Technology, a Chinese financial software company, also collaborated with Huawei over the years to introduce some features to M-Pesa.\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\n\n\nSuccess begets success\n\nM-Pesa\u2019s success meant that when Ethiopia\u2019s state-owned telecoms company Ethio telecom decided to build the country\u2019s first mobile money platform, TeleBirr, they turned to Huawei.\n\nLaunched in May 2021, TeleBirr caters to the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. In just two months since its launch, TeleBirr has added six million users to its mobile payment system without a hitch.\n\nFor Huawei, these feats highlight its shift from providing solely telecommunications infrastructure to now providing its network customers with technology to run mobile payment applications in as many as 19 African countries. Encouraged by its accomplishments, Huawei also recently announced its intention to build an innovation and research centre in Tunisia, head of the company\u2019s North Africa region.\n\nThe success of M-Pesa and Telebirr has enhanced Huawei\u2019s reputation as the poster child for China\u2019s enterprising tech sector. Meanwhile, the collaboration between Huawei and Beijing Murong Technology highlights a bigger trend: Beyond building bridges, rail lines, airports and roads across the continent, Chinese companies are increasingly building digital infrastructures in Africa.\n\nWhy Africa? The African market offers Chinese companies and investors a growing young population expected to reach 1.7 billion by 2030. Presently, about 50% of this growing population is excluded from the financial system and less than 40% have access to the internet. This presents a massive opportunity to boost financial inclusion and connectivity.\n\nThe indispensable player\n\nThe presence of tech companies like Huawei and ZTE in Africa dates back to the 1990s. Their expansion to Africa was fueled by the desire to fill a vacuum left by the growing disinterest by Western companies and countries to invest in Africa. These Chinese tech companies decided to establish a stronger presence in Africa despite the political and economic instability. In the long run, this move has paid off and the results are glaring.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that you wouldn\u2019t have a thriving African tech ecosystem today without the Chinese,\u201d said Eric Olander, Managing Editor of the Chinese Africa Project, a media organisation dedicated to exploring every aspect of China\u2019s engagement with Africa.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese were not there, Africa would be 15 years behind at least. Think about it, about 50% of the phones in Africa are controlled by one company: Transsion.\u201d\n\nOlander cites the success of Transsion, Africa\u2019s leading mobile phone maker which went public on a $7 billion valuation, and more recently Opay, a fintech platform with over 5 million users, which raised $400 million at a $2 billion valuation from investors like Softbank.\n\n\u201cThese Chinese companies are challenging the assumption that you can\u2019t make money in Africa and that the African tech ecosystem isn\u2019t really that big.\u201d\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\nBeyond just making money, once these Chinese companies strike gold, they go on to invest in other upcoming Chinese startups. In 2018, Transsion led a $40 million seed investment in PalmPay, a digital payment service, with participation from China\u2019s NetEase and Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek. PalmPay offers peer-to-peer money transfers, airtime purchase and bill payments in Nigeria and Ghana with plans to expand to other African countries.\n\nRiding on Transsion\u2019s wings, in 2020, PalmPay came pre-installed on about 20 million units of Transsion phone brands \u2013 Tecno, Infinix and itel. Likewise, from June 2021, Huawei Mobile Kenya users were able to make in-app purchases via M-Pesa.\n\nChinese tech giant, Alibaba Group, hasn\u2019t been left out of the action. Its online and mobile payment platform Alipay collaborated with Vodacom to develop VodaPay, a super app positioned to drive financial inclusion and economic growth in South Africa. In June 2021, VodaPay was unveiled, with 70 companies already signed up on it.\n\nNotably, Wapi Pay, a Singapore-based Kenyan fintech startup powering the Africa-Asia cross-border payment, uses Huawei\u2019s mobile money services. An indication that contemporary fintech startups are also relying on Chinese tech.\n\n\u201cChinese technology is the foundational technology in Africa. I call it the indispensable player in the African tech space. You take the Chinese piece out and African tech falls apart,\u201d Olander said.\n\nCaution, concerns and the reality\n\nThe proliferation of Chinese enterprises in Africa has attracted a great deal of scepticism from academics, policymakers and other observers in recent years. Of particular concern is the relationship between Chinese companies and the Chinese communist party as well as how the data from Africa is used.\n\nJili Bulelani, a South African researcher at Havard with research interests in Africa-China relations, is concerned about this.\n\n\u201cThe question a lot of the time is how deep Chinese companies like Huawei are involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt some level, we can see them supporting fibre optics, cloud storage and mobile money projects. But there are questions around who owns this data and the legal ramifications around people securing themselves and their data.\u201d\n\nThese issues around data usage are worsened by the fact that there aren\u2019t effective data laws in Africa to protect its citizens. About 50% of countries on the continent don\u2019t have data protection laws backed by legislation.\n\nWhile Olander agrees that the answer to these questions about Huawei\u2019s practices is relatively opaque, partly because Huawei does not communicate well enough about this, he also clamours for a practical look at the situation.\n\nHe believes that, from a practical standpoint, African countries are better served by these Chinese companies because their products are cheaper and more tailored to the African market. Africa is a difficult place to do business, and as such, most African countries and companies are not in a strong negotiating position.\n\n\u201cWhen the Americans told the Kenyans that they should not use Huawei for 5G networks, the answer from Safaricom was, \u2018Okay, but what do we do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFor African countries, the choice at the end of the day is not between Nokia, Alcatel, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. Oftentimes, it\u2019s between Huawei and nothing.\u201d\n\nHe also points out that the accusations against Huawei aren\u2019t about the performance of their products and services. A testament to the fact that they make quality products that meet the needs of their clients.\n\nHenry Tugendhat, a senior policy analyst with the China team at the US Institute of Peace, is of the opinion that if Africans are really concerned about cybersecurity then they have to start with the assumption that everybody is interested in our data and communications.\n\n\u201cUntil African countries manufacture their own equipment, they\u2019ll always be susceptible to international organisations having access to their data,\u201d Tugendhat said. \u201cTo manage the situation it\u2019s going to come down to how African countries can legislate and how they enforce that legislation.\u201d\n\nIs there room for competition?\n\nDespite the immense contribution of Chinese tech to the African fintech space, there\u2019s still room for growth. Per the GSMA report 2020, less than 50% of the African population have a phone. This pales in comparison with the US (81%) or even China (63%).\n\nThe race is still on for the different players building digital infrastructure for the African fintech space. Iginio Gagliardone, author of China, Africa, and the Future of the Internet is of the opinion that there might not be much room left for competition in the next few years.\n\n\u201cChina tends to approach projects with a longer time horizon. With it making headway in the physical and digital infrastructure space, it could use its pervasiveness to lock in standards against competitors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they keep creating at this momentum, it\u2019ll be difficult to unbundle and pull the plug. I\u2019m a bit more worried about the future,\u201d Gagliardone added.\n\nIn the past decade, China has become a central player in Africa\u2019s development. Having a strong Chinese presence in African tech has clearly been very beneficial; a monopolistic dominance is what\u2019s worrying.\n\nTechCabal contacted Huawei for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate",
          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at a leading e-commerce company,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "At the first virtual Google for Africa event today, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made huge strides together over the past decade \u2014 but there\u2019s more work to do to make the internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d Sundar Pichai said.\n\nTo provide affordable internet access in Africa, Google is building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Its subsea cable Equiano will run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena and connect the continent with Europe.\n\nAs part of Google\u2019s commitment to supporting Black-led startups in Africa, the company announced the launch of an Africa Investment Fund. Through this fund, it will invest $50M in startups and provide them with access to Google\u2019s employees, network, and technologies to help them build meaningful products for their communities. This is in addition to Google\u2019s existing support through the Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, which has helped more than 80 African startups with equity-free finance, working space and access to expert advisors over the last three years.\n\n\u201cI am so inspired by the innovative African tech startup scene. In the last year we have seen more investment rounds into tech startups than ever before,\u201d Nitin Gajria, Managing Director for Google in Africa said.\n\n\u201cI am of the firm belief that no one is better placed to solve Africa\u2019s biggest problems than Africa\u2019s young developers and startup founders. We look forward to deepening our partnership with, and support for, Africa\u2019s innovators and entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nTo cater for small businesses and entrepreneurs, Google is collaborating with non-profit organisation Kiva to provide $10M in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa get through the economic hardship created by COVID-19.\n\nNonprofits haven\u2019t been left out of this, Google.org is expanding its commitment to support nonprofits working to improve lives across Africa, with an additional $40M to help more partners organisations. In the case of the Airqo team at Makerere University, who use AI and sensors to monitor poor air quality, a leading cause of premature death. Google is providing $3M in new grant funding to expand this pioneering work from Kampala across 10 cities in 5 countries on the continent.\n\nThe announcement of the $1bn investment is commendable and a testament to Google\u2019s commitment to supporting digital transformation in Africa. Since 2017, Google has trained 6 million young Africans and businesses in digital skills. Google has also supported more than 50 nonprofits across Africa with over $16 million of grants and enabled 100 million more Africans to access internet services for the first time through Android.\n\nShare this article\n\nAdegoke Oyeniyi | Author @seunadegoke01",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTen years is a long time, and in the startup scene, it can often seem like forever. In the nine years since its founding, Savannah Fund-backed startups have raised follow-on funding of over $200 million. Techpoint Africa caught up with Mbwana Alliy, the firm\u2019s Managing Partner and chatted on what drives the firm\u2019s investments and future plans.\n\nBefore starting Savannah Fund, Alliy, an electrical and communications engineer and Stanford MBA graduate, worked as a software and aerospace systems engineer for several technology companies in Silicon Valley and the United Kingdom, including Microsoft and the UK\u2019s Defense Evaluation Research Agency.\n\nHe cut his teeth as an investor while working as an associate at i/o Ventures, an early-stage seed fund. He helped source deals, incubate startups, and provide strategic directions for the venture\u2019s portfolio companies.\n\nHis experience at these organisations allowed him to observe developments in Africa\u2019s tech industry. This opportunity showed him the difficulty founders face in getting early-stage capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTogether with Paul Bragiel, Savannah Fund\u2019s General Partner and a partner at i/o Ventures, he started the firm in 2012. Initially an accelerator, the firm hosted startup cohorts for three months, culminating in a $30,000 investment. In 2016, it fully transitioned to a VC firm supporting early-stage startups.\n\nWhat the firm looks for in startups\n\nSavannah Fund invests between $100,000 and $250,000 in startups, and Alliy shares what they like to see in the founders they back. The first requirement is having at least one technical solid co-founder on the team. With both partners having technical backgrounds, this does not come as a surprise.\n\n\u201cIn my experience, the best startups have strong engineering teams. Aerobotics and Smile Identity (portfolio companies) have strong engineering teams. We are seeing more and more startups that could work without a technical CTO, but that is something that we like.\u201d\n\nThe market size the startup is pursuing is another factor the firm considers. \u201cWe like to go after frontier markets where there\u2019s not much going on. That\u2019s why I like Ethiopia right now. It\u2019s quite disconnected from the rest of Africa, and with a hundred million people, it\u2019s a big market.\u201d\n\nIn addition to a big market, the firm also favours startups with the potential to scale across Africa and go global. Two of the companies in its portfolio \u2013 Aerobotics and FlexClub \u2013 have expanded outside Africa; the former operates in the United States while the latter has launched in Mexico.\n\nIn March, the firm brought the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Women\u2019s Finance Initiative (WeFi) on board as investors in their second fund. This has affected the firm\u2019s investment policy, emphasising female founders/teams and issues around environmental, social, and governance (ESG).\n\nAlliy discloses that about 46% of the startups in their portfolio have at least one female founder or a female CEO. In addition, he encourages startups in their portfolio, especially those in the logistics sector, to adopt sustainable practices. Governance is another area the firm takes seriously, but he cautions that timing is crucial in instituting corporate governance.\n\nMore than money\n\nA major effect of the success enjoyed by African startups is that more investors are itching to get a piece of the pie. However, this also means that founders need strategic partners who bring more than money to the table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSavannah Fund is well-placed to offer founders a lot more than money. Alliy and Bragiel have extensive contacts in the US, having worked there previously. Also, Bragiel is a partner at Golden Gate Ventures, a Singaporean VC firm that has invested in startups like Stripe and AngelList.\n\nPortfolio companies and failures\n\nSome of the startups in Savannah Fund\u2019s portfolio include lending startup, Lidya, identity management startup, Smile Identity, eCommerce startup, Supermart.ng, logistics startup, Sendy, Ugandan gaming company, Kola Studios, and edtech startup, Eneza Education. So far, none of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies has failed.\n\nHowever, Alliy reveals that most of the startups from the firm\u2019s accelerator days failed.\n\nPitfalls for startups to avoid\n\nAlliy believes that focus is vital for startups, especially at the early stages when they may not have as much freedom to experiment. \u201cI see too many startups trying to do too much, too quickly, too early. A focus on the next step is very important.\u201d\n\nHe also advises that founders build to solve problems they care about and not for investors.\n\nWhile speaking with Alliy, his pride in those who work or have worked with him is evident. One such person is Malaika Judd, Co-Founder and CFO at Sendy, a logistics platform. Before joining Sendy, she was a mentor at Savannah Fund, leading the firm\u2019s investment in Nigerian logistics company, African Courier Express (ACE).\n\nDespite being Tanzanian, Savannah Fund has not funded any Tanzanian startup; Alliy hopes to change this soon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not made any investments in Tanzania because the previous governments have not been friendly towards startups. Hopefully, that changes soon. Investing in a Tanzanian startup would be my proudest moment,\u201d he remarks with a laugh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The report is in line with Techpoint Africa\u2018s mission of democratising the African technology narrative\n\nIntelligence by Techpoint \u2014 the data and research arm of Techpoint Africa \u2014 has since released 12 editions of NSFR and the West African Startup Decade Report (WASDR) within the last three and a half years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil this moment, only the first three editions of NSFR were available for free but after rethinking the ultimate vision of Techpoint \u2014 becoming the information warehouse for everything startups, technology, and innovation on the continent, we have decided to make all our reports available for free, starting with the WASDR and NSFR Q1 2021.\n\nFor believing in the Intelligence by Techpoint dream\n\nI\u2019d like to use this opportunity to once again appreciate brands and individuals that have believed in the Intelligence by Techpoint dream.\n\nFuture Hub and SUNRYSE believed in the dream enough to work with us in translating WASDR to Mandarin and Japanese editions respectively. They also played a major role in the campaign and marketing of the report alongside the likes of Statista, Crunchbase, and Maxime Bayen.\n\nThe WASDR is our most expensive report to date but people still believed in our work enough to make a purchase. These people are getting part of the credit for making the decade report available for free. Some of them who accepted to be mentioned are Odunayo Eweniyi (co-founder, PiggyVest and FirstCheck Africa), and Salient Advisory.\n\nOn the part of NSFR, we have subscribers of the paid editions in three digits: it would have been nice to mention you all but that would be a very long list.\n\nBeyond making all our past reports available for free, most (if not all) of our subsequent reports will also be available for free as well. And we will be working with brands, as sponsors, to make them available for free. A couple of these are already in the works and would be released before the year runs out.\n\nTo every brand and person mentioned above (and those not mentioned), we say thank you for believing in the Techpoint Africa dream once again. Do note that this decision doesn\u2019t imply that we are abandoning the Intelligence by Techpoint dream. The only change is that we will be releasing only a single annual edition of the Nigerian Startup Funding Report.\n\nMeanwhile, we will keep our subscribers up-to-date on funding activities in the country, and Africa by extension, as well as other relevant activities, through our monthly newsletter that was started earlier in the year. Kindly follow this link to subscribe to the monthly newsletter.

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nLab testing at your doorstep\n\nKlasha\u2019s Ghanaian expansion\n\nSudan\u2019s first tech investment in over 25 years\n\nHealthtracka wants to bring lab testing to your doorstep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R: Ifeoluwa Dare-Johnson & Victor Amusan, Healthtracka Co-founders\n\nThe death of a loved one is often a life-changing event. While it drives some to despair, others are inspired to create solutions that ensure a better survival rate for more people.\n\nIfeoluwa Dare-Johnson falls into the second category. She started healthtech startup, Healthtracka, following the avoidable death of her father from several illnesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Healthtracka does: Easing the process of conducting laboratory tests, the startup allows people to get tested without leaving their homes or offices.\n\nHow does this work? Phlebotomists visit the patient at home or the office where they take samples required for the test. These samples are then sent to laboratories where the tests are carried out and results sent to patients via email.\n\nAt what cost: The average pricing for a test costs \u20a615,000 ($37). While this may be expensive for most Nigerians, if you live in Lagos, Nigeria \u2014 where the startup launched \u2014 this might be a small price to pay for the inconvenience that comes with leaving your house.\n\nDare-Johnson, however, hopes that they can carry out tests at cheaper costs as Healthtracka grows.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, no more spoilers; here\u2019s a link to the full story on our website. Also, while you\u2019re here, please share this newsletter with anyone you know.\n\nKlasha launches in Ghana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJessica Anuna, Klasha\u2019s Founder\n\nCross-border payment startup, Klasha, has launched in Ghana. Last week, the startup announced its $2.4 million seed investment led by Greycroft. At the time, the startup hinted at possible expansion plans into three African countries.\n\nWith this announcement, Ghana opens the floor, with two more coming soon.\n\nJessica Anuna, CEO of Klasha, believes that its expansion into Ghana will make it easier for residents of the West African country to shop online. \u201cBefore now, international online and offline businesses faced the challenge of accepting online payments from Africa and even delivering items to Ghana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur solution will simplify the process, removing payment and last-mile delivery barriers, making it easier and faster for retailers to collect online payments in Ghana, manage payouts and expand seamlessly.\u201d\n\nThe Ghana expansion also comes with more functionalities for users, with the ability to send and receive money between Ghana and Nigeria. And access to a multi-currency wallet, giving them the option to hold, exchange, and send money in different currencies at the best rate for free.\n\nSudan gets its first foreign investment in over 25 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarneem Nina Saeed, CEO of alsoug. Source: Technext\n\nSome news from Sudan. Yes, Sudan. Egyptian payments company, Fawry has announced its investment in alsoug, Sudan\u2019s largest online classifieds marketplace, to help build out the latter\u2019s new fintech platform, Cashi.\n\nThis is part of a $5 million investment in alsoug by Fawry and other investors and is symbolic as it marks the first foreign funding in Sudan in over 25 years.\n\nWhat does alsoug do? The company allows Sudanese consumers to buy and sell products and services, including real estate, furniture, and electronics. The platform reportedly has had nearly two million app downloads since its launch in 2016.\n\nFawry CEO, Eng. Ashraf Sabry said, \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to be kicking off our partnership with alsoug, one of Sudan\u2019s most exciting prospects and a Sudanese leader in tech innovation. This is our first investment foray outside of Egypt in our thirteen years of operation, and we\u2019re confident that our story with alsoug and Cashi will be a special one.\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean? After being isolated for over 25 years, the investment into alsoug could prove to be a watershed moment in Sudan\u2019s startup space, coming at a time when there is increased interest in African startups. With a population of 43.8 million, Sudan represents a large market for any startup to play in.\n\nHowever, the country\u2019s unstable political climate could be a deciding factor in investors\u2019 minds. Therefore, all eyes would be on alsoug as its success or lack could encourage or discourage further investment in the country.\n\nTarneem (Nina) Saeed, alsoug\u2019s co-founder and CEO, shares these sentiments. \u201cThis investment marks a significant milestone not just for alsoug, but for the nascent tech space in Sudan as a whole, which has until today been essentially shut out of the global capital markets. I hope this investment is the first of many and that the huge potential of the tech sector in Sudan is fully realised in the coming years.\u201d\n\nP.S.

          "text": "Five global investors are putting their money where their mouth is by championing bold ideas in Nigerian startups, a development that is expected to boost more innovations in Nigeria\u2019s technology sector.\n\nIn a bid to leverage on the huge potentials in Nigeria\u2019s tech sector, Tiger Global, SoftBank, Valar Ventures, Target Global, and Avenir Growth alongside other investors have contributed a significant portion of the over $850 million raised by tech startups in Q3 of 2021.\n\nA quest for resource deployment, a proliferation of fintech services across Africa and the opportunities that abound in the sector, among others are the reasons for these investments in Nigerian startups.\n\nThese are the top five of the highest investors for 2021.\n\nSoftBank\n\nSoftBank Group, a Japanese company with its headquarters in Minato, Tokyo was founded by Masayoshi Son. The group primarily invests in companies operating in the technology, energy, and financial sectors.\n\nA first-time investor in Africa, the group led an Africa-focused fintech company OPay to raise $400 million in new funding in August. This round marked the fund\u2019s first investment in an African startup.\n\nIn September, the group also led a $200 million Series E round for Andela, another African startup with operations in Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya, making both startups unicorn companies.\n\nRead also: Why Nigerian big companies scramble for commercial paper\n\nTiger Global\n\nThe American hedge fund started operations in March 2001 and focuses on public and private companies in the global Internet, software, consumer, and financial technology industries. This year, the company has co-led fundings of startups to close several series\u2019 rounds, which include Fairmoney, a Nigerian credit-led neobank, to raise $42 million Series B round in July and $170 million Series C raised by Nigerian-owned Flutterwave in March.\n\nFounded by Chase Coleman, Tiger Global has since 2003 invested in over 100 companies across more than 30 countries, including investments ranging from Series A to pre-initial public offering (IPO), having won bets on companies like Facebook and LinkedIn.\n\nAvenir Growth Capital\n\nA New York-based private equity firm co-led the $170 million Series C round by Flutterwave in March.\n\nAvenir Growth Capital is a private investment firm based in New York, founded in 2017 with a focus to invest in future-focused growth equity firms, backing category-defining technology and technology-enabled companies.\n\nValar Ventures\n\nValar Ventures invests in high-margin, fast-growing technology companies that are pursuing huge market opportunities. The company started its journey in investing in African startups with Nigerian Kuda Bank leading the $25 million Series A in the fintech company in March, and a co-lead in the $55 million Series B funding in August.\n\nValar Ventures, founded in 2010 by Andrew McCormac, with founding partners which include James Fitzgerald and Peter Thiel, has helped Kuda Bank raise $80 million across two rounds.\n\nTarget Global\n\nA Berlin-based venture capital firm founded in 2012 by Alex Frolov has 70 percent of its funds invested in Europe-based startups and 20 percent to startups in Israel, has committed the remaining 10 percent to emerging startups in Africa.\n\nThe company invests in early-stage ventures, late-stage ventures, and seed rounds.\n\nBeing a first-time investor in Africa, Nigerian Kuda bank is one of such emerging startups and has enjoyed lead funding from Target Global in one of its last three rounds, and co-led in two of the rounds this year.\n\n$25 million Series A round in March 2021 and the $55 million Series B in August.",

          "text": "After cleaning her teary eyes, Jenifer Abbas arranged more firewood to intensify the flame under her pot. She looked tired and sick, but could not quit her business. She has run the food business for over 25 years, alternating between firewood and cooking gas.\n\nAbbas, who resides in Sabongida village, a community close to Nigeria\u2019s federal capital, battles chest pain and cough. She told BusinessDay that the incessant increase in the price of Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) also called cooking gas, has made life more difficult for her.\n\n\u201cI alternate between cooking gas and firewood because I have to factor my children\u2019s school fees into the business. The current rising price of cooking gas won\u2019t allow me to consider it as an option,\u201d Abbas said.\n\nShe added, \u201cThe little I make from my rice and beans sales are channelled into different responsibilities. With N200 firewood, I will prepare food for my customers for two days and make little money for the needs of my children.\u201d\n\nEunice Okon, a fruit seller and resident of Lagos State described as worrisome, the rising cost of cooking gas, which she said had made many go back to use of coal and firewood because kerosene was also expensive.\n\nAccording to Okon, it\u2019s becoming cheaper to cook with charcoal at N200 per bucket of paint than buying 3kg of cooking gas at N2,000 or 12.5kg at N7,500, excluding transportation.\n\n\u201cWith the way things are going, the cost of gas may rise to N1, 000 per kilogram by end of the year,\u201d she predicted.\n\nRead Also: Nigerians to expect further rise in cost of cooking gas as problem persists\n\nAina Babatunde, a taxi driver, said he abandoned his gas cooker for a charcoal stove. \u201cMany of us can\u2019t buy cooking gas anymore; the government should do something about it. The price keeps increasing every day.\u2019\u2019\n\nBusinessDay findings revealed that the price of LPG has increased five times in the last two months.\n\nFindings further showed that a 12.5kg cooking gas cylinder was sold in Lagos for N3,800 in October 2020; N4,500 in June and July 2021; N6,000 in September, and now N7,500 in Lagos and Ogun States, depending on locations.\n\nMajor fear among consumers and stakeholders is that the price may jump to N10, 000 soonest unless urgent steps are taken to increase local production and improve supply to the market.\n\nExperts blamed the price hike of LPG on the dearth of infrastructure, global shortfall in gas supply, inadequate local production, shortage of foreign exchange (Forex), devaluation of naira and logistic hitches.\n\n\u201cThe government need to review the recently introduced import charges and value-added tax (VAT), else the price of cooking gas may as well reach N10,000 for a 12.5kg cylinder,\u201d Bassey Essien, the executive secretary of Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers (NALPGAM) said at weekly e-discourse organised by a Platforms Africa.\n\nRecall that in September, oil marketers under the aegis of Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), protested the Federal Government\u2019s reintroduction of VAT on imported LPG.\n\nThey argued that the introduction of VAT to the already high price of gas which is largely imported due to the global gas crisis will negate the government\u2019s policy on the adoption of LPG.\n\nMembers of the association who are major stakeholders in the downstream sector of the oil industry asked the Federal Government to rescind its decision by removing the 7.5 percent VAT on the product, warning that the fee will hamper the adoption of gas in the country and create a barrier to the objectives of the \u2018Decade of Gas\u2019 agenda of the government.\n\n\u201cWe are also meeting with the marketers via moral suasion not to capitalise on the situation to inflict more pain on citizens by increasing the price of gas in their locations, though they are equally incurring a huge cost to have cooking gas at their locations,\u201d Essien said at the event.\n\nThe NALPGAM executive secretary also decried the gradual rise in the cost of cylinders over the years, maintaining that all the raw materials used by the two cylinder manufacturing plants in the country are imported.\n\nHe said despite Nigeria\u2019s over 200 million population, the country can hardly boost of 10 million cylinders in circulation, most of which are even substandard, a development that is forcing more households to other means of cooking.\n\nMost health experts say those cooking with firewood and charcoal are likely to develop Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a condition that makes breathing difficult. Also, children around the vicinity are particularly at risk of asthma.\n\nIn 2018, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said \u201ceach year, close to four million people die prematurely from illness attributable to household air pollution from inefficient cooking practices using polluting stoves paired with solid fuels.\u201d\n\nThe organisation also said that non-communicable diseases caused by firewood often lead to premature deaths due to stroke, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer.\n\nIn another report, WHO says smoke emanating from firewood used for cooking is the third greatest killer of women and children in Nigeria as no fewer than 98,000 Nigerian women die annually from smoke inhaled during cooking with firewood.",

This is opposed to representative participation (indirect system) where voters elect a body which in turn elects the candidate.\n\nWith the deployment of technology to electronically transmit results as the ballot is being cast by voters, the manipulations that usually attend to manual counting is expected to reduce.\n\nRead Also: At last, Senate backs INEC on electronic transmission of results\n\nThe effusive reaction by Nigerians to the Senate\u2019s volte face has expression in the belief that going forward, the integrity of the ballot, which had over the years been corrupted, making it difficult for votes to count in Nigeria, would now assume its pride of place.\n\nAt the plenary on Tuesday, the Senate took the decision, following the amendment of Clause 52(2) of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill at the Committee of the Whole chaired by Ahmad Lawan, the Senate president.\n\nThe amendment reads: \u201cSubject to section 63 of this Bill, voting at an election and transmission of results under this Bill shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the Independent National Electoral Commission, which may include electronic voting.\u201d\n\nClause 87(1) of the Electoral Amendment Bill, which was also passed as recommended, states: \u201cA political party seeking to nominate candidates for elections under this Bill shall hold direct primaries for aspirants to all elective positions, which shall be monitored by the Independent National Electoral Commission.\u201d\n\nIn July, during consideration of report on 2010 Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, submitted by its committee on INEC, the Senate had amended Clause 52(3) as recommended.\n\nWhile the clause as presented by the committee in the report says INEC can transmit election results electronically, where and when practicable, the Senate passed the amended version which says: \u201cINEC can transmit election results electronically subject to confirmation of Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) of adequacy and security of national network.\n\nWhile considering the amendment of the Electoral Act in July, the House of Representatives passed Clause 52, allowing INEC the discretion to decide whether to transmit election results electronically, but the Senate said the clause was amended to allow the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to decide on where and when electronic voting and electronic transmission of results should take place.\n\nReacting to the resolution Tuesday, a former vice president of Nigeria and presidential candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 election, Atiku Abubakar said: \u201cBy this outcome, I am convinced that public institutions in Nigeria will continue to play their roles as guardians of public policy.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe harmonisation of positions between the two institutions was an indication that Nigeria\u2019s democracy was growing and getting stronger.\u201d\n\nLanre Isa-Onilu, a former APC national publicity secretary from Kwara, North-Central, said the lawmakers had done what was expected of them.\n\n\u201cSince they have done what was expected from them. The National Assembly can\u2019t legislate on everything, it is to provide a legal framework on challenges facing INEC, rather than hold INEC down in a certain direction. If that was done it would have boxed the commission to a corner,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis development would help to see that credible elections are conducted in Nigeria. I am happy for the development from the Senate,\u201d Isa-Onilu said.\n\nMonday Ubani, chairman, NBA SPIDEL, described the development as a step forward for the country.\n\nAccording to Ubani, \u201cIt would minimise human interference in elections in Nigeria and restore voters\u2019 confidence. Though it may not stop electoral fraud because politicians are the ones causing the problems because of what they get from the system, it would go a long way to sanitise the system. I think they have realised their error; we should commend them this time around.\u201d\n\nChekwas Okorie, a former leader of the United Progressives Party (UPP), who joined the All Progressives Congress (APC) last year, said: \u201cIs the way to go with the issues we have now with conducting elections in Nigeria. Nigerians would be the final benefits of this new development and the benefits would be immense. You would see that unpopular candidates who often manipulate the system in their favour would be checked and confidence would be restored to the electoral process.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis is something I have canvassed since 2012; with this, votes would count. Anything that does not come within the approved result would not be valid except the original results. The development would also gradually restore voter confidence in the system. We have voter apathy in the country now, part of the problem is that people don\u2019t believe their votes would count based on experience in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope they can start with the Anambra gubernatorial election. But we need to begin to carry out voter education on what this means for our democracy.\u201d\n\nMark Adebayo, co-national spokesperson, Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), lauded the decision, saying that \u201cThe fundamental implication is that it would infuse public confidence in the electoral processes. Electronic transmission of results is a popular demand by Nigerians. The fact that the Senate earlier attempted to assume a role in our electoral processes by attempting to compromise INEC\u2019s independence and sole authority on electoral matters was seen as an unacceptable abnormality by the generality of Nigerians and was vehemently resisted. INEC says it can transmit electronically, why should the Senate use analgesics for another person\u2019s headache?\u201d\n\nSanni Yabagi, national chairman of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), said: \u201cIt is a victory for democracy in Nigeria; we have joined the list of nations progressing and the future of their country secured.\n\n\u201cIt would lay the foundation for credible leadership that would be responsible to the people. Now, it is up to us as Nigerians to reject the politics of money; not allowing money to influence where you vote.\u201d\n\nINEC had at various fora insisted it had the capacity to deploy the technology contrary to the story that was being told by the Senate.\n\nLast Sunday, Tunde Bakare, serving overseer of The Citadel Global Community Church, while speaking on the state of the nation in Lagos, wondered why the National Assembly refused to okay electronic transmission of results by INEC.\n\n\u201cIn this highly connected 21st century, we have absolutely no excuse to condone the retrogressive resolution passed by the National Assembly with the collusion of the Nigerian Communications Commission; we have absolutely no excuse to reject the electronic transmission of election results,\u201d he said.\n\nBakare wondered: \u201cWho, if I may ask, is afraid of free, fair and credible elections? Who is afraid of efficiently conducted elections? Who is afraid of the voice of the millennials and the youth of this nation?\u201d\n\nReacting to the development, yesterday, INEC said it has developed adequate structures and processes to successfully undertake electronic transmission of results.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the technology and national infrastructure in the country at the moment are adequate to support it.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s not forget that the subsisting law stipulating manual collation of results has neither been repealed nor changed at this point. The amendments being undertaken at the moment would still have to be transmitted to Mr. President for his assent, said Rotimi Oyekanmi, chief press secretary to Mahmood Yakubu, the INEC chairman.",

          "title": "ANALYSIS: Why Fran\u00e7afrique can no longer be used to explain France\u2019s Africa policy",
          "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron held a new kind of France-Africa summit in Montpellier on October 8. He invited no African heads of state. Instead he met with non-institutional delegates, including civil society, entrepreneurs and intellectuals. This welcome change from previous approaches is among the new steps taken by the French president to renew his country\u2019s relations with Africa.\n\nMany African observers criticised the summit and its format as a new version of \u2018Fran\u00e7afrique\u2019. Senegalese president and poet L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor used the term to describe the shared history of France and Africa. The idea later acquired a negative connotation, leaving little room for fact-based analysis that provides a nuanced understanding of the complex links between France and African countries.\n\nThe term Fran\u00e7afrique is based on deeply rooted preconceived ideas about France\u2019s relations with Africa: financial servitude, military interventionism, corruption of African leaders, and an over-estimation of France\u2019s economic interest in the continent. At the heart of all this lies a profound ignorance of bilateral and contextual dynamics in favour of outdated generalisations.\n\nOne example of the gap between perception and reality is that none of France\u2019s former sub-Saharan colonies is among its top five trading partners in Africa. The same goes for foreign direct investments.\n\nThe notion of Fran\u00e7afrique doesn\u2019t acknowledge the agency of African actors except when they oppose the colonial power. In this sense, the continent\u2019s post-colonial history is often reduced to a string of martyrs whose fate is attributed more to \u2018neo-colonialism\u2019 than their own flawed political strategies.\n\nThere is no denying the role played by France in the post-independence authoritarianism that gripped French-speaking Africa after the 1950s. But why are leaders of former English colonies \u2013 Tanzania\u2019s Julius Nyerere and Zimbabwe\u2019s Robert Mugabe \u2013 acclaimed as pan-African heroes while C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny and Gabon\u2019s Omar Bongo are vilified, even though they were no less democratic or economically efficient?\n\nAfrica needs more robust political analysis of countries\u2019 internal dynamics and their relations with world powers. This approach is more empirically sound than resorting to \u2018Fran\u00e7afrique\u2019 which adopts a moralising and infantilising approach to African actors. And the notion is misleading for four reasons.\n\nFirst, the Fran\u00e7afrique concept is hardly a true reflection of contemporary French-African relations. France no longer plays the central role it once did in most Francophone African political systems. This is largely due to the youthfulness of the continent\u2019s people and generational changes among political and administrative personnel.\n\nAfrica\u2019s economic importance for France \u2013 already dwindling at the time of colonisation \u2013 has been steadily decreasing due to the French economy\u2019s orientation towards services rather than the production of low-cost secondary products. The latter constitute the bulk of African imports from China, for example.\n\nSecond, the neo-Marxist influence of the 1970s continues to shape the thinking of many African intellectuals. Rooted in the concept of dependence, this world view sees African countries as dominated by world powers like France, who support their alleged puppet governments. In reality, the vision is becoming obsolete. Over the years, Francophone political systems have acquired their own logic and historicity, and some heads of state have distanced themselves from France.\n\nThird, the term \u2018Fran\u00e7afrique\u2019 glosses over individual African states\u2019 characteristics and dynamics, reducing their relations with the former colonial power to a common denominator of paternalism and domination.\n\nAfter all, what similarities are there between Congo-Brazzaville, whose political scene was dominated by trade unions and a Marxist party led by the military, and Chad, whose North-South geographical and cultural divide continues to shape political competition and relations with France? The diverse bilateral relations between specific countries and France are often reduced to a dominant-dominated configuration unsupported by facts.\n\nFinally, France has recently made efforts to address various dimensions of its colonial past. The opening of selected historical archives, the numerous testimonies and other investigative work are helping uncover previously concealed information about the nature of relations between France and its former colonies.\n\nSeveral African states are currently showing the same logic of dependence with countries like China that they did with France. It\u2019s therefore time to declare the death of Fran\u00e7afrique as a relevant framework for analysing the internal and external dynamics of French-speaking African countries.\n\nMore than ever, empirical studies based on knowledge of local contexts \u2013 as advocated by the Cameroonian sociologist Jean-Marc Ela \u2013 must become the norm. Information is needed about what guides states\u2019 interests and the dynamics between different groups within society.\n\nThe continued use of the notion of Fran\u00e7afrique shows a poor understanding of African countries\u2019 foreign policies. The starting point in analysing nations\u2019 trajectories must be that African societies and their leaders have agency in the choices they make.\n\nPaul-Simon Handy, Acting Regional Director, Institute for Security Studies (ISS) Addis Ababa and F\u00e9lict\u00e9 Djilo, Independent Analyst\n\n(This article was first published by ISS Today, a Premium Times syndication partner.

          "text": "The 2021 Physician\u2019s Week of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) in the country has been declared open in Uyo by the Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Mr. Udom Gabriel Emmanuel, with a call for improved healthcare delivery systems across Nigeria.\n\nRepresented by the Deputy Governor, Mr. Moses Ekpo, Governor Udom Emmanuel celebrated the contributions of medical practitioners in the fight against COVID -19 and called for support from all stakeholders towards improving the state of affairs in Nigeria\u2019s health sector.\n\nNigeria\u2019s former President, Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, GCFR and the Chairman, Seplat Energy Plc, Dr. A. B. C. Orjiako, FWACS delivered keynote addresses on the theme of the week, \u201cNigerian in the COVID Era and Beyond: Health Systems Strengthening for National Security and Prosperity\u201d.\n\nThe President of the NMA, Prof. Innocent Achanya Otobo Ujah,Mni, FNMA added his voice to calls for improvement in the healthcare delivery system, by asking for the augmentation of physician\u2019s monthly hazard allowance from a paltry N5,000 and for the establishment of a Bank of Health in Nigeria. He argued that, if there is a Bank of Agriculture to incentivize agro-businesses in the country and a Bank of Industry to provide stimulus to industrial growth, there was no reason why Nigeria should not have a functional bank that supports the growth and development of the health sector.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the former Vice Chairman of ExxonMobil Companies in Nigeria and Advisor, Inoyo Toro Foundation, Mr. Udom Inoyo thanked Nigeria\u2019s medical practitioners for volunteering to help humanity as first respondents in the fight against COVID 19 and sued for a multi-stakeholder approach towards beginning the much-desired journey aimed at redeeming healthcare delivery system in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTruth be told, there has been a systemic failure across the board, and for so long. We recognize that you have complained severally, gone on strike, adjusted where necessary, and like some colleagues, may have thought of or are still thinking about abandoning the ship. But this is not the time to apportion blames but rather, an opportunity for all stakeholders to row in the same direction. We must reset the clock and begin a journey of redemption for the general good.\u201d\n\nMr. Inoyo, a former National President and Chairman of Council of the Chartered Institute of Personnel Management in Nigeria, particularly spoke on how improvements in Human Resource Management (HRM) could inspire improvements in Nigeria\u2019s health system.\n\n\u201cTo achieve good human resource management and health system strengthening in Nigeria, you as health managers must focus on delivering health benefits to everyone, especially the vulnerable. And to effectively do so, you must understand the interplay of human resources in this process. Employees are the engine and livewire of any organization. Recruitment process across the value chain must be above board \u2013 square pegs in square holes. Strategic planning and staffing are critical success factors. Development and career planning must not only be deliberate but should be reflective of performance. Compensation and benefits must reflect the market and be transparently determined. Given the shortfall in human resources, task shifting is recommended.\n\n\u201cEnsure that your staff are up to date on global best practices. You must promote such practices that retain the workforce and halt regrettable attrition.\u201d\n\nMr Inoyo noted that \u201cmuch as possible, brain drain must be minimized\u201d, adding that \u201cdespite how challenging the situation maybe, doctors must continue to take pride in the profession and remain committed to the fundamentals of the Hippocratic Oath\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou must re-skill yourself. No matter how difficult, please read and stay abreast of new developments in medicine and do not rely on past knowledge and experiences, as any misdiagnosis further erodes the confidence of your patients.\u201d\n\nThe opening ceremony ended with presentation of awards to two of the panelists at the event: Mr. Udom Inoyo and Pst. Umo Bassey Eno. The presentation of award to Mr. Inoyo was in recognition of his support towards improving healthcare delivery in Akwa Ibom State.\n\nPresenting the award, the State Chaiman of NMA, Dr. Ime Sylvester Udo, flanked by NMA\u2019s National President, Prof. Innocent Ujah, celebrated Mr. Inoyo and partners for the donation of 11,000 PPE units to medical workers in the state in the heat of COVID 19 and the procurement and donation of state of the art PCR machine to Akwa Ibom State Government.\n\nAccording to the NMA Chairman, \u201cIf you go to Ibom Specialist Hospital, the PCR machine there was donated by Mr. Udom Inoyo and partners\u201d.\n\nIt could be recalled that, while the 11,000 PPE units were donated by Concerned Akwa Ibom Professionals in Lagos (CAKPIL), an association Mr. Inoyo currently coordinates; the PCR 3 machine was jointly donated by Inoyo Toro Foundation and Stanbic IBTC Bank.",

Targeted at executives, remote workers, creatives, and tech engineers and developers, Eden Life is removing the barriers to finding reliable household services in the city and in doing so has quickly picked up 600+ customers and is growing a loyal following with a 92% monthly retention rate and over 70% of new users coming via referrals.\n\nA vertical integration strategy, fueled by the seed funding, will ensure Eden can own and manage its entire supply chain and deliver its services without the need for third-party providers by having a physical footprint where chefs prepare meals, laundry can be processed quickly and cleaners receive training to provide a high-quality service. Having launched with three core services \u2013 those most fundamental to making the home a sanctuary \u2013 Eden Life will be rolling out many more over the coming months to make the app a one-stop tool to manage household chores and personal life.\n\nNadayar Enegesi, Co-Founder at Eden Life and Co-founder at Andela said, \u201cFor many of our users, if they\u2019re cooking or running errands, they\u2019re not being productive; they don\u2019t want distractions from their work, which is where Eden Life comes in.\n\n\u201cWhile we can\u2019t create more time physically, we are offering access to a platform that delivers a seamless mix of household services so that busy professionals can focus on their work and leisure. We\u2019re excited to scale our platform to offer so much more, and continue to offer some of the highest quality services underpinned by world-class technology and a highly trained team of professionals.\u201d\n\nRemus Brett, General Partner at LocalGlobe said, \u201cWe fell in love with Eden Life\u2019s vision for the future of home services in Africa.

          "text": "As the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) prepares for the national convention, former special assistant to President Olusegun Obasanjo and former governorship aspirant in Adamawa State, Dr Umar Ardo has warned that the party\u2019s hope of returning to power in 2023 may be elusive if its leaders fail to address the issues surrounding the suspension of Prince Uche Secondus as national chairman of PDP.\n\nArdo who described the suspension of Secondus as unjust added that the party has settled for political expediency to the detriment of justice and rule of law, which he said, will hurt it either at the courtrooms or at the polls.\n\nRecall that Secondus was suspended by a court order following a suit filed in Rivers State while his deputy (South), Elder Yemi Akinwonmi, has since assumed leadership of the party after a power tussle with some other members of the party executives.\n\nSecondus\u2019 travails began after his political relationship with his erstwhile ally and benefactor, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, crashed.\n\nHe has since gone to the Appeal Court to challenge his suspension.\n\nHowever, pending the verdict of the Appeal Court, Ardo said, \u201cIt is my personal assessment of the material politics on the ground that until the Secondus issue is justly and conclusively resolved, it\u2019ll be delusional to think PDP will go into the election cycle of 2023 with the faintest hope of coming out victorious.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe variables don\u2019t seem to add up for the simple fact that one cannot hope to win on injustice and illegitimacy because this is a logical social law! Still our latter-day PDP stakeholders, the old and new party oligarchs, seem to see that they can, forgetting that they\u2019ve always in the past failed. It\u2019s not about the individuals involved, just as of now it\u2019s not about Secondus.\n\nArdo said as one who went to court 11 times against the sheer acts of impunity of the party, he knows that PDP lost in 2015 and 2019 presidential elections mainly as consequences of such acts. \u201cAt any time the party takes to political expediency to the detriment of justice and rule of law in the system the acts ultimately come up to hurt it either at the courtrooms or at the polls. One must definitely give in,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "The United Nations Security Council has been told that the failure of Nigerian leaders to deal with diversity was the root cause of the Biafran crisis.\n\nThe person who made the presentation, was South Africa\u00b4s former president Thabo Mbeki, who lived in Nigeria for a few years in the late 70s during the anti-apartheid struggle.\n\nMbeki addressed the UN Security Council on Tuesday and listed African countries, apart from Nigeria, where the failure to deal with diversity was a root cause of conflict.\n\nHe blamed the current clashes in Ethiopia\u00b4s Tigray region, also on the failure to manage diversity.\n\nMbeki recalled that the Nigerian government was victorious against secessionist-seeking Biafra 50 years ago and its leaders announced \u201cthat they would follow a policy of no victor, no vanquished.\u201d\n\nLooking at the \u201cpainful example\u201d of the ongoing conflict between the Ethiopian government and ethnic Tigrayans, Mbeki said, \u201cthis is exactly what Ethiopia needs.\u201d\n\nThabo Mbeki cited \u201cthe centrality of failure properly to manage diversity\u201d in the conflicts in Congo, Burundi, Ivory Coast and Sudan.\n\nHe pointed to the 2004 report of the Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Commission \u201cwhich tells the naked truth, that it was as a result of the failure to manage diversity that the country experienced a very costly 11-year war which started in 1991\u201d \u2014 and there is a similar failure to manage diversity \u201cin the violent conflict which has been and is still going on in Cameroon.\u201d\n\nFrance\u00b4s U.N. ambassador, Nicolas De Riviere, had some additions.\n\nIn the Sahel region stretching across northern Africa between the Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea, \u201cterrorist groups use differences to stir up hatred between communities,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd ethnic and religious violence is also prevalent in the Middle East including Iraq, Yemen and Syria.\n\nThey spoke at a U.N. Security Council meeting on \u201cDiversity, State Building and the Search for Peace\u201d that was organized by Kenya, which holds the council presidency this month, and chaired by its president, Uhuru Kenyatta.\n\n\u201cThe key message I wish to deliver today is that poor management of diversity is leading to grave threats to international peace and security,\u201d Kenyatta said.\n\nHe said inequality within and between countries \u201cis too often the result of exclusion on the basis of identity\u201d that becomes institutionalized in governments and in economic relations.\n\n\u201cAnd it manifests in stereotyping and bigotry,\u201d leading among other consequences to lack of work for billions of people simply based on who they are, he said.\n\n\u201cThe result is a profound sense of grievance and bitterness that populists and demagogues can easily exploit,\u201d Kenyatta said.\n\n\u201cIt is fodder for terrorism, insurgencies, the rise of xenophobia, hate speech, divisive tribalism, as well as racism.\u201d\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres cited a U.N.-World Bank study that found \u201cmany conflicts are deeply rooted in longstanding inequalities among groups,\u201d which leave people feeling excluded and marginalized because they are denied opportunities based on their culture, race, skin colour, ethnicity or income.\n\nHe pointed to the sharp increase in armed groups at the heart of conflicts \u2014 \u201crebels, insurgents, militias, criminal gangs and armed trafficking, terrorist and extremist groups\u201d \u2014 as well as a rise in military coups.\n\nWhile combatants can agree to end hostilities, Guterres warned, \u201cwithout including a wide range of diverse voices at every step of this process \u2014 without bringing all people along \u2014 any peace will be short-lived.\u201d\n\nHe said that women and young people must be \u201cmeaningful participants\u201d and that \u201cwhen we open the door to inclusion and participation, we take a giant step forward in conflict prevention and peacebuilding.\u201d\n\nFawzia Koofi, the first woman to be deputy speaker of Afghanistan\u00b4s Parliament who left the country after the Taliban takeover on Aug. 15, said her country is the latest test of whether the global community can come together to uphold the principles of the U.N. Charter, including promoting the rule of law, justice and equality for men and women.\n\n\u201cThere are serious reports that fundamental freedoms are being flouted,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWomen and girls are once again regarded as second-class citizens, literally. They are making us invisible again \u2026 (and) thousands of people from religious minorities and other minority groups are forced to flee their villages.\u201d\n\nKoofi said the Afghan situation shows how the imbalance in power is \u201cat the roots of so much conflict and inequality.\u201d\n\nRwandan President Paul Kagame, whose country was the scene of genocide in 1994 in which 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were massacred by the majority Hutu population., said sustainable peace can only be built if the root causes of conflict are understood by a broad range of the population, and it requires dialogue and search for solutions.\n\n\u201cIt may not be possible to entirely prevent all conflict,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, disagreements and grievances will always be there in one form or another. But the intensity and the impact of conflicts can be minimized by remaining attentive to local needs\u201d and delivering \u201cthe results that citizens expect and deserve.\u201d",

          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has denied calling for the devaluation of Naira as reported by a certain section of the media (Blueprint not inclusive).\n\nIn a statement issued by his media aide Mr Laolu Akande, Tuesday in Abuja, the vice president said he had consistently been against what he referred to as \u201ca willy-nilly devaluation of the Naira.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo had spoken Monday at the two-day Mid-Term Ministerial Performance Review retreat, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nWhat Osinbajo said\n\nAt the event, he reeled out the progress report on the Economic Sustainability Programme (ESP) and delay experienced in burse disbursement.\n\nHe also called on the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to review its strategy on foreign exchange and ensure the Naira value reflects the market reality, rather than what he described as \u201cartificially low,\u201d deterring investors from bringing foreign exchange into the country.\n\n\u201cAs for the exchange rate, I think we need to move our rates to be as reflective of the market as possible. This, in my own respectful view, is the only way to improve supply,\u201d Osinbajo had said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get new dollars into the system, where the exchange rate is artificially low. And everyone knows by how much our reserves can grow. I\u2019m convinced that the demand management strategy currently being adopted by the CBN needs a rethink, and that is my view.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the naira is changing at N411 to $1 at the official side of the market, while the same goes for about N565 at the parallel market.\n\n\u201cThere must be synergy between the fiscal and the monetary authority. We must be able to deal with the synergy, we must handle the synergy between the monetary authority, the CBN, and the fiscal side,\u201d the VP had said.\n\nMy position -VP\n\nReiterating his position, Vice President Osinbajo said he was never at any time a fan of naira devaluation.\n\nIn a statement, Osinabjo\u2019s media aide, Mr Akande said: \u201cOur attention has been drawn to statements and reports in the media mis-characterising as a call for devaluation, the view of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN that the Naira exchange rate was being kept artificially low.\n\n\u201cProf. Osinbajo is not calling for the devaluation of the Naira.

If we allow this market mechanism to work as intended, we will find that the Naira will appreciate against the dollar as we restore confidence in the system.\u201d\n\nAcademics say no to devaluation\n\nAlso lending their voice to the issue, Association of Capital Market Academics of Nigeria (ACMAN) said devaluing the naira poses grave consequences for the 2022 budget proposal as it would not be implementable.\n\nThe naira presently exchanges for N411/$ at the official market but N565/$ at the parallel market.\n\nSpeaking at a media parley on the 22 budget proposal in Abuja, ACAMAN President Professor Uche Uwaleke noted that given the fragilities, structural imbalances and vulnerabilities, the economy may not be able to withstand a naira devaluation at this time.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs you all know, this economy remains a mono-product economy. The export base is not well diversified. Over 90 per cent of the forex we get is from a single source-oil. You can see that the supply side is challenged by the mono-product nature of the economy. The demand side is also challenged because it is an import dependent economy. This is an economy that imports virtually everything including toothpicks.\n\n\u201cExcept these fundamentals are addressed, it\u2019s difficult to talk about, if you like, allowing market forces to completely determine the value of the naira. You can\u2019t float the naira when fundamentals are not there. So, I am saying that it\u2019s important we address these fundamentals to ensure that this country has multiple sources of earning forex as well as also deal with the demand issue.\u201d\n\nThe ACMAN president also said the argument that naira devaluation would incentivise foreign investors remains to be seen as other factors such as insecurity equally play a part.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, the naira has suffered several devaluations in recent past. It has neither solved the fundamental problem of helping to diversify the export base nor curbed unbridled imports. Doing so yet again will not change anything. Rather, it\u2019s a recipe for high poverty and unemployment levels.\n\n\u201cAgain, suggesting that the CBN should discontinue its forex demand management strategy to the effect that certain items are excluded from accessing the official window has grave implications for exchange rate and the economy. If anything, it negates the import substitution drive of the present administration,\u201d the first Capital Market Professor in Nigeria told Blueprint.\n\n\u2018No synergy among managers of nation\u2019s economy\u2019\n\nAlso speaking on the telephone with one of our correspondents, a political economist and development researcher, Mr Olamilekan Adefolarin, said the VP\u2019s position is an indication that Nigeria\u2019s \u201ceconomy managers are working at cross purposes, a development that it is not good for the health of the economy.\u201d\n\nAccording to the political economist, the current dilemma of the naira goes beyond what ordinary devaluation can address.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening right now in my assessment is a deliberate action to weaken the naira on all front, and the vice president shouldn\u2019t be the one doing the bidding or calling of the obvious enemies of the naira.\n\n\u201cWhat we expect from the vice president being the chairman of the national economy committee is how to suggest more proactive fiscal policies that would foster realistic monetary policy in strengthening the naira, not to suggest outright devaluation.\u201d\n\nOn his part, MD/CEO SD&D Capital Management Limited, Idakolo Gabriel Gbolade, shared the thinking and views of the vice president.\n\n\u201cI share the opinion of the Vice President because this measure will actually free the FX market and allow new Dollars to come into the economy. The devaluation of the Naira to reflect the true reality on ground is the way to go.\n\n\u201cNigeria presently does not need a multiple exchange rate regime where official rate is far different from the parallel market.\n\n\u201cThe present intervention by the CBN has not yielded the desired result as it has further caused the Naira to continue on a downward slope,\u201d he said in a chat with Blueprint.\n\n\n\nWay forward\n\n\n\nFor Professor Uwaleke, the good news is that the CBN has sufficient external reserves to meet genuine demands for forex at the investors and exporters\u2019 window. \u201cThe CBN should continue to manage it while joining hands with the fiscal authorities to create multiple sources of forex beyond oil,\u201d he said.\n\nAdefolarin averred that redoubling the federal government\u2019s diversification policy with strong focus on the productive sectors, especially non-oil that includes, ICT, revamping local industries such as the paper mills, Ajaokuta and other steel mills scattered all over the country would help.\n\n\u201cMore so, the CBN must not push back on its stand to strengthen the naira. And the last thing the apex bank cannot bear is pressure from the executive to devalue the naira,\u201d he said.",

Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) has assured the international community of Nigeria\u2019s preparedness and determination to go after the assets of drug barons and traffickers in any part of the country.\n\nAccording to a statement on Tuesday by NDLEA\u2019s spokesman, Femi Babafemi, the NDLEA boss gave the assurance in his presentation at the ongoing third committee session of the 76th United Nations General Assembly, UNGA, in New York, US.\n\n\u201cNigeria will remain undaunted in adopting dynamic strategies to counter new approaches adopted by organized criminals, in order to make drug trafficking unattractive while ensuring forfeiture of the criminally derived assets, a tested and powerful deterrent to the proliferation of drug crimes and criminalities,\u201d Marwa declared.\n\nHe added that the Nigerian Government has exhibited political will by demonstrating high commitment to the protection of public health and safety with the launch of the War Against Drug Abuse (WADA) campaign, a call for civil action for all Nigerians to buy in and take full ownership of the fight against the menace of illicit drugs.\n\n\u201cMore so, Nigeria\u2019s Drug Control efforts have received a tremendous thrust with unprecedented stakeholders\u2019 involvement; we have engaged civil society groups, non-governmental organizations, academia and governments at all levels, public enlightenment is also being strengthened with remarkable media visibility, even as the youths are regularly sensitized on social media platforms on the ugly consequences of illicit drugs and related criminalities.\n\n\u201cOur consistent targeting of Drug Trafficking Organizations has resulted in the arrest of 8, 634 suspected drug traffickers and the seizure of over 100 billion Naira in cash and drugs within the first eight months of this year. Perpetrators will go through the Criminal Justice system, with their fundamental human rights, being strictly upheld.\u201d\n\nMr Marwa expressed appreciation to all international partners who he said: \u201cin the spirit of shared responsibility, deserve to be appreciated for their great support through technical assistance, information and intelligence sharing, capacity building and training specifically in the area of countering the use of information and communication technology for criminal purposes\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, the partnerships have given a great boost to Nigeria\u2019s counter-narcotics strategies.\n\nThe NDLEA boss further stated that Nigeria is happy to report that the EU-funded, UNODC sponsored Cannabis Cultivation Survey is expected to bring to the fore, the full extent of cannabis cultivation in Nigeria, and make it easier to target measures to contain this perennial menace.\n\nHe told the global gathering that appropriate strategies have also been adopted to address the issue of stigmatization of people who use drugs, including meeting the needs of vulnerable communities and groups such as women, girls, children (out of school and homeless), internally displaced persons and so on.\n\nGeneral Marwa explained how one of the challenges of the pandemic is the proliferation of online sales of drug cookies and use of courier services to move illicit drugs.\n\nHe, however, stressed that the agency has been able to intercept, trace and dismantle most of the drug cells involved.\n\nPart of the successes of Nigeria\u2019s drug war efforts, Marwa noted is the recent \u201cfirst seizure of 74.119kg of Captagon brand of Amphetamine, presumably destined for use, to fuel insurgency and other violent crimes and criminalities, which Nigeria is currently grappling with.\u201d",

When I came back, I knocked but there was no response. Then I opened the door and realized it wasn\u2019t locked,\u201d Chidinma said.\n\n\u201cThe duvet was on the floor and pillows. The couch was facing the door and the bed was stained with blood and the floor where he was. Music was on, the TV was on. The room was in disarray like someone broke in.\n\n\u201cThen I saw him on the floor, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was afraid.

          "text": "The United Nations\u2019 top court has awarded Somalia control of most of a potentially oil- and gas-rich chunk of the Indian Ocean after a bitter legal battle with neighbouring Kenya over their sea border.\n\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled on Tuesday that there was \u201cno agreed maritime boundary\u201d and drew a new border close to the one claimed by Somalia, although Kenya kept a part of the 100,000 square-kilometre (39,000-square-mile) area, chief judge Joan Donoghue said.\n\nThe court rejected Kenya\u2019s claim of the maritime boundary it sought, saying Kenya had not consistently maintained it.\n\nBut the court rejected Somalia\u2019s pursuit of reparations after the country alleged that some of Kenya\u2019s maritime activities had violated its sovereignty.\n\n\u201cI thank Allah for \u2026 for the fruit of the long struggle made by the Somalis in preventing Kenya\u2019s desire to claim ownership of part of Somalia\u2019s sea,\u201d Somalia\u2019s President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed said in a broadcast on his office\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nIn a speech later on Tuesday, Mohamed urged Kenya to \u201crespect the international rule of law\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt should instead see the decision of the court as an opportunity to strengthen the relationship of the two countries,\u201d the president, widely known as Farmajo, said.\n\nKenya said last week that it would not recognise the court\u2019s judgement, alleging that the judicial process had \u201cobvious and inherent bias\u201d.\n\nIts statement acknowledged that the judgement would have \u201cprofound security, political, social and economic ramifications in the region and beyond\u201d, while urging Kenyans to remain calm.\n\nSomalia filed the ICJ case over the countries\u2019 maritime boundary in 2014, contributing to their strained relations.\n\nThe court based at The Hague noted that it \u201ccannot ignore the context of the civil war\u201d that destabilised Somalia for years and limited its government functions. It also found \u201cno compelling evidence that Somalia has acquiesced\u201d to Kenya\u2019s claim of a maritime boundary along a parallel line of latitude.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Malcolm Webb reporting from Nairobi, Kenya said the \u201cnew maritime border that the court has specified gives most of the disputed territory to Somalia and a little sliver of it to Kenya.\n\n\u201cThe court has already said Kenya does not have any legal grounds to reject this judgement because it signed up to this court\u2019s authority in the 1960s and can\u2019t retroactively renege on that,\u201d Webb said.\n\n\u201cThe question now is will Kenya accept this ruling and if it does not, it puts Somalia in a stronger position to seek support from the UN to seek diplomatic support in enforcing or obliging Kenya to uphold this ruling.\u201d",
