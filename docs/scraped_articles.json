Ben Ayade has now transferred himself to the APC.\u201d\n\nAnother tweep, @GodwinEguono described the decision as a shameful one, as he tweeted, \u201cThey run to APC for safety when their tenure is coming to an end, to avoid being probed by EFCC (Economic and Financial Crimes Commission).\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat blessing will your decamping bring to the state? What development has Buhari brought to Nigeria that you want to join hands with him?

          "text": "Governor of Cross River State, Ben Ayade, has stated that the Peoples Democratic Party, which he dumped for the All Progressives Congress on Thursday, stood by him during his political travails.\n\nAyade recalled how he rose politically on the platform of the opposition party to become a governor.\n\nThe governor, who featured on Politics Today, a current affairs programme on Channels Television, on Thursday attributed his defection to the leadership attributes of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and his relationship with Cross River.\n\nAyade also said more governors in the opposition PDP would soon join the ruling APC. He, however, failed to name them.\n\nHe said in part, \u201cMy decision to move has nothing to do with my relationship with the PDP, it has everything to do with my understanding of the challenges of this nation at this time. My respect for the integrity, character and quality of leadership that President Muhammadu Buhari has brought. I feel depressed when the nation is challenged with security issues. Instead of us rising as an orgasmic whole to see how we can support the President to deal with these foreign herders that are colonising our various roads and farms, we rather sit back; we tend to create an impression as if the government is not doing well.\n\n\u201cSo, it is therefore not driven by a mere political ideology but the philosophical point that this nation is tending toward the brink of collapse and we must support the President. The reality is that there is a reason for which I have moved is what I have analysed for you\u2026because of my personal relationship with Mr President. The relationship is so strong that, don\u2019t forget, the President\u2019s first working visit was to Cross River State. I am not from the North. I am not a Muslim. I was not in APC. But the President chose my state to visit. I owe him that sense of duty, relationship, that fatherly respect. I have related closely with him and I can see his heart and soul. He is a good man in all total sense.\n\n\u201cEssentially speaking, I am one of those whose political slogan is very clear\u2026Politics with Ethics. I am from Cross River State and Governor of Cross River State. Cross River has been reduced to worse in body, in spirit and in the soul; a state that has lost her territory and oil wells; a state that is among the lowest, 35th out of 36 states, in terms of federal allocation. The only state in the South-South that is completely dislocated from the comity of the oil-producing states. A state that does not get 13 per cent derivation. A state that its monthly income is far less than its cumulative monthly salary. I was hit elected to practise politics but to bring value to my society; to the people who elected me.\u201d\n\nAyade added, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that by this decision, it is disloyal to the party (PDP). Even all through the time I spoke about my defection, I never spoke about PDP. So, for me, APC is the party to go to at this point in time because if this nation does not have a smooth transition in 2023, what we talk about Somalia will be like a child\u2019s play.\n\n\u201cThe choice to join APC at this point is based on a nationalistic approach and my commitment to my state; nothing to do with morality or the issue of whether I\u2019m loyal or not to the PDP. Besides, as many people as you see in the PDP, have defected at one time or the other. And many people that you are talking to in APC, who are so committed to this nation, were at some time in PDP.\n\n\u201cAs to whether there are issues in the PDP, no. The party stood by me all through the way. In any other legal issue that I have had, PDP had stood with me. PDP gave me the opportunity to be a senator; PDP gave me the opportunity to be governor. I would never have any time to pull down PDP. I have integrity, character and honour. My politics have ethics. My decision to join APC is to join the President to reduce the tension in the country.\u201d",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nNigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, has awarded the Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, with a \u201cDistinguished Role Model\u201d in education, for his outstanding achievements in the sector in four years.\n\nThe National President, NUJ, Chris Isiguzo, said the Governor was singled out by the award Committee out of the 36 state governors after painstaking assessment of each state in the education sector.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe Role Model in Education Award is a special category award, given to Bello for bringing revolution to education in Kogi State.\u201d\n\nIsiguzo continued: \u201cThe award we are presenting to him (Bello) today is a special category award in education. Apart from recognising political actors that have done well in press freedom, we also take time out to single out political leaders that have by their own actions made enormous contributions across sectors.\n\n\u201cGovernor Yahaya Bello started a university from the scratch, and today, that university is set to kick off. He has transformed the state polytechnic and other institutions.\n\n\u201cThese were among many other achievements of the governor, which the award committee took into consideration, including the fact that the teaching staff in Kogi State stood out clearly among their colleagues in other states.\u201d\n\nHe noted, \u201cIf you look at the teaching staff in Kogi State and compare them with their contemporaries in other states, the difference is clear. Oftentimes, political actors tend to confuse the role of the media. They see us from the point of view of antagonists.\n\n\u201cWe are institutional partners. Where a government has done well, it is our responsibility to acknowledge such achievement; where the government has also not done very well, it is also our responsibility to challenge the same government and say, in this same area, you have not done well.\u201d\n\nThe NUJ President added, \u201cSo many people may not understand what we are doing today, but it is something that we must have to do because we must encourage the shining examples we have in the present democratic experiment. This is why we have gathered here together with my colleagues, and with the endorsement of the national leadership of the union, we have come to present this special recognition to His Excellency, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State.\n\n\u201cI must also point out that in arriving at this conclusion, it was not something that one or two persons sat down to do. The Managing Director, Enentis Communications, Dr. Peter Ademu, led the team of people that went through and screened the nominations. At the end of the day, they informed me that they had selected Governor Yahaya Bello after thorough screening, that he stands out of the Governors of the 36 states.\u201d\n\nResponding, Bello said his administration identified the development of the education sector as the key to high-level human capital development needed for the emancipation of the people of the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cI did not know that in carrying out my constitutional responsibilities to the best of my ability and within the limited resources available, I was making a serious impact in the educational sector and paving the way for awards.\n\n\u201cThe transformed education system is the reason our youth are no longer taking to crime.\u201d\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n.asks Ohanaeze, Afenefere, Arewa, PANDEF, Other groups to give total support\n\n\u2026calls on NASS to give legal backing to Southern Govs\u2019 resolutions\n\nBy Levinus Nwabughiogu-Abuja\n\nBillionaire Lawyer and former member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ned Nwoko has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to grant full autonomy to the local government councils to facilitate their revenue allocation directly from the federation accounts.\n\nHe also asked that the same treatment be given to state houses of assembly and the judiciary just as he called on the national assembly to enact laws to legal backing to the recent resolutions of the southern governors.\n\nNwoko in an open letter to Buhari, a copy of which he made available to Vanguard in Abuja on Thursday said giving heed to the issue was the only to bring peace, unity, progress, security, and sustainable development to the country.\n\nHe also called on the socio-political regional bodies such as Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Afenefere, Arewa, PANDEF to give their total support to the call.\n\nAccording to him, the autonomy would signal the commencement of the restructuring Nigerians were hearing for.\n\nNwoko lauded Buhari for his many populist and people-oriented programmes and policies, declaring support for the President.\n\nHe said that a situation where state Governors muzzle the local government and the Houses of the assembly was highly defective to the ideals of democracy.\n\nThe letter read in parts: \u201cToday, Nigeria as a developing nation is faced with a myriad of social, economic and political challenges which have been endemic and long drawn transcending successive governments. But even with the hydra headed constraints, you have continued to stand firm in your faith and hope in the survival and growth of the nation, especially with your anti-graft crusade and selfless leadership style.\n\n\u201cI share your good vision that Nigeria must overcome her problems, rise above her inhibitions and move forward for the well-being of her over 200 million people.\n\n\u201cIn recent times there have been growing interest and anxiety in the affairs of Nigeria against the backdrop of corruption, socio-economic difficulties and insecurity by bandits across the country.\n\n\u201cI particularly share your concerns for the necessity of one Nigeria,that would guarantee peaceful coexistence, equity and social justice among the diverse inhabitants.\n\n\u201cMr. President, I am elated that you have championed this move with your policy thrust of granting autonomy to local governments as well as ensuring independence of State Assemblies and the judiciary.Your quest remains a bold patriotic template that would strengthen separation of powers among the executive, judiciary and legislature,for the benefit of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency , I join you and other well meaning Nigerians, as an impassioned citizen and concerned stakeholder in the Nigerian project to make a clarion call for the sustenance of these institutions .I specifically call for full autonomy for the local government administration in Nigeria as the bedrock of restructuring,true federalism and genuine democracy.\n\n\u201cI make bold to assert that lack of independence in local government leadership has over the years produced a weak structure that could not safe guard lives and inspire good governance at the grassroots.\n\n\u201cMy firm belief is that local government autonomy and direct funding from the Federation allocation account would embolden elected chairmen and councilors to work effectively with divisional police officers and traditional rulers to manage security as every crime is local.\n\n\u201cThe prevailing situation where most state governors control local government funds through the federation allocation account, leaving the councils as appendages of the states, is grossly defective. Local governments deserve independence to attract experienced technocrats and successful business men who have the latitude and wealth of experience to perform as chairmen.\n\n\u201cI am convinced such arrangement would herald real democracy as elections would be fought locally and popular candidates would emerge regardless of political parties and godfather phenomenon.\u201d\n\nGo beyond rhetorics on restructuring call by Southern Govs\n\n\u201cThe recent resolution by Southern governors for restructuring should go beyond rhetorics and be matched with action. What is required urgently is for the National Assembly to ensure implementation of administrative and financial autonomy in favour of democratic institutions in Nigeria especially the local governments.\n\n\u201cElections will be free and fair if local governments are independent.This will usher in the much needed election of credible aspirants. Council chairmen will be effective while Councilors will take charge of their wards. Also the kings will be held responsible for their towns and villages.\n\n\u201cIt has been generally observed that most Governors don\u2019t know what goes on in local governments areas.They rely on advisers who are most times not resident in the LGAs. Majority of the Governors control elections because they control local government executives. Free these executives and empower them through direct allocations and see what will happen with elections and security.\n\n\u201cMr. president,the restructuring we need should start from the grassroots because it is the foundation of democracy.Happily you have been in the vanguard of this campaign and I wholeheartedly support your efforts so far.\n\n\u201cI also call on Ohaneze, Afenefere, Arewa, PANDEF and other groups to give total support. I believe that if this is achieved before the next general elections in 2023, everything will change for good, to the delight of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe need strong democratic institutions at the various levels in Nigeria for the good of all. We need rule of law and social justice much more than ever before. The strike by judicial workers under JUSUN demands this reasonably. Judges deserve financial and administrative autonomy to function freely. State legislators should not be subservient to state Chief executives. Local governments must stand alone to drive effective governance at the grassroots.\n\n\u201cIt is a welcome development that public hearing on the review of the 1999 Constitution is holding simultaneously across the six geo political zones from May 26 to 27, 2021. Local government officials in collaboration with traditional rulers must mobilize their people to participate massively. Political parties, civil society organizations, human rights groups, youths and women bodies and indeed all Nigerians irrespective of tribe, religion and social status must ensure full participation in the constitutional review process.\n\n\u201cThe needed and achievable restructuring is autonomy of local governments and independence of state Assemblies and the judiciary.\n\n\u201cMy inner conviction is that such proper framework of institutional reforms will lead to the birth of a new Nigeria rooted in a glorious culture of self belonging, justice and fairness, peace and unity, political stability, economic prosperity and general fulfillment. A new Nigeria where democracy would live up to its true meaning as government of the people ,by the people and for the people, propounded by the 16th President of the United States of America, Abraham Lincoln. True democratic independence at the local governments, state assemblies and the judiciary represents the trajectory of our search for a better Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMr. President, I resolutely trust and have the confidence that you will do your utmost best as a consummate patriot and exemplary leader to bequeath a legacy of viable democracy to the present and future generations of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency,may God continue to guide you in good health and wisdom to lead Nigeria towards the attainment of the positive goals and dreams of the founding fathers.\u201d\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

This makes Lagos the highest contributor to the federal purse.\n\nEgube said: \u201cThis report shows that we are on course. It is clear proof that the \u2018THEMES AGENDA\u2019 of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu-led administration is an operational tool that is correctly aligned to our long-term development plan, and hooked up into our Medium Sector Strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe THEMES AGENDA remains strong, and all its elements remain relevant. Even in the heart of the pandemic, the pillars held through. It was like Mr. Governor saw the future, despite the headwinds that came against the pillars, such as the health pandemic and the economic downturn, which lead to a revised budget and other tactical maneuvers against the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner added that the Lagos State Development Plan (LSDP), which encompasses the State Economic Development Policy and guided by the State Development Plan (2012-2025), has been improved on and expanded to a 30-year Development Plan (2021-2051).\n\n\u201cThis new perspective plan is necessary to \u2018encourage citizens participation (Build Team Lagos); develop our people to drive productivity and protect the vulnerable (Building our Future); drive Lagos readiness and openness for Business (Building our Economy); optimising relevant infrastructure to support our growth (Building our 21st Century Mega-City) and engaging intergovernmental partnership; all these are aimed at improving the quality of lives of Lagosians.\n\n\u201cThe LSDP sits at the apex of the planning and budgetary system of the state. The document provides an overall direction for the growth and development of Lagos State. It also provides a framework through which all sectors of the economy can direct their energies and contribute to the improvement of the quality of life of people,\u201d Ebube stated.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "title": "Nigeria has World Bank\u2019s largest portfolio of more than $12b, says Malpass",
          "text": "World Bank Group President David Malpass and Vice President for Western Africa, Ousmane Diagana, in a media roundtable on Thursday, speak on its portfolios in Nigeria, fuel subsidies and more. With the portfolio, programmes under implementation cover a variety of sectors, access to electricity, water, education, health and agriculture. Excerpts:\n\nIn 2020, Nigeria requested for a 3-billion-naira loan from the World Bank. We were able to get 1.5 billion. How soon are we expecting the balance of 1.5 and\u2013or is there any change, delay, in the payment of that 1.5 billion?\n\nMalpass: Thanks. And I\u2019m going to turn to Ousmane, as well, but I wanted to say one thing, which is Nigeria has huge potential. And with some of the improvements in the economic policies, the growth can be rapid for people across Nigeria. We\u2019ve encouraged efforts that would reduce the subsidies for fossil fuels, that would encourage trade across borders, where Nigeria could be doing more in that area.\n\nAnd very importantly, the multiple exchange rates have been a burden on the people of Nigeria, and we\u2019ve encouraged the elimination of the official rates and the unification of rates so that money and investment and remittances can flow in and out of Nigeria with less friction. So, our program remains strongly supportive of the people of Nigeria and of Nigeria. Let me turn to Ousmane for some specifics on Nigeria.\n\nMR. OUSMANE DIAGANA: Thank you very much, David.\n\nAs we speak, we have probably the largest portfolio of the World Bank in Nigeria. More than $12 billion. Those are programs under implementation covering a variety of sectors, access to electricity, water, education, health, agriculture.\n\nEspecially for this year, indeed, we have prepared a pipeline\u2013we had a pipeline of a number of programs and we have delivered about $2 billion for Nigeria in order to help the population have access to critical services but also to support governments and institutions to provide some technical assistance to a variety of stakeholders.\n\nThe conversation of when Nigeria continues around some of the critical reforms that I think Nigeria has been waiting for some time. And we have seen progress and producing the will continue in Nigeria as a very important partner for the Bank and also the role that it plays in Africa clearly\u2013we make any investment in Nigeria will have also some positive externalities for African countries.\n\nThank you.\n\nMR. MALPASS: Yeah, can I underscore that last point of Ousmane\u2019s, as well, that throughout Africa, if one of the major economies can do well, it has very positive synergy with its neighbors, and that\u2019s one of our primary goals, to have successful economies that then bring synergy with neighbors, because that\u2019s a way that there can be massive progress in Africa.\n\nMajor undertakings\n\nMR. MALPASS: I want to quickly go through several of our major undertakings. As you know, COVID-19 has taken a toll on lives and livelihoods and economies, so it\u2019s the highest priority in the various meetings and in our work. It\u2019s devastating the poor and the job losses are immense. And also, the reversals in education are a giant challenge.\n\nOver the last ten years, the World Bank Group has invested over $200 billion in Sub-Saharan Africa and, as I announced on Tuesday at the summit in Paris, in just the next five years, we intend to invest and mobilize about $150 billion in Africa to support the continent\u2019s recovery. And a large portion of that is through grants and long-term zero interest rate loans from IDA, which provides a strong net-positive flow for Africa. So, we\u2019re working full speed on an ambitious IDA20 replenishment, to be concluded by December 2021, and that will be critical for the concessional financing and grants that the IDA countries in Africa need. So, that gives you the context for the funding support that we\u2019re doing both for the public sectors and the private sectors through IFC in Africa. So, it\u2019s an all-out effort by the World Bank to provide as much support as possible during the crisis.\n\nOne of the areas of our work has been on vaccines themselves. Since the outbreak of the crisis, we have invested more than $24 billion in Africa to support health and economic recovery. Our Board authorized $12 billion for the vaccination efforts. And as of today, 18\u2013as of today, there have been 38 African countries that have requested support on vaccination efforts, and 18 of those from West and Central Africa. We have six projects already approved by the World Bank Board, that includes Cote d\u2019Ivoire, The Gambia, Cabo Verde, and more are scheduled to be approved over the next few weeks, several weeks. And so, this effort is moving along fast from the World Bank standpoint, providing financing for countries to both purchase vaccines or receive vaccines from other intermediaries, and, importantly, to distribute those vaccines to people within their countries.\n\nUnfortunately, the supply of vaccines has been limited. The delays are deepening. The inequality, the divide that\u2019s going on in the world and is a serious problem for fragility and for people\u2019s lives and livelihoods, and I\u2019ve repeatedly urged countries that expect to have excess vaccine supplies to release their excess as soon as possible to developing countries that have delivery programs in place. This is a very important connection that needs to be made week-by-week now. We\u2019re at the crisis stage. We have been\u2013of the COVID pandemic, and there has to be a matching between the countries that have access and the countries that have delivery programs that are ready to go. I\u2019ve emphasized the need for transparency on that, because one of the big gaps is in knowing who has excess vaccines, which manufacturers have deliveries available, and which countries have programs that are ready to actually put shots, put jabs in people\u2019s arms.\n\nSo, in that spirit, the World Bank yesterday launched\u2013we launched a comprehensive online portal that provides easy access to information. I tweeted about it this morning. I encourage everyone to click on the website and see how the countries are\u2013how the vaccination programs are set up in each of the now 22 programs that we have in place, and it\u2019s going to mount week by week. We hope to reach 50 programs by midyear, which have clear documentation, clear explanation of the connection to the deliveries in countries.\n\nThis builds on the assessments that we did earlier in the year and late last year, 140 assessments of the capacity to actually deliver vaccines. So, this becomes the critical path in the vaccination effort for the countries that have excess vaccines to free up their options, their control, their export limitations so that the vaccines can go to developing countries that have programs and the World Bank has active, transparent programs that reach people arms, and they\u2019re available now and they\u2019re transparently disclosed on the website. And we encourage other intermediaries and other participants in the global vaccination effort to do the same in terms of transparency.\n\nI want to turn to debt sustainability. It also has a very important transparency aspect to it. The contracts are burdened by collateralization, by non-disclosure clauses, and by restraints on comparable treatment as countries look to restructure their debt contract. This is a major problem in West Africa. And as COVID-19 persists into 2021, the debt situation will certainly deteriorate further.\n\nComprehensive debt solutions, we think, involve four elements which we have proposed: One is debt suspension; then, there is debt reduction; there is the resolution of debt; and there\u2019s transparency, debt transparency. So, in all four areas, there needs to be much more progress. We supported the DSSI, but recognize that there was only partial\u2013for many of the major creditors, there was only partial participation. And during 2020, and now into 2021, large profits are being withdrawn from Africa, even during the crisis, and there\u2019s no real prospect for cancellation of those debts.\n\nOne of the themes of the Paris Conference two days ago, on Tuesday, was the call by African heads of state for cancellation of debts, but that\u2019s not the direction that the world is moving at this point. A permanent solution is necessary for this overhang of debt stocks for countries that have unsustainable debt levels. World Bank is working closely with the IMF to try to implement the G-20 common framework for debt reduction. The success of that hinges on full participation by the private sector, and also improvements in debt transparency. The full private sector participation is an essential part of any path to lasting debt sustainability. Let me give you some examples.\n\nIt\u2019s not sufficient that Chad or Ethiopia, which have asked for common framework treatment\u2013merely for them to seek comparable treatment from private creditors. The private creditors themselves must do their fair share and deliver debt relief in a timely manner and on fully comparable terms to official bilateral creditors. That process is underway, but has moved very slowly and it means continuing burden of unsustainable debt on countries within Africa.\n\nThe private creditors need to recognize that a successful debt restructuring is a beneficial outcome for all parties involved. It brings relief to the people of the country, as we are trying to do in Chad, and it also benefits the private sector, because it limits their losses compared to a scenario of outright default. So, in the longer term, we want to\u2013we, the World Bank and the countries of Africa are working to try to have a stable and thriving economic growth prospect for the people of Africa and the business opportunities that are available there. But without the private creditors fully on board, the common framework won\u2019t be able to provide sustainable solutions for Chad, Ethiopia, or Zambia, the three countries that have asked for common framework treatment.\n\nAnd this\u2013okay, so, I wanted to go through that in some detail, because we\u2019re at an important turning point in the common framework and we are urgently trying to implement it successfully so that we can have sustainability in debt. This builds on very strong World Bank financing, including to Chad. Over the next decade, the World Bank plans to put as much as $1.4 billion into Chad. This will strengthen Chad\u2019s ability to sustain a moderate debt burden, if that can be achieved. So, that\u2019s the overall goal, to bring Chad to a moderate debt level. But so far, the participation by creditors has been limited and we\u2019re working on that in detail.\n\nOkay. I want to also mention, and I\u2019m happy to take questions on these areas\u2013but I want to mention climate change. This is a critical part of the World Bank efforts. We are working with countries to strengthen their capacity to absorb and adapt and transform their systems in response to climate change. We\u2019ve announced the elements of our climate change action plan.\n\nThese include\u2013and importantly, we want to integrate climate and development so it works for the people of the countries. We want to have actual results in terms of success, successful adaptation and successful mitigation efforts within the climate sphere. There needs to be electricity access, and so that means growth in the production of electricity, but in ways that are cleaner and that are lower carbon emitting as we go along. So, that\u2019s a major effort underway and the elements have been announced and we\u2019ll be releasing the plan itself and also participating actively in countries\u2019 nationally determined contributions, the NDCs that are part of the Paris Agreement, as we, the World Bank, work to align our financing with the Paris Agreement. And we\u2019re also participating actively in the runup to COP26.\n\nI wanted to mention also, and I\u2019m sorry to be so brief on very important issues, the work that we\u2019re doing on fragile, conflict, and violent states. Eleven of the 22 countries in the West Africa Region are now affected by FCV, and more than 70 percent of the population live in FCV countries. So, this is the\u2013we\u2019re scaling up our financial aid to the G-5, the Sahel countries: Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger through IDA to support the conflict prevention and also the resilience and emergency responses that are needed. Our aid to those five, we expect to reach $8.5 billion for the fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023. So, that is starting now for the next two or so\u2013little more than two calendar years from now.\n\nLet me conclude, very nice to be with you today. We know that the road to recovery will be a long one. The countries in the Region have applied lessons from previous crises, such as the Ebola outbreak in 2014. Many countries have strengthened their social safety nets to help protect the poor, and the World Bank is working actively\u2013World Bank Group is working actively on those efforts and we think those are important preparations for future crises and the ability to get money to people during a crisis is a critical part of preparation.\n\nAnd we want to also move faster on the key reforms that each of the countries is facing that will help draw in new investment. So, that gives you some description of the expanse of our work and I look forward to your questions.\n\nDo you believe that we are in danger of having a lost decade in Africa? And what can we do to avoid it, or what debt relief will have to do with the solution?\n\nMR. MALPASS: Yeah, thank you. Well, the COVID itself was a historically large setback, and it was particularly harmful for people\u2013for the poorest and most vulnerable. And so, from that standpoint, we recognize that it will take years to claw back some of the losses.\n\nI mentioned earlier the education system. So, by having the advanced economies close down, and then the education systems\u2013often, schools closed\u2013children weren\u2019t able to move forward, and that\u2019s a critical part of the future of every country, and especially in Africa with the youth.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo, we\u2019re working very hard to avoid a lost decade; so, I want to say that. And I don\u2019t think\u2013I think there are still pathways forward in order to avoid having all of the setbacks extend in Africa. So, I want to give some specifics on that.\n\nOne is from the vaccination effort. So, we have to get vaccination started in more countries, and that means getting the supply, and that means those countries with excess releasing the supply. And that means using programs that are ready, that are on the shelf, that are on websites, and fully disclosed as the World Bank programs are, to get vaccinations to people across their countries. So, that\u2019s a key starting point.\n\nAnd then, I wanted to say a second vital area is on debt. Oftentimes, the term \u201clost decade\u201d is applied to Latin America, and I worked throughout the 1980s on the Latin debt crisis. And we\u2019re trying hard to avoid the situation that occurred in that crisis where, year after year, the debts were rescheduled, they were pushed forward into the future, but never actually reduced. And so, the new investment couldn\u2019t come in because they were\u2013they realized that they were going to end up be used to pay previously contracted debt. So, there needs to be a mechanism for those countries in Africa that have unsustainable debt burdens, for them to have actual debt reduction, debt relief.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on with\u2013that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do with my call a year ago\u2013over a year ago\u2013was for a debt moratorium. The G-20 put forward the debt suspension initiative, which delayed the payments but kept the interest rates compounding on that debt. And now, we have the common framework, where it faces the obstacles from the debt being\u2013much of the key debt being collateralized, being nondisclosed as far as the contracts, and these are obstacles to successful debt restructuring and raises the concern or the possibility of a lost decade; so, we\u2019re working on that.\n\nAnd then third, and my final point, is on the economic advancements themselves. Many countries have key things that they could be doing in terms of digitalization, in terms of trade facilitation, in terms of unification of exchange rates, in terms of the business climate being improved, in terms of infrastructure, which is so vital. All of those things could be done more.\n\nAnd I would like to cite Sudan. We are making progress in Sudan. And you know on Monday there was a major conference in Paris on the progress on Sudan. We were able to clear our arrears, then the African Development Bank\u2019s arrears. And now, the IMF\u2019s arrears are on track to being cleared. And that enables the international system to help Sudan. And then, in order to accomplish that, Sudan was taking very important steps to help itself through the unification of the exchange rate and other reforms that are really working.\n\nAnd so, I encourage each country to work to avoid the last decade that is still a risk for the continent.",

          "text": "By Christopher Oji\n\nMany people were injured while many others were robbed at Oshodi area of Lagos when Soldiers from the Nigeria Air Force clashed with Motorpark touts and some hoodlums.\n\nMany people believed to be touts were taken away by the Soldiers at Capa Motor Park Mosafejo area of Oshodi.\n\nTrouble started when the Soldiers heard about the death of one of their colleagues who was allegedly murdered on Monday by hoodlums on top of the Oshodi Bridge.\n\nA source told Daily Sun that the personnel of the Nigerian Air Force, was allegedly murdered by hoodlums on Monday; his body was seen on top of the bridge on Tuesday and some government officials who were alerted evacuated the body to the morgue .\n\nVery early morning, Thursday Military personnel stormed the popular Capa Motor Park to question the Chairman on what he knew about the death of the Soldier, but the touts who thought their chairman was being arrested by the Soldiers, started throwing stones, bottles and other cudgels at the soldiers who threw caution to the winds and started shooting sporadically into the air.\n\nThe touts were said to have burnt the patrol vehicles belonging to the Soldiers.\n\nIt was gathered that there was pandemonium as residents; traders and road users ran for cover. Motorists and their passengers also abandoned their vehicles while many passengers were stranded as no commercial vehicle driver had the courage to pass through the road for fear of the unknown as the Military men had taken over the entire area.\n\nIt was gathered further that the Soldiers succeeded in taking unspecified numbers of suspected hoodlums and touts away and some dangerous weapons recovered at the scene.\n\nA witness, Felicia Madu, told Daily Sun that:\u201d The Air Force personnel was on mufti when he ran into a group of hoodlums who were robbing people of their belongings on top of Oshodi bridge . He resisted the hoodlums and was overpowered and killed by the robbers. After killing him, they dumped his remains into a ditch.\n\n\u201cWe knew there would be trouble when a team of Soldiers from OP MESA stormed Oshodi today to interrogate the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) Chairman. His boys and other hoodlums started throwing stones at the soldiers. That was the cause of today\u2019s crisis.\n\n\u201cIn the process of the crisis, hoodlums cashed in on the opportunity and started vandalising and looting properties from stranded passengers and commercial vehicles drivers within the vicinity\u201d.\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, relative calm has returned to the scene as a combined team of Military, Police and Para- Military personnel were on the ground to maintain law and order.\n\nSpokesman of Nigerian Army, 9Brigade, Major A.K. Bello, said the Army was not directly involved in the incident, \u201cbased on the situation on ground, we had to wade into the crisis and bring the situation under control because of the sensitivity of the environment,\u201d\n\nLagos State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, said the Commissioner of Police Lagos State Command Mr Hakeem Odumosu,has ordered investigations into the incident.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Lagos State Police Command was aware of the conflict that occurred at (Capa Park/Mosafejo Osodi) at about 7am. Normalcy has been restored to the area, as the matter is under investigation. We urge Lagosians to go about their lawful businesses in the area and the state in general. No cause for alarm. The CP has ordered that intensive patrol be emplaced in the area.",

They include the governors of Yobe, Mai Buni; Imo, Hope Uzodinma; Plateau, Simon Lalong; and Ekiti, Dr Fayemi Kayide. Minister of State for Petroleum Timipre Sylva was also in the entourage.\n\nThey arrived in Calabar about 7:30 pm and had a dinner with Governor Ayade where the defection was exhaustively discussed.\n\nTwo more governors \u2013 Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa and Bagudu of Kebbi \u2013 joined the delegation on Thursday morning.\n\nAt about 9:45 am, the APC governors, led by APC Interim National Chairman and Governor of Yone State, Mai Mala Buni, stormed Government House for an expanded executive committee meeting.

A youth leader, Abashe Dauda, told Daily Sun that 11 bodies were discovered at Gaida Kaso and five others missing when gunmen launched an offensive on Gaida Kaso and Wako Kaso villages, Kakau Ward in Chikun local government area of Kaduna State, on Tuesday. He added that two other persons were shot at Wako Kaso village, but survived the attack that lasted for hours.\n\nHe said the killings in the adjoining agrarian communities were becoming tensed up daily with no tangible help from the government to salvage the situation.\n\nHe said: \u201cA community called Gaida Kaso village, Kakau ward, Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna state, was attacked on 18/5/2021 by unknown gunmen.\n\n\u201cThe attack was carried out at about 3am, houses were set ablaze, 11 persons confirmed dead and five are nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cThe gunmen also attacked a nearby community called Wako in Kaso Village, two were shot and sustained gunshot injury and are receiving treatment.\n\n\u201cAssemblies of God Church and one mission house were burnt down in the process,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth Kaduna State Police Command and the State\u2019s Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs are yet to make any official statement about the development as the time of filing this report.\n\nAlso, on Tuesday night, armed bandits reportedly attacked Batsari town in Batsari Local Government Area in Katsina State, killing one person and abducted 21 others.\n\nAn eyewitness said that the armed bandits stormed into Batsari community at about 10:20pm and started shooting sporadically before they abducted 21 persons, mostly women and children, while a man simply identified as Alhaji Hassan was shot dead.\n\nEfforts to get the police authorities in Katsina State to comment on the incident proved abortive as the spokesperson, Gambo Isah, did not respond to calls to his phone.\n\nThe police command had, earlier on Tuesday night, confirmed the abduction of a judge, Alhaji Husaini Sama\u2019ila, by gunmen at a Shari\u2019a Court at Baure Zaka village in Safana Local Government Area of the State. The judge was said to have been kidnapped around 3:00 pm, on Tuesday, while on a personal visit to the court.\n\nThe police spokesman: \u201cAs you all know, the court has not been on the session since the commencement of the strike action embarked by the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN).\n\n\u201cThe judge took the risk and went to the court. He didn\u2019t inform the police about his going to the court, knowing fully that the place is not secured enough,\u201d he said.",

Simon Lalong of Plateau State; Abubakar Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State; Jigawa State Governor, Mohammed Badaru Abubakar; and the Chairman of APC National Caretaker Committee and Yobe State Governor, Mr. Mai Mala Buni.\n\nAlso present was the Minister of State for Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva.\n\nSome of the governors and the minister had stormed the state since Wednesday to lobby Ayade to join the ruling party in Nigeria.\n\nWhile announcing his decision to dump the PDP, Ayade declared that henceforth, Cross River State has become an APC state, and urged all his supporters and followers to go to their respective wards and register with his new party.\n\nBefore decamping formally to the APC, he held a two-hour meeting with the APC delegation led by the party\u2019s interim chairman and governor of Yobe State.\n\nOthers at the meeting were the state deputy governor, Prof Ivara Esu, Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Eteng Williams Jones and members of the state house of assembly, some National Assembly members, members of the Cross River State Executive Council members, local Government chairmen, councilors and some stakeholders, including Dame Princess Florence Ita-Giwa and High Chief Asuquo Ekpenyong amongst others.\n\nSpeaking on why he was joining the APC, Ayade highlighted the character and attributes of President Muhammadu Buhari and the realisation that Cross River, which has been emasculated economically following the ceding of its oil wells, needed to be in sync with the party at the center, as the main reasons for moving.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201chaving seen and known the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and his commitment to this country, his nationalistic disposition and all the efforts he has made to bring Nigeria to where we are today, it is obvious that at this point we needed to join hands with him to build a Nigeria that we can be proud of .\n\n\u201cWe need all governors to recognize that it is not party that matters. It is character, it is honor, it is commitment to the vision of this great nation. We all need to as a team work ahead of the president by working towards building a prosperous country that the succession worries of 2023 will come without the fears and the worries the international community has for us.\n\n\u201cI believe that if everyone of us as governor joins hands with Mr President, I think we can sit on the same dining table and fashion out a way to govern this country.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the development, an elated Buni said he and his team were in the state to formally welcome Governor Ayade to the APC.\n\nHis words: \u201cI am here on behalf of the APC family to welcome His Excellency the Executive Governor of Cross River State formally to the APC. As from today he is the leader of the party in the state. \u201d\n\nMinutes after his formal defection, Ayade took to the social media where he further explained why he dumped the PDP for the APC.\n\n\u201cThis morning I formally joined the All Progressives Congress. This decision was borne out of the need to bring Cross River State in sync with the policies and programs of the federal government. I believe that if everyone of us as governors joins hands with Mr President, I think we can sit on the same dining table and fashion out a way to govern this country.\n\n\u201cWe need all Governors to recognize that it is not party that matters. It is character, it is honor, it is commitment to the vision of this great nation.\n\n\u201cWe all need to as a team work ahead of the President by working towards building a prosperous country that the succession worries of 2023 will come without the fears and the worries the international community has for us,\u201d Ayade wrote on his Facebook page.\n\nFormer Leader of the 7th Senate of Nigeria, and Secretary, APC 2018 National Convention Planning Committee, Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba, SAN, a chieftain of the APC from the state has joined in welcoming Ayade into the party.\n\nIn a press statement issued by Ndoma-Egba on Thursday, he described Ayade\u2019s entry into the APC as a good development for the state.\n\nThe statement made available to journalists in Calabar read as follows:\n\n\u201cCongratulations Governor Ben Ayade:\n\nOn behalf of myself and political associates, I heartily congratulate Your Excellency, Senator Prof. Ben Ayade, Governor of Cross River State on your well thought out decision to formally defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC) today and join the league of Progressive Governors in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency will recall that Cross River State has always been in the mainstream of Nigeria politics. There is no gainsaying the fact that the past 6 years of being in the opposition has impacted the State negatively, even though you have consciously navigated the ship of governance in sync with the APC-led Federal Government. As a State, we can ill afford to remain in the opposition. I commend you for recognizing this fact and doing the needful for the good of our dear State.\n\n\u201cAs you join us in the Progressives fold, my expectation is that your coming will enrich our internal democracy and I enjoin you to be consultative, inclusive, democratic, transparent and accountable because these are the hallmarks of the All Progressives Congress family. I also expect that your presence in the APC will further strengthen the party and improve our electoral fortunes in Cross River State. I have no doubts that the APC family in the State has received you with open arms and will work with you to reposition our dear State on the path of unprecedented socioeconomic and sociopolitical development.\n\n\u201cOur core objective remains forging a stronger, united and formidable APC that will deliver the dividends of good governance to all Cross Riverians irrespective of political affiliation, ethnicity and religion. I trust that you are well in tandem with this.\n\n\u201cOnce again, congratulations and welcome to the All Progressives Congress.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Nothing can be more disconcerting. This outburst should, ordinarily, not elicit response from reasonable people who know the distinction between a legitimate business that is not in anyway injurious and a certain predilection for anarchy.\n\n\u201cClinging to an anachronistic model of animal husbandry, which is evidently injurious to harmonious relationship between the herders and the farmers as well as the local populace, is wicked and arrogant.\n\n\u201cComparing this anachronism, which has led to loss of lives, farmlands and property, and engendered untold hardship on the host communities, with buying and selling of auto parts is not only strange. It, annoyingly, betrays a terrible mindset.\n\n\u201cMr Malami is advised to approach the court to challenge the legality of the laws of the respective states banning open grazing and decision of the Southern Governor Forum taken in the interest of their people. We shall be most willing to meet him in court.\n\n\u201cThe decision to ban open grazing stays.

          "title": "Stax wants you to enjoy USSD with better design, without ever dialling codes again",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nMost people who started using mobile phones in the 2000s became familiar with USSD through loading and checking airtime balance. With time, mobile banking became a major use case; again for airtime transactions, but also for buying internet data, sending money and paying bills.\n\nUnlike mobile apps that need to be downloaded and installed, USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, if you insist) is lightweight and straightforward to use.\n\nDial the code for the desired service, follow the instructions e.g. \u201cpress 1 to Check Balance\u201d on each page and, provided there isn\u2019t some \u201cconnection failure\u201d or \u201centry error\u201d, your wishes will come true.\n\nA misconception is that USSD is for people who use basic phones but the feature has become mainstream even among smartphone users in Africa. A study of smartphone users in Bangladesh, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa showed that 87% of all financial-related transactions were conducted via USSD, with only 13% via mobile app.\n\nSo, USSD works well. But it still has its fair share of frustrating glitches that you normally wouldn\u2019t encounter on an app. For one, you need to memorise the code for each service you want to access. You could minimise an app to get information from, say, your notes app. But you mostly can\u2019t minimise a USSD session once it\u2019s started.\n\nUSSD\u2019s original design did not foresee \u201chow the introduction of smartphones would bridge the worlds of computing and telecommunications to form an entirely new industry,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi explains.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say we should throw it away. On the contrary, some companies recognise that USSD is here to stay in Africa. As such, they are merging the best of both worlds: stacking the visual appeal and interactivity of smartphones on top of USSD\u2019s simple and efficient backend.\n\nOne such company is Hover, a US-based company, and their solution is called Stax.\n\nMaking USSD smart\n\nStax is a mobile app currently available only to Android users in 10 countries, including Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. It has three use cases: buy airtime, send money, and request money. All without ever dialling any USSD code.\n\nStax\u2019s main promise is that users never have to dial a code again\u2026 while enjoying USSD.\n\nIt\u2019s not a digital wallet or account, so it doesn\u2019t ask for an email address or phone number. But \u2013 and this is an important but \u2013 Stax needs certain phone permissions.\n\nWhat permissions? Three precisely: to make and manage phone calls; send and view messages; and access your contacts.\n\nWith those enabled, you can input how much airtime you want to buy, choose the bank or fintech-powered account you want to debit and input the phone number to credit or select from your phonebook.\n\nIt would be great if this is where it ends but \u2013 somewhat unfortunately \u2013 Stax asks for two other permissions to complete this task of buying airtime. Permission to display on top of other apps on your phone and another to connect with mobile money and telecom services on your behalf.\n\nThis gave me pause and maybe it is because of the copy: \u201cAllow Stax to have full control of your device?\u201d\n\nThree paragraphs beneath that question describe why the permission is needed. But all the bad news I have absorbed about privacy risks over the past four years flashed before my eyes, discouraging me from clicking \u201cAllow.\u201d\n\nJess Shorland, co-founder of Hover, agrees that some work needs to be done to make users more comfortable with the permissions. But she has an explanation for why they are necessary:\n\n\u201cIt allows us to automate the USSD session on behalf of the user. We\u2019ve basically built a different interface for USSD. The user interacts with that interface in a way that is a lot more screen-reader friendly.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one big permission request\n\nIn other words, the accessibility permission is what enables Stax to do these things on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\nWhen a user gives Stax access, the app activates a screen reading functionality and acts as a web browser. USSD is still happening in the background but instead of presenting those USSD screens, Stax\u2019s SDK reads the USSD dialog, runs the functions and shows the user a familiar app interface.\n\nBut what are the risks? Because there is no way to convince a user that giving up control doesn\u2019t somehow make them a little vulnerable. Shorland says Stax only takes the information needed to enable the user complete their transaction.\n\n\u201cEverything happens client side, not on our servers. It\u2019s also what enables us to be offline,\u201d she says, emphasizing that the app is open-source as a sign of transparency.\n\nWho in Africa needs Stax?\n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of cool that Stax, a fintech app, works offline like regular USSD. But with the internet being more central to the digital and financial services space today, why should we cheer for Stax?\n\nHover CEO and co-founder Ben Lyon says they are \u201cbuilding for the world as it is today so that we can bridge it to where it ought to go.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, there were 159 million monthly active mobile money accounts in Africa, according to the GSM Association. Africa represents more than half of the global mobile money usage.\n\nLyon thinks such numbers and smartphone usage \u2013 expected to double to 678 million by the end of 2025 \u2013 will make USSD even more mainstream. \u201cIt is a standard view of the tech industry that USSD is a bygone thing. It is actually just categorically wrong.\u201d\n\nIf that view is wrong as he insists and if USSD\u2019s user experience needs to be modernised for the smartphone age, then solutions like Stax would seem right on time.\n\nStax wants the app to be under 10MB so that it will work easily on every (Android) phone. Average transaction time is supposed to be 12 seconds.\n\nMy airtime purchase this morning took a bit longer. It showed a transaction failure message at the end and my bank debited me two seconds later. But I got the airtime.\n\nStax is\u2026 a work in progress\n\nAs of today, Stax currently supports transactions for eight banks (Access, First, Guaranty, Keystone, Sterling, UBA, Wema, Zenith), OPay and Paga.\n\nBeing in the USSD business in Nigeria means getting into the CBN (banks) vs NCC (telcos) scuffle around who pays for USSD services. What does Hover think about this debate?\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that USSD is about accessibility and inclusion, I believe strongly that consumers should not pay to access the channel,\u201d Lyon says.\n\n\u201cI hope NCC and other players come around to this view that consumers should not pay.\u201d\n\nOutside of that and other potential headaches, Stax\u2019s focus will be on convincing individuals and businesses that the app is reliable for all seasons and geographies, regardless of internet connection, says Peace Itimi, who leads growth for the product.\n\n\u201cWe are not monetizing Stax yet and it\u2019s not on the near term roadmap to monetize it,\u201d Lyon says. \u201cThere is a WhatsApp sized opportunity here and our first priority is to make sure we can seize the opportunity at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBen also name-drops WeChat as a possible inspiration for monetization. With a large user base, Stax could begin enabling discovery and access to third party services, in what could make Stax a super app of sorts.\n\n\u201cWhen people understand what the product can do, they will fall in love with it,\u201d Itimi says.\n\nThat depends: on how they fix those curious accessibility permissions, and if people really feel the need to switch from basic USSD \u2013 which works okay \u2013 to a shinier, app-enabled life.",
          "summary": "\u2014Most people who started using mobile phones in the 2000s became familiar with USSD through loading and checking airtime balance.\nMaking USSD smartStax is a mobile app currently available only to Android users in 10 countries, including Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania.\nWhen a user gives Stax access, the app activates a screen reading functionality and acts as a web browser.\nStax wants the app to be under 10MB so that it will work easily on every (Android) phone.\nWith a large user base, Stax could begin enabling discovery and access to third party services, in what could make Stax a super app of sorts.",

          "title": "Many people have one concern: NITDA warns Nigerians against digital colonialism as Whatsapp\u2019s new privacy policy takes effect",
          "text": "Whatsapp has been more subtle about telling users to sign new terms of service but NITDA says some dangers remain\n\nIn January 2021, users of the popular instant messaging app Whatsapp got notifications about new terms of service and an updated privacy policy. The notification came with the warning that if users did not accept the new terms by February 8, they would lose access to the app.\n\nWhen you\u2019re one of the world\u2019s most popular apps and owned by Facebook, a company many people distrust, that sort of announcement will hog headlines. There\u2019s also the fact that many tech users are becoming concerned about privacy and the kind of data apps collect about them.\n\nSo for a few weeks, we saw articles suggesting that people should switch to apps like Telegram and Signal, which do not collect as much information on their users. As a result, Signal saw a rush of downloads.\n\nAlthough the pushback was intense, Whatsapp did not budge on its terms and privacy policy; instead, it decided to soft-pedal on the new terms of use and be more subtle about getting users to sign it.\n\nWhatsapp still wants you to agree to new terms\n\nIn the weeks leading up to a new deadline of May 15, Whatsapp began sending reminders to users as an in-app notification. While it will no longer block users from using the app if they don\u2019t agree to the new terms, it will restrict some functionalities.\n\nThe company said in a blog post in May, \u201cfor the last several weeks, we\u2019ve displayed a notification in WhatsApp providing more information about the update. After giving everyone time to review, we\u2019re continuing to remind those who haven\u2019t had the chance to do so to review and accept. After several weeks, the reminder people receive will eventually become persistent.\u201d\n\nWhatsapp is swapping its forceful method and wants to send reminders until users agree. Yet, countries are still concerned, and in Nigeria, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NIDTA) issued a statement Tuesday about Whatsapp.\n\n\u201cWhatsApp users are at liberty to decide on giving consent to the processing of their data based on the new privacy policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) recognises; we have consent (a clear, unambiguous expression of privacy terms communicated by the controller and accepted by the Data Subject) as one of the lawful basis for data processing. Acceptance of the new privacy policy and terms of use implies that users\u2019 data would now be shared with Facebook and other third parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsers will now be subject to the terms and policies of Facebook and other receiving entities with or without being direct subscribers to such services.\u201d\n\nNITDA is wary of new policy\n\nAt the heart of the new terms, Whatsapp wants to become a place where businesses directly sell to customers. Small businesses will have virtual storefronts, while bigger businesses will be able to integrate Whatsapp into their existing technology stack.\n\nIn a statement, NITDA published some portions of Whatsapp\u2019s new policy\n\nOne concern many people have is whether Facebook will have access to their Whatsapp chats, but the company insists that messages on the IM platform are encrypted end-to-end. Yet, NITDA says users should \u201climit the sharing of sensitive personal information on private messaging and social media platforms as the initial promise of privacy is being overridden on the basis of business exigencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cNITDA is exploring all options to ensure Nigerians do not become victims of digital colonialism,\u201d the agency added in its statement.\n\nIt is not clear what these options are. For now, the choice ultimately lies with users who will determine how to guard their privacy as WhatsApp\u2019s new rules go into effect.",

          "title": "Nigerians mourn a painful dip day for crypto, but the rallying cry is \u201cHODL!\u201d",
          "text": "Moses Francis has had a heart-breaking Wednesday. Looking at his Binance app, every graph is red. He holds four coins \u2013 Tron, Doge, Litecoin and Ripple. They have been bleeding value all day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been holding for over a year now. I\u2019ve come across a lot of dips. But I haven\u2019t encountered one as bad as this,\u201d he says to TechCabal.\n\nFrancis is not alone. In Nigeria, thousands of users have felt burned on a day of massive slumps in value of virtually every notable cryptocurrency traded across the globe. \u2018Bitcoin\u2019, \u2018Binance\u2019, \u2018Elon Musk\u2019 and \u2018Crypto\u2019 are among top trends on Twitter.\n\nBitcoin is the hardest hit \u2013 the value has crashed as low as $32,000 from a previous high of $65,000 in mid April. But the wave has shaken BNB, Binance\u2019s cryptocurrency, as well as Ethereum, the currency of the NFT world.\n\n\u201cI am feeling down. Anytime I open Binance, I feel as though I want to purge,\u201d says Ogechukwu (he gave just his first name) who has held Bitcoin and Ethereum since 2017.\n\nMany reacted to the crash by choosing to see the funny side.\n\nBitnob, a Lagos-based cryptocurrency exchange, had a request for Risevest, a stock and real estate investment startup.\n\nHi @Risevest are you hiring?\n\n\n\nWe dey find work \u2014 Bitnob (@Bitnob_official) May 19, 2021\n\nSomeone imagined the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s governor must be feeling good about his crypto warnings earlier in the year. (\u2018Ponzi\u2019 also became a top trend in Nigeria).\n\nEmefiele looking at all these crypto tears pic.twitter.com/mN3ve6CVGL \u2014 Editi Effi\u00f2ng (@EditiEffiong) May 19, 2021\n\nBut the jokes do not mask the pain of the dip\u2019s strokes. Victor Asemota, a Nigerian businessman and startup investor, lamented in a tweet.\n\n\u201cI take it back. Crypto is now worse than equities. I have lost all my gains this year and the last in a few hours.\u201d\n\nIndeed Bitcoin has now lost all of the gains made since February 8, the day Tesla announced it would accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for its highly-demanded cars. In the three months since, BTC rose steadily.\n\nThat rising tide drove up the value of other currencies. The biggest beneficiary of the Elon Musk-fueled bull market was Dogecoin, whose value rose an incredible 12,000% between January and the first week of May. $1,000 (\u20a6380,000) worth of Doge in January was worth $121,000 (\u20a646 million) just a few weeks ago.\n\nBut Musk has caused a different kind of turbulence, 49 days after that boom announcement.\n\nAt 11 pm on May 12, Musk tweeted ominously that Tesla will not be accepting Bitcoin for car payments. The reason given was that because Bitcoin takes a lot of energy to mine, it would be unfitting for a company that sells electric cars to directly encourage activities that potentially harm the environment.\n\nAnd just like that, the Cryptoverse has been in a tailspin.\n\nFrancis, a 21-year-old medical student, says more than half the value of his coins have vanished with Wednesday\u2019s dip. He is taking it cheerfully, mustering some laughter on our call. He suspects some foul play has fueled the dip.\n\n\u201cThis dip is because crypto whales have sold off en masse. After this dip, they will re-buy and make gains. I think this thing is planned.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence at the moment of a coordinated sell-off by BTC holders. Observers and long-time holders believe the cryptocurrency market is merely experiencing a correction, a tendency familiar with veteran stock market traders.\n\n\u201cThe case for Bitcoin hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Eloho Omame, co-founder of FirstCheck Africa, a Nigerian startup investment firm, told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cCrypto markets were always volatile. So honestly it\u2019s not fun, but it\u2019s not unexpected. Long term, I\u2019m bullish. So it doesn\u2019t really matter what happens today.\u201d\n\nThat feeling \u2013 that this dip is not abnormal or catastrophic \u2013 has helped keep heads cool even as crypto exchange apps continue to look bloody. Despite the crash in value, holders only lose when they sell off their assets at the current prices.\n\nThe second part of the Asemota tweet mentioned above projected strength: \u201cStill buying the dip on margin though. Worst case, I lose everything. Best case, I can afford another condo.\u201d (He explained his risk calculus in a follow-up tweet).\n\nOther bruised holders like Francis are confident of a rebound. \u201cThe only thing I can do [is] HODL,\u201d an acronym popular among crypto enthusiasts that could be interpreted as Hold On for Dear Life.\n\nOgechukwu is also holding on, saying he is in the game for the long haul. \u201cI won\u2019t be selling. I know I will still grow but looking at the value still makes my stomach churn.\u201d\n\nWhile it is mainly a consumer affair, Dip Day affects crypto companies who facilitate trades. Binance experienced network congestion on Wednesday (I tried to sign up, unsuccessfully). ETH and ERC20 withdrawals were temporarily disabled for about an hour.\n\nTomiwa Lasebikan, co-founder of Buycoins, a Nigerian crypto exchange, is looking beyond the moment.\n\n\u201cWhat matters is my long term thesis and aggressively improving the tech so it\u2019s tangibly accessible to as many people as possible around the world,\u201d he told TechCabal.\n\nWhat does Musk, the unanimous hero and villain of this story so far, think of all this?\n\nTesla has \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 19, 2021\n\nWhich, in the crypto world, is another code for \u201cHODL!\u201d",

          "text": "ZOLA Electric, one of Africa\u2019s leading renewable energy providers, has launched a robust distribution scheme to drive market penetration and access to its product in its quest to provide clean, effective, and reliable power anywhere.\n\nOlufemi Ashipa, Ag. Managing Director, ZOLA Electric Nigeria\n\nAlready, ZOLA Electric has signed into their distribution network some of the leading distributors of solar and renewable products across Nigeria and has opened its doors to onboard even more. Blue Camel, a leading provider of renewable energy solutions including PV panels, solar streetlights, solar home systems, and a major distributor for global solar brands, was recently signed into the scheme. Blockchain, Black bit Solar, Shokenny Solutions, Enersys Energy, Solarmate Energy, and SOSAI Renewables are already in different stages of the distribution partnership.\n\nAlmost half the population has no access to electricity. The rest of the Nigerian population is grossly underserved by the electricity grid. As a result, diesel generators are the default source of power, with an estimated 100 million people currently relying on diesel generators each day (GTM, 2019). According to Nigeria\u2019s Rural Electrification Agency (REA, 2017), the use of these generators collectively costs Nigeria\u2019s households and businesses nearly USD 14 billion every year, while the Energy to Access Institute (Dalberg, 2019) estimates that fuel subsidies for small gasoline-powered generators cost the government USD 1.6-2.2 billion each year. Besides the economic costs, diesel generators entail significant health risks including lung disorders caused by emissions, as well as environmental risks including air and noise pollution. Diesel generators produce about 29 million metric tonnes of CO2 emissions each year in Nigeria, a total comparable to the annual emissions from 6.3 million passenger vehicles.\n\nSigning on distribution partners will contribute significantly to help bridge the electricity supply deficit by expanding access to ZOLA\u2019s innovative power solutions across the country.\n\nThe move by the brand, which currently serves over one million users across three continents in over ten countries, is part of its efforts to boost its current market operation, as well as provide reliable power solutions to markets that lack energy access and make it possible for homes and businesses across Africa and anywhere in the world to generate, store and consume energy sustainably.\n\nAdebimpe Adebisi, Business Development Manager, ZOLA Electric Nigeria; Olumide Ajayi, Group Director, Technical Operations, ZOLA Electric; Enobong Kennedy, Group Marketing Director, ZOLA Electric; Olufemi Ashipa, Ag. Managing Director, ZOLA Electric Nigeria and Natasha Amaefuna, Business Development Manager, ZOLA Electric during the ZOLA Electric Media Meet at the ZOLA Experience Centre in Lagos on Tuesday, May 18, 2021.\n\nCommenting on the development, the Ag. Managing Director, ZOLA Electric Nigeria, Olufemi Ashipa, said; \u201cThe solar space in Nigeria has come a long way from the days of using dirty and expensive power resources to clean energy sources, offering modular and scalable technology. Since many customers do not have existing appliances, ZOLA is able to offer a closed-loop system that guarantees a certain baseline of performance and runtime.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTelda raises $5m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "In the past few days, many crypto currencies have wiped off significant gains made since the beginning of the year renewing fears of the 2017 burst, where the price of bitcoin crashed from around $20,000 to below $3,500.\n\nBut experts say this time the price decline is different, as the market has stronger fundamentals and is coming into maturity on the back of institutional investments and growth in emerging market consumers.\n\n\u201cThis bitcoin bull run is not just from institutions,\u201d Marcus Swanepoel, CEO/co-founder of Luno, a global crypto currency exchange with a significant presence in emerging markets like Nigeria and other African countries, says in a tweet. \u201cOur (retail) volumes in South Africa, Malaysia, Nigeria, and Indonesia all trebled over last month and at all-time highs. Emerging market consumers are voting with their money and they\u2019re ready for a better financial system,\u201d Swanepoel notes.\n\nMore investors in the market mean renewed scrutiny into the workings of the very infrastructure that powers the market and how it is deployed. There are questions about environmental impact, use cases, illicit activity, and regulation.\n\nBitcoin, the most valuable crypto asset, has been the most affected with the price falling by over 30 percent from as high as $58,000 it recorded last week to around $36,000. It recovered on Wednesday towards $40,000 and settled around $40,229 on Thursday morning.\n\nAccording to Chainalysis, the end-of-day bitcoin price has fallen by over 25 percent over seven days on four other occasions since the start of 2017. These were December 24, 2017, when the price fell from the $20,000 peak of the 2017 bull run; February 5, 2018, when the price fell below $10,000 as the bull run ended; November 25, 2018, when the price went to $4,000 as crypto winter set in, and Mid-March 2020, when the price fell as low as $4,000 as financial markets reacted to COVID-19.\n\nEthereum price, which surged to an all-time high of $4,308 about seven days ago, dropped to $2,200 on Wednesday before recovering above $2,800. As of press time, the price was at $2,684 on Thursday.\n\nWhile the price fall at 30 percent is high, the price level of both Bitcoin and Ethereum is still significantly high at over $40,000 and $2,000 respectively. The price decline\n\nEnvironmental impact\n\nLong before Elon Musk and Tesla came along, there have been debates over the electricity consumption of bitcoin mining and the impact it has had on the environment and climate change.\n\nIt takes 10 minutes to mine one bitcoin. At 600 seconds (10 minutes), all things being equal, it will take 72,000GW (or 72 Terawatts) of power to mine a bitcoin using the average power usage provided by ASIC miners.\n\nIn explaining why it suspended bitcoin payments, Tesla said it was concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.\n\nA report by the BBC in February found that the bitcoin network consumes 121.4TWh of power per year, which means that it would be the 29th highest energy-consuming country in the world, above Argentina and below Norway.\n\nIt is however important to also acknowledge that fiat currency printing and minting, gold mining, and the banking system consume far more energy than bitcoin mining.\n\nHowever, stakeholders in bitcoin mining and operations say the technology is built in such a way that it incentivises the use of clean power. This is because it is currently much cheaper than non-renewables, and in an industry with such significant financial rewards, this matters. Miners will always go wherever they can use the cheapest power, and they will move to those regions where power is cheapest.\n\nA report by payment firm, Square, also explains that renewable sources typically produce excessive supply when demand is low. Conversely, they struggle to provide enough when demand is high. The Square report recommends addressing divergent renewable production and demand for electricity by building an ecosystem \u201cwhere solar/wind, batteries, and bitcoin mining co-exist to form a green grid that runs almost exclusively on renewable energy.\u201d\n\nUse cases\n\nThe use cases of crypto currencies remain a concern of many institutional investors. In the past, the most uses for bitcoin have been as a speculative asset \u2013 investors stake capital in hopes of trading for high capital.\n\nBut crypto currencies like bitcoin have potential for transforming payments and remittance in the financial services sector. This is why the market continues to celebrate the entrance of payment institutions such as PayPal, Mastercard, and Visa in the market. US banks like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have also provided support for their investors in crypto currencies.\n\nData from Chainalysis show that institutional investors have spent $410 billion to acquire their current bitcoin holdings. $300 billion of this has made a loss at a price of $36,000. However, the remaining $110 billion in profit is greater than all that had been spent to acquire all bitcoin held in mid-March 2020, when the last major price fall occurred.\n\nIllicit activities\n\nThis is one sore spot that critics of crypto currencies easily spotlight. In Nigeria where authorities have taken a hard stance on the market, the financial regulator accuses crypto currencies of funding terrorism and kidnappings, two malaise fuelling insecurity in the largest country in Africa.\n\nIronically, long before crypto currencies became a trend in the country, fiat has funded criminal networks wreaking havoc, and also oiled the bank accounts of corrupt politicians. But the anonymity of crypto currencies is making it very attractive for criminals.\n\nCybercrimes are also rising with criminals demanding for payment in crypto currencies. A report on Ransomware 2021 by Chainalysis found that known payments to attackers rose 337 percent from 2019 to 2020, when they reached over $400 million worth of crypto currency. Ransomware is reportedly the fastest growing segment of cryptocurrency-related crime, with victim payments to attackers growing 311 percent to reach nearly $350 million worth of crypto currency.\n\n\u201cAttackers show no signs of slowing down in 2021, and have already taken in more than $81 million from victims so far this year. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that these are low-end estimates, and that the true numbers are almost certainly higher,\u201d the report released in May 2021, noted.\n\nIt is a challenge that many crypto currency operators are still scrambling for answers for. In the absence of regulation, crypto currency exchanges have since taken up the challenge to build their own security firewalls, these efforts have mostly paid off as the number of breaches has reduced significantly.\n\nRegulation\n\nInstitutional investors are also wary of regulatory positions that do not favour the crypto currency market. China, which has since 2017 flirted with the idea of not supporting crypto currency transactions, this week reiterated that financial institutions and payment companies were banned from providing services related to crypto currency transactions, and warned investors against speculative crypto trading.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) toed a similar prohibitive path in February 2021. India is also planning a review of regulation for the crypto currency market. The Indian government is reportedly looking at the possibility of regulating crypto currency. Unlike China and Nigeria, Indian authorities think a blanket ban recommended by former finance secretary Subhash Garg in 2019 has become out-dated.\n\n\u201cThere is a view within the government that the recommendations made by the Subhash Garg committee are data and a fresh look is needed at use of cryptos rather than a total ban,\u201d a source said.\n\nIn Nigeria, the government is not totally aligned with an outright ban of the market. The Vice President and many lawmakers have disagreed with the CBN on the prohibition, recommending regulations for the market instead.",

          "text": "Ondo State Governor and Atedo Peterside have faulted the comment by the attorney-general of the Federation, Abubakar Malami opposing the ban on open grazing. They have said such a view was deceptive.\n\nRecall that the Southern Governors forum took the decision in the meeting in Asaba, the Delta State capital recently; they had complained that the movement of armed herders, bandits into the Southern region had constituted security breaches which had affected the everyday lives of the people.\n\nOpen grazing is the archaic practice of moving ruminant animals in open fields, plains and bushes in search of pasture or foliage, in recent time it had led to clashes between farmers and herders across Nigeria with thousands of lives lost, while thousands have also been displaced from their ancestral homes.\n\nBut speaking in an interview on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today Programme Wednesday, Malami, noted that such a decision would not stand because it violates Nigerians right to free movement, violating the provision of the law of the country.\n\nHowever, in a tweet Thursday, Atedo noted that the constitutional right to movement of people does not correspond to the free movement of cattles and destruction of properties across the country.\n\n\u201cIt is disingenuous to link a ban on open grazing to the constitutional right to the free movement of persons. The later does not extend to the free movement of cattle, goats, sheep etc through farms with the attendant destruction of somebody\u2019s harvest,\u201d Atedo said.\n\nAkeredolu, who is the chairman of Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, spoke in a statement he personally signed on Thursday, titled, \u2018Our decision is irreversible and will be enforced\u2019.\n\nThe Ondo Governor, urged the AGF to challenge the Southern Governor\u2019s position on open grazing in court, stressing that Malami\u2019s view on the issue was wicked considering the problems and damage of open grazing to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI have just read the press statement credited to the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Shehu Malami SAN on the resolution of the Southern Governors Forum to ban open grazing in their respective States.\n\n\u201cIt is most unfortunate that the AGF is unable to distill issues as expected of a Senior Advocate. Nothing can be more disconcerting. This outburst should, ordinarily, not elicit response from reasonable people who know the distinction between a legitimate business that is not in any way injurious and a certain predilection for anarchy.\n\n\u201cClinging to an anachronistic model of animal husbandry, which is evidently injurious to the harmonious relationship between the herders and the farmers as well as the local populace, is wicked and arrogant.\n\n\u201cComparing this anachronism, which has led to loss of lives, farmlands and property, and engendered untold hardship on the host communities, with buying and selling of auto parts is not only strange. It, annoyingly, betrays a terrible mindset,\u201dpart of Akeredolu\u2019s statement read.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nGovernor of Ondo State and chairman of Southern governors forum, Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), has described the opposition of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr Abubakar Malami, to the ban placed on open grazing in the Southern part of the country as very unfortunate, and not expected of someone who bears the title of Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN).\n\nMalami had appeared as a guest on Channels Television on Wednesday, where he faulted the decision of Southern governors to ban open grazing during their meeting in Asaba last week, describing it as unconstitutional and an infringement on the herders right to freedom of movement, which according to him, cannot stand.\n\nMalami went on to compare open grazing to spare parts business, noting that Northern governors might as well ban spare parts dealers from operating in the North.\n\nBut responding to his position in a statement on Thursday, Akeredolu maintained that the ban was sacrosanct, adding that Malami\u2019s comparison of open grazing with the selling of spare parts is annoying.\n\n\u201cI have just read the press statement credited to the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr Shehu Malami SAN on the resolution of the Southern Governors Forum to ban open grazing in their respective States,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe AGF is quoted to have said that this reasoned decision, among others, is akin to banning all spare parts dealers in the Northern parts of the country and is unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cIt is most unfortunate that the AGF is unable to distill issues as expected of a Senior Advocate. Nothing can be more disconcerting. This outburst should, ordinarily, not elicit a response from reasonable people who know the distinction between a legitimate business that is not in any way injurious and a certain predilection for anarchy.\n\n\u201cClinging to an anachronistic model of animal husbandry, which is evidently injurious to the harmonious relationship between the herders and the farmers as well as the local populace, is wicked and arrogant.\n\n\u201cComparing this anachronism, which has led to the loss of lives, farmlands, and property, and engendered untold hardship on the host communities, with buying and selling of auto parts is not only strange. It, annoyingly, betrays a terrible mindset.\n\n\u201cMr Malami is advised to approach the court to challenge the legality of the Laws of the respective States banning open grazing and decision of the Southern Governor Forum taken in the interest of their people. We shall be most willing to meet him in Court.\n\n\u201cThe decision to ban open grazing stays. It will be enforced with vigour.",

          "text": "A Chinese deep-sea drilling rig recently drilled to a depth of 231 meters on a seabed more than 2,000 meters beneath the sea level in the South China Sea, setting a new world record in deep-see drilling depth.\n\nBefore that, the maximum designed drilling depth of deep-sea drilling machines around the world was 200 meters, and the actual depth drilled in pressure coring was 135 meters.\n\nThe Chinese drilling rig Hainiu (meaning \u201cmanatee\u201d) II, developed by Hunan University of Science and Technology (HNUST), signifies that China has theoretically acquired the capability to explore all maritime resources as a front runner in deep-sea drilling.\n\nPressure core sampling is a unique technique of Hainiu II, which enables the rig to retrieve core samples from the ocean floor while maintaining in-situ pressure. It is considered vital for exploring flammable ice, a methane-laced ice crystal, and some other seafloor minerals.\n\nFlammable ice is in ice form only when it\u2019s under seawater pressure. Once withdrawn from the depth it is adapted to, it would volatilize due to decompression. That\u2019s why such substances can only be retrieved with pressure core sampling.\n\nAs the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea stipulates, resources from high seas are the common heritage of mankind, and countries that carry out sea exploration at a certain sea area should generally be given priority in exploiting resources at the waters.\n\nExperts believe the Hainiu II gives China a competitive edge over other countries in the research and development of solid mineral resources in the seabed.\n\nThe Hainiu II drilling rig has made a series of technological breakthroughs, such as whole-process pressure coring, as well as high-capacity drill rods and fast connection & release, said Wan Buyan, a professor with the HNUST and chief researcher of the Hainiu II project.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAll the core technologies were independently developed by Chinese researchers, which have obtained 125 Chinese patents and four international ones, Wan added.\n\nThe smart drilling machine can be operated by one person alone on a mother ship. While drilling and sampling, it can also detect rock electrical resistivity and porosity, and take photos in the borehole.\n\nChina has placed increasing importance on the R&D of marine equipment over the recent years. Deep-sea drilling technologies are important for the manufacturing techniques of other deep-sea equipment, and are able to drive the development of relevant industries.\n\nOver 10 years ago, almost all the equipment on China\u2019s research vessels was imported, Wan recalled. Now, however, more than 80 percent of the devices used in Chinese expeditions are domestically produced, and the proportion will continue to grow in the future, he added.\n\nWan disclosed that the research team of Hainiu II will further improve the performance of the drilling machine to make it more adaptive, better complete operations, and become more intelligent.\n\nThe team plans to put the drilling rig into an exploration operation at the Mariana Trench with a depth of over 10,000 meters, where no seabed drilling has ever been performed, Wan said.",

That\u2019s why such substances can only be retrieved with pressure core sampling.\n\nAs the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea stipulates, resources from high seas are the common heritage of mankind, and countries that carry out sea exploration at a certain sea area should generally be given priority in exploiting resources at the waters.\n\nExperts believe the Hainiu II gives China a competitive edge over other countries in the research and development of solid mineral resources in the seabed.\n\nThe Hainiu II drilling rig has made a series of technological breakthroughs, such as whole-process pressure coring, as well as high-capacity drill rods and fast connection & release, said Wan Buyan, a professor with the HNUST and chief researcher of the Hainiu II project.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAll the core technologies were independently developed by Chinese researchers, which have obtained 125 Chinese patents and four international ones, Wan added.\n\nThe smart drilling machine can be operated by one person alone on a mother ship. While drilling and sampling, it can also detect rock electrical resistivity and porosity, and take photos in the borehole.\n\nChina has placed increasing importance on the R&D of marine equipment over the recent years. Deep-sea drilling technologies are important for the manufacturing techniques of other deep-sea equipment, and are able to drive the development of relevant industries.\n\nOver 10 years ago, almost all the equipment on China\u2019s research vessels was imported, Wan recalled. Now, however, more than 80 percent of the devices used in Chinese expeditions are domestically produced, and the proportion will continue to grow in the future, he added.\n\nWan disclosed that the research team of Hainiu II will further improve the performance of the drilling machine to make it more adaptive, better complete operations, and become more intelligent.\n\nThe team plans to put the drilling rig into an exploration operation at the Mariana Trench with a depth of over 10,000 meters, where no seabed drilling has ever been performed, Wan said.",
          "summary": "A Chinese deep-sea drilling rig recently drilled to a depth of 231 meters on a seabed more than 2,000 meters beneath the sea level in the South China Sea, setting a new world record in deep-see drilling depth.\nBefore that, the maximum designed drilling depth of deep-sea drilling machines around the world was 200 meters, and the actual depth drilled in pressure coring was 135 meters.\nThe Chinese drilling rig Hainiu (meaning \u201cmanatee\u201d) II, developed by Hunan University of Science and Technology (HNUST), signifies that China has theoretically acquired the capability to explore all maritime resources as a front runner in deep-sea drilling.\nExperts believe the Hainiu II gives China a competitive edge over other countries in the research and development of solid mineral resources in the seabed.\nDeep-sea drilling technologies are important for the manufacturing techniques of other deep-sea equipment, and are able to drive the development of relevant industries.",

However, the increase in the number of livestock also led to pressure on the pastures and the severe decline of the grassland ecology. Faced with the dual pressure of protecting the grassland and increasing income, Zarut Banner began to implement a policy of reducing sheep and increasing cattle.\n\nWhile other herders were still waiting to see, Honggelbatel made up his mind to sell all of his sheep. He adopted measures such as scientific livestock breeding, grassland grazing, and breed improvement. He also began to shift toward eco-tourism.\n\n\u201cSheep eat a lot of grass and shave grass roots, but cows eat the tip, which will not affect the growth of the grass. The same grassland, different pressure. I used to raise more sheep, and it took nearly a million yuan to buy forage. Under the guidance of the government and experts, we continue to improve the breeds, to raise fewer but better cattle, which not only improves economic efficiency but also protects the ecological environment,\u201d Honggelbatel said.\n\n\u201cLiving a happy life is the primary human right,\u201d as President Xi Jinping pointed out in his congratulatory letter to the symposium marking the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. China embraces a human rights philosophy that centers on the people, and regards the rights to subsistence and development as the basic human right of paramount importance.\n\nContrary to the unfounded allegations in Western media in recent years, the facts in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region show that the cause of human rights in China has made headway on all fronts. Several measures proved that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been fully committed to implementing China\u2019s Human Rights Action Plan from 2016 to 2020, respecting and safeguarding the rights of ethnic minorities to use and develop their own cultures and languages, and protecting and caring for the rights of disadvantaged groups.\n\nNowadays, the family ecological ranch of Honggelbatel is continuously expanding, with modern facilities readily available. Relying on beautiful natural scenery and transportation advantages, Honggelbatel has built several yurts on the ranch and started a pastoral tourism industry, receiving thousands of tourists every year. He took the initiative to provide stable jobs for the surrounding poor households and lead them to improve their lives together.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Mongolian herder Hein helps out on the ranch from May to October every year during the peak tourist season. With the help of the government\u2019s poverty alleviation policy, he moved from an earthen house to the new building, and now he has a stable job. \u201cThanks to the good policies of CPC and government, there is nothing to worry about in my life,\u201d Hein said.\n\nAt the same time, ethnic Mongolian women are more confident while their living conditions are improved and their own cultural characteristics are vigorously promoted.\n\nSince participating in Mongolian embroidery skills training organized by the Horqin Right Wing Middle Banner government, Liu Menglan\u2019s embroidery had increased the family\u2019s income by about 20,000 yuan per year. In 2017, Liu Menglan started learning Mongolian embroidery, and has now become a first-level embroiderer. She has taught more than 70 apprentices.\n\nIn 2019, Liu\u2019s family has been completely lifted out of poverty. \u201cIn the past, dry days caused poor harvests, life was sad and difficult. In recent years, with the help of the government, we moved into a new house and learned new skills.

If there is any dissatisfaction, I would say, it will be better to learn embroidery earlier!\u201d\n\nToday, nearly 30,000 women in Xing\u2019an League, North China\u2019s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, have gathered to learn and pass on Inner Mongolia\u2019s intangible cultural heritage like embroidery and paper cutting.\n\n\u201cThe greatest benefit of the promotion of Mongolian intangible cultural heritage by the government is that it has improved production methods in rural areas that have been dominated by male labor for a long time.

Today, you can spend the whole day without catching anything.\n\n\u201cOil was first pumped in Ogoni in 1956 by Shell. Since then, several international oil companies have extracted oil from across the Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cIn Ogoni and elsewhere, communities have faced an environmental catastrophe. About 40 million litres of oil are spilled every year across the Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cAir, land and water have all been contaminated, with studies reporting devastating effects on residents\u2019 health and livelihoods.\n\nVast areas of the state\u2019s waterways and mangrove swamps, one of the most diverse ecosystems in Africa have been destroyed or put at risk.\n\n\u201cFarmland has been cloaked in oil, contaminating crops and exposing people to high levels of heavy metals such as chromium, lead and mercury among others\u201d, Fabeke said.\n\nOur correspondent reports that Shell did not explicitly say that it would exit onshore Nigeria completely or give a timeline for any potential asset sales.",

Biobelemoye Joy Josiah, expressed shock that such barbaric, primitive and anarchist action could still be practiced in modern day Nigeria.\n\nTherefore, he proposed May 18, to be tagged as a sad day for democracy and a day of mourning by people of the state.\n\n\u201cI want to use this occasion to register our utmost displeasure, disgust and dismay at the naked display of executive rascality exhibited by the Executive Governor of Kaduna State, Mal.

El-Rufai to mass sack workers whose only offence is that they chose to serve their fatherland faithfully and diligently with all man made inconveniences is most unfortunate.

          "text": "It is an uncommon development in modern days for a sitting President to die on the battlefield. But that was what happened in the Republic of Chad recently.\n\nMarshal Idris Deby Itno, a veteran of many battles and President of Chad, had led his forces into the field, as it was his wont. He won the battle, but didn\u2019t win the war. The war for life, for survival, after he got fatally shot.\n\nChad rallied itself, did perhaps the next best thing by setting up a Transitional Military Council, headed by the son of the deceased, Lt. Gen, Mahamat Idris Deby Itno. That Council is to run the country for 18 months, organize elections, and return the land to constitutional order.\n\nOn Friday last week, President Muhammadu Buhari played host to Lt Gen Mahamat Itno at State House, Abuja. Rather ironically, the visit came some weeks after the father had been hosted in the same diplomatic room, unknown to us all that it was the final adieu. He had come to say goodbye. And like they say, there\u2019s no good in goodbye.\n\nLt Gen Mahamat is slight of frame. Not half as tall as his late father, who almost always stood shoulder to shoulder with our President. And Muhammadu Buhari, as you know, is a tall man.\n\nA brief digression: It is said that after the military coup of 1967, which saw Yakubu Gowon emerge as head of state, there was the search for who would be his Aide de Camp (ADC). Some young officers were assembled, including a certain Captain Buhari, who was presented to the new leader.\n\nGowon was said to have looked at the proposed ADC, observed his height, and remarked: \u201cHe is too tall. People would think he\u2019s the head of state, and not me.\u201d Lol.\n\nThe new leader settled for one Captain William Walbe, who was not as tall as Buhari, but fortuitously, the man bypassed for his height eventually became head of state years later, and a twice elected democratic leader. Your height (or lack of it) may be indicative of many things about you.\n\nBack to Lt Gen Mahamat, the transitional leader of Chad. He is slight of build, but that stature belies the weighty responsibility on his shoulders. He must combat a fierce insurgency against his country, fight terrorism alongside Nigeria and other neighbors, re-stabilize his country, and return the land to democratic rule. All within 18 months.\n\nAs President Buhari received him in the forecourt of the Presidential Villa, I had a sense of deja vu. Here in this same place, weeks before, Idris Deby Itno had been received. He was ushered into the Diplomatic Room, where t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate discussions held. He was hosted to lunch, addressed the Press, and then left. It was the final hurrah, but we didn\u2019t know.\n\nMahamat sat in the same seat where his father had sat weeks before. And he addressed our President. He thanked him and Nigeria for the solidarity delegation sent to Chad, after the passage of his father, and recounted how the tragic incident happened:\n\n\u201cMercenaries from Libya, with sophisticated weapons, had joined insurgents to attack Chad. Marshal went to face them with his troops. It was a bitter-sweet victory, because we won the battle, but lost Marshal in the process.\n\n\u201cAn emergency meeting of the National Assembly, Security Council, and the Supreme Court was summoned, to prevent chaos and instability in the country. The National Assembly gave the reins of power to the military to conduct the transition, and the Supreme Court concurred.\n\n\u201cOur main objective is the security and cohesion of the country. We\u2019ve won the battle, but the war is still going on. We will have democratic, free polls in 18 months.\u201d\n\nChad has appointed a Prime Minister.

          "title": "Opinion: How my father died in battle, by Mahamat Idris Deby Itno \u2013 By FEMI ADESINA",
          "text": "It is an uncommon development in modern days for a sitting President to die on the battlefield. But that was what happened in the Republic of Chad recently.\n\nMarshal Idris Deby Itno, a veteran of many battles and President of Chad, had led his forces into the field, as it was his wont. He won the battle, but didn\u2019t win the war. The war for life, for survival, after he got fatally shot.\n\nChad rallied itself, did perhaps the next best thing by setting up a Transitional Military Council, headed by the son of the deceased, Lt. Gen, Mahamat Idris Deby Itno. That Council is to run the country for 18 months, organize elections, and return the land to constitutional order.\n\nOn Friday last week, President Muhammadu Buhari played host to Lt Gen Mahamat Itno at State House, Abuja. Rather ironically, the visit came some weeks after the father had been hosted in the same diplomatic room, unknown to us all that it was the final adieu. He had come to say goodbye. And like they say, there\u2019s no good in goodbye.\n\nLt Gen Mahamat is slight of frame. Not half as tall as his late father, who almost always stood shoulder to shoulder with our President. And Muhammadu Buhari, as you know, is a tall man.\n\nA brief digression: It is said that after the military coup of 1967, which saw Yakubu Gowon emerge as head of state, there was the search for who would be his Aide de Camp (ADC). Some young officers were assembled, including a certain Captain Buhari, who was presented to the new leader.\n\nGowon was said to have looked at the proposed ADC, observed his height, and remarked: \u201cHe is too tall. People would think he\u2019s the head of state, and not me.\u201d Lol.\n\nThe new leader settled for one Captain William Walbe, who was not as tall as Buhari, but fortuitously, the man bypassed for his height eventually became head of state years later, and a twice elected democratic leader. Your height (or lack of it) may be indicative of many things about you.\n\nBack to Lt Gen Mahamat, the transitional leader of Chad. He is slight of build, but that stature belies the weighty responsibility on his shoulders. He must combat a fierce insurgency against his country, fight terrorism alongside Nigeria and other neighbors, re-stabilize his country, and return the land to democratic rule. All within 18 months.\n\nAs President Buhari received him in the forecourt of the Presidential Villa, I had a sense of deja vu. Here in this same place, weeks before, Idris Deby Itno had been received. He was ushered into the Diplomatic Room, where t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate discussions held. He was hosted to lunch, addressed the Press, and then left. It was the final hurrah, but we didn\u2019t know.\n\nMahamat sat in the same seat where his father had sat weeks before. And he addressed our President. He thanked him and Nigeria for the solidarity delegation sent to Chad, after the passage of his father, and recounted how the tragic incident happened:\n\n\u201cMercenaries from Libya, with sophisticated weapons, had joined insurgents to attack Chad. Marshal went to face them with his troops. It was a bitter-sweet victory, because we won the battle, but lost Marshal in the process.\n\n\u201cAn emergency meeting of the National Assembly, Security Council, and the Supreme Court was summoned, to prevent chaos and instability in the country. The National Assembly gave the reins of power to the military to conduct the transition, and the Supreme Court concurred.\n\n\u201cOur main objective is the security and cohesion of the country. We\u2019ve won the battle, but the war is still going on. We will have democratic, free polls in 18 months.\u201d\n\nChad has appointed a Prime Minister. He is the man who came second in the presidential polls won by Marshal Itno, but he was not officially inaugurated for another term before he died. The country is setting up something akin to Government of National Unity, and will hold a national dialogue, to chart a path for the future.\n\nGen Mahamat said something that President Buhari had always maintained, and over which the wailing wailers would often go into overdrive. He declared that the main source of instability in the Sahel region was Libya, which was overtaken by anarchy, after the fall of Moamer\n\nGadaffi from power.\n\n\u201cPlenty of mercenaries with sophisticated weapons are threatening our region from Libya, \u201c Gen Mahamat submitted.\n\nHe urged the United Nations and other international organizations to ensure that the mercenaries were disarmed, \u201cand reintegrated in an orderly fashion,\u201d warning that if such was not done, \u201cmore chaos and instability lay ahead in the Sahel.\u201d\n\nMahamat recalled that President Buhari and his late father were close friends, adding: \u201cI am here to reaffirm that relationship, and for you to support our transition.

We are ready to be guided by you as we return to constitutional rule.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari told Itno the son that his father was his guest only few weeks before the sad passage, \u201cand our relationship was both personal and national.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, when I first emerged President, I visited all our neighbors. It made sense to do so, as we were thus able to help our countries and region.\n\n\u201cThe situation in the North-east of Nigeria is best known by the people living there. The improvements could not have been achieved without the cooperation of Chad and Niger Republics. Nigerians know and appreciate our neighbors, and we will be glad to continue the collaboration, as we are bound together by geography.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari said Chad has been steadfast in helping Nigeria fight terrorism, \u201cand we will help you to a smooth transition. We will help in diverse ways we can. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask whatever help we can render. That is the least we can do in memory of Marshal Idris Deby Itno.\u201d\n\nAnd that is President Buhari for you.

          "text": "The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has backed the decision of Southern governors to ban open cattle grazing in their domains.\n\nThe body said the ban would help address farmers \u2013herders\u2019 crisis.\n\nNational Patron of MACBAN, Senator Walid Jibrin, who spoke in Kaduna on Thursday said as a concerned Fulani Leader in Nigeria, he had a free mind on anyone recommending a ban on open grazing, free movement of herders and cattle in Nigeria because the practice was getting outdated internationally and is therefore necessary for Nigeria, especially Fulani race to study critically the traditional open grazing believing that the 21st century might never accommodate it.\n\nHe said when one looked at the practice of open grazing in Nigeria compared with what is happening Internationally, Nigeria could never continue with traditional open grazing practice.\n\nAccording to him, in order to effect a change, the Fulani elite should be bold enough to come out with alternatives to open grazing and advise the Fulanis in Nigeria accordingly.\n\nJibrin added that most importantly, the various Fulani Associations with membership up to 50 must come together and talk with one voice on this tradition of open grazing and not necessarily allow any group to come out to do it for them.\n\n\u201cI have fully observed the feeling of many groups and individuals in Nigeria about open grazing. There is so much condemnation from Nigerian Governors, Northern Governors, Southern Governors etc.\n\n\u201cThese groups and individuals should never be condemned and must be praised for their bold comments trying to modernise and improve cattle rearing in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnother reason why we should shun away from open grazing is the way old methods of settlements of crises between herdsmen and farmers have been abandoned,\u201d he said.\n\nJibrin congratulated all the governors for the bold steps they are taking to curve the menace of open grazing, kidnapping and banditry.\n\nHe said Nigeria must remain one entity and one Nigeria as against what is happening now.\n\n\u201cWe should rely more on dialogue and mediation with herders, Fulani leaders, Traditional rulers and our Governors in order to end this feud.\n\n\u201cFinally I strongly appeal to the Federal and State Governments to maintain all existing grazing reserves by providing special amenities mentioned in my earlier suggestions.\n\n\u201cIt is also necessary that Government uses the services of World Bank to archive all plans that will come out of well modernised Grazing Reserves in Nigeria,\u201d he suggested.",

Tanko Sununu said there is need for amendment of the existing National Health Insurance Scheme Act for actualisation of the Universal Health Coverage and by extension, health security.",

          "text": "The House of Representatives has called on the Federal Government to stop the proposed increase of electricity tariff for June.\n\nThis formed part of the resolutions by the lawmakers during Thursday\u2019s plenary in the lower chamber of the National Assembly in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThey stressed that it was important to direct the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to rescind its decision on the proposed increment in view of the hard times Nigerians were going through.\n\nSimilarly, the lawmakers mandated the House Committees on Power, Poverty Alleviation, as well as Labour, Employment and Productivity to ensure compliance with the directive.\n\nA member of the House, Aniekan Umanah, had raised a motion seeking that the nation\u2019s electricity regulator should suspend the proposed increase in electricity tariff.\n\nHe wondered why there would be an increase in electricity tariff at a time when Nigerians were going through hard times and governments all over the world were providing means to cushion the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to the motion, the Electric Power Sector Act of 2005 established the NERC with a mandate to license Distribution Companies (DISCOs), determine operating codes and standards, establish customer rights and obligations, as well as set cost-reflective industry tariff.\n\nThe lawmaker stated that the Act prescribed its funding from 15 per cent of electricity charges paid by consumers to distribution companies.\n\nHe decried that NERC, working with the distribution companies, had increased the tariff five times since 2015, the latest being on January 1, 2021.\n\n\ufeff\n\nLack Of Empathy\n\nDespite the increases, Umanah lamented that Nigerians have not enjoyed significant improvement in power generation but grapple with daily epileptic services from the DISCOs.\n\nHe also accused the distribution companies of exploitation in the name of estimated billing arising from non-metering of over 50 per cent of consumers across the country.\n\nThe lawmaker informed his colleagues that poor services by the DISCOs have impacted negatively on the socio-economic growth of the country, saying the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Report of 2020 on Nigeria indicated that the manufacturing sector lost over $200 billion to inadequate power supply while $21 billion was said to have been spent by Nigerians on generators within the period under review.\n\nHe noted that Nigerians have gone through many hardships in recent times arising from acts of terrorism, banditry, and kidnappings.\n\nUmanah said he was concerned that at a time governments all over the world were adopting measures to cushion the effects of the COVID\u201319 pandemic by providing a wide range of palliatives to losses of loved ones, jobs, businesses and general distortion in the social life, NERC was considering a further increase in electricity tariff in a country where two-thirds of its 200 million population were grappling with the effects of the pandemic.\n\nHe stressed that the current economic recession made worse by inflation has resulted in disturbing prices of foodstuffs, and increased prices of petroleum products have triggered the further increase in transport costs and rents.\n\nThe lawmaker added that the spending power of an average Nigerian has drastically reduced, warning that any further hike in electricity tariff would amount to overkill, lack of empathy, and height of insensitivity on the part of the government.",

The AGF is quoted to have said that this reasoned decision, among others, is akin to banning all spare parts dealers in the Northern parts of the country and is unconstitutional.\n\nIt is most unfortunate that the AGF is unable to distill issues as expected of a Senior Advocate. Nothing can be more disconcerting. This outburst should, ordinarily, not elicit a response from reasonable people who know the distinction between a legitimate business that is not in any way injurious and a certain predilection for anarchy.\n\nClinging to an anachronistic model of animal husbandry, which is evidently injurious to harmonious relationship between the herders and the farmers as well as the local populace, is wicked and arrogant.\n\nComparing this anachronism, which has led to the loss of lives, farmlands, and property, and engendered untold hardship on the host communities, with buying and selling of auto parts is not only strange. It, annoyingly, betrays a terrible mindset.\n\nMr Malami is advised to approach the court to challenge the legality of the Laws of the respective States banning open grazing and the decision of the Southern Governor Forum taken in the interest of their people. We shall be most willing to meet him in Court.\n\nThe decision to ban open grazing stays. It will be enforced with vigour.\n\nSIGNED\n\nARAKUNRIN OLUWAROTIMI O AKEREDOLU, SAN\n\nGOVERNOR, ONDO STATE",

          "text": "The BBC has offered an unconditional apology after a report found a prominent journalist used \u201cdeceitful\u201d methods to secure a landmark interview with Princess Diana as her marriage broke down.\n\nBBC journalist Martin Bashir conducted the career-defining interview with Diana in 1995, in which she detailed her breakdown of her relationship with Prince Charles.\n\nThe report, written by former judge Lord Dyson, found that Bashir had shown fake bank statements to Diana\u2019s brother Charles Spencer, which \u201cdeceived and induced him to arrange a meeting with Princess Diana.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy gaining access to Princess Diana in this way, Mr Bashir was able to persuade her to agree to give the interview,\u201d the report notes, adding that this behavior was in breach of BBC guidelines.\n\nBBC Director-General Tim Davie said Thursday the interview \u201cfell far short of what audiences have a right to expect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the BBC cannot turn back the clock after a quarter of a century, we can make a full and unconditional apology. The BBC offers that today,\u201d Davie said.\n\nBashir has long been alleged to have used forged documents that suggested the palace staff were working against Princess Diana and being paid to spy on her.\n\nMatt Wiessler, a former graphic designer for the BBC, said he mocked up false bank statements after Bashir reached out to him.\n\nThursday\u2019s report found that Bashir also likely created another set of fake bank statements, which he again showed to Spencer.\n\nThe 1995 interview was a seismic moment in British public life. During the event, Diana told Bashir that there were \u201cthree of us\u201d in her marriage to Charles, referring to Camilla Parker Bowles, whom the heir to the throne would later marry.\n\nBuckingham Palace was blindsided by the interview and thrown into crisis by Diana\u2019s comments, which cast a rare light on the inner workings of the royal family.\n\nThe broadcaster launched an internal inquiry in 1996 and concluded that documents had been forged but didn\u2019t play a role in Diana\u2019s decision to participate in the interview.\n\nThe report is critical of both Bashir\u2019s behavior and of the way the 1996 probe was carried out by the BBC.\n\nIt concludes that \u201cwithout justification\u201d the BBC \u201ccovered up\u2026 facts as it had been able to establish about how Mr Bashir secured the interview.\u201d\n\nThe BBC\u2019s former director-general Tony Hall, who was in charge of news and current affairs at the time of the controversy, said Thursday that he was \u201cwrong to give Martin Bashir the benefit of the doubt,\u201d according to PA Media news agency.\n\nLast week Bashir stepped down from his role as the BBC\u2019s religion editor, citing health reasons.\n\nThe BBC\u2019s investigative current affairs show Panorama \u2014 the same program which featured the 1995 interview \u2014 will air a documentary on the controversy on Thursday.\n\nThe program will examine the inside story of how Bashir obtained the interview, and how the BBC responded when it discovered he had faked bank statements and shown them to Earl Spencer.",
