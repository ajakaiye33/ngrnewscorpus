James Pam, said: \u201cWe want the public to know that the people of this LGA have experienced the highest number of assaults by herders as documented by Stefanos Foundation a member of our coalition between 2001 and 2020, they recorded a total of 625 attacks with 151 of them (that is, 24 per cent ) taking place in Barkin Ladi LGA.\n\n\u201cThe public should know that this is not the first time that the people of that LGA are requesting for a name change, but the third time. They definitely have good reasons for the request and denying them this right goes against natural law, Nigerian laws, and international conventions to which Nigeria is a signatory.\n\n\u201cFive Bills simply sought to change or correct the names of seven LGAS in Nigeria. While 4 four bills for six name changes or corrections received the favour of almost all Senators present. However, 26 Senators from at least nine states voted against the change of Barkin Ladi\u2019s name.\n\nOn the rejection of the bills seeking the advancement of the rights of FCT\u2019s original inhabitants, Pam applauded Members of the House of Representatives for passing the bills for a Mayor and a Minister for the FCT but bemoaned the Senate\u2019s unwillingness to adopt the proposed laws.\n\n\u201cThese people graciously surrendered their ancestral homes so that Nigerians may have central and befitting Federal Capital City. Yet their desire was denied by our Senators Note that their Traditional Rulers have not been accorded the same status by the FCT administration as other States are doing. We feel this is very unfair treatment of a minority group,\u201d he added.\n\nHe urged the national assembly to reconsider their positions by passing the six rejected bills.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Okowa\n\nBy Senator Ifeanyi Okowa\n\nThe first part of this piece published on Friday posits that citizens are under obligation to obey the laws of the land\n\nTHE rest of the population avoid paying tax and for the same reason that the Jews detested paying it \u2013 that governments are corrupt, wasteful, and inefficient. But the word of God does not excuse Christians from this responsibility under any circumstance.\n\nChristians are supposed to model the right example as the light of the world (Matthew 5:14). We are to let our \u201clight so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven\u201d (Matthew 5:16). It is incumbent on us to ensure that our works survive the purifying fire of the Holy Spirit \u201cfor we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that everyone may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad\u201d (2 Cor. 5:10).\n\nFor every Christ follower who wants to hear the words, \u201cwell done thou good and faithful servant\u201d (Matthew 25:21-23), it is exigent that we obey God in this matter of taxes so that we can have consciences \u201cvoid of offence towards God, and toward men\u201d (Acts 24:16). Another way we respect the law of the land is by obeying building regulations.\n\nOur salt and light status is severely compromised when churches join others to flout these regulations at will but cry foul when they are sanctioned. We are to submit to the nation\u2019s laws and regulations if they do not conflict with the laws of God.\n\nWhere there is a conflict, we are duty bound to obey the higher law of God because there is a limit to political authority, which is delegated from God because \u201cwe ought to obey God rather than men\u201d (Acts 5:29). A classic example is the case of Shiphrah and Puah, the Egyptian midwives who disobeyed the directive of Pharaoh to kill the newly born Hebrew males (Ex. 1:17).\n\nWe also have a responsibility to pray for our leaders and others. Prophet Jeremiah wrote: \u201cAnd seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives and pray unto the Lord for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace\u201d(Jer. 29:7).\n\nApostle Paul exhorted: \u201cI exhort, therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour\u201d (1 Tim 2:1-3).\n\nIt is instructive that Paul told Timothy as Bishop of the Church at Ephesus that one of the first things the congregation must do as they gather for worship is to pray \u201cfor kings and all that are in authority.\u201d And he gave the reason for this: \u201cthat we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty\u201d.\n\nHere is the evidence that God holds the church responsible for the peace, progress, and prosperity of the country. While the political leaders will ultimately be held accountable for their actions and inactions, God expects the church to stand in the gap and ensure that God\u2019s will for good governance is enthroned in the land.\n\nIt really doesn\u2019t matter who is in power; what matters is the power that is controlling the person. Hence, as a church we are to keep praying for the right persons to get into leadership, pray for those in leadership \u2013 the president and his staff, governors and their aides, legislators, elected officials, judges, political appointees, captains of industry \u2013 that the Spirit of God will touch their hearts and lives, and work through them so that we will enjoy a quality of life that produces joy, fulfilment, and overall prosperity.\n\nIf our prayers must work, we must refrain from speaking negatively about our country. Proverbs, the book of wisdom, affirms that \u201cby the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked\u201d (Prov.11:11). It is a law of the spirit that you will have what you say (Mark 11:23, 24).\n\nMy observation is that our actions after we have prayed are far more important than our prayers. Oftentimes, as Christians we pray but we cancel our prayers through negative confessions about our country. James cautioned us about using the same mouth to bless and curse: \u201cMy brethren, these things ought not to be so\u201d (James 3:10). As Christians, we have a moral obligation to bless our country and speak positively about its people, the leaders, and the future.\n\nThirdly, we must share the gospel. Before He ascended into Heaven Jesus commissioned His disciples and, by implication, Christians of all ages. \u201cGo ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\n\nHe that believeth and is baptised shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\n\nSo then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen\u201d (Mark 16:15-20).\n\nEvangelism remains the primary mission of the church and there are three basic ways we are to fulfil this commission: Preaching \u2013 It is God\u2019s eternal will for \u201call men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth\u201d (1 Tim. 2:4). Preaching the gospel is every Christian\u2019s calling and responsibility.\n\nWe must use every available means to proclaim this truth to sinful humanity wherever we are located \u2013 offices, industry, politics, government, entertainment, media, academia. The simple message of the gospel is that \u201cChrist died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures\u201d (1 Cor. 15:3,4).\n\nThose who accept this message by faith receive the gift of salvation and become heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ (Rom. 8:16-17). Salvation is free but it cost God the life of His precious son.\n\nFurthermore, churches must have well defined structures and programmes geared towards the unfinished task of global missions and evangelism. I agree with what someone said that a church should be measured by its sending capacity not by its seating capacity.\n\nOur desire for societal transformation begins through transformed individuals; God changes the world one person at a time. Transformed hearts and minds are veritable instruments for change, development, and societal advancement.\n\nBeing a Witness \u2013 Acts 1: 8 says: \u201c\u2026Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.\u201d We are not witnesses of Christ by words alone; our faith must impact our conduct and character otherwise it is in vain. A sage once said, \u201cpreach the gospel at all times, use words if necessary.\u201d Apostle Paul enjoined us to live in such a manner that we are living \u2013 and walking \u2013 epistles \u201cknown and read by all men. (2 Cor. 3:2).\n\nTo be concluded\n\nSenator Ifeanyi Okowa, Governor of Delta State, presented this keynote address to the standing committee meeting of the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), at the Diocese of Evo, All Saints Cathedral, Rumuokwurusi, Obio, Port-Harcourt, Tuesday, February 22, 2022\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

The security agents that had arrived with over 70 battle-ready personnel, barricaded the street, stopped and screened all human and vehicular movements into the secretariat. Members of staff, visitors and journalists that were allowed into the complex were equally thoroughly screened.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nThe arrival of the Governor of Niger State, Sani Bello accompanied by the women representative in CECPC, Stella Okotete, the Youth Leader, Ismail Ahmed, David Lyon, Prof. Tahir Mamman, Senator Ali Abba, Sen. Ken Nnamani and Sen. Yusuf Yusuf, around 12 noon, further heightened the tension and anxiety.\n\nHailed by crowd of party supporters and staff, Governor Bello, earlier reported to have taken over the running of the party from the Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Governor Mai Mala Buni, presided over an emergency meeting held by the committee.\n\nShortly after the meeting by the Caretaker Committee and inauguration of the state chairmen, seven governors, comprising Yahaya Bello (Kogi), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Hope Uzodimma (Imo), Abdulraman Abdulrazak (Kwara), Babagana Zulum (Borno), Inuwa Yahaya (Gombe) and Dapo Abiodun (Ogun) had visited the secretariat in what Governor Bello described as show of solidarity.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen after the meeting, Governor Bello, said though he had the endorsement of President Muhammadu Buhari to take charge of the party, he cannot confirm whether the Yobe governor had been shoved aside completely.\n\nAnnouncing that the presence of the state chairmen that came for inauguration was responsible for the rowdy situation at the secretariat, Governor Bello claimed that he was just acting on Buni\u2019s behalf.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nOn the rowdy situation, he said: \u201cEvery time there is a major event, we beef up security. Today, we have a major event and all the chairmen came in. And they are to maintain law and order.\u201d\n\nAsked how often he would be in charge, he said: \u201cAlmost everyday,\u201d adding: \u201cmost of my colleague governors are here to support me to receive the report from the zoning committee. You know the zoning committee report is a very important one. And all the governors here are here to support me. Now, at zonal level, they can go and do their work. What is going on today, does it have the blessing of the president? \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nAsked in what capacity he presided over the meeting and whether he had been confirmed as chairman, he said: \u201cI have been acting for a while since the chairman traveled. As for your question for me to confirm the news that I have been appointed to take over from Buni as the acting Chairman, I can only say that it is news and I don\u2019t have comment.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

They can\u2019t disprove that. But, that was where the problem arose.\n\n\u201cThe governors were angry when they heard that the CECPC secretary had been in charge in Buni\u2019s absence. They asked why he transferred power to the secretary when, in fact, he, Buni, could have handed over to one of the governors. That was the crux of the matter, as at last weekend\u2026\u201d the source disclosed.\n\nMeanwhile, the national leadership of the party had earlier dismissed the report of change in the leadership of the party, describing it as fake news.\n\nThe statement signed by the Secretary APC Caretaker Committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, urged members and supporters of the party to remain calm.\n\n\u201cThe APC is a progressive political party guided by rules. Leadership changes are not announced by \u2018sources\u2019 through name dropping in the media.\n\n\u201cWe urge our teeming supporters, members and indeed the general public to remain calm and support the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led APC CECPC conduct a rancour-free and credible National Convention deserving of our great party,\u201d the statement read.",

          "title": "NCDMB: Afreximbank Invested over $42bn in African Enterprises in Five Years",
          "text": "\u2022Africa must address funding, technology, other limitations to achieve energy security, says Sylva\n\nPeter Uzoho\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) yesterday disclosed that the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) had invested more than $42 billion in support of African businesses between 2016 and 2020.\n\nPresident of Afreximbank, Professor Benedict Oramah, stated that the continental multilateral institution was presently the largest lender to the multi-million dollar 650,000 barrels per day Dangote Refinery currently under construction at the Lekki Free Trade Zone, Lagos.\n\nThey spoke at a forum with the theme, \u201cEvolving a Pan-African Strategy Towards Sustainable Funding of Africa Oil and Gas Projects,\u201d targeted at oil and gas practitioners especially member nations of the African Petroleum Producers Organisation (APPO).\n\nSpeaking yesterday at the maiden edition of the African Local Content Investment Forum (ALCIF) in Lagos, Executive Secretary of NCDMB, Mr. Simbi Wabote, described Afreximbank as one bright spot in the continent mandated to finance and promote intra and extra-African trade.\n\nWabote recalled that Afreximbank signed a $1.04 billion facility with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited to finance the exploration of petroleum during the second intra-Africa trade fair which held in Durban, South Africa, few days after the completion of Climate Change Conference (COP-26) in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn respect of African institutions, one bright spot is the African Export-Import Bank (Afrexim Bank), a pan-African multilateral financial institution mandated to finance and promote intra-and extra-African trade based in Cairo, Egypt.\n\n\u201cIt is very instructive that Afreximbank signed a $1.04 billion facility with the NNPC Limited to finance the exploration of petroleum during the second intra-Africa trade fair which held in Durban, South Africa, few days after the completion of COP-26 event in Glasgow.\n\n\u201cFor a bank that disbursed more than $42 billion between 2016 and 2020 in support of African enterprises, there is no doubt that Afreximbank is an institution of note in consideration of the quest for funding hydrocarbon development projects in Africa.\u201d\n\nThe executive secretary said African Development Bank (AfDB) made similar financial support to African businesses in line with the bank\u2019s objective to spur sustainable economic development and social progress in member countries thus contributing to poverty reduction.\n\nAccording to Wabote, AfDB has the African Development Fund (ADF), which became operational in 1974 and has cumulatively invested $45 billion over its 44 years of operation on the African continent.\n\nNoting that the fund had not been used much in the hydrocarbon sector, he said there was opportunity to engage AfDB to utilise part of the fund for gas development, which could be of interest to its largely Western donor countries against the backdrop of disruption in gas supplies in Europe.\n\nAt country level, according to Wabote, Nigeria represents a bright spot in the provision of funds that can be sourced for the execution of oil and gas projects. He explained that the funds included the Nigerian Content Intervention Fund (NCIF) and other funds that could be sourced from Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), like the Bank of Industry (BOI), Nigerian Export-Import Bank (NEXIM Bank) ,and other special funds managed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nHe cited the NCDMB partnered with BOI to establish the $300 million NCI Fund and the NCDMB partnership with NEXIM bank to create a$50-million fund for Working Capital and for Women in Energy.\n\nIn the area of research and development, Wabote said the NCDMB had sponsored the patent for some inventions, and had commenced the process of commercialising those inventions.\n\nHe also said a $50-million Research and Development (R&D) Fund was also launched to enable research and development in the oil and gas industry.\n\nBeyond the provision of intervention funds as loans to industry players, he maintained that the board had also entered into partnerships with project promoters in the hydrocarbon sector.\n\nIn the aspect of modular refineries, the executive secretary noted that NCDMB was serving as a catalyst in the development of four modular refineries with the 5,000bpd Waltersmith Modular Refinery already in operation.\n\nHe pointed out that the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), played a role in seeing the project to fruition, listing the other three modular refineries under construction as the 2,500bpd Duport Modular Refinery, 2,000bpd Atlantic Refinery and the 12,000bpd Azikel Modular Refinery.\n\nWabote explained that the essence of the event was for stakeholders to develop a robust response to the push for Africa to abandon her hydrocarbon resources.\n\nThe forum, he further explained, was to highlight some of the bright spots of the business, both at the national and continental levels to attract or deploy funding to the oil and gas industry, and propose some ideas to enhance continental collaboration and global support for fossil fuels.\n\nHe explained, \u201cAlready, some European banks are pulling out of hydrocarbons development projects and most International Operating Companies are shying away from investments in hydrocarbon projects to avoid backlash from green energy activists.\n\n\u201cThis unfolding scenario is of huge concern to African leaders and policy makers in the oil and gas industry. It is, therefore, critical that we explore the necessary steps required to address this funding and investment challenge so that our hydrocarbon resources are not abandoned below the surface, like many African countries, including Nigeria, abandoned their coal mines.\n\n\u201cIt is a bit of a comfort that some African countries have made some in-roads in securing funding and investment for the development of hydrocarbon projects with strategic partnerships with countries that have not turned themselves to oil and gas adversaries such as China and India.\n\n\u201cOther African countries are also doing their bit to develop infrastructure and processing plants for the hydrocarbon value chain but there is need to do more.\n\n\u201cOne of such bright spots is the 650,000bpd Dangote Refinery which is now mechanically complete. This investment represents a major testament of the emerging crop of bold and audacious African businessmen positioning themselves and the continent on the map of the required energy mix for mankind.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that there was a genuine battle for the soul of the hydrocarbon industry in Africa, adding that Africans must all rally to save the industry or stand by while the continent perishes right in front of our eyes.\n\nIn his remarks, Oramah, who was represented at the forum by the bank\u2019s Director/Global Head, Advisory and Capital Markets, Mr. Ibrahim Sagna, said Afreximbank had invested a total of $4 billion as of the third quarter (Q1) 2020 to support businesses in Nigeria.\n\nHe said by Q3 2021, the number of funds invested in the country passed $5 billion, adding that in the last four months, the bank has supported the NNPC Limited with $1 billion.\n\nOramah stated, \u201cBy the third quarter of 2020, our total investment is about $4 billion. By the third quarter of last year, the number has passed $5 billion. Over the last four months, we\u2019ve given $1 billion for NNPC.\n\n\u201cWe signed $5 billion agreement with NNPC. We signed an MOU of $5 billion with UTM Offshore. Also, the BOI which was mentioned, we provided over \u20ac700 million bond for them last week.\n\n\u201cIn a bid to mobilise global financing to Africa, we have also lent some of the largest syndications in the sector. In fact, about the largest refinery in the world, which is the Dangote Refinery, we are today, the largest lender to that facility.\u201d\n\nIn his keynote address, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, who was represented at the occasion by Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Mr. Nasir Gwarzo, said Africa must address funding, technology and other limitations in the oil and gas industry in order to attain energy security and in-continent value addition.\n\nSylva listed some of the limitations as, \u201cdearth of funds to finance its oil and gas sector projects; limitations in technology mastery to manage the oil and gas industry; high-end skills gap; inadequate energy infrastructure to sustain oil and gas industry operations; undeveloped internal market for hydrocarbon derivatives and overdependence on sale of crude oil for foreign exchange and budget financing.\u201d\n\nHe said Africa\u2019s energy transition should be anchored on maximising fossil fuels (gas) utilisation and investment in renewable energy projects.\n\nWith over 600 million people living without access to modern energy, the minister said Africa\u2019s energy demand in 2035 would be 40 per cent higher than it is today, compared to 10 per cent higher for global energy demand. The minister said this growth would be driven by industrialisation, population and expansion in economic activities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

One APC governor from the North declared triumphantly, \u201cwe are going to have our convention at last.\u201d\n\nBut a group, APC Youth Development and Solidarity Forum (APC-YDSF), has declared Buni\u2019s removal as chairman of CECPC as illegal and akin to a coup.\n\nTHISDAY had learnt that with just a note of his directive to the SGF, President Muhammadu Buhari, had on Sunday, actuated the leadership change witnessed yesterday at the national headquarters of the ruling APC in Abuja, before departing for London on medical grounds.\n\nAlthough Buhari was wary of the implications of arbitrarily removing the former chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Mai Mala Buni, the president had also considered his options after consulting and thus, with a note, gave detailed instructions on what to do.\n\nAccording to Villa sources, those who could read between the lines saw the handwriting on the wall, when at the point of departure to London, the president said: \u201cThe party has all it takes to resolve all convention issues\u2026 and the March 26 convention would go on as scheduled.\u201d\n\nInside sources hinted that the president had been inundated with unsavoury reports of mismanagement and alleged corruption against the Buni leadership.\n\nBut he had often dismissed the allegations as lacking proof, until he was able to see first-hand, how the Yobe State governor, had truly messed things up, including encouraging a court case against the party to prevent it from conducting the convention.\n\nBased on that, and with the convention just a little over two weeks away, the president, sources stated, saw the danger in not acting in time to save the situation as well as give confidence to members and supporters of APC.\n\nTherefore, before leaving for London on Sunday, the president left a note, instructing without equivocation, that the APC leadership must change.\n\nThe Villa source explained: \u201cWhat happened was that, after some governors went to ambush the president, while he was about to travel and convinced him that the Buni-led committee was foot-dragging on holding the convention on March 26, and that there was no preparations to indicate any serious plan on the convention, the president got angry and asked that Buni should be removed.\n\n\u201cFirst he tried to get hold of the SGF, but couldn\u2019t reach he him on phone. So, he called the Permanent Secretary in the Villa, who took down note of what the president\u2019s directive was. It was the Permanent Secretary, who now decided to recap all what the president said on the note to Boss Mustapha, that first, dissolve the committee; secondly, let Bello act and thirdly, that March 26th is sacrosanct. Those were the three instructions to be relayed to the SGF for action.\u201d\n\nThe THISDAY Source further explained that while the choice of the Niger State governor was not originally the Buhari\u2019s, as the suggestion came from the governors, who saw the mistake in appointing a first term governor as chairman of the committee, he did not object to it and gave his express approval.\n\nAccording to the THISDAY source, some of the governors, who ambushed the president before leaving for London included the Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum and Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi; the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai; the Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu; the Jigawa State Governor, Mohammed Badaru Abubakar; the Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong and the Niger State Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello.\n\nHowever, Bello, after meeting with members of CECPC at the national secretariat of the party, where he had his maiden interaction, served a notice of NEC, including the need to prune down the national convention sub-committees.\n\nAn APC source, who hinted at the purported notice for the NEC meeting noted that, \u201cSo, NEC would hold any time after the seven days notice. The minimum notice for NEC is seven days and after that, NEC can hold.\u201d\n\nAsked if NEC would sack Buni, the source was straight to the point: \u201cWell, there is only one item on the agenda for NEC to deal with and it is the convention. But anything can come under Any Other Business. That means anyone can stand up to say he is passing a vote of no confidence on Buni, because technically by law, he is still Acting Chairman of the CECPC.\u201d\n\nBello, who further announced the need to prune down all the sub-committees set up by Buni for the purpose of the national convention, argued that, the party did not need as many people as his predecessor had appointed.\n\nThe acting caretaker committee chair, according to the source, explained that the sub-committees, which was made up of about 1,700 people was too unwieldy, arguing that the party didn\u2019t need more than about two hundred people.\n\nHe was of the view that the new membership of the sub-committees must reflect all the various interests in the party, such as Governors, Senators, members of house of representatives, etc nominating members of the committee, rather than one person drawing up the entire list of convention sub-committee members.\n\nDwelling in Bello\u2019s first day in office, the source explained that, \u201cThe truth is that the chairmen have been sworn in, the zonal committee has submitted its report and by tomorrow, the sub-committees would be sworn in, so things are moving ahead. Governor of Niger was appointed to act any way. He had been acting in that capacity even before.\u201d\n\nThe source explained thus: \u201cThe committees were not dissolved. What they said was that the committee were too many. We had 1,700 people in committees and so, he said they should go and prune down the list and also make sure it covers every body\u2019s interest. So, it was more about his reluctance to do what was expected of him. There appeared to be a reluctance to hold the convention.\n\n\u201cThe thing to take away from the president\u2019s decision, it came about against the background of what he was told that Buni was not preparing to hold the convention.\n\n\u201cThe President was angry by the report and expressed his dissatisfaction with the NWC \u2013 something like an expression of loss of confidence in their ability to ensure that we have the convention on March 26. Therefore, he felt it was better to find a way to relieve them of their responsibilities. A team that would ensure that the convention holds.\u201d\n\nBello\u2019s maiden meeting had nine out of the 12 members of the CECPC in attendance, including the secretary of the committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, who had earlier denied a THISDAY exclusive report about imminent leadership change but had since not deemed it fit to retract his gaffe or apologise, after deliberately embarrassing a foremost national daily with a terse but false statement.\n\nTHISDAY had earlier reported that there was palpable tension at the headquarters of the party, as officers of the Nigeria Police took over the secretariat. The police numbering about 70 had come with 10 vehicles and cordoned off the secretariat situated at Blantyre Street to prevent any breakdown of law and order as early as 8am.\n\nThis followed an earlier exclusive report by THISDAY that Buhari approved Buni\u2019s removal and in his stead, appointed Bello. This was because a faction of APC governors had allegedly complained to the president that Buni was not inclined to holding the convention as rescheduled as there were no preparations on the ground to indicate a readiness to do so.\n\nAPC Governors Switch Support, Line Behind Bello\n\nNot surprisingly, the APC governors appeared to have left Buni in the lurch after Professor Babagana Zulum of Borno, Babjide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, Yahaya Bello of Kogi, Hope Uzondinma of Imo, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun, Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe, and AbdulRahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara, stormed the national secretariat of the party to show support for theirNiger State counterpart.\n\nIn his first official assignment as acting caretaker chairman of the party, Bello inaugurated the APC state chairmen.\n\nAddressing journalists after the inauguration yesterday in Abuja, Bello said the governors were at the secretariat to show him support.\n\nWhen asked if he had taken charge of the party, Bello said, \u201cActing chairman? I have been acting for a while since the chairman travelled. Every time there is a major event, we beef up security. Today, we have a major event and all the chairmen came in. And they are to maintain law and order.\u201d\n\nOn the question of how often he would come to the party secretariat, Bello said, \u201cAlmost everyday\u201d, adding, \u201cMost of my colleagues are here to support me to receive the report. You know the zoning committee report is a very important one. And all the governors are here to support me. Now, at zonal level, they can go and do their work\u201d.\n\nAsked if the happenings at the party had the blessing of Buhari, he said, \u201cOf course\u201d.\n\nHowever, when Akpanudoedehe was asked if he still stood by his earlier statement that there was no leadership change in the party, he referred THISDAY to the statement made by Bello, where he said he was the acting national chairman of the party, because Buni was out of the country.\n\nThe apparently mystified secretary told THISDAY that he was not the right person to answer the question, adding that the question should be directed to Bello instead.\n\n\u201cI am not the right person to be asked this question. You should direct your question to the Niger governor. Whatever I say now will be like speculation, because I didn\u2019t speak with the president and the president didn\u2019t speak with him,\u201d he said.\n\nLukman Sheds More Light on Why Buni Was Sacked\n\nThrowing more light on the latest development, former Director General of Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukman, said Buhari, like most party leaders and members, was highly disappointed at the deliberate efforts by Buni and his associates to block the APC convention from holding, based on alleged personal ambitions.\n\nLukman noted that between November 2021 and January 2022, the APC convention was postponed three times, because of deliberate refusal to initiate most of the processes required, such as booking the venue for the convention and serving the statutory three weeks\u2019 notice to INEC.\n\nLukman stated, \u201cIn addition, there were other serious allegations against the leadership of His Excellency, Mai Mala, which included the discovery that his group, since November 2022, had obtained a court injunction against the convention and are waiting until three or two days to the convention before serving it on the party to succeed in blocking the March 26 APC convention from holding.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the plot was for Buni to continue to run the affairs of the party and conduct the party primaries, where candidates for 2023 elections would emerge.\n\nLukman said there were specific allegations about Buni striking deals with some presidential aspirants to ensure their emergence as the presidential candidate of APC at the 2023 general election.\n\nHe stated: \u201cSome of the allegations suggest extorting money from these aspirants, including someone, who is yet to join the party. It is being alleged that campaign offices for the aspirant are already being opened even before such a person joins the party.\n\n\u201cA good confirmation of why it will be difficult for party leaders and members to continue to invest any trust on Buni leadership of the caretaker committee is the attempt to constitute another zoning committee after there is a decision by President Buhari and the Progressive Governors on zoning, based on which stakeholders of the party at zonal levels are to finalise negotiations on positions to go states.\n\n\u201cAs far as His Excellency Mai Mala is concerned, his interest is supreme and together with the secretary of the CECPC, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, and their collaborators outside the CECPC, they must block the APC convention from holding on March 26.\u201d\n\nLukman pointed out that anybody, who would emerge as a replacement to Buni and Akpanudoedehe, as chairman and secretary, would have all the requisite mandate of the organs vested with such responsibility as provided by the constitution of the party.\n\nHe said this was the time Buni, Akpanudoedehe, and all their collaborators were required to demonstrate their loyalty to the party and Buhari, noting that attempts to delegitimise the process of changing the leadership would only confirm their undertaker mission.\n\nIt\u2019s Illegal, Akin to Coup, Says Group\n\nA group, the APC Youth Development and Solidarity Forum (APC-YDSF), has insisted that Bihari had no right to order the removal of Buni without meeting with the members of the caretaker committee.\n\nNational Secretary of APC-YDSF, Hon. Tobias Ogbeh, while addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, declared that Buni remained the legitimate national chairman of the party and therefore, called for the expulsion of Bello from the party\n\nThe group stated, \u201cWe feel that Governor Abubakar Bello, lent himself for use as an agent of destabilisation of the APC, when this same party has been pivotal to his political growth as an individual. It is this party that made him governor today.\n\n\u201cAPC Youth Development and Solidarity Forum categorically re-states that President Muhammadu Buhari, without a meeting of the CECPC, has no right to order the removal of Buni or any member of the CECPC, who in the first instance, is a product of a collective decision of the party\u2019s NEC meeting held in Abuja sometime ago.\u201d\n\nThe group noted that before now, there were signs that some people within APC were out to sabotage the party, added: \u201cWe invite Nigerians to note that what Governor Abubakar Sani Bello and the group he is working for have done amounted to staging a coup, which is contrary to known democratic tenets. He has shown utmost disregard for the constitution of the party.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we hereby expel the Niger State Governor, His Excellency Abubakar Sani Bello, from the All Progressives Congress (APC) for violating the constitution of the APC, sabotaging the party, undermining the party\u2019s leadership, and engaging in acts capable of breaching the peace and security of Nigeria. His ward in Niger State has been contacted to effect his expulsion and escalate the same through the various layers to the national level as a matter of procedure.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022No arm of government can stop National Assembly from working, says Senate Minority Leader\n\nSunday Aborisade, Alex Enumah, Udora Orizu and Juliet Okojie\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Assembly has put on hold further legislative action on the letter from President Muhammadu Buhari seeking amendment to Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022. The decision was based on a court injunction, which temporarily stopped the institution from taking any action on the legislation.\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court Abuja on Monday temporarily restrained the National Assembly from deleting or taking any further steps regarding Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act 2022.Ekwo made the order while delivering ruling in an ex parte application brought by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) challenging the legality of the National Assembly\u2019s decision to amend a bill already signed into law by the president.\n\nBuhari had in his letter urged the National Assembly to expunge the controversial Section 84(12) in the Electoral Act, which mandates government appointees to resign their positions three months ahead of the primary elections of political parties where they would be delegates.\n\nThis, he had said, was in order to deepen democracy in the country. The section particularly barred appointed political office holders from voting or being voted for during conventions and congresses of political parties.\n\nBefore Buhari signed the bill into law on February 25, 2022, he was said to have reached an agreement with both the Senate and the House of Representatives for the lawmakers to expunge the section.\n\nHowever, the leadership of the nation\u2019s apex legislative institution in an exclusive interview with THISDAY, yesterday, said the court order would stall the debate on the document, billed for deliberation today.\n\nThe Chairman, Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Senator Ajibola Basiru, confirmed to THISDAY that the National Assembly would refer the court verdict to its team of legal advisers.\n\nBasiru said, \u201cWe will study the court judgement and we will get legal advice. At the moment we have not been served. When we are served we will study the order.\n\n\u201cWe have legal advisers who will advise us on the position to take. We will take action based on the legal advice.\u201d\n\nAsked if the National Assembly would go ahead with the deliberation on the egislation today, Basiru said \u201csuch decision would be taken by the leadership when they meet.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, Minority Leader of the Senate, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, told THISDAY that the judiciary could not stop the parliament from performing its constitutional duties.\n\nAbaribe said, \u201cUnder the Nigerian constitution, no other arm of government can stop the National Assembly from doing their work.\n\n\u201cIt is our job to debate any communication from the president on national issues. No court injunction can restrain us from performing our constitutional duties.\n\n\u201cWe will await the court order and see whether any judge in Nigeria will issue an order to stop the legislature from performing their function. We will debate and do anything that is in front of us in the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cWe just got the letter from the president asking us to consider an amendment to the Electoral Act 2022. I cannot speak on it until we debate it on the floor of the senate.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives vowed to argue against the demand by the president.\n\nMinority Leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu (PDP, Delta), in a chat with THISDAY, said the caucus was still studying the request and would certainly argue against it.\n\nElumelu said, \u201cWe are still studying the request but most certainly we argue against it.\u201d\n\nCorroborating, leader of the Peoples Democratic Party caucus (PDP), Hon. Kingsley Chinda (Rivers) also speaking to THISDAY, said all amendments would be considered on its merit.\n\nHe said the lawmakers would put into consideration the interest of the country.\n\nChinda stated that Buhari\u2019s request was no doubt to safeguard the interest of his lieutenants that desire to run for elective posts.\n\nHe said, \u201cAll amendments will be considered on their merit, putting into consideration the interest of the country and not the desires or interest of any citizen. The request of Mr. President is, no doubt, to safeguard the interest of his lieutenants that desire to run for elective posts. This law will transcend this government.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the House leader, Hon. Ado Doguwa (APC, Kano), said the House was yet to receive Buhari\u2019s communication for the amendment. Doguwa said when the communication comes; the lawmakers will do justice to it.\n\nHe added, \u201cFor me at the moment, there is already a legislation, formal legislation assented to by Mr. President in the name of electoral act amendment 2022.\n\n\u201cSo it is a law, if Mr. President or any Nigerian would like to come out for an amendment the procedures are there.\n\n\u201cI understand that there was a communication in the Senate to that effect, we have not yet received a communication to that effect, we have not yet received that communication in the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cThis you can quote me authoritatively, but when it comes, we will do justice to it. We will go through our procedures if that will permit us to do it.\n\n\u201cThe House has not taken any position on this. My opinion is that going by the electoral protocol worldwide, when you have a legislative framework that has to do with the electoral process of a country, you cannot alter any part of the law in less than one year to election.\n\n\u201cThat might be a very big challenge. I am not pre-empting the president request, i am not also pre-empting the position of the House. But I am afraid if the House will indulge such a request in a situation whereby it will amount to procedural breach of the expectation of the best practices of democracy worldwide. 360 days to election, we are advised not to temper with the elections framework.\u201d\n\nCourt Temporarily Stops NASS from Granting Buhari\u2019s Request\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, temporarily restrained the National Assembly from deleting or taking any further steps regarding Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nHowever, after listening to counsel of the PDP, Chief Ogwu Onoja, who argued the ex parte application, the court held that the application had merit and consequently granted it as prayed.\n\nEkwo held that all the defendants were restrained from taking any further steps regarding the request of Buhari for the deletion of Section 84 (12) pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.\n\nThe judge further ordered the applicant to serve the order as well as the process on all the defendants and adjourned till March 21, for hearing of the substantive suit.\n\nPDP dragged Buhari before a Federal High Court in Abuja over alleged fresh move to tamper with the newly amended Electoral Act signed into law by the president.\n\nThose sued alongside Buhari were the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Senate President, Speaker, House of Representatives, Clerk of National Assembly, Senate Leader, House of Representatives Leader and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nOthers included Deputy Senate President, Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Deputy Senate Leader, and Deputy House of Representatives Leader.\n\nThe plaintiff in the ex parte prayed the court for an order of interim injunction restraining the defendants from refusing to implement the duly signed Electoral Act or in any manner withholding the Electoral Act from being put to use, including the provisions of Section 84 (12) of the said Act, pending the resolution of the suit.\n\nThe plaintiff similarly prayed for another order restraining the National Assembly from giving effect to Buhari\u2019s request to remove Section 84 (12) from the Electoral Act or take any step that will make the provision inoperative pending the resolution of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.\n\nOnoja argued that Buhari, having assented to the bill on February 25, 2022, could not give any directive to the National Assembly to take immediate steps to remove the section or any section of the Act on any ground whatsoever.\n\nIn the main suit marked: FHC/ABJ/ CS/247/2022, the plaintiff wants the court to declare that Buhari\u2019s power as regarding law making was limited to assenting bill of the National Assembly or withholding assent and does not extend to giving conditional assent.\n\nThe PDP further wants the court to hold that Section 84 (12) is constitutional and liable to be enforced by INEC, who is the eight defendant in the suit.\n\nThe party further sought a declaration that Section 84 (12) was not inconsistent with or contradicts Sections 40 and 42 of the constitution and does not offend constitutional provisions on disqualification of a person from election to office.\n\nThe PDP accordingly asked the court for an order of mandatory injunction compelling INEC to put into immediate effect the Electoral Act including the said Section 84 (12).\n\nThey also prayed the court for an order of injunction restraining the defendants from treating Section 84 (12) as unconstitutional or in any manner denying it its efficacy or altering it on the grounds that it is unconstitutional.\n\nPDP also prayed for another order of injunction restraining the third to 12 defendants from implementing the directive of Buhari to amend Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act on the grounds that it is unconstitutional.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Togolese inventor builds $12,000 mini tractors for the West African market",
          "text": "First, he received awards for inventing the \u201cFoufoumix\u201d, which brings relief from hours spent pounding foufou. Then, Minsob Logou invented a mini-tractor, tailor-made for local conditions. Now, he wants to sell it across the region.\n\nThis article was contributed to TechCabal by Blame Ekoue of bird story agency.\n\nSeeing imported agricultural machinery \u2013 often paid for by government or donors \u2013 lying discarded due to the unavailability of local servicing or parts was enough for Minsob Logou to invest his time, money, and energy into a local solution for farmers. The result: the Logoutrac mini-tractor. It\u2019s a step out of the kitchen and into the field for this award-winning Togolese inventor.\n\nBetter known in Togo and the region as the \u201cfather of Foufoumix\u201d Logou requires little introduction to those who keep an eye on the world of African invention. As early as 2002, Logou was honoured for his work by the World Intellectual Property Organisation and in 2014, he placed second at the African Innovation Awards. His desire to invent is deep-seated.\n\n\u201cThe story started from a passion that I had from an early age for all things related to technology. Since the benches of the school, I had this thing in me for all that is technological. I have to try to see how they were designed, how we arrive at what we design can respond to a given functionality. This is what gave me all this knowledge today, which far exceeds what I learned on the benches,\u201d Logou explained.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBorn into a large family, his position as an engineer at Togo Telecom, though coveted, was not enough to stop the inventor from resigning to devote himself to finding solutions full time. His first big win came with an invention that allows cooks at home and in restaurants to replace hours of strenuous work \u2013 the Foufoumix. The industrial-looking kitchen unit has been a hit in West Africa to such an extent that knock-offs are now produced in China. Logou tries to provide local solutions to local problems.\n\n\u201cThe basis of my research to be able to create a product is the observation of my community. When I see that they are in need of something, I can create machinery to make it easier for them to obtain a result in order to improve performance and make their lives better,\u201d he said.\n\nThat was the thinking behind his latest invention, launched recently at his small factory located on the outskirts of the Togolese capital, Lom\u00e9. Logou describes his mini-tractor \u2013 which sports the \u201cLogoutrac\u201d brand \u2013 as a \u2018made-in-Togo mini-tractor, a versatile, powerful, and resilient machine\u2019.\n\nThe prototype for the tractor, which retails for the local equivalent of $12,000, was built using salvaged parts, with the idea that doing so would help buyers easily access spare parts. But due to high initial demand, the young Togolese engineer quickly took the next step.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stay in recovery or recycling anymore and I am now manufacturing some of the spare parts of this machinery myself,\u201d he explained.\n\nLogou said that the initial idea for the mini-tractor came from his frustration at seeing the vast amounts of money that are used to purchase foreign agricultural machinery, only for it to be abandoned because spare parts are too difficult to too expensive to purchase locally.\n\n\u201cThe solutions that we import from elsewhere, most of the time, fail to meet our needs. So we end up with problems in agricultural mechanisation. Big tractors don\u2019t last long in the field before they break down. And when they stall, first, the expertise to detect the breakdown is a problem and the same spare part must be ordered from the parent company, which is quite complicated,\u201d he lamented.\n\nThe $12,000-mini tractors built by Minsob Logou. Image credit: bird story agency.\n\nSelling at 7 million FCFA (the equivalent of around $12,000), the mini-tractors are built for a regional market as well as a local one. That is why Lougou is looking carefully at the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) to which Togo is a signatory \u2013 and which should help him sell his inventions across Africa. Currently, there are trade barriers in place which prevent significant exports.\n\n\u201cPeople are showing interest but so far, there has been no international export. We should do it but the problem is free trade between African countries,\u201d fumed Logou.\n\nCurrently, Logoutrac equipment is sold by agricultural groups and the Togolese Ministry of Agriculture. A lower-cost option is already in the works.\n\n\u201cSince the cost is not within the reach of all farmers, we are working on a tiller for those who cannot afford it,\u201d Lougou explained.\n\nLogou\u2019s other pet project is finding solutions to a far wider problem: counterfeiting. While counterfeiting is estimated at 10% worldwide, it reaches 30 to 80% of products sold in Africa, depending on the sector. He has good reason to want to bring an end to counterfeits, especially of his Foufoumix product.\n\n\u201cThere are Chinese choppers that our compatriots import to sell and announce that it is foufoumix, but the latter is a registered trademark which has a patent\u2026 Having had trials in this direction, the conclusion that I have drawn is that our justices in West Africa are not strong enough in the field of intellectual property. There is still a lot to be done,\u201d he says, adding that he has brought counterfeiters to justice but nothing has come out of it.\n\nTo deal with this problem, he prefers to focus instead on the quality of his products.\n\n\u201cThe struggle is to have quality products,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Jimi Daodu has always been entrepreneurial. Back at Babcock University, he had established an entertainment business that organised parties in the school. After Daodu completed his master\u2019s programme in Advanced Computing at the University of Bristol, he wanted to stay back in the UK for a couple of years to work and earn back his master\u2019s fees. At the time, Daodu recalled, the British government allowed international students to apply for a post-work-study visa, which grants one a two-year stay in the UK. Daodu got the post-work-study visa, but things started to look grim when, for months, he couldn\u2019t get a job. Frustrated from his job search, Daodu contemplated booking a return ticket to Nigeria and returning to his shoe selling business.\n\nHe eventually got a job that sustained him until he got yet another which secured a visa for him and got him to stay. In the past decade, Daodu has worked in project management, hospitality, financial services, and the telecommunications industries all in the UK.\n\nDaodu was born in Lagos, Nigeria, and lived most of his years in the bustling city. He had studied Computer Science at Babcock University before going to the UK for a master\u2019s degree in Advanced Computing at the University of Bristol.\n\nIn 2017, Daodu got into the crypto space, Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin (BTC) were buzzy, so, he bought a couple. He then stumbled on virtual lands and saw them as an opportunity to diversify his digital assets and, as a Nigerian accustomed to the notion that land is the best investment, he bought some, even though he knew nothing about virtual lands. He got 8 plots of land in virtual spaces: 2 plots in Decentraland and 6 in Somnium Space for $200 each.\n\nThe idea for what would become a blockchain-based metaverse company, Vault Hill, started to form last February when he got an email stating that there was an offer on his land. He accepted the offer and sold a plot of land in Somnium Space for $10,000. He was stunned because he hadn\u2019t gotten such a high return from the stocks and shares he had purchased.\n\nHe realised that the only reason the buyer paid that much was because of the value associated with the virtual land, so, he realised that there was a market there. When he shared his idea with his friends, they said, \u201dJimi, you have come with your ideas again!\u201d But Daodu assured them: \u201cThis is the one.\u201d\n\nFounder and CEO of Vault Hill, Jimi Daodu\n\nIn May 2021, Daodu started bootstrapping Vault Hill by selling a few investments as well as plots of land in Somnium Space, for amounts ranging from $9,000 to $12,000. To differentiate itself from other virtual spaces and metaverse, Vault Hill City (Vault Hill\u2019s Metaverse) has four different islands and each island has 7 human-themed districts: Play, Romance, Curiosity, Community, Idealism, Vitality, and Imagination. \u201cEach district is human-themed to ensure the metaverse is open to everybody. This space is infinite; it is hard to choose a target audience, so we want to build an ecosystem where anyone can come in.\u201d Currently, the cost of a plot of land in a district in Vault Hill City range between $2,000 and $2,600.\n\nDaodu describing a metaverse, said, \u201cMetaverse is a shared virtual space. It\u2019s like Twitter, but in a gamified perspective\u2014the use of augmented reality and virtual reality. In a metaverse, you have to create a digital representation of yourself called an avatar, which allows you to navigate the digital world since you can\u2019t go into the digital world with your physical body.\u201d Daodu\u2019s definition of a metaverse involves a connection to the blockchain, decentralised finance, and freedom from control by the government, or even private individuals.\n\nIt is in respect to this vision that Vault Hill is building through 3 phases and at the end of the third phase, Vault Hill is handed over to a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO)\u2014the community of token and landowners\u2014which will be responsible for decision making on its metaverse.\n\nVault Hill is building a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace to allow NFT artists to list their art on the metaverse and display it to potential buyers through a gamified experience. Vault Hill is also encouraging companies to build edifices in their metaverse. The two plots of land Daodu bought on Decentraland were merged together to build Vault Hill\u2019s sales office.\n\nVault Hill is also partnering with Ready Player Me to build out avatars and incorporate digital wearables and limited-edition accessories. It is also partnering with Nigerian brands including Crivel Watches and Looks Like a Good Man for corporate and traditional wear. \u201cAdditionally, we are currently working to have interoperability of avatars. That is, using one avatar across multiple metaverses instead of having to create one for Vault Hill, and another for Decentraland,\u201d Vault Hill said. Vault Hill Part is also partnering with Lingua54 to use machine learning to translate the speeches of avatars across different languages in real time.\n\nAs funding was a constant headache for the team, Vault Hills started talking to traditional venture capitalists to raise funds, but a lot of them didn\u2019t understand what they were building. A senior colleague, at the time, had said \u201cIf you\u2019re talking to VCs, and they don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re building, you\u2019re doing something right.\u201d\n\nTo meet its funding needs, Vault Hill created a token called VHC token\u2014which is currently going for $0.003697 on Coin Market Cap, as of the time of writing. With it, Vault Hill raised $2.1 million in pre-pre-seed and private equity rounds, selling 25% of its total supply of tokens of 340 million. The majority of the fund will go into product development and hiring, Daodu said.\n\nMajority holders of the VHC token or majority landowners in the Vault Hill City will have voting power in the DAO. The VHC token will serve as a medium of a transaction within the metaverse, give majority token holders voting power in Vault Hill\u2019s proposed DAO and reward content creators when they get to sell or get traction for their artworks and content.\n\nDaodu speaks about the challenges of building a metaverse company: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a book on how to build a metaverse, so there isn\u2019t anything like what a good one looks like.\u201d But one challenge stands out: getting talent. \u201cYou need a host of developers\u2014extended reality developers, a mix of augmented and virtual reality developers, blockchain developers, full-stack developers, etc, but because it is an emerging technology and these skills are not taught in most traditional schools yet, they can be difficult to find.\u201d\n\nBut Daodu is optimistic, especially about the increase in VR adoption in recent years, which he said is both the cost and effect of the cost of the tech. \u201cAs adoption grows, the cost of technology always drops. The Oculus quest is retailing for $300, would that get to $50- $100 at some point in time? Absolutely. People are already spending $1,000 on an iPhone every year.\u201d\n\nDaodu noted that Vault Hill is not building an escapism platform, but intentionally thinking about how humans do things in the real world and then creating a way to augment it virtually\u2014with an ultimate aim of fostering human interaction. For example, in its Vitality district, it will collaborate with physiotherapists to help people with mental health challenges and create an augmented reality (AR) consultation service for London Bridge sports medicine, which will allow patients that can\u2019t come in physically for consultation in the hospital to get consultation services through augmented reality.\n\nThe first glance of Vault Hill City will be up by Q2 2022 and by the end of the year, it will be fully running. \u201cUsers will be able to design their own unique experiences, explore their fantasies, and also enjoy activities they do in the physical world such as interacting with other users, attending events, playing games, curating arts, exercising, host shows, visiting a library, build a music studio, and so much more,\u201d Vault Hill said. \u201cUsers will be able to access the metaverse using a virtual reality headset for a fully immersive experience. But they will also be able to explore the metaverse through laptops.\u201d\n\n\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Two years and 3 million rides later, can SafeBoda keep its lead in Nigeria?",
          "text": "On Wednesday, Ibadan-based Ugandan bike hailing startup SafeBoda clocked two years of operating in the Nigerian market.\n\nSafeBoda launched in Nigeria in December 2019 but started operations in January 2020. The startup had initially set to launch in May 2019 but months of deliberations\u2014including that of the best city market entry\u2014delayed its launch.\n\nThen, finally, in a surprising move which immediately created an outlier reputation for the company, SafeBoda skipped Lagos, the Nigerian commercial hub, to launch in Ibadan, a decision that continues to pay off\u2014especially considering that the Lagos government shutdown bike hailing businesses a month after it launched.\n\nSafeBoda\u2019s growth since its launch has been groundbreaking. In June 2020, about 6 months after its operation started, it reached a milestone of 100,000 rides. Also, in August 2020, it grew 150% and recorded 250,000 rides. And by the end of the year, while it was pausing its Kenyan operation, it celebrated half a million rides in Nigeria.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, its defining growth started when in April 2021, the startup reached the 1 million rides milestone; that\u2019s a 150% growth in a month. Prior to that, it had done the same rate quarterly, and since then to date, it\u2019s been bumping up the numbers.\n\nAs anyone would expect, an increase in the number of rides must have been the result of an increase in other proportional metrics. By June 2021, 100,000 passengers had signed up on the platform, and 3 months after that, its 8,000th rider was onboarded. And in November it was doing 20,000 rides daily.\n\nFast forward to today, SafeBoda claims to have recorded over 3 million rides, more than 10,000 riders, over 100,000 users, and completed 50,000 deliveries.\n\nThe startup currently offers 3 services in Nigeria: rides, deliveries, and airtime purchase. The payment vertical which has already launched in Uganda, will launch in Nigeria soon.\n\nThe end and the beginning of an era\n\nSafeBoda is endearing to people for many reasons. One of them is its first Nigeria Country Director Babajide Duroshola, who led the startup from launching till June last year when he exited for another East African startup that had just expanded into Nigeria.\n\nSafeBoda Nigeria\u2019s new Country Director Olaoluwa Arokoyu\n\nChanging leadership always comes with challenges and SafeBoda faced its fair share. But it quickly made an internal replacement when it appointed its Head of Operation Olaoluwa Arokoyu as Country Director. Arokoyu had previously worked in operations with Opay and Jumia and joined SafeBoda 5 months prior to Duroshola\u2019s exit.\n\nEver since his appointment, the company said that Arokoyu has achieved some laudable milestones including taking the company from 1.5 million rides to over 3 million rides, optimising the app for address verification during the onboarding process to reduce fraudulent activities, and improving how riders are being paid to increase brand loyalty among riders.\n\nCreating a better experience for all\n\nSafeBoda says it\u2019s as compassionate with its riders the same way it is with passengers. It says in a statement that it\u2019s constantly looking for a better way to increase the earning power of its riders while giving passengers a good experience. \u201cAs a result of this increased earning power, SafeBoda riders and their families have access to a more quality lifestyle.\u201d\n\n\u201cSafeBoda\u2019s primary mission is to provide a better standard of living for drivers and customers. Everything we do is aligned with this goal,\u201d Arokoyu told TechCabal.\n\nSafeBoda\u2019s riders in Ibadan\n\nFor SafeBoda riders like Ghazali Saheed, who\u2019s the 5964th rider that joined the bike-hailing startup, the best thing about SafeBoda is the respect they [the riders] get from customers that other riders don\u2019t get. \u201cSafeBoda also makes it easy to set targets and reach them. It\u2019s easy for us to know where to get a lot of orders so that we can easily reach our targets,\u201d he said.\n\nLike many bike-hailing startups, SafeBoda is also destigmatising bike [okada] riding in Ibadan and Nigeria as a whole. The way it looks, it\u2019s like these bike-hailing companies are formalising a sector that\u2019s been informal for a long time.\n\n\u201cThe okada or boda business isn\u2019t categorised to be prestigious within African communities. But with a touch of orange, the story is different. SafeBoda riders are highly regarded and respected, not just because of the colour but because of their conduct,\u201d said Clement Obaro, Growth Manager at SafeBoda.\n\nCompetition is stronger than ever\n\nDue to SafeBoda\u2019s success in Ibadan, it has become apparent that the city is the new juicy spot for the bike-hailing market and, as a result of that, it has also become a battleground. Everybody wants a piece of the pie. Uber last month launched its bike-hailing arm in Ibadan and joined the host of others like MaxNG, ORide, and Gokada to snag more market share from SafeBoda.\n\n\u201cWe have been expecting this to happen and now that it has, we are not worried. Our focus is to keep giving the best experience to our customers and keeping our riders happy and willing to complete more rides daily,\u201d said Arokoyu. \u201cThe sky is wide enough for all birds to fly; healthy competition is always good for business.\u201d\n\nSafeBoda is one of the most active bike-hailing companies in sub-Saharan Africa as it holds more than 80% market share in Uganda and Nigeria. Uber and Bolt had first launched their bike-hailing product in Uganda but couldn\u2019t beat SafeBoda.\n\nIf combining the popularity and capital war chest of Uber and Bolt, the two most powerful mobility startups in the world, couldn\u2019t beat SafeBoda in Uganda, there\u2019s no saying that only Uber can pull it off in Nigeria. But it\u2019s a different market, however, with the level of loyalty SafeBoda has built among riders and customers, it won\u2019t be an easy call to dominate over it in Ibadan.\n\nShare this article",
          "summary": "On Wednesday, Ibadan-based Ugandan bike hailing startup SafeBoda clocked two years of operating in the Nigerian market.\nAnd by the end of the year, while it was pausing its Kenyan operation, it celebrated half a million rides in Nigeria.\nFast forward to today, SafeBoda claims to have recorded over 3 million rides, more than 10,000 riders, over 100,000 users, and completed 50,000 deliveries.\nThe startup currently offers 3 services in Nigeria: rides, deliveries, and airtime purchase.\nSafeBoda riders are highly regarded and respected, not just because of the colour but because of their conduct,\u201d said Clement Obaro, Growth Manager at SafeBoda.",

          "text": "Facebook content moderators in Kenya will receive a 30-50% pay rise. This announcement comes two weeks after an investigation report by TIME revealed that content moderators in Nairobi were subject to poor pay and working conditions by Sama, a company responsible for Facebook\u2019s sub-Saharan Africa content moderation since 2019.\n\nEvery content moderator will receive an extra 20,000 Kenyan shillings ($176) per month, Sama told employees in a meeting on Tuesday, sources revealed to TIME.\n\n\u201cThe raise means that the lowest-paid Facebook content moderators at Sama will now take home around 50,000 Kenyan shillings ($439) each month after-tax, or around $2.20 per hour for a 9-hour working day. This is up from around $1.50 per hour previously.\u201d\n\nAll content moderators were also promised yearly bonuses worth one month of their salary, as an incentive to remain at the company, according to the sources.\n\nDespite the obvious correlation, Habel Kamau, a human resources director at Sama\u2019s Nairobi office, said that the salary increase wasn\u2019t a result of the release of the investigation by TIME. He claimed that the conversations about a salary increase had been ongoing for a while now, adding that the pay raise was made possible due to budget cuts from other places and not as a result of Sama receiving additional money from Facebook.\n\nAlthough the pay raise is welcomed by many of the content moderators, some still say it\u2019s not enough. Sama employees remain some of Facebook\u2019s lowest-paid workers anywhere in the world. While the lowest starting salary of a Facebook content moderator at Sama is $2.20 per hour, outsourced content moderators for Facebook in the U.S. are paid a typical starting salary of $18 per hour.\n\nSouth African Daniel Motaung, a former employee of Sama who was fired after trying to lead a union, noted that in 2019 employees had requested for their pay to be doubled. \u201cThis increase will make a difference but it won\u2019t change their lives,\u201d Motaung said in the statement. \u201cThey still won\u2019t be able to buy a house or feed their families in line with the \u2018lifting the poor out of poverty\u2019 narrative that Sama continuously boasts about.\u201d\n\nSama didn\u2019t comment on allegations that its managers suppressed a unionization effort in 2019, which led to Motaung losing his Job. Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company also declined to comment on the announcement of the pay raise.\n\nThe announcement of the pay raise is seen as a win for the content moderators and validation of the power in employees speaking up.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnivasa, an indigenous ride-hailing company in Nigeria, launched Verify and Pay, an innovative digital payment system aimed at reshaping the transport system in Nigeria, on Friday, March 4, 2022.\n\nThrough Verify and Pay, passengers hailing a cab can scan the barcode on the taxi to confirm the details of the driver and the vehicle, input their destination to check and negotiate fares, and select preferred payment options such as card payments or USSD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe platform was launched at the Lagos State Taxi Driver & Cab Operators Association (LSTDCOA) headquarters, Oshodi, Lagos. The event was graced by Mr Otunba Taiwo Omolekan, President, LSTDCOA; Honorable Mike Oladipupo, general secretary of LSTDCOA, and other high-ranking members of LSTDCOA.\n\nComrade Idris, President of Professional E-Hailing Drivers and Private-owners Association (PEDPA), Mr Ayodele Kumolu, representative, Universal Insurance plc, and Mr Israel Ifedayo, Mizala tech partner, were also present at the event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Verify and Pay platform is a new face to transportation in Nigeria; currently, it has been launched for the Lagos Yellow Cabs but will also cut across other forms of transport within the state, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt before the end of the year.\n\nMr Otunba, the president of LSTDCOA, gave a breakdown of the journey so far for taxi drivers. He said that he has been working on providing solutions to the issues affecting taxi drivers and their services.\n\nHe added that technology has to be embraced to prevent the extinction of yellow taxi cabs in Lagos state.\n\nSpeaking at the event, CEO of Univasa, Dr Ben Adeniyi, said, \u201cThe verify and pay platform initiative was born out of the need to be an \u201cEnabler\u201d to service providers and consumers.\n\nFor us at Univasa, providing innovative services is at the helm of our operations, and we continue to hold it as a top priority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a driver-partner with Univasa, you get to enjoy the convenience of receiving your payments instantly with our instant withdrawal feature, so \u201cCash or Card e no matter\u201d as we like to say and for the riders, we are offering you a chance to own your experience while hailing a ride\u201d.\n\nComrade Idris gave a brief speech, where he called for solidarity between members of LSTDCOA and PEDPA as they stand to benefit from each other.\n\nMr Ayodele Kumolu, the representative of Universal Insurance plc, also spoke in detail about their flexible insurance packages. Drivers can apply and make payments in instalments, either a weekly, monthly or yearly package.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Univasa rolled out its Drive-to-Own empowerment program, which allows drivers on the Univasa ride-hailing app to pick a Univasa car as their vehicle of choice to work, make daily remittances for a duration of 18-24months, which will be deducted from their earnings from the app, and then the driver gains permanent ownership of the car.\n\nThe Univasa team also confirmed that the cars in the drive-to-own scheme had been insured with Universal Insurance plc and tech partners, Mizala. The insurance covers the car, third party and life.\n\nUnivasa also has a package for drivers who meet the earning mark of NGN 200,000 in a month. They will automatically be beneficiaries of free insurance against the next month, and others can also easily apply for comprehensive insurance on a flexible payment structure.\n\nThe yellow cab drivers expressed their excitement for the new initiatives by Univasa especially verify and pay platform, as it will help them track their rides and also help to improve the reputation of the association as their riders will be more assured of their safety.\n\nSpeaking to Techpoint Africa, Dr Ben Adeniyi said that the onboarding process won\u2019t be limited to the drivers alone as passengers need to understand how to use the platform. It will enable the passengers to easily adopt the platform and increase trust as they know the driver is affiliated with Univasa and LSTDCOA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnivasa is a wholly-owned Nigerian Company that provides a one-stop solution to fulfil the daily needs of Africans via cutting-edge digital technology. Univasa launched its ride-hailing application in the later part of 2020 in Lagos with a partnership with the popular Lagos yellow cabs (LSTDCOA) with a campaign called \u201cBaba dey Online\u201d and has since expanded operations to Ibadan, Port Harcourt, Benin City, Akure, Ilorin; Kwara state and Abuja.\n\nThe Univasa User and Provider User and Provider apps are available for download on Google Playstore and the Apple AppStore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Coverage by Techpoint Africa Looking to promote your industry event?

While the war lingers, cryptocurrencies have become a significant theme in the conflict as crypto donations pour in to support Ukraine.\n\nOn Thursday, February 24, 2022, Russian troops invaded neighbouring European country, Ukraine. While Russia\u2019s President, Vladimir Putin, described the invasion as a \u201cspecial military operation,\u201d The Washington Post reports that more than 2,870 Ukrainian troops have been killed and more than 3,500 wounded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCivilians and soldiers taking cover. Souce: Aljazeera.\n\nRussia and Ukraine are the two largest countries in Europe; however, their military capabilities are miles apart.\n\nRussia has one of the largest and most powerful militaries globally, and according to Aljazeera, it spent $61.7 billion on its military in 2020. For context, that is 32.4% \u2014 $46.6 billion (\u2248 \u20a619.15 trillion) \u2014 more than Nigeria\u2019s budget for 2019 and 2020 combined.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the other hand, Ukraine spent $5.9 billion (\u20a62.4 trillion) on its military in the same year. Some countries have sent military equipment to Ukraine because of Russia\u2019s military superiority. It received shipments of weapons from the US as part of a $200m defensive package approved by President Joe Biden in December 2021.\n\nHowever, support has also been pouring in for the Eastern European country in cryptocurrencies. According to CNBC, the crypto donations that have come in one week are valued at $54 million.

After confirmation, Buterin deleted the tweet, and donations started pouring in. The Washington Post said 46,000 people donated amounts a little less than $100.\n\nThere were also large donations like the $290,000 from FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, and $280,000 sent anonymously.\n\nInterestingly, donations also came in the form of very valuable non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, there is no need to sell them as cryptocurrency donations keep pouring in. Crypto analytics firm, Elliptic, also confirmed a $5.8 million grant by Polkadot Founder, Gavin Wood.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian crypto exchange, Kuna.io, some donations have been turned to fiat, particularly Euro, and used to purchase military equipment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow do crypto donations to Ukraine affect the crypto market, adoption, and regulation?\n\nWith crypto donations to Ukraine shining more light on already spotlighted cryptocurrencies, crypto evangelists have seized the opportunity to reiterate the benefits of cryptocurrencies and how people who oppose digital currencies have misunderstood them.\n\nCrypto trader and investor Scott Melker tweeted, \u201cUkraine has received $50 million in crypto donations. Maybe it\u2019s not just for criminals,\u201d pointing out how nations have erroneously labelled crypto as a tool for illegal activities.\n\nUkraine has received $50m in crypto donations.\n\n\n\nMaybe it\u2019s not \u201cjust for criminals.\u201d \u2014 The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) March 5, 2022\n\nPopular crypto commentator Anthony Pompliano, aka Pomp, also rooted for crypto in a tweet that reads,\n\n\u201cThis feels like a turning point for fiat currencies globally. A country currently engaged in violent combat to preserve its sovereignty and freedom is publicly soliciting bitcoin and crypto donations. Hard to imagine just a few years ago.\u201d\n\nThis feels like a turning point for fiat currencies globally.\n\n\n\nA country that is currently engaged in violent combat to preserve its sovereignty and freedom is publicly soliciting bitcoin and crypto donations.\n\n\n\nHard to imagine just a few years ago. pic.twitter.com/jgK5BSxBBl \u2014 Pomp \ud83c\udf2a (@APompliano) February 26, 2022\n\nIndeed, cryptocurrencies have been the easiest and perhaps only alternative for the Ukrainian government to take donations.\n\nAfter Russia\u2019s invasion in February, Ukraine\u2019s President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, instituted martial law, suspending civil law and extending military rule to civilians, thus making it almost impossible to send and receive fiat currencies.\n\nDespite current events portraying cryptocurrencies in good light, the market has not benefited from the increased popularity.\n\nWithin hours of the invasion, the value of flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, plummeted by 8% \u2014 from $37,000 to $34,000 \u2014 while popular cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Solana dropped considerably.\n\nHowever, as the conflict lingered and more sanctions were imposed on Russia, the price of Bitcoin soared to about $44,000. Just as traders thought a bull market was on the horizon, the largest crypto by market capitalisation dashed their hopes and fell to less than $39,000.\n\nThe market seemed to crash as the donations rose, probably due to the liquidation of the crypto assets received by Ukraine into fiat.\n\nIn contrast, crypto educator and investor Andy LaPointe told Techpoint Africa that \u201cthe global market cap of crypto is $1.84 trillion; even if all of the donations to Ukraine are sold at once, it wouldn\u2019t negatively affect prices.\u201d\n\nWhile the donations to Ukraine aren\u2019t affecting the crypto market, they are working wonders for crypto PR; consequently, we could see more use cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "title": "These women have raised millions in a male-dominated startup space; Here\u2019s how they did it",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phrase \u201cIt\u2019s a man\u2019s world\u201d takes on more meaning when funding from venture capitalists to startups founded or led by a woman is considered.\n\nAfrican startups raised approximately $5 billion in 2021, yet less than 1% of the money raised went to startups with a female founder or CEO. This trend also plays out globally, where just 2.3% of funding went to women-led startups in 2020.\n\nOne of the reasons often given for this mismatch is the lack of women as role models. So, we spoke to seven women who have raised at least $1 million from investors over the past three years, and they shared their top money-raising tips.\n\nTarget women-led funds\n\nThere\u2019s no data to back this up, but most of the VCs you\u2019ll meet are men. This is normal as humans are hard-wired to support people who look like them. Naturally and perhaps unconsciously, they end up funding men and only a few women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately, it\u2019s getting easier for women to raise money as more women launch venture capital funds targeted at them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an art to fundraising. The first thing that an investor is trying to look for is the founders and team members. There\u2019s a likeability factor there. They need to be able to relate to the founder. The story is different when an all-male team is trying to judge an all-women team,\u201d says Damilola Olokesusi, Founder and CEO of Shuttlers, one of Nigeria\u2019s oldest transport tech startups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamilola Olokesusi, CEO of Shuttlers. Source: TechCrunch\n\nNelly Chatue-Diop, Founder and CEO of Ejara, a Cameroonian fintech startup, shares the same opinion but warns that simply going after women investors isn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cYou should do your due diligence. Don\u2019t think that they\u2019ll be better because they\u2019re women. Most of the women VCs that support women are very vocal about it. Look for those, and your chances will improve.\u201d\n\nOn the flip side, Chioma Ugo, Co-founder and Head of Growth at fintech startup, Prospa, believes that women should spread their nets wide. Raising funds is often a numbers game, and the more investors you speak to, the more likely you are to get positive responses.\n\n\u201cI will say, talk to as many investors as possible just because the more people you talk to, the higher your chances of raising money,\u201d she says.\n\nSolve a viable problem\n\nInvestors fund businesses to get returns on their investments. Consequently, they always look out for companies that can scale. Therefore, regardless of gender, investors will often invest in businesses that promise generous returns.\n\nJessica Anuna, CEO and Founder of Klasha, believes that having a large market in Nigeria makes it easier to build such businesses for Nigerian entrepreneurs. Her startup provides payment options for businesses in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJessica Anuna, Founder and CEO of Klasha\n\n\u201cI think that creating a company that solves a problem for a large addressable market is critical for success. Luckily, there are 200 million people in Nigeria, so we have a large addressable market.\n\n\u201cWe also have different problems around the continent that we need to solve given the nascency of digitalisation on our continent.\u201d\n\nOlokesusi shares the same view. Her founding team at Shuttlers were all women. While she says it initially played a role in their difficulty raising money, she believes that solving a big enough problem and gaining traction helped them raise easily.\n\n\u201cIrrespective of your gender, the problem you should be solving must be big enough. That way, even if no one invests, you can still build a business.\u201d\n\nHave the right team\n\nHaving the right team is crucial for any startup, regardless of what stage they\u2019re at. However, with little information for investors to make decisions at the early stages, it often comes down to who is working on a problem.\n\nFor Olokesusi, having an all-women team without experience in the transportation industry and no CTO was a disadvantage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChioma Ugo, Co-Founder and Head of Growth, Prospa. Source: FintechTimes\n\n\u201cI know that one other thing that didn\u2019t help at the initial stage was we didn\u2019t have a CTO. At the same time, we needed funds to attract a CTO, so it was a chicken and egg thing.\u201d\n\nAnuna adds that investors are more likely to back founders when they have deep expertise in the industry they\u2019re building in.\n\n\u201cVCs are more likely to back you if you have a history in the field that you want to get into because it proves that you have a track record and understanding of the industry and ecosystem.\u201d\n\nUnderstand what fundraising involves\n\nIt\u2019s rare to find a first-time entrepreneur that has a complete grasp of what fundraising entails. Even for more experienced founders, the process can also be nerve-wracking. Unfortunately, there are not enough resources for African founders looking to learn about the fundraising process.\n\nJihan Abass is the Founder and CEO of Lami, an insurtech startup, and she believes that founders need to understand what the fundraising process involves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJihan Abass, CEO and Founder of Lami. Source: TechCabal\n\n\u201cSpeaking to as many women or just founders in general, to understand the process is really helpful. Secondly, understand what you should expect, what is not a good deal. I think you should have those discussions and make sure that you speak with other founders to see what their process was and what deal they got.\u201d\n\nProve that your business works\n\nToo many entrepreneurs start fundraising before they have proven that their ideas work. While some entrepreneurs may raise money for their ideas without proof that it works, that is harder in Africa. Therefore, proving that your business works could improve your chances with investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNelly Chatue-Diop, CEO and Founder of Ejara. Source: Blockchain Nigeria Group\n\n\u201cProving the concept is very critical no matter how small it is. So, get your first hundred customers, get your first 500 merchants or whatever it is. That proof of concept is so critical because it helps the VCs buy in. After all, you\u2019ve used your money and resources to show your idea works regardless of if it\u2019s on a small scale or not,\u201d Anuna shares.\n\nTake advantage of intros\n\nThe difference between a founder who raises money and another who struggles is often the successful entrepreneur\u2019s network. Unfortunately, few women work as VCs or founders. Consequently, getting an introduction to an investor could be helpful.\n\n\u201cIntros are always great. For example, suppose I introduce you to an investor that already backed me. In that case, that proves that they back women, and it\u2019s coming from a very reliable source, so obviously, the chances of you raising from that person are heightened,\u201d Ugo says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeghan McCormick, Co-Founder and CEO of OZ\u00c9. Source: LinkedIn\n\nWhile women have a more challenging time raising money than men, Meghan McCormick, CEO and Co-founder of OZ\u00c9, advises that they take feedback from VCs with scepticism, accepting only what is important.\n\n\u201cWhile raising, it is essential to evaluate the feedback you get from VCs and decide which one to implement. Because when you\u2019re raising money, the VCs are your customers, and you want to be customer-centric. \u201cOn the other hand, you should also take it with a grain of salt and not role-play what you think a male founder will act like or say because you think that will be more successful in getting you money.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Nigerian women still have an uphill task of breaking the bias against them as the world celebrates the International Women\u2019s Day today, few days after the National Assembly rejected some gender bills.\n\nThe lawmakers had last week voted against bills that were in favour of women, including a bill to create special seats for women in the national and state houses of assembly.\n\nThe rejection of the bills seeking gender equality in the country bills has since sparked protests by women in the country.\n\nBy rejecting the bills, the lawmakers denied citizenship to the foreign-born husbands of Nigerian women while a Nigerian man\u2019s foreign-born wife gets automatic citizenship, and denied women the ability to take indigeneship in their husband\u2019s state after five years of being together.\n\nThey rejected 35 percent appointed positions for women and 35 percent affirmative action for women in party administration and leadership.\n\n\u201cI am deeply concerned about the mindset of our family, community, religious, traditional, organisational, business and political leaders, in supporting more women to serve in leadership capacities as decision makers on the tables that would move this nation forward,\u201d Hansatu Adegbite, executive director at Women in Management, Business and Public Service, told BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cIs it wisdom for men to effectively take decisions on behalf of over 101 million women without the input of fellow women?\u201d\n\nAtedo Peterside, founder of Stanbic IBTC Bank, in a tweet on Monday, stressed the need for men to support women. \u201cIf you do not appreciate your mother then I am sorry for you. It is time to rethink; confident men should support our women because we need them at the table,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nAccording to the Economic Times, in a report by BofA Securities, gender inequality has cost the world $70 trillion since 1990.\n\nThe report also shows that full gender equality globally can increase the world GDP by up to $28 trillion by 2025, and the loss of human capital wealth due to gender inequality alone is estimated at $160.2 trillion.\n\nHansatu said, \u201cNigerian women must arise and stand as one body with one voice, so that we can collectively break the bias for the sake of generations yet unborn.\n\n\u201cWe must start with the gender bills recently voted against by the National Assembly; we must say \u2018No\u2019 to constitutional and political bias. Let\u2019s break the bias because gender equity today is needed for a \u2018sustainable\u2019 tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, to break the bias, there is a need to reshape entrenched attitudes and a culture that tends to devalue women.\n\n\u201cWe need legislation that mandates parity on all decision-making bodies in both the public (governmental bodies/political parties/ parliament) and private sectors, with consequences for non-adherence.\u201d, Olatowun Candide-Johnson, founder of GAIA Africa, said.\n\n\u201cWhen men and women are in equal numbers on decision-making bodies, this will help shift biased thinking in both men and women, as well as increase visibility and access for women in business, government and politics.\u201d\n\nRead also: Nigerian Women get huge boost as U.K. Backs First Bank With $100 Million Credit\n\nAbimbola Onakomaiya, managing director at Peak Thrust Insurance Company, said gender inequality was limiting the growth and development of the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that those who currently control and influence the narrative in our country still have a long way to go in their understanding of the depth of gender inequality, how it has taken root in the minds of the populace and how the negative fruits are subverting the growth, both of the economy of our dear country, and the futuristic impact on our leadership style, our corporate world and the political system,\u201d she said.\n\nAs women continue to face significant gender bias in Nigeria, another area of concern is in the agricultural sector, according to stakeholders.\n\nAccording to a recent World Bank study, women farmers produce 30 percent less per hectare than men.\n\n\u201cAccess to markets remains a challenge, given that male aggregators and logistics providers dominate the sector, with long traditions of middlemen and very few middle women,\u201d said Ndidi Nwuneli, co-founder/executive chair of Sahel Consulting, Agriculture & Nutrition Limited.\n\n\u201cBiases in financing also limit the scaling of female-owned businesses, and from microfinance to bank loans, venture capital, and private equity, significant gender gaps persist,\u201d she added.\n\nNwuneli said the persistent gender biases in Nigeria must be broken by strengthening women\u2019s land rights at the federal, state, and local levels, engaging with governments, traditional rulers, and faith-based organisations.\n\n\u201cWe must close the financing gaps women face by creating a comprehensive strategy led by CBN and all financial service providers to ensure explicit quotas and targets, incentives, and windows to support equitable female engagement, free of all conscious and unconscious biases,\u201d she added.\n\nShe stressed the need to develop and implement policies and incentives that would close the gender gaps in the agri-food sector.\n\n\u201cThis will not only directly impact the livelihoods of women and their families across the most strategic value chains, but also the growth of the sector and GDP of our nation,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother important area of concern for Nigerian women is domestic violence.\n\nIn Lagos, for instance, the Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team recorded 10,007 reported cases of domestic violence between May 2019 and August 26, 2021.",

          "title": "Working mothers struggle with outsourcing childcare",
          "text": "Fresh concerns have emerged as an increasing number of working mothers in Nigeria are struggling with outsourcing childcare.\n\nA Twitter user, with the handle @Lolo_cy, had on Sunday narrated how a friend took a three-month-old healthy boy to a cr\u00e8che but returned to find he was dead.\n\nWhat followed was a barrage of comments questioning the rationale behind leaving such a tender child in the hands of care minders and why the mother failed to stay at home to raise the child.\n\nSome commenters also queried why women increasingly seem to prioritise career over child support and family care, suggesting that women should forfeit working in their child-bearing years.\n\n\u201cA three-month-old should have nothing to do at the creche. In fact, a nine-month-old baby has no business in the cr\u00e8che. Where are your support systems? Your family members? I don\u2019t get it,\u201d a Twitter user, @Drwhales_, tweeted.\n\nA counter-argument also trailed the criticism as more women opened up on the burden that women face in their struggle to juggle paid employment with child raising and family care.\n\nMany women argued that they have to work to support the family income, gain financial independence and ease potential suffering in an economy with one of the world\u2019s highest inflation rates.\n\nWith a labour law that only allows 12 weeks of maternity leave and at least 50 percent pay, many working women are forced to return to their jobs three months after childbirth, unlike 39 weeks after in the UK, 43 weeks in Greece or 58 weeks in Bulgaria.\n\nAnd since the options of professional childcare provision are often unavailable at workplaces, some women contract their children\u2019s care to cr\u00e8ches which sometimes fail.\n\nSome women are calling for a societal review of the bias and stereotypes of gender roles and asking that child-raising should get the joint effort of both parents and the support of other family members where possible.\n\nAtinuke, via the handle @ThatGirlTinuke, said: \u201cIf some women had their way, they won\u2019t keep their baby at the cr\u00e8che. But the reality in the labour force doesn\u2019t give them many options \u2013 resume or lose the job. It\u2019s worse when the women involved are single parents, widows or even breadwinners. God comfort that woman.\u201d\n\nRead also: Weaning tips for breast-feeding mothers\n\nUncle Charle, via the handle @AkwariCharles, said, \u201cThey need to start advocating for companies and firms to have a cr\u00e8che at work where workers can drop off their babies while they work \u2013 a subsidised one. At least, during their break time, they can spend it with their baby. Also, in case of emergency, they can be reached faster\u201d.\n\nShakirat Gold-Olufadi, who tweeted with @skinandall_, urged women to reject the societal pressure to be a superwoman or the notion that women were built to do any and everything, describing it as a set-up for breakdown.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let anyone make you feel guilty for getting help in achieving a healthy work-life balance. Don\u2019t let anyone make you feel bad for wanting to be more. Ignore all the talkative on and off social media and do the best you can. For the family that lost their child and yet the woman is the one facing all the fire, I wish I could see you and give you a hug,\u201d Gold-Olufadi said.\n\nA 2014 analysis of gender gaps in labour outcomes by the OECD Development Centre showed that the gender gap in unpaid care work had significant implications for women\u2019s ability to actively take part in the labour market and the quality of employment opportunities available to them.\n\nThe study found that outsourcing unpaid care activities, such as child-minding, cooking or cleaning was not an affordable or realistic option for most women as their household\u2019s daily wellbeing depended on them to carry out these activities.\n\nAccording to the report, the unequal distribution of caring responsibilities between women and men within the household translates into unequal opportunities in terms of time to participate equally in paid activities.\n\nIt said, \u201cGender inequality in unpaid care work is the missing link in the analysis of related to gender gaps in labour outcomes in three areas: gender gaps in labour force participation rates, quality of employment, and wages,\u201d the study said.\n\n\u201cStates\u2019 failures to provide regulate and fund domestic and care formal services increase the burden for communities, families and especially women. Finally, recognition of the economic contribution of unpaid care work requires measuring it.\u201d",
          "summary": "Fresh concerns have emerged as an increasing number of working mothers in Nigeria are struggling with outsourcing childcare.\nSome commenters also queried why women increasingly seem to prioritise career over child support and family care, suggesting that women should forfeit working in their child-bearing years.\nA counter-argument also trailed the criticism as more women opened up on the burden that women face in their struggle to juggle paid employment with child raising and family care.\nAnd since the options of professional childcare provision are often unavailable at workplaces, some women contract their children\u2019s care to cr\u00e8ches which sometimes fail.\nFinally, recognition of the economic contribution of unpaid care work requires measuring it.\u201d",

          "text": "As of January this year, analysts predicted that in 2022 crude oil market will see higher demand while allowing for an oil rally of up to $100 a barrel on tight supply. Then on February 24, Russia invaded Ukraine and Western countries imposed bruising sanctions on Russia fuelling high prices.\n\nOil prices retreated after having hit more than $130 per barrel, a 13-year high, on Sunday evening as markets panicked over a possible embargo of Russian crude oil.\n\nThe United States and its European allies are discussing a ban on Russian oil imports in the latest attempt to punish the Russian government for invading Ukraine. But this has been a hard sell in Europe where fears of rising gas prices have dulled appetites for sanctions on oil.\n\nMeanwhile, the concerns that contributed to sending oil prices above $90 a barrel in January are still present. Libya\u2019s crude oil production averaged nearly 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) during 2021. In late December 2021, armed militants shut in an estimated 370,000 bpd from the four key oil fields in the south-western part of the country.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that 0.4 million bpd of crude oil production went offline in Libya in late December 2021. This unplanned outage contributed to the increase in the Brent crude oil spot price to $90 per barrel (b), as of January 19, 2022, which was $16/b more than the December average,\u201d said the United States Energy Information Agency (EIA).\n\nOPEC member countries, including Nigeria, are unable to meet their production quotas; this is in addition to their unused spare capacity. This situation is leading to tight supply when economies have opened up after people have accepted to live with the reality that COVID-19 would be here longer than expected.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that OPEC members still have more surplus production capacity than they have had on average in the past. OPEC\u2019s surplus crude oil production capacity increased to nearly 9 million bpd in mid-2020 as the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic greatly reduced demand, causing producers to lower output,\u201d said the EIA.\n\nNigeria, Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer, has been unable to meet its supply quota from OPEC, struggling to produce barely 1.3 million bpd when it should supply as much as 1.6 million bpd.\n\nTimipre Sylva, minister of state for petroleum resources, in remarks at an energy conference in Abuja last week, said Nigeria was unable to take advantage of rising prices.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe rise in crude oil prices is not something to celebrate. In Nigeria, right now we are a net importer of petroleum products and when the prices of crude oil go up it affects the prices of petroleum products.\n\n\u201cSo, for us who are the net importers, it is not very good for us. What we are saying is that if you are going to produce more and you get more dollars from your production, then it gives you more money for your imports.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s external reserves dip amid record-high oil prices\n\n\u201cBut if you are now producing less and then you still have to make sure that the Nigerian market is supplied fully with petroleum products, then you will see that there will be a shortfall.\u201d\n\nAmidst this supply constraint, the Russia-Ukraine war has blown a hole through the oil market. The EIA said in a note last week that the geopolitical risk related to Russia\u2019s further invasion of Ukraine had contributed to higher and more volatile crude oil prices.\n\nThe ensuing sanctions on Russia by the United States and their European allies have been so comprehensive that personal assets, travel bans, asset freezes, payment solutions and sanctions on the Russian central bank have sent oil markets reeling.\n\nUS, European and other governments exempted energy trade from sanctions to prevent already tight markets rallying further, but that has failed. Traders say it has thrown Russian oil trade into chaos as producers postponed sales, importers rejected Russian ships and buyers worldwide searched for alternative supply.\n\n\u201cEurope is seeking alternatives, with reports suggesting that refiners should avoid taking Russian oil supplies. At the same time Russia is still able to find a market for the majority of its production by offering discounts in the order of $15-20,\u201d said Maciej Ko\u0142aczkowski, manager, oil and gas industry at the World Economic Forum, Geneva.\n\nAnalysts already say prices could reach $150 per barrel if Russian oil is sanctioned. But even without a sanction on oil, prices have risen to record highs.\n\n\u201cBecause of the banking sanctions we\u2019ve estimated about 70 percent of Russian crude oil exports can\u2019t be touched. That\u2019s about 3.8 million bpd,\u201d Amrita Sen, director of research at Energy Aspects, told CNBC last week.\n\nRussia is the second largest exporter of crude worldwide, trailing only Saudi Arabia. It ships out 4 million to 5 million bpd of crude, along with 2 million to 3 million bpd of refined products.\n\nRussia\u2019s crude and refined product exports have dropped by one-third, or by 2.5 million bpd, this week, according to estimates from Energy Intelligence based on shipping data and interviews with traders.",

          "title": "ASUU Industrial Action and Public Education In Nigeria \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nStrike or Industrial Action, in whatever perspective it is defined, foretells the existence of a depressing relationship between and among employers, employees and the beneficiaries of whatever utility, goods or service designed to be provided or delivered.\n\nTherefore, Industrial action is basically an open display of dissatisfaction by employees against bad and discouraging inhuman working conditions that is capable of depriving workers of any form of motivation, encouragement and hope. It could also be as a result of slave-like labour that is oppressive in every nature.\n\nThis however, is one of the reasons while International Labour Organisation (ILO) recognises strikes as a major instrument that guarantees and advances the rights to collective bargaining across the globe.\n\nIn the case of the prevailing circumstances in Nigeria today, public Education and the health sector have become major casualties essentially difficult to remedy in the context of the above definition and progressive negotiation. This, no doubt is why brain drain, low productivity and incessant strikes have become very pervasive across major sectors of the country, ranging from education, health, petroleum sector, and many more.\n\nTo check these unwarranted anomalies in the area of massive brain drain for example, and the desire to produce universally competent graduates as well as effectively tackle the need for efficient and global standard workforce across Nigeria, ASUU and many other critical stakeholders have intermittently and consistently challenged the Nigerian government to continue to provide the necessary funds, prioritise infrastructure and competent policies, not just in the Education sector alone, but also in the health and all other aspect of national life.\n\nTo this very end, the economic well being of Nigeria, the plight and dissatisfaction of the human populace, particularly the students and family members shouldering the responsibility for payment of tuition and other financial commitments, have continued to suffer as long as the impasse has remained incessant. This has therefore left many to continue to crave for greener alternatives outside the shores of this country.\n\nIn the last few years for example, thousands of qualified Academic and Health personnel have transited our borders to better their economic needs and the potentials of their immediate family. And the number is still scaling up the graph.\n\nThe inconsistent infliction emanating in this regard and the regular industrial disagreement over the years, have continued to dispirit critical stakeholders and the hopes of service providers and the dynamic workforce, such as lecturers, doctors, nurses and other professionals. It has also greatly affected the trust and commitment by both genuine and potential investors in the Nigerian system.\n\nIt is imperative therefore, to emphasise that the prevailing strike situation in Nigeria today, will certainly not motivate any student or family for instance, so long as the system tends to ingeniously stagnates intellectual ambition, liquidate economic vibrancy and other critical and legitimate derivable objectives; due to regular disregard to resolutions, persistent disagreements and lack of provision of basic and adequate resources to enhance collective well being of the people and their global rating?\n\nTo reconcile these entanglements, ASUU has stoutly demanded the revitalisation of university education, discontinuance of Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS), as the payment system in the universities and the payment of promotion and salary arrears, particularly as it affects Education.\n\nThey have also consistently accused the FG of non-seriousness as well as insisting that the government is trivialising such an essential challenge as public education. ASUU has further blamed the Federal Government of levity in handing education, rather than entrenching policy system that can prioritise all critical sectors in the country. They implied that the major areas of disagreement, which is IPPIS, can appropriately be replaced with the University Transparency and Accountability System (UTAS), in addition to adequate funding of the sector.\n\nReiterating these demands, the Minister of Labour, Dr. Chris Ngige recounted that the 2020 December Agreement with ASUU is rightly on course in terms of implementation. He emphasised that the Federal Government had so far paid over N92 billion as Earned Allowances and revitalisation fees to federal-owned universities across the country.\n\nAccording to Ngige, N30 billion was also budgeted and paid for revitalization late last year. He added that N22.127 billion was agreed also in that December agreement, to be paid from the supplementary budget as Earned Allowances for 2021. In his words, the implementation of the agreement is on course.\n\nOn the controversial issue of introducing the University Transparency and Accountability Solution payment platform as preferred by ASUU instead of government\u2019s Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System, the minister held that the matter would be revisited and therefore presented a new proposal towards permanent resolution of the ASUU industrial impasse.\n\nLooking through the positions of both ASUU and the Federal Government, they appeared determined and positive towards the betterment of the Education system and resolving the present challenge in the country. Going by this positivism, the stakeholders must be mutually respectful and be strategically disposed not just because of win-win compromise, but for the sake of our students and the Nigerian society.\n\nGood Education system anywhere in the world is a knowledge fountain. It can help to engage the active youths and take many out of the idle predicament. Education can help to sequentially build society far more than anyone can imagine. The roads, bridges, technology, interpersonal relations, science researches and methods of achieving designed objectives are all derivable from a well co-ordinated knowledge driven education system. In the case of Nigeria we are always overwhelmed by lack of funds and lack of motivation as a result of rambling education and a pitiful policy system.\n\nOur education system now seems to be solely theorised, practically disjointed and academic calendars unjustly elongated with no deliberate strategic policy for training experts who can evolve the science, technology and manufacturing industry.\n\nIt is therefore pitiable that Nigeria with about 43 Federal and 48 States\u2019 universities, still struggle to survive with borrowed technologies. This is pathetic to the extent that we cannot even think of Engineering faculties and other related departments and their professors for example, providing home-grown serviceable energy in terms of solar power and accessories in their faculties, manufacture global standard machines or provide much needed water resources or technology to energise their departments. This is bad enough and it needs to change.\n\nWhile the Government on its part must start to lay broad policy guidelines that can consistently enhance education and improve industrial relations, it must also engage policy experts, supervisors and implementers to guarantee mutual trust, confidence and universal harmonious relationship. The unions on their part must exercise some understanding, just as they must effectively control the activities of the militant few who occasionally stampede members into industrial actions even when the employer is genuinely anxious to reach a collective advantage.\n\nThe government as a matter of importance, must learn to honour, implement and keep to the terms of agreements as collectively resolved. Government should always promptly review, negotiate and implement collective agreements in line with international consensus concerning improvements in general working conditions, rights to freedom and collective bargaining.\n\nOnly in this respect shall the reality of collective bargaining truly manifest as the viable and practical means of ensuring harmonious peace in the Country.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "I\u2019m not leaving PDP for anyone; accept my leadership or leave \u2013 Obaseki to detractors\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u2026 Edo sets for council polls, as PDP registers over 539,000 members\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, at the weekend, said he has no plan of defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), urging anyone who is uncomfortable with his leadership of the party to leave.\n\nThe governor, who stated that the party is now fully harmonized, stressed that the constitution of the party bequeaths him with the leadership of the party in the state, a position which is not up for contest by anyone.\n\nObaseki said this during an expanded caucus meeting of leaders and members of the PDP in the state.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t leave PDP. I will not decamp from the PDP; we will always win any election. PDP won in the last election and we will continue to win all elections in the state and country; nothing will stop us as a party,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor noted that the forthcoming local government election in the state will set the template for next year\u2019s national and legislative elections, urging party members to reflect on the elections and work in unity to ensure victory in the polls.\n\nHe noted, \u201cThere is no division in Edo PDP. Let the party be open to accommodate others. PDP is democratic. The hallmark of democracy is ensuring that the majority has their way, as the minority can\u2019t dictate to the people.\n\n\u201cI heard that Chief Dan Orbih went around, saying there is no harmonization in Edo PDP. This is really irresponsible to say and an insult to members of the party, as the party has truly harmonised in the state.\n\n\u201cPDP in Edo State is harmonised because before we made any appointments in any ward, we made sure the party at that level was harmonised. We are gathered here now as election timetable is out; harmonisation has been done, appointments made and we are ready to win any election before us.\u201d\n\nObaseki disclosed that the PDP National Chairman Iyorchia Ayu will visit the state on Thursday 10th of March 2022, urging party leaders to bring along five percent of newly registered members to welcome the party chair.\n\n\u201cPolitics is not about fighting but dialogue and discussion. I urge us to collaborate and unite to move the party and state forward,\u201d he charged.\n\nNoting that over 539,000 members have been registered in the ongoing e-registration exercise, Obaseki said, \u201cThese numbers are not fabricated as we have the data, pictures, emails and phone numbers of members of the party we have registered so far. You have broken records as this is the bastion of PDP in Nigeria. We have changed the face of politics in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI didn\u2019t give leaders any resources to mobilize them but rather they challenged themselves and achieved the goal to register more members in the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people went around saying people should not join our party. No true party man will do that. Those that engaged in that are not true members of the party and don\u2019t belong to Edo PDP. If not, they will not push people away from the party.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur focus now is on how to engage our members, making them participate in the policy-making process of the party. We don\u2019t need to wait for an election before we act.\u201d\n\nCharging detractors sponsoring disunity in the state to stop forthwith, the governor stated, \u201cEdo is Edo, leave Edo State alone. They have tried us in battle, and have been made to know that we are battle-ready. We have been tested and trusted. We must always win elections; we must always win as a party.\n\nThe Chairman PDP Edo State, Anthony Aziegbemi, noted that \u201cEdo State is the only state in the nation that has surpassed the 500,000 thresholds for e-registration of the party.\u201d\n\nOthers at the meeting include the Deputy Governor of Edo State, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu; Speaker of Edo State House of Assembly (EDHA), Hon. Marcus Onobun; Senator Matthew Urhoghide; Senator Clifford Odia; Chief Tom Ikimi; Hon. Joe Edionwele and National Youth Deputy Leader of PDP, Timothy Osadolor, among others.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "Hope rises for Naira as CBN moves to weaken parallel market",
          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nExpectations are high that the RT 200 Forex Programme of the Bankers Committee and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will achieve its aim of stabilising the nations foreign exchange market if deliberate efforts are made to follow it through.\n\nThe CBN had last week released implementation guidelines for its newly created RT200 Non-oil Export Proceeds Repatriation Rebate Scheme, highlighting its exporters responsibilities and benefits.\n\nAccording to the circular signed by the Director of Trade and Exchange Department, Dr. Ozoemena Nnaji, exporters of eligible non-oil commodities will receive N65 for every $1 repatriated and sold at the Investors and Exporters (I & E) Window through authorised dealer banks (ADBs) for third-party use.\n\nOthers who repatriate and sold through the window for self-use on eligible transactions will also receive a rebate of N35 per dollar, the document stated.\n\nIt would be recalled that the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, recently unveiled the scheme, which is aimed at raising $200 billion from processed and semi-processed non-oil exports in the next three to five years, saying the policy direction would ultimately lead to the self-sufficiency of the commercial banks in foreign exchange needs in the coming years.\n\nEmefiele had said, The RT200 FX Programme is a set of policies, plans and programmes for non-oil exports that will enable us attain our lofty yet attainable goal of US$200 billion in FX repatriation, exclusively from non-oil exports, over the next 3-5 years.\n\nThe apex bank had put Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) on notice that it would stop selling forex to them by the end of 2022, arguing that it was ripe for the banks to source for their forex by funding entrepreneurs with ideas, skills and support to make them responsive and attract foreign currencies to Nigeria.\n\nThe RT200 initiative is anchored on five key areas which are; value-adding export facility, non-oil commodity expansion facility, non-oil export rebate scheme, non-oil export terminal financing and bi-annual non-oil export summit.\n\nSimilar step was taken by the apex bank last year with the Naira-4Dollar Scheme, which lures recipients of diaspora remittances with reward of N5 for every dollar wired through the official window.\n\nThe CBN believes that the rebate would narrow the arbitrage between the official and parallel markets, a differential which is responsible for the low participation at the official window by exporters.\n\nData published on the FMDQ website where forex is officially traded showed that the naira closed at N416.67 to a dollar at the close of business Friday. This implies a N0.17 or 0.04 per cent devaluation from N416.50 it exchanged hands with the hard currency on Thursday.\n\nIn the past weeks, the currency has been trading within the range of N416.00 and above, with the N416.67 benchmark being the lowest rate the domestic unit has touched at the official market segment with this period.\n\nThe local currency experienced an intraday high of N410.00 and a low of N444.00 before closing at N416.67 at the close of business on Friday, with a total foreign exchange of $115.26 million supplied at the market segment.\n\nHowever, the currency has been considerably stable at parallel market since the opening of business this week. Exchangers at the Uyo street market said the naira was exchanged at N576.00 to a dollar and sold within the range of N581.00 and N582.00 to a dollar on Friday.\n\nThe same rate it has been trading since the beginning of the week. Similar scenario played out at the Abuja black market, where dealers traded the local unit with the hard currency at N575.00 and sold within the range of N577.00 to a dollar on Friday.\n\nHitting the target\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief Executive Officer, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), an economic and business advocacy think tank, Dr Muda Yusuf, has lauded the RT 200 FX Programme.\n\nYusuf, in a statement, said though ambitious, the initiative is laudable as the management of the supply side of forex would greatly impact the economy.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that supply-side policies are even more critical and impactful than demand management interventions in the foreign exchange market. Over the last couple of years, the CBN has been fixated on managing the demand side of the foreign exchange market and the outcomes have been suboptimal,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CPPE CEO said for the initiative to succeed, given the peculiar operating environment of Nigeria, the CBN should consider such factors as fixing structural constraints impeding non-oil exports, reviewing the pricing regime in the I&E window, giving exporters access to export proceeds, expanding the scope of forex supply strategies and allowing forex-generating MDAs to sell at the I&E window.\n\nStructural issues are very vital for driving the growth and competitiveness of non-oil exports. Structural variables are not within the purview of the CBN or the Bankers Committee. The fiscal authorities have much bigger roles to play in fixing the structural constraints which have been impeding non-oil exports productivity and competitiveness for decades.\n\nTherefore, collaboration with fiscal authorities is a critical success factor for the realisation of the RT 200 outcomes.\n\nOn CBN\u2019s plan to stop the sale of foreign exchange to banks, Dr Yusuf called for caution and urged the apex bank to ensure a much deeper and stronger I&E window before enforcing the action to avoid disruptions to the Nigerian business environment and economy.\n\nCPPE would like to caution that the apex bank should rigorously think through this proposition before implementation because of the likely systemic shocks, business disruptions, macroeconomic dislocations and weakening of investors.\n\nSimilarly, the Director-General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, (LCCI), noted that the RT200 FX Programme would need additional policy improvement with export infrastructure, financing for exporters and others to achieve the desired result.\n\nAlmona, in a statement, added that the CBN also needs to educate the public, especially potential exporters on the benefit of the scheme so as to enhance the participation of the business community.\n\nPraising the scheme, Almona observed that a major challenge in Nigerias export chain is the unstructured procedures that cause delays, corruption, and rejection of exports and advised that it requires critical export infrastructure, international trade diplomacy, and adequate funding to succeed.\n\nThese facilities should be well directed to process targeted products in which Nigeria has some comparative advantage such as sesame, cashew, cocoa into finished goods, she said.\n\nThe reason for the low FX revenue from exports is due to the export of primary unprocessed commodities. Nigeria must take bold steps to establish a trading system that supports the seamless flow of trade. It must establish the necessary infrastructure, create needed awareness toward exploring the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nOn his part, a professor of Economics at the University of Benin, Hassan Oaikhenan, said for the programme to achieve its goals, the CBN must shore up the value of the Naira.\n\n\u201cThe rapidly depreciating Naira serves to encourage the phenomenon of currency substitution in which economic agents prefer to hold the more stable hard currency,\u201d Oaikhenan said.\n\n\u201cThe question that follows is will an exporter, in response to the incentives that are spelt out in the programme, be willing to repatriate the foreign exchange earned? It is doubtful.\n\n\u201cUntil deliberate policies are taken to broaden the sources of foreign exchange in the economy and to diversify it from borrowing and from crude oil, every effort in that regard, will have little potential to make the much needed big dent on the scarcity of foreign exchange in the economy.\n\n\u201cI had thought that the CBN should by now be appraising the successful nature or otherwise of the policy of giving N5 incentive for every dollar that is received from abroad by beneficiaries of remittances from abroad.\n\n\u201cThat, in my opinion, should serve as the basis for the CBN to proceed to embark on the RT200 Forex Programme.\u201d",

          "title": "Russia vs Ukraine: Time ticks for WW III",
          "text": "By Adebayo Obajemu (with agency reports)\n\nGradually, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a sovereign state is following a dangerous, but familiar pattern, which has all the hallmark of Hitler\u2019s declaration of war against Poland that precipitated the Second World War.\n\nBy the early part of 1939 the German dictator Adolf Hitler had become determined to invade and occupy Poland. Poland, for its part, had guarantees of French and British military support should it be attacked by Germany.\n\nHitler intended to invade Poland anyway, but first he had to neutralize the possibility that the Soviet Union would resist the invasion of its western neighbour. As it is now the world is witnessing similar scenario of a near nuclear holocaust, but for the restraint and maturity of Western Powers led by the United States.\n\nBut the grim and horrifying spectre of war is still very much on the horizon, as the conflict could easily escalate into a direct confrontation between Russia and the West, officials say. So far, it is still Russias war against Ukraine. But World War III has never been closer.\n\nAs Russian forces pound Kyiv and other cities, Western Powers have with great diplomatic skills and sense of 20th century history, maneuvered carefully not to allow a direct conflict with President Vladimir Putin, the man who controls the worlds largest nuclear arsenal and has shown no qualms in boasting about it.\n\nOnly last week, Putin said he had asked his military commanders to put the nuclear missiles on high alert. The Russian dictator is watching with great interest and cynicism how Ukraines Western allies are supplying weapons and other materiel, but have ruled out the idea of imposing a no-fly zone.\n\nProfessor Adamu Abdullahi, an historian told BusinessHallmark that \u201d Putin is currently the most dangerous man on earth, and the greater danger is that he\u2019s a paranoid, and the more isolation he suffers the more paranoid he becomes. It is like a bull in China shop, the West must be careful with him.\u201d\n\nEU countries are providing air defense systems, but have balked at Ukraine\u2019s request for fighter jets. No country has offered to send troops.\n\nMany analysts spoken to by Business Hallmark agreed with Western government officials, diplomats and military analysts believe that there is now a grave danger that the United States and other NATO allies could be drawn into the war \u2014 at virtually any moment, as the result of any number of scenarios.\n\nOne is a mistake, said a Washington-based analyst whose work is partly financed by the U.S. government. The lob of a missile into Poland. That is not impossible and then it very quickly escalates. But we have to respond. We cant not respond.\n\nOr the outcry against the crimes against humanity is so strong that we feel compelled to take what we think is a limited and judicious action, the analyst said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.\n\nThe enforcement of a no-fly zone means killing Russians, the analyst said. Anything that we do that results in killing Russians puts us into World War III.\n\nThe shelling and a fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the early hours of Friday morning provided yet another frightening example of the type of emergency scenario that could ensnare a broader international coalition in Putin\u2019s war: to urgently prevent a global catastrophe.\n\nDr. Adesanya \u1eccj\u1ecd, an International relations scholar said \u201cPutin could decide to escalate the war by lobbing missiles on Poland or asking his proxy, Belarus\u2019 Luckashenko to do it. That means NATO will react.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden has been adamant about American forces not getting involved in the fighting. In his State of the Union speech last week, Biden described the war as Ukraines fight and said Washington would do what it could to help.\n\nWell continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and help ease their suffering, he said. But let me be clear: Our forces are not engaged and will not engage in the conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight [in] Ukraine but to defend our NATO allies in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.\n\nOne European official privy to intelligence briefings provided to U.S. allies said analysts in Washington had reached a terrifying conclusion: Russia is ready to use a thermonuclear bomb in Ukraine, the official said.\n\nThe official said the war in Ukraine was far more dangerous than anything Europe has seen since the end of World War II, including the Balkan wars of the 1990s.\n\nAs horrible as that was, the official said, this is worse, with the potential of getting a real European war, or a world war very quickly. This is just getting deeper and deeper, every day.\n\nRecall that last Friday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg emphatically said the alliance would not be drawn into direct conflict with Putin, and its unwillingness to impose a no-fly zone.\n\nThe only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send NATO planes \u2014 fighter planes \u2014 into Ukrainian airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes, Stoltenberg said following a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels. If we did that, well end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering.\n\nOn a visit to Chi\u015fin\u0103u, the Moldovan capital which has been swamped by Ukrainian refugees, the EUs foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said he recognized the whole world has a stake in whats happening in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cToday the problem is not only Donbas, the problem is not only Ukraine \u2014 what is at stake is the stability in Europe and the whole international order,\u201d he said.\n\nBut asked if he would back a no-fly zone enforced by NATO allies, 21 of whom are EU members, Borrell said that was not a decision for him or the EU to take.\n\nProxy war\n\nMany experts have since the conflict begun attributed it to a proxy war.\n\nProfessor Adeagbo Moritiwon, a political scientist said \u201cthe effort to portray the conflict as Ukraine\u2019s war misses the key point: Putin has attacked Ukraine precisely because it chose a path toward the EU and NATO. Fighting Ukraine, they say, is a proxy for fighting the West.\n\n\u201cSome believe the conflict can only be resolved if Putin\u2019s complaints about the U.S. and NATO are resolved. Until then, he will continue the war, seeking to conquer or destroy the country, and making the peace negotiations with Ukrainian officials of little significance.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the West will end up even more directly involved, politically and perhaps militarily, than it is already. The precise nature of that greater role is a matter of debate but many believe it is coming, one way or another \u2014 and some argue that the sooner it happens, the quicker the war will end. That calculation, of course, presumes Putin chooses self-preservation over nuclear Armageddon.\u201d\n\nBut all signs suggest the situation in Ukraine will get far worse in the coming days, a point French President Emmanuel Macron warned about on Thursday.\n\nAs Putin realizes that fury among the Ukrainian population means he will lose politically, no matter the military outcome, there is a heightened risk he will simply seek to destroy Ukraine, flattening its cities and towns just as Russian forces obliterated the Chechen capital of Grozny.\n\nAnd the devastating barrage of severe sanctions that are punishing the Russian economy will almost certainly remain in place, giving Putin little incentive to back away from his goal of conquering Ukraine and toppling its government. Putin chose war fully knowing there would be severe economic consequences \u2014 a calculation he made previously with the invasion and annexation of Crimea, which led to sanctions and steep absorption costs.\n\nA partial ceasefire was abruptly announced by the Russians on Saturday, presumably to allow residents of two Ukrainian cities that were surrounded by Russian forces, including the strategic port city of Mariupol, to evacuate, the first since the conflict broke out February 24.\n\nRussians Defence Ministry announced a ceasefire to allow civilians in the besieged port city of Mariupol and the town of Volnovakha to evacuate. Mariupols mayor Vadim Boychenko said evacuations would begin at 0900 GMT.\n\nThe strategic city of 450,000 people on the Azov Sea, which has suffered intense shelling, has been without electricity, food, water and heating for days in the depth of winter.",

          "title": "2023: Emefiele\u2019s alleged ambition rattles political parties",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nWhen it emerged early February that the \u2018who is who\u2019 in Nigeria\u2019s business community, including governors of both the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressive Congress (APC) were holding strategic meetings in Abuja and Lagos to push for the presidential candidacy of a South South technocrat in 2023, with Mr. Godwin Emefiele\u2019s name being mentioned as the said candidate, many people would have been amused.\n\nMr. Emefiele could not be an ideal presidential candidate in a contest featuring many time-tested politicians, even as the stakes are high on account of a number of factors. Indeed, only few individuals could have contemplated a possible power bid by the cool headed governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) who has practically no experience in party politics.\n\nBut the reality of the Agbor, Delta State born banker being potentially the favoured person to fly the presidential flag of Nigeria\u2019s ruling party in 2023, is dawning and the political environment has continued to buzz with debates for and against him dominating political discuss, even as groups have emerged to drum support for him.\n\nLast week, his campaign posters surfaced in Lagos, mostly around Surulere and recently, his supporters, mainly youths, spotted white T-Shirts with the inscription MEFFY 2023 at an occasion held in the state to promote his potential candidacy.\n\nThough not entirely clear at moment, and Emefiele has, for obvious reason of his still presiding over the country\u2019s apex bank, not come out to admit or deny the rumoured presidential ambition, preferring instead to put his fate in God\u2019s hands while noting that it is the prerogative of President Muhammadu Buhari to map out his succession plan, what is clear is that he will be the candidate to watch should he finally own up to the rumour; what at this stage seems to be only a matter of time.\n\nSeveral sources in the know have confirmed to our correspondents that Emefiele, known to have the ear of Buhari, is one of the president\u2019s preferred candidates to succeed him, with Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi and former president, Goodluck Jonathan also mentioned as potential candidates.\n\nJonathan, who remains officially a member of the PDP, has been mentioned severally, too, with the idea being that since he is only eligible for one term of four years, his presidency, which could be in breach of the eight tenure for power rotation, would be the quickest route for the North to reclaim power, potentially in 2027.\n\nEmefiele, on the other hand, fits the bill in the president\u2019s reckoning, sources said, on account of his loyalty and ethnic origin.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that he (Emefiele) as president is unlikely to distort the order Buhari has established in the polity,\u201d a source who preferred anonymity said. \u201cImportantly, he is also from the Igbo speaking part of Delta State, which means that he would also be addressing the issue of Igbo presidency.\u201d\n\nThe source continued: \u201cThe President knows how strongly the Igbo feel about producing president in 2023, but he is uncomfortable with the Southeast. He prefers someone from the South South and of course, the Igbo cannot argue against someone like Emefiele.\u201d\n\nLast week, the CBN governor created a twitter account and has been relatively active, with posts ranging from dismissing untrue reports about his person and praising Buhari for one project or the other. The development would have ordinarily seemed innocuous, but the timing of it, and given the role of the social media platform in the country\u2019s politics, many have tended to link it to a certain intention to join partisan politics.\n\nIndeed, what appears to be the strongest indication yet is that since the speculations began to emerge strongly in early February, Emefiele has yet to deny it, what he would have ordinarily wasted little time to do, especially given that he is still the governor of the Central Bank.\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday, February 15, when when a \u2018group of his friends,\u2019 that identified themselves as Friends of Godwin Emefiele, visited him to discuss the controversy over his rumoured presidential ambition in 2023, the CBN governor noted that his fate is in God\u2019s hands.\n\nOnly yesterday, as the speculation became widespread, a group of his friends under the aegis of FRIENDS OF GODWIN EMEFIELE met with him to clarify his position, a statement signed by the group after the visit said.\n\nThe group said the verbal attacks on Emefiele over the rumoured 2023 bid are uncalled for, since he has not confirmed to anyone he is running for President even as he is constitutionally qualified to do so.\u201d\n\nExplaining what Emefiele said during the meeting, the group had said, Here is what he told us: That he remains focused on his job and will continue supporting the Muhammadu Buhari-led federal governments economic recovery drive; that in his career trajectory, right from his days as a young banker, he never asked, nor lobbied for a job, he was invited by the Board of Directors to be the Chief Executive Officer/Group Managing Director of Zenith Bank as he was an integral part of the team, led by founder Jim Ovia, that transformed Zenith Bank from a start-up to one of Africas largest banks with subsidiaries in Ghana, Sierra Leone, Gambia, South Africa, Dubai, China and the United Kingdom\u2026.\n\nMr. Emefiele told us that he believes its the prerogative of President Muhammadu Buhari to plan his succession in line with global best practices for good governance for the continuing peace and progress of the federal republic of Nigeria, as such he will play his part to stabilise the economy for an orderly transition.\n\nAnd given that its God that anoints leaders, he will leave his fate firmly in the hands of God.\n\nGroups Drum Support\n\nMeanwhile, a number of groups have come out to demand that the CBN governor throws his hat in the ring. On Saturday, February 12, a coalition group, the Green Alliance, addressed a press conference in Lagos asking him to declare for president.\n\nAddressing the press conference in Lagos on Saturday, Wale Fapounda, convener of the group, said the country needs a technocrat that can handle the affairs of the country, adding that Emefiele understands global economic growth and that it would compel him to accede to its request to run for the presidency under the APC platform.\n\nThis forum has come together to plead and beg Dr. Godwin Emefiele to run as president of Nigeria in 2023, Fapounda said.\n\nSince he was appointed the governor of the CBN he has spent his energy in building a resilient financial system that can serve the growth and development needs of the Nigerian economy. A typical example of this was seen during his first term, he supervised an interventionist currency policy at the behest of the presidency, propping up the Nigerian Naira by pumping billions of dollars into the foreign exchange market.\u201d\n\nOn February 2022, another group PUSH Emefiele 2023 (Pe2023), urged Nigerians to join in urging him to contest for president, as according to it, he remained the best man for the job.\n\nThe group, in a statement signed by its National Coordinator, Mr. Presley Okojie, argued that Emefieles candidacy would ensure economic consolidation project to life one hundred million Nigerians out poverty in the next couple of years.\n\nPE2023 which claimed to have credible Nigerians, with solid grassroots connection across the six geopolitical zones within its ranks, had said, At this point in our history, we need a pan-Nigerian, with strong background in economics and versatile local and international connections/experience, to upscale our steady economic growth and ultimately tackle all forms of insecurity and separatists narratives.\u201d\n\nYet, last week, another group, the Kaduna chapter of the Pro-Godwin Ifeanyi Emefiele for President 2023, asked the CBN governor to join the race for the presidential election.\n\nChairman of the group, Mohammed Omale, who made the call at a meeting organised by his members in Kaduna, on Sunday, noted that Emefiele has devoted his time and energy towards building a strong financial system that would lead to the growth and development of the Nigerian economy.\n\nAccording to him, Emefiele, has demonstrated the capability and ability to lead this great country to the promise land. The group therefore, urged the CBN governor to run for the presidency in 2023, maintaining that his track records at the CBN, are indication that he would transform Nigeria for the better if elected president.\n\nAs patriotic citizens of the federal republic of Nigeria, strong believers in democracy and advocates for a greater Nigeria built on a solid economic foundation, we declare support for the current governor of the Central Bank Nigeria, Mr. Godwin Ifeanyi Emefiele for President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Omale said.\n\nHe promoted agricultural development through anchor borrowers schemes which has yielded great success in all parts of the country regardless of religion or tribe.\n\nHe has ensured stable economy in Nigeria by engaging the fiscal authority through various interventions.\n\nHe has worked tirelessly to see that Nigerian economy is among the 25th world best economy globally.\n\nPolitics remains the biggest industry in Nigeria, and support groups are never in short supply during election seasons. The emergence of various support groups, therefore, cannot be testament to Emefiele\u2019s presidential credentials, but as a top Lagos businessman noted in an interaction with our correspondent, the decision of the business community to back the CBN governor speaks volumes.\n\nI can assure you that it\u2019s not for nothing that top businesses owners like Dangote are part of the Emefiele presidential project,\u201d he said. \u201cThey won\u2019t just back anyone. They have businesses everywhere, are in the know and just know the people to look look out for during election seasons. This time, Emefiele is one of such people.\u201d",

You know the zoning committee report is a very important one and all the governors are here to support me.\u201d\n\nOn the status and position of Buni in the scheme of things in the caretaker committee, Sani- Bello said: \u201cI am not aware of his position at this moment. I know he has travelled.\u201d\n\nNo change in leadership \u2013 Akpanudoedehe\n\nEarlier in a statement, Senator Akpanudoedehe described the report in a section of the media that Governor Sani-Bello had taken over the party leadership as fake news.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cOur attention has been drawn to sponsored media reports on an imaginary leadership change in the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\n\u201cThe media report is fake news and should be disregarded. The APC is a progressive political party guided by rules. Leadership changes are not announced by \u2018sources\u2019 through name dropping in the media.\n\n\u201cWe urge our teeming supporters, members and indeed the general public to remain calm and support the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led APC CECPC conduct a rancour-free and credible National Convention deserving of our great party.\u201d\n\nBut another top party source believed to be close to Governor Buni said the seeming takeover was occasioned by Buni\u2019s decision to hand over the party leadership to the secretary while travelling even when there are two governors on the committee.\n\n\u201cWell, to the best of my knowledge, Governor Buni handed over to the CECPC Secretary while he was travelling out of the country. Did you hear him (Bello) say he was in acting capacity? I think the problem here is that the angst came about because Governor Buni handed over the rein of the party leadership to the secretary which didn\u2019t go down well with some people who saw it as an act of disrespect when there are two governors there as members.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd even at that, one may want to ask: on whose directive did Governor Bello step in as acting chairman? Well, in the next two or three days, the coast will be clear,\u201d said the source who consistently pleaded anonymity.\n\nBuni, scribe to resign?\n\nBlueprint, however, learnt that Governor Buni and the CECPC secretary may resign today (Tuesday) from the APC National Caretaker Committee, leaving behind other members.\n\nA senior member of the party told this newspaper that the president had actually ordered that Governor Buni and Senator Akpanudoedehe step aside while Governor Sani-Bello and someone else among other members emerge as chairman and secretary respectively.\n\nThe source said: \u201cWith all that is playing out now, Governor Buni and the CECPC Secretary might have been pressured and they might tender their resignation on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nBadaru on Adamu\n\nIn a related development, Jigawa state Governor Muhammadu Badaru Abubakar has denied reports that President Buhari endorsed Senator Abdullahi Adamu for the position of the national chairman of the APC.\n\nGovernor Badaru made the clarification while fielding questions on the BBC Hausa Service, monitored in Abuja Monday.\n\nWhen asked to comment on the meeting held between the APC governors and President Buhari, the Jigawa governor confirmed that the meeting held but that Buhari did not endorse any particular candidate at the meeting.\n\nResponding to the reporter\u2019s inquiry, Badaru said: \u201cBuhari did not endorse Senator Abdullahi Adamu. He only expressed his desire for the party to agree on a consensus candidate and that the North-central should produce the national chairman.\u201d\n\nHe also dismissed the insinuations that agitations for the position of the national chairman may have divided the APC, saying the governors of the APC were united and would work together to actualise Buhari\u2019s vision for the party.\n\n\u201cWe are not divided. We are awaiting directives from our leader, President Buhari and whatever direction he gives us, we will follow accordingly,\u201d he stated.\n\nGovernor Badaru further denied allegations that himself, governors of Kebbi and Kaduna states were bent on causing problems for the party ahead of the March 26 national convention.",
          "summary": "However, National Secretary of the party\u2019s CECPC, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, in a statement Monday in Abuja, declared no change in party leadership.\nAnd as a further confirmation of his new status as acting chairman, Governor Bello inaugurated and conducted the swearing-in of party state chairmen elected 2021.\nBello said he had been acting for a while in the absence of the caretaker committee chairman, Governor Buni since travelling out.\nThe statement said: \u201cOur attention has been drawn to sponsored media reports on an imaginary leadership change in the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\nBlueprint, however, learnt that Governor Buni and the CECPC secretary may resign today (Tuesday) from the APC National Caretaker Committee, leaving behind other members.",

          "text": "Buses packed with people fleeing the Russian invasion in Ukraine began a procession along a snowy road out of one city Tuesday, as a new effort to evacuate civilians along safe corridors finally got underway.The Russian onslaught has forced 2 million people to flee Ukraine, UN officials said Tuesday, but has trapped others inside besieged cities that are running low on food, water and medicine amid the biggest ground war in Europe since World War II.Previous attempts to lead civilians to safety have crumbled with renewed attacks. The route people took Tuesday out of the eastern city of Sumy was one of five promised by the Russians to offer civilians a way to escape the fighting.\n\nVideo posted by the Ukrainian state communications agency showed people with bags boarding buses, but it was not clear how long the effort would last.\u201cThe Ukrainian city of Sumy was given a green corridor, the first stage of evacuation began,\u201d the agency tweeted. Sumy is just 50 kilometres from the Russian border.With the invasion well into its second week, Russian troops have made significant advances in southern Ukraine but stalled in some other regions. Ukrainian soldiers and volunteers fortified the capital, Kyiv, with hundreds of checkpoints and barricades designed to thwart a takeover. A steady rain of shells and rockets fell on other population centres, including the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where the mayor reported heavy artillery fire.\u201cWe can\u2019t even gather up the bodies because the shelling from heavy weapons doesn\u2019t stop day or night,\u201d Mayor Anatol Fedoruk said. \u201cDogs are pulling apart the bodies on the city streets. It\u2019s a nightmare.\u201dIn one of the most desperate cities, the encircled southern port of Mariupol, an estimated 200,000 people \u2014 nearly half the population of 430,000 \u2014 were hoping to flee, and Red Cross officials waited to hear when a corridor would be established.\n\nRussia\u2019s coordination centre for humanitarian efforts in Ukraine and Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk both said a ceasefire was agreed to start Tuesday morning to allow some civilians to evacuate, but the two sides differed on where they said the corridors would be.Russia\u2019s coordination centre suggested there would be more than one corridor, but that most would lead to Russia, either directly or through Belarus. At the UN, however, the Russian ambassador suggested corridors from several cities could be opened and people could choose for themselves which direction they would take.Vereshchuk, meanwhile, only said that the two sides had agreed to an evacuation of civilians from the eastern city of Sumy, toward the Ukrainian city of Poltava. Those to be evacuated include foreign students from India and China, she said.She reiterated that proposals to evacuate civilians to Russia and its ally Belarus, which was a launch pad for the invasion, were unacceptable.",

          "text": "Russia has said it may close its main gas pipeline to Germany if the West goes ahead with a ban on Russian oil.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said a \u201crejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market\u201d, causing prices to more than double to $300 a barrel.\n\nThe US has been exploring a potential ban with allies as a way of punishing Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut Germany and the Netherlands rejected the plan on Monday.\n\nThe EU gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia, and has no easy substitutes if supplies are disrupted.\n\nIn an address on Russian state television, Mr Novak said it would be \u201cimpossible to quickly find a replacement for Russian oil on the European market\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt will take years, and it will still be much more expensive for European consumers. Ultimately, they will be hurt the worst by this outcome,\u201d he said.\n\nPointing to Germany\u2019s decision last month to freeze certification of Nord Stream 2, a new gas pipeline connecting the two countries, he added that an oil embargo could prompt retaliation.\n\n\u201cWe have every right to take a matching decision and impose an embargo on gas pumping through the [existing] Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline,\u201d he said.\n\nRussia is the world\u2019s top producer of natural gas and second top producer of crude oil, and any move to sanction its energy industry would badly damage its own economy.\n\nIt also supplies the world with about 10% of its nickel needs, mainly for use in stainless steel and electric vehicle batteries.\n\nOn Tuesday, nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange more than doubled to rise above the $100,000-a-tonne level for the first time.\n\nUkraine has implored the West to adopt an oil and gas ban, but there are concerns it would send prices soaring. Investor fears of an embargo drove Brent crude oil to $139 (\u00a3106) a barrel at one point on Monday \u2013 its highest level for almost 14 years.\n\nAverage UK petrol prices also hit fresh record of 155p a litre.\n\nRises in Brent crude \u2013 the global oil benchmark \u2013 were muted on Tuesday, with the price of a barrel 3% higher at $121.\n\nQuoting unnamed sources, Reuters news agency reported that the US might be willing to move ahead with an embargo without its allies, although it only gets about 3% of its oil from Russia.\n\nHowever, on Monday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed the idea of a wider ban, saying Europe had \u201cdeliberately exempted\u201d Russian energy from sanctions because its supply could not be secured \u201cany other way\u201d at the moment.\n\nEuropean powers have, however, committed to move away from Russian hydrocarbons over time, while some Western companies have boycotted Russian shipments or pledged to divest their stakes in Russian energy companies.\n\nMr Novak said that Russian companies were already feeling the pressure of US and European moves to lower the dependence on Russian energy, despite fulfilling all its contractual obligations to deliver oil and gas to Europe.\n\n\u2018Enormous pressure\u2019\n\n\u201cWe are concerned by the discussion and statements we are seeing regarding a possible embargo on Russian oil and petrochemicals, on phasing them out,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe see our partners, traders, shipping companies, banks and financial institutions coming under enormous pressure.\u201d\n\nHis comments came as a third round of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia made little progress in Belarus.\n\nMore than 1.7 million Ukrainians have fled to Central Europe since the conflict began on 24 February, the United Nations refugee agency said on Monday, with over 1 million arriving in neighbouring Poland.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters that Moscow would halt operations if Ukraine ceased fighting, amended its constitution to declare neutrality, and recognised Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the independence of regions held by Russian-backed separatists.\n\nA Ukrainian negotiator said that although small progress on agreeing logistics for the evacuation of civilians had been made, things remained largely unchanged.\n\n\u201cAs of now, there are no results that significantly improve the situation,\u201d Mykhailo Podolyak said.\n\nBBC",

          "title": "Nigeria: Parliament Suspends Amendment of Electoral Act Pending Legal Advice, Following Court Order",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s National Assembly has put on hold further legislative action on the letter from President Muhammadu Buhari seeking amendment to Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022. The decision was based on a court injunction, which temporarily stopped the institution from taking any action on the legislation.\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court Abuja on Monday temporarily restrained the National Assembly from deleting or taking any further steps regarding Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act 2022.Ekwo made the order while delivering ruling in an ex parte application brought by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) challenging the legality of the National Assembly\u2019s decision to amend a bill already signed into law by the president.\n\nBuhari had in his letter urged the National Assembly to expunge the controversial Section 84(12) in the Electoral Act, which mandates government appointees to resign their positions three months ahead of the primary elections of political parties where they would be delegates.\n\nThis, he had said, was in order to deepen democracy in the country. The section particularly barred appointed political office holders from voting or being voted for during conventions and congresses of political parties.\n\nBefore Buhari signed the bill into law on February 25, 2022, he was said to have reached an agreement with both the Senate and the House of Representatives for the lawmakers to expunge the section.\n\nHowever, the leadership of the nation\u2019s apex legislative institution in an exclusive interview with THISDAY, yesterday, said the court order would stall the debate on the document, billed for deliberation today.\n\nThe Chairman, Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Senator Ajibola Basiru, confirmed to THISDAY that the National Assembly would refer the court verdict to its team of legal advisers.\n\nBasiru said, \u201cWe will study the court judgement and we will get legal advice. At the moment we have not been served. When we are served we will study the order.\n\n\u201cWe have legal advisers who will advise us on the position to take. We will take action based on the legal advice.\u201d\n\nAsked if the National Assembly would go ahead with the deliberation on the egislation today, Basiru said \u201csuch decision would be taken by the leadership when they meet.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, Minority Leader of the Senate, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, told THISDAY that the judiciary could not stop the parliament from performing its constitutional duties.\n\nAbaribe said, \u201cUnder the Nigerian constitution, no other arm of government can stop the National Assembly from doing their work.\n\n\u201cIt is our job to debate any communication from the president on national issues. No court injunction can restrain us from performing our constitutional duties.\n\n\u201cWe will await the court order and see whether any judge in Nigeria will issue an order to stop the legislature from performing their function. We will debate and do anything that is in front of us in the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cWe just got the letter from the president asking us to consider an amendment to the Electoral Act 2022. I cannot speak on it until we debate it on the floor of the senate.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives vowed to argue against the demand by the president.\n\nMinority Leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu (PDP, Delta), in a chat with THISDAY, said the caucus was still studying the request and would certainly argue against it.\n\nElumelu said, \u201cWe are still studying the request but most certainly we argue against it.\u201d\n\nCorroborating, leader of the Peoples Democratic Party caucus (PDP), Hon. Kingsley Chinda (Rivers) also speaking to THISDAY, said all amendments would be considered on its merit.\n\nHe said the lawmakers would put into consideration the interest of the country.\n\nChinda stated that Buhari\u2019s request was no doubt to safeguard the interest of his lieutenants that desire to run for elective posts.\n\nHe said, \u201cAll amendments will be considered on their merit, putting into consideration the interest of the country and not the desires or interest of any citizen. The request of Mr. President is, no doubt, to safeguard the interest of his lieutenants that desire to run for elective posts. This law will transcend this government.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the House leader, Hon. Ado Doguwa (APC, Kano), said the House was yet to receive Buhari\u2019s communication for the amendment. Doguwa said when the communication comes; the lawmakers will do justice to it.\n\nHe added, \u201cFor me at the moment, there is already a legislation, formal legislation assented to by Mr. President in the name of electoral act amendment 2022.\n\n\u201cSo it is a law, if Mr. President or any Nigerian would like to come out for an amendment the procedures are there.\n\n\u201cI understand that there was a communication in the Senate to that effect, we have not yet received a communication to that effect, we have not yet received that communication in the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cThis you can quote me authoritatively, but when it comes, we will do justice to it. We will go through our procedures if that will permit us to do it.\n\n\u201cThe House has not taken any position on this. My opinion is that going by the electoral protocol worldwide, when you have a legislative framework that has to do with the electoral process of a country, you cannot alter any part of the law in less than one year to election.\n\n\u201cThat might be a very big challenge. I am not pre-empting the president request, i am not also pre-empting the position of the House. But I am afraid if the House will indulge such a request in a situation whereby it will amount to procedural breach of the expectation of the best practices of democracy worldwide. 360 days to election, we are advised not to temper with the elections framework.\u201d\n\nCourt Temporarily Stops NASS from Granting Buhari\u2019s Request\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, temporarily restrained the National Assembly from deleting or taking any further steps regarding Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nHowever, after listening to counsel of the PDP, Chief Ogwu Onoja, who argued the ex parte application, the court held that the application had merit and consequently granted it as prayed.\n\nEkwo held that all the defendants were restrained from taking any further steps regarding the request of Buhari for the deletion of Section 84 (12) pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.\n\nThe judge further ordered the applicant to serve the order as well as the process on all the defendants and adjourned till March 21, for hearing of the substantive suit.\n\nPDP dragged Buhari before a Federal High Court in Abuja over alleged fresh move to tamper with the newly amended Electoral Act signed into law by the president.\n\nThose sued alongside Buhari were the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Senate President, Speaker, House of Representatives, Clerk of National Assembly, Senate Leader, House of Representatives Leader and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nOthers included Deputy Senate President, Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Deputy Senate Leader, and Deputy House of Representatives Leader.\n\nThe plaintiff in the ex parte prayed the court for an order of interim injunction restraining the defendants from refusing to implement the duly signed Electoral Act or in any manner withholding the Electoral Act from being put to use, including the provisions of Section 84 (12) of the said Act, pending the resolution of the suit.\n\nThe plaintiff similarly prayed for another order restraining the National Assembly from giving effect to Buhari\u2019s request to remove Section 84 (12) from the Electoral Act or take any step that will make the provision inoperative pending the resolution of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.\n\nOnoja argued that Buhari, having assented to the bill on February 25, 2022, could not give any directive to the National Assembly to take immediate steps to remove the section or any section of the Act on any ground whatsoever.\n\nIn the main suit marked: FHC/ABJ/ CS/247/2022, the plaintiff wants the court to declare that Buhari\u2019s power as regarding law making was limited to assenting bill of the National Assembly or withholding assent and does not extend to giving conditional assent.\n\nThe PDP further wants the court to hold that Section 84 (12) is constitutional and liable to be enforced by INEC, who is the eight defendant in the suit.\n\nThe party further sought a declaration that Section 84 (12) was not inconsistent with or contradicts Sections 40 and 42 of the constitution and does not offend constitutional provisions on disqualification of a person from election to office.\n\nThe PDP accordingly asked the court for an order of mandatory injunction compelling INEC to put into immediate effect the Electoral Act including the said Section 84 (12).\n\nThey also prayed the court for an order of injunction restraining the defendants from treating Section 84 (12) as unconstitutional or in any manner denying it its efficacy or altering it on the grounds that it is unconstitutional.\n\nPDP also prayed for another order of injunction restraining the third to 12 defendants from implementing the directive of Buhari to amend Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act on the grounds that it is unconstitutional.\n\nSunday Aborisade, Alex Enumah, Udora Orizu and Juliet Okojie\n\n:",
