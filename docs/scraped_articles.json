          "text": "\u2026Says IPoB legal team more interested in pecuniary interest than getting justice for Kanu\n\nBy Soni Daniel\n\nThe Department of State Services has boasted that detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, is being given a very Important Person treatment in its custody contrary to claims by the leadership of the group that he is being denied basic needs.\n\nThe Public Relations Officer of the DSS, Dr. Peter Afunanya, made the clarification at a world press conference in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nAfunanya said contrary to IPoB\u2019s claims, Kanu is being given all that he needs and has never been denied change of clothes and practice of Jewish religion.\n\nAfunanya said: \u201cOn IPOB and the alleged ill-treatment of its detained leader, the Service has, without any fear of contradiction, applied restraint in making public statements over the matter. The reason is simply because it avoids joining issues especially over a matter that is sub-judice. But for the sake of transparency and democratic accountability, the Service has decided to make some clarifications.\n\n\u201cThe Service denies all the inciting allegations by IPOB and states that Nnamdi Kanu is not, in any way, maltreated in custody. Accusations of maltreatment negate the Service\u2019s Standard Operation Procedure on the implementation of rights of a suspect.\n\n\u201cNnamdi Kanu enjoys full luxury in the holding facility incomparable to any of its type anywhere in the country. He is accorded full rights and privileges. He is never denied his right of worship or freedom from his select religious practice.\n\n\u201cAdequate attention is paid to Kanu\u2019s health. He has unhindered access to the best medical care and doctors. Kanu, himself, has confirmed to his visitors that the Service has never, in any way, maltreated him. He even confirmed this to the quartet of Senators Ike Ekweremadu and Enyinnaya Abaribe; Bishop Sunday Onuoha of the Methodist Church, Nigeria and Co-Chair, Interfaith Dialogue Forum for Peace and Ambassador Okechukwu Emuchay, MFR, Secretary-General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, who saw him on Wednesday, 8th December, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe story of Kanu being starved is fallacious. He could not have been starved as he enjoys meals of his choice. That he is not allowed change of clothing is also false. He is regularly allowed change of clothing as against what is presented to the public by IPOB propagandists. Assuming he is being maltreated, how come his visitors told him he was looking well?

          "text": "The Department of State Services (DSS) on Tuesday raised alarm that certain groups and individuals intend to cause a breakdown of law and order in the country.\n\nThe Service said this is more so as it has observed that some persons who are desperately seeking power use wrong and skewed narratives to not only mislead citizens but overheat the polity.\n\nIt said already, such persons are exploiting and politicising the issue of insecurity in parts of the country for pecuniary and other selfish reasons.\n\nAddressing reporters at the DSS headquarters, Public Relations Officer of the Service, Dr Peter Afunanya, said many simply want to use the situation to cause divisions among citizens, seek cheap popularity and/or present the country as ungovernable.\n\nThe Service also raised alarm that recessing members of National Assembly and State Houses of Assembly and other public and private sector workers on vacation may be predisposed to threats of various degrees.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThis, it said, also applies to Nigerians who may travel from within and outside the country to join their loved ones for the celebrations.\n\nThese individuals, the Service said, are susceptible to kidnapping, hijack, assassinations, armed robbery and political manipulations\n\nThe DSS also accused the legal team of leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, of misleading the public with fake news about how their client is treated in custody.\n\nIt said contrary to what is being peddled, Kanu is not being starved or ill treated in any way.\n\nAfunanya said: \u201cThe Service, therefore, warns that those who are involved in these should desist from such destabilising acts.\n\n\u201cIt also enjoins politicians to play by the rule and avoid statements or activities capable of inflaming the fires of division and violence prior to 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cOpinion moulders like the clergy, religious and traditional rulers are also to guard their utterances and avoid inciting pronouncements.\n\n\u201cIn a related development, it is common knowledge that criminal elements will heighten their inglorious activities before, during and after the festive periods.\n\n\u201cTherefore, religious and community leaders, hoteliers and operators of markets, parks, recreational and relaxation centres are to be at alert and watch strange movements and activities around their facilities.\n\n\u201cSuch facilities include places of worship, palaces, markets, schools and other public buildings.\n\n\u201cOwners and operators of these public spaces and their patrons should endeavour to isolate and report suspected rogues to security agencies for prompt response.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the Service\u2019s interactive website and complaint lines will remain active and available to the public.\n\n\u201cIts formations at the State and local Government levels will be open 24 hours of the day. This is in line with the Service\u2019s commitment and support to the populace.\n\n\u201cAs schools vacate and students return home for holidays, there is likelihood that subversive gangs will target them for recruitment for undesirable intents.\n\n\u201cThese may include but not limited to financial crimes, armed robbery, civil disobedience and violent protests, substance abuse, banditry and kidnapping.\n\n\u201cIn this respect, parents and guardians are advised to be watchful of their children and wards and ensure that they do not engage in unlawful acts.\n\n\u201cAside students, recessing members of National Assembly/State Houses of Assembly and other public/private sector workers on vacation may be predisposed to threats of various degrees.\n\n\u201cThis also applies to Nigerians who may travel from within and outside the country to join their loved ones for the celebrations.\n\n\u201cThese individuals are susceptible to kidnapping, hijack, assassinations, armed robbery and political manipulations.\n\n\u201cThey are advised to be security conscious in order not to fall victims of these attacks and destructive political maneuvers.\n\n\u201cLet me reiterate at this juncture that those who sponsor kidnapping, banditry, terrorism, insurgency and all kinds of attacks on security agents, civilians and vulnerable populations should have a rethink.\n\n\u201cThese persons, whether in the North or South, know themselves. There is no doubt that they have crossed the lines and it is now time to crush them.\n\n\u201cOn IPOB and the alleged ill-treatment of its detained leader, the Service has, without any fear of contradiction, applied restraint in making public statements over the matter.\n\n\u201cThe reason is simply because it avoids joining issues especially over a matter that is sub-judice. But for the sake of transparency and democratic accountability, the Service has decided to make some clarifications.\n\n\u201cIt (the Service) denies all the inciting allegations by IPOB and states that:\n\n\u201cNnamdi Kanu is not, in any way, maltreated in custody. Accusations of maltreatment negate the Service\u2019s Standard Operation Procedure on the implementation of rights of a suspect;\n\n\u201cNnamdi Kanu enjoys full luxury in the holding facility incomparable to any of its type anywhere in the country. He is accorded full rights and privileges. He is never denied his right of worship or freedom from his select religious practice.\n\n\u201cAdequate attention is paid to Kanu\u2019s health. He has unhindered access to the best medical care and doctors.\n\n\u201cKanu, himself, has confirmed to his visitors that the Service has never, in any way, maltreated him. He even confirmed this to the quartet of Senators Ike Ekweremadu and Enyinnaya Abaribe; Bishop Sunday Onuoha of the Methodist Church, Nigeria and Co-Chair, Interfaith Dialogue Forum for Peace and Ambassador Okechukwu Emuchay, MFR, Secretary-General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, who saw him on Wednesday, 8th December, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe story of Kanu being starved is fallacious. He could not have been starved as he enjoys meals of his choice. That he is not allowed change of clothing is also false.\n\n\u201cHe is regularly allowed change of clothing as against what is presented to the public by IPOB propagandists. Assuming he is being maltreated, how come his visitors told him he was looking well?\n\n\u201cAll the allegations of violation of his rights as a suspect, victimization and starvation among others are not true.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that some elements have decided to use outright misinformation to represent the state of affairs.\n\n\u201cThose who make these false stories do so to attract undue attention for the singular purpose of achieving a desired end.\n\n\u201cRather than focus on how he should get justice, Kanu\u2019s legal team and some mischievous elements among them have chosen to use fake news to mislead the public.\n\n\u201cWhile the Court in its wisdom ordered that Kanu be remanded in the safer DSS Custody, some of his legal representatives, for reasons best known to them, preferred Kuje Prison and have failed to explain the rationale for such choice.\n\n\u201cIt may interest the public to note that a particular lawyer among Kanu\u2019s Team is feasting on the matter such that one can conclude that his interest is beyond getting justice for his client. Be that as it may, the Court has the final say on the matter.\n\n\u201cInstructively, the media is reminded of its duty in national security. As influencers, media practitioners are called upon to use their platforms to pursue peaceful coexistence.\n\n\u201cThey must commit themselves to the unity of the country and shun misinformation, fake news, hate speech and such other misleading narratives.\n\n\u201cJournalists, while discharging their constitutional roles, are enjoined to be objective, conflict-sensitive and patriotic in their reportage.\n\n\u201cOverall, citizens and residents are advised to cooperate with security and law enforcement agencies for lasting peace in the country.\n\n\u201cThey should be wary of efforts designed from within and outside the shores of the country to misdirect or use them to undermine public order. Therefore, they should exercise caution in the way and manner they may conduct their affairs during the festivities and beyond.\n\n\u201cOn its part, the Service will continue to collaborate with other sister agencies and relevant stakeholders to ensure that all law abiding citizens and residents pursue their legitimate businesses without hindrances.\n\n\u201cWhile it has become expedient to issue these warnings and advisories, the Service maintains that it will not hesitate to deal, in accordance with the law, with those who may wish to test its resolve in ensuring internal security and national stability before, during and after the yuletide.\n\n\u201cFor those that wish to, they must note that nemesis and the long hands of the law will definitely catch up with them.\n\n\u201cFor emphasis, no one, no matter how highly placed, will be allowed to take laws into his or her hands.\n\n\u201cFinally, the DG, Management and Staff of the DSS appreciate everyone who has supported the Service in its effort to ensure peace and security in the country.\n\n\u201cLet us remember that security is the responsibility of everyone. Let us support security agencies to achieve the desired peace for our country.\n\n\u201cWe wish every one of you and indeed all Nigerians a hitch free yuletide season. As we look forward to a new year, we wish you a prosperous 2022.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigerians have been told to brace up as the Federal Government plans introduction of new tariffs and levies in 2022 \u201cas the economy hits a recovery path.\u201d\n\nMinister of Finance, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed made this known at a public hearing on the 2021 Finance Bill organsied by the House of Representatives Committee on Finance in Abuja.\n\nShe said a couple of reforms and amendments had been recommended in the draft 2021 Finance amendment bill saying more would be introduced in the middle of 2022.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nThe minister said modest changes had been proposed but that more fiscal reforms were still in view as the ministry could not take all the proposals collected from stakeholders.\n\n\u201cOur aspiration is to do a midterm review with a possibility of another Finance Bill in mid-year 2022 to bring in more amendments.\u201d\n\nThe minister said there were ongoing legal cases against the Federal Government on VAT and stamp duties which was why the ministry stayed off those areas.\n\nShe, however, expressed hope that by mid-2022, the cases might have been dispensed with and then reforms in those areas could be proposed for parliament to consider.\n\nAhmed said there might be need to revisit the antiquated stamp duties and capital gains tax for holistic reform by the parliament.\n\n\u201cWe prepared this draft bill along five reform areas, the first domestic revenue mobilisation, the second is tax administration and legislative drafting, third is International taxation, fourth is financial sector reforms and tax equity and fifth is improving public financial management reform.\n\n\u201cThe provision in the draft bill is proposing to amend the Capital Gains Tax Act, Company Income Tax, FIRS Establishment Act, Personal Income Tax, Stamp Duties Act and Tertiary Education Act, Value Added Tax, Insurance Police Trust Fund and the Fiscal Responsibility Act.\n\n\u201cThis is to amend the Police Trust Fund Act and the Nigerian Trust Fund Acts, the purpose is to empower the FIRS to collect the Nigerian trust fund levies on companies on behalf of the fund itself.\n\n\u201cCurrently, because there is no such provision, the FIRS is unable to start collecting on behalf of the fund. Also, it is to streamline the tax and the levy collection from the Nigerian companies in line with Mr President\u2019s administration ease of doing business policy.\n\n\u201cSo we do not have NASENI going out to collect that tax, the FIRS will collect on their behalf during their collection process and it will be passed through to them.\u2019\u2019\n\nAhmed said the bill was a product of the President Muhmmadu Buhari\u2019s commitment made while presenting the 2022 budget to the joint session of the National Assembly on October 8, 2021.\n\nHe said the ministry had worked with relevant stakeholders and Fiscal Policy Reform Committee to draft the 2021 Finance bill.\n\nSpeaker Femi Gbajabiamila said the 2021 Finance Bill seeks to introduce strategic and broadminded, positive reforms that will engender best practices and guarantee interest of the investing public and businesses.\n\nHe said the bill seeks to statutorily check borrowing by local, states and Federal Government, enhance transparency and accountability in the administration in various strata of tax and public revenue generation.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to state that the essence of the 2021 bill is to further reposition our finance system to plug wastes, close openings for corruption, create opportunities for employment as well as stimulate stability and growth in our productive sectors, within the wider context of our quest for economic recovery in our country.\n\n\u201cGiven the democratic credentials of the House of Representatives under my watch as well as the need to further deepen the credibility of the process through wider participation of stakeholders, this stakeholders meeting has been designed to give Nigerians and critical stakeholders in the industry the ample opportunity to own and drive the process.\n\n\u201cIn this hall, we have very proficient professionals and experts, who as stakeholders, investors, development partners and interest groups have submitted memoranda and are ready to make contributions to the bill.\n\n\u201cIt is on this backdrop that I charge this stakeholders meeting to extensively scrutinize the templates in the bill in the general interest.\n\n\u201cWe must strengthen the institution to strategically check reckless borrowings by ensuring accountability in the use of borrowed funds and ensuring that the borrowings shall be on concessional terms or at relatively low interest rates and subject to the rigorous of legislation,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, had on December 7, transmitted a letter to the Senate, urging it to consider and pass the Finance (Amendment) Bill 2021.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

He was earlier quoted to have said that Federal Government was going to retaliate the ban.\n\nSirika was further quoted to have said that the decision to ban these countries in retaliation would be made by the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 latest by Tuesday.\n\nHowever, during the briefing, yesterday, he said: \u201cThe PSC is working with mandate ministries to address the issues surrounding the restriction imposed by some countries on travelers from Nigeria on account of the omicron variant. While each country is entitled to put in place measures to protect its citizens. Nigeria has similar responsibilities. However, based on existing relationships, Nigeria has initiated diplomatic steps to make these countries reverse their course. This is on-going in the interest of all parties concerned and we expect that positive results would emerge within the next one week.\n\n\u201cThe PSC also evaluated the developments on the relationship between Nigeria and the UAE and we are pleased to inform you that the position of the federal government is in line with established ICAO protocols and the spirit of the BASA signed with the UAE. Our sovereignty remains paramount and mutual respects shall be our guiding principle in as much as it should be in the best interest of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe PSC will at its next regular briefing on Monday, December 20, 2021 brief you fully on developments.\u201d\n\nPart of the media report had also quoted the minister of Aviation as saying that \u201cthere is a case of Saudi Arabia, which put Nigeria on the banned list \u2013 no visa, no travel, etc. So also Canada. So, today (Saturday) there was a meeting, I participated in a zoom meeting, COVID-19 task force, just for your information also.\n\n\u201cWe have given our input in aviation, it is not acceptable by us and we recommend that those countries be also put on red list, as they did similarly to us.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t allow our citizens to go into their countries who are their airlines coming to pick from our country?\n\n\u201cSo, I am very sure that in the next few days, between now and Monday, or perhaps Tuesday, at maximum, all those countries will be put on the red list from the PSC from the task force of COVID-19. Once they are put on the red list, which means they are banned, of course, their airlines will be banned.

          "text": "From Obinna Odogwu, Awka Tony Osauzo, Benin and Priscilla Ediare, Ado-Ekiti\n\nAcademic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has threatened to embark on an indefinite strike soon if the Federal Government failed to implement the agreement they reached in 2009 within the shortest possible time.\n\nThe lecturers\u2019 union spoke at press conferences held at various zonal levels across the country, yesterday.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nBriefing newsmen at Nnamdi Azikiwe University (UNIZIK), Awka, Anambra State, coordinator of Owerri zone, Uzo Onyebinama, said it was deeply saddened that the Federal Government failed to honour the agreement which it entered into without coercion.\n\nIn attendance were Okey Aniebo, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University, Igbariam; Steve Ufoaroh (UNIZIK); Chike Ugwuene, Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike; Augustine Ejiogu, Imo State University in Owerri; Christopher Echerobia, Federal University of Technology Owerri, and the immediate past chairperson in UNIZIK, Dennis Aribodor.\n\nThe ASUU leaders claimed government spurned the magnanimity the union extended to it through the signing of various memorandums of understanding (MoU) and memorandums of action (MoA).\n\n\u201cAs we speak, the Federal Government is still in arrears of major components of the 2009 FG/ASUU agreement that includes funding for the revitalisation of the publication universities, earned academic allowances and the renegotiation of the 2009 FG/ASUU agreement.\n\n\u201cThe situation has been compounded by the introduction of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS) and the attendant consequences of the mutilated salaries, promotion arrears and the non-resolution of the more favoured University Transparency and Accountability Solution.\n\n\u201cWe once again alert Nigerians that unless the government strives to sincerely resolve these issues, there will be no rest for us all. There will be no more MOUs or MOAs.\n\n\u201cWhen the macabre dance begins, there will be no stopping it until everything is fully implemented. The insincerity of the Federal Government is not just beyond understanding, it is beyond tolerance,\u201d ASUU said.\n\nThe Benin zone clarified that strikes were a last resort to draw government attention to their plights and not intended to derail academic activities.\n\nThe Benin Zonal Coordinator of ASUU, Fred Esumeh, described members renumeration as slave wage and demanded a new benchmark for condition of service, stressing that \u201cthe Nigerian universities are no longer attractive to foreign lecturers, including neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cThis is due to the prevailing slave wage where the highest ranked professor earns less than a thousand dollars monthly,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Akure Zonal Coordinator, Olufayo Olu-Olu, who presides over Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife; Federal University of Technology, Akure and Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti, said the Federal government has been insincere and deceptive, by reneging on the MoA signed with ASUU on December 23, 2020.\n\nCalling for swift interventions of the students\u2019 body, parents, traditional rulers, and other stakeholders in education sector, he added that the strike would be long and total until all issues raised are addressed.\n\n\u201cIt is rather unfortunate that government has to stretch ASUU beyond its elastic limit on this. To accept negotiation on every issue and for the agreement to be reached, strike must be embarked upon. The implementation of such agreement be it MoA or MoU would only see the light of the day after series of action,\u201d he said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has said that President Muhamadu Buhari has done the best he could do and expecting him to do anything more is akin to beating a dead horse.\n\nAccording to Daily Trust, Obasanjo spoke in Abuja Monday at a retreat on inclusive security organised by the Global Peace Foundation and Vision Africa.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe truth is this: President Buhari has done his best. That is what he can do. If we are expecting anything more than what he has done or what he is doing, that means we\u2019re whipping a dead horse and there is no need.\n\n\u201cThen, where do we go from here? We cannot fold our hands. I believe that is part of what we\u2019re doing here and what we continue to be doing. How do we prepare for post-Buhari? Buhari has done his best. My prayer is that God will spare his life to see his term through.\n\n\u201cBut what should we do to make post-Buhari better than what we have now? That is our responsibility now, because it concerns all of us.\u201d\n\nObasanjo also said that military action alone would not effectively end the insurgency in the country.\n\nHe said the stick-and-carrot approach should be used to tackle the security challenges.\n\n\u201cPeople talk of political will, but I talk of political action. Political will is not enough. It must be matched by political action. The problem of insurgency will not go away, if all we are using is the \u2018stick\u2019 (military action). We may suppress it, and keep it down a bit, but we have to use \u2018carrot and stick\u2019 together to effectively tackle the problems,\u201d Obasanjo said.\n\nThe former leader also advocated state policing, saying \u201cSecurity in Nigeria is local, it must be addressed locally. Legislation should be able to tackle that before the next election.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the Sultan of Sokoto and President of the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Alhaji Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, urged leaders to stop politicising security.\n\n\u201cParties are accusing one another of not doing enough to tackle insecurity. I think that\u2019s the major problem we\u2019ve been facing in the country\u2026We believe we have a problem and the solution is close\u2026Peace is very important. Without peace, you can\u2019t even worship God. We find people killings themselves. We must go back to the holy books and work according to those books for lasting peace,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, the President, Christian Association of Nigeria, Samson Ayokunle, urged the elite to sustain pressure on the politicians to ensure that the successes recorded in the country\u2019s effort to fight insecurity were not botched.\n\nAyokunle, represented by the Deputy President of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, Archbishop John Praise, said: \u201cThere has to be justice and fairness, if peace is going to reign in the country.\u201d\n\nFor the spokesman of the Northern Elders\u2019 Forum (NEF), Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed,\n\nThe citizens must consider merit and competence in choosing their leaders for Nigeria to make progress.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a problem with each other. We have a problem with the leadership we have in the country. We\u2019re not talking to that leadership, and exactly to the degree that we continue to fight and blame each other. This is the key problem facing the nation.\u201d\n\nAn elder statesman, Alhaji Tanko Yakasai, said, \u201cWe can sit here all day and talk to each other, but if we leave without following up our decisions with actions, we\u2019ve wasted our time. Unfortunately, that\u2019s what is happening in the country today.\u201d",

          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has said that President Muhamadu Buhari has done the best he could do and expecting him to do anything more is akin to beating a dead horse.\n\nAccording to Daily Trust, Obasanjo spoke in Abuja Monday at a retreat on inclusive security organised by the Global Peace Foundation and Vision Africa.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe truth is this: President Buhari has done his best. That is what he can do. If we are expecting anything more than what he has done or what he is doing, that means we\u2019re whipping a dead horse and there is no need.\n\n\u201cThen, where do we go from here? We cannot fold our hands. I believe that is part of what we\u2019re doing here and what we continue to be doing. How do we prepare for post-Buhari? Buhari has done his best. My prayer is that God will spare his life to see his term through.\n\n\u201cBut what should we do to make post-Buhari better than what we have now? That is our responsibility now, because it concerns all of us.\u201d\n\nObasanjo also said that military action alone would not effectively end the insurgency in the country.\n\nHe said the stick-and-carrot approach should be used to tackle the security challenges.\n\n\u201cPeople talk of political will, but I talk of political action. Political will is not enough. It must be matched by political action. The problem of insurgency will not go away, if all we are using is the \u2018stick\u2019 (military action). We may suppress it, and keep it down a bit, but we have to use \u2018carrot and stick\u2019 together to effectively tackle the problems,\u201d Obasanjo said.\n\nThe former leader also advocated state policing, saying \u201cSecurity in Nigeria is local, it must be addressed locally. Legislation should be able to tackle that before the next election.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the Sultan of Sokoto and President of the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Alhaji Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, urged leaders to stop politicising security.\n\n\u201cParties are accusing one another of not doing enough to tackle insecurity. I think that\u2019s the major problem we\u2019ve been facing in the country\u2026We believe we have a problem and the solution is close\u2026Peace is very important. Without peace, you can\u2019t even worship God. We find people killings themselves. We must go back to the holy books and work according to those books for lasting peace,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, the President, Christian Association of Nigeria, Samson Ayokunle, urged the elite to sustain pressure on the politicians to ensure that the successes recorded in the country\u2019s effort to fight insecurity were not botched.\n\nAyokunle, represented by the Deputy President of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, Archbishop John Praise, said: \u201cThere has to be justice and fairness, if peace is going to reign in the country.\u201d\n\nFor the spokesman of the Northern Elders\u2019 Forum (NEF), Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed,\n\nThe citizens must consider merit and competence in choosing their leaders for Nigeria to make progress.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a problem with each other. We have a problem with the leadership we have in the country. We\u2019re not talking to that leadership, and exactly to the degree that we continue to fight and blame each other. This is the key problem facing the nation.\u201d\n\nAn elder statesman, Alhaji Tanko Yakasai, said, \u201cWe can sit here all day and talk to each other, but if we leave without following up our decisions with actions, we\u2019ve wasted our time. Unfortunately, that\u2019s what is happening in the country today.\u201d",

          "title": "1da Banton\u2019s \u201cNo Wahala\u201d blew up on Tik Tok. Now he knows its power",
          "text": "A few months ago, Nigerian artiste, 1da Banton, logged into his TikTok account, which he rarely used, only to discover that one of his songs, \u201cNo wahala\u201d, from his Original Machine Vibe album, was being used in videos captioned in French. Because he doesn\u2019t understand French, he Google-translated the captions, then smiled at himself.\n\nThe Afro dancehall artiste\u2019s song was being used in a TikTok challenge that would take his music straight to the ears of millions of fans around the world. Since the challenge began, \u201cNo wahala\u201d has been used as a soundtrack in more than 190,000 videos and was at some point the second most Shazamed song in the world. The song is also charting in over 10 countries, including the UK, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Uganda, and Kenya.\n\nSpeaking on the inspiration for the song, on a video call with TechCabal, from his Lagos apartment, 1da Banton said he set out to create a stress-free vibe and connect with people who just wanted to live their lives without worrying.\n\n\u201cWhen I recorded \u2018No Wahala\u2019, that was how I was feeling, so I put it into music. When my producer, Blaise Beats, played the beat for me, the only thing that came to my head was to write a song that talks about a stress-free life, not a love or party song. I just wanted to make music people could relate to; that no matter the situation or circumstance, you just have to live your life. So, I\u2019m glad we achieved that.\u201d\n\nBorn and raised in Port-Harcourt, 1da Banton, dropped his debut single in 2015. Since his debut, he has released one EP and collaborated with Ghanaian Afro Dancehall superstar, Stonebwoy.\n\n\u201cNo wahala\u201d means no stress in Nigerian pidgin, a language widely spoken in Port Harcourt.\n\nThe song is featured in videos of afro-dances; reactions or replies to challenges or questions, sometimes from a loved one or crush. Some of the funniest videos under the challenge feature videos of Nigerian social media influencers, James Brown and Idris Okuneye (popularly known as Bobrisky), dancing, kicking a football, or in the gym.\n\n\u201cMy TikTok video on the \u2018No Wahala\u2019 challenge gave me my highest views and engagement on TikTok. I didn\u2019t expect it,\u201d said Yewande Daranijo, an aspiring actress whose first viral TikTok video has over 300,000 views through this challenge.\n\n\u201cI jumped on the challenge, and boom it went viral. I was really excited, and I\u2019m glad I joined the challenge,\u201d said Daranijo who joined the app about seven months ago. Before the challenge, Daranijo did not know about 1da Banton, but now she knows him and believes he will get his due now that a lot of people know his song.\n\n1da Banton recalled that at the time his song was blowing up in France, he wasn\u2019t a regular user of Tik Tok and was still finding his way around the app.\n\n\u201cSo, \u2018No Wahala\u2019 doing so well on TikTok wasn\u2019t me; it was people. I just gave them the song. From now on, it would be a great idea to follow up on TikTok because of the influence it has on music today.\u201d\n\n1da Banton explained that all of his social media\u2014YouTube and Instagram\u2014is growing: \u201cEveryone is trying to check out who sang this amazing song, so all my numbers are going up.\u201d\n\nAnd as Nigerian artiste CKay did a few weeks ago, 1da Banton created a video on TikTok where he tried to claim ownership of the \u201cNo Wahala\u201d sound. He might have been successful with that, but his dance skills in the video were questionable, an assessment he agrees to and laughs about.\n\n\u201cUp until now, a lot of people still don\u2019t know that I am the owner of the song. It\u2019s a gradual process. I just had to make that video as a part of the process. I\u2019m not really a good dancer, but I still had to dance to the song. I needed them to understand that I am the original owner of the song.\u201d\n\nThis year alone, TikTok has taken at least three African songs to the global stage, and it is making Africans feel represented. Somali singer Nimco Happy\u2019s song, \u201cIsii Nafta\u201d, became an internet sensation, with celebrities like Cardi B, Trevor Noah, and Bella Hadid using the song in content. More than 100,000 videos have been created using the song. The viral song which switches between Swahili, English, Arabic, and Somali has left many Somalis celebrating the fact that their culture is in the global spotlight.\n\nCKay\u2019s \u201cLove Nwantiti\u201d also took over TikTok for weeks, earlier this year, with more than three million videos created using the song. As of September of this year, it was the most Shazamed song in the world and charting in 160 countries.\n\nTikTok\u2019s impact on music in Africa is growing and proving to be a massive support for artistes who may now create and strengthen the reach of their music beyond the continent, without a bank-breaking marketing campaign.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Can Kenya get out of the supply chain crisis?",
          "text": "Q4 is coming to a close, the holiday season is upon us, and Kenya\u2019s businesses are settling their accounts for the year.\n\nIn many ways, transport and logistics, which support numerous sectors of the Kenyan economy, seem to be on an upswing. The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) reported a 4.4% growth in container traffic during the first eight months of the year, and Kenya\u2019s all-new port at Lamu launched in May.\n\nBut, alongside positive figures and groundbreaking infrastructure projects that point to an optimistic outlook for the logistics industry, Kenya\u2014just like the US, UK, and other countries throughout the world\u2014is also feeling the impact of a COVID-19-induced supply chain shortage.\n\nWill tech offer a solution to help the industry sustain itself?\n\nA global meltdown\n\nOn a global level, the supply chain meltdown began with a container shortage that cropped up at the end of 2020, with freight rates rising higher than 264%, compared to previous years. Prior to this, containers moved from China to Europe and North America, but COVID-19 restrictions limited air freight, creating an increased demand that prevented the flow of containers back to East Asia.\n\nFollowing that, demand for Chinese exports skyrocketed after a pandemic-induced slump. At this point, global supply chains were already out of balance, and demand for exports exceeded the supply of shipping containers.\n\nBy March 2021, shipping container rates from China to the US and Europe had increased by 300%, compared to the year before.\n\nTrade under lockdown\n\nIn Kenya, it began with a lockdown.\n\nThe start of the pandemic led to a gridlock in Kenya\u2019s transport industry that had an immediate impact on the country itself, and the region as a whole.\n\nIndustries with markets outside of the East African community were among the hardest hit. East Africa\u2019s flower industry, for example, which ships fresh flowers via air to European countries, suffered an estimated $1 billion in losses when European countries sealed their borders. Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second-largest flower exporter, also reported an 80% reduction in flower export volume.\n\nDue to restricted sea and air routes, imports to Kenya decreased by 23%, but the permission of select land transport that allowed goods to flow by land between borders meant that \u201cother countries in the East African community benefited,\u201d said Manaseh Otieno, Trade and Policy Manager at the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM). For example, trade between Kenya, an exporter of palm oil, petroleum oil, and salt, and Uganda, an exporter of milk, tobacco, cane, and energy, increased by 11.3%.\n\nBut transport by land between the countries was still slow and prohibitively expensive.\n\nAs positive COVID cases began to increase in East Africa, Rwanda, Uganda, and Kenya agreed to test all truck drivers entering and exiting the three countries. However, unequal distribution of COVID-19 resources and inadequate supply chains to get them to East Africa meant a scarce number of test kits. This led to a buildup of drivers along the border, lost goods, an overall decrease of truck inflows into Uganda, and an increase in shipping cost at around 48%.\n\nWhile the flower industry is rebounding and trucks are moving more freely, the temporary dismemberment of the supply chain industry may continue to have knock-on effects on businesses in the East African economy.\n\nShortages\n\nThe US is already feeling inflationary pressures caused by supply chain issues that have resulted in a 6.2% increase in the US Consumer Price Index\u2014a measurement used to estimate price changes in a basket of goods\u2014compared to last year.\n\nKenya is experiencing a similar phenomenon.\n\nIn April, the cost of bread in Kenya increased by $.044 for the first time in four years and is set to increase yet again. The Cereal Millers Association (CMA) points to lower global wheat stocks, marine freight issues, and the rising cost of fuel to its highest levels in the past 10 years as the causes of the price increase.\n\nReliability is key\n\nKenya\u2019s potential supply chain crisis and its impact can be mitigated.\n\nA major aspect of the rise in prices caused by the current meltdowns is uncertainty, which can be costly in the logistics industry.\n\nThe market is currently highly uncertain, which can present difficulties for even the most well organised businesses.\n\n\u201cThe shipping lines are like a small mafia,\u201d said Dr. Simeon Obidairo, co-owner of BoConcept, a contemporary, Danish, luxury furniture line in the process of reopening in Nairobi.\u201cThey tell you transit times for the shipping is going to be six weeks; the shipment leaves, and they end up delivering it 12 weeks later. So, we\u2019ve seen at least double the typical transit times.\u201d\n\nA typical method of organising and tracking shipments to lessen supply chain disruptions is through the use of technology, which, when underutilised, creates major operational kinks that can be cumbersome to correct.\n\nLogi-tech\n\nA new Personal Information Protection Law out of China, for example, is preventing the provision of real-time shipping information by some China-based shipping companies, triggering fears of further shipping disruptions. As China is home to six out of 10 of the world\u2019s largest container ports, this has caused a 90% drop in terrestrial shipping data that companies use to track the arrival and departure of essential goods.\n\nEast Africa\u2019s logistics industry is still growing to a place where it is similarly tech-reliant. At present, most trade in the region happens informally. But more reliability is highly desired: \u201cWe need frameworks to support digital trade,\u201d said Manaseh Otieno. \u201cWhatever the client has ordered should be what they actually get. And if it isn\u2019t, there should be a mechanism to address these issues.\u201d\n\nDue to pandemic-induced demand shocks, transporters in the region also cut back. As consumption rises amid holiday festivities, and businesses increase capacity, those who fail to become more tech-reliant may find themselves \u201cill-positioned across the country primarily due to the low adoption of technology by the industry,\u201d said Tayo Oyegunle, COO of Moove, a logistics platform that offers on-demand solutions to both customers and businesses within East Africa.\n\nInvestor appetite for the transport and logistics sector was still high in 2021, with a total of $200 million raised by the industry as a whole in Africa during the first eight months of the year. But, much of this has been attributed to the January commencement of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), a 34-member-state-strong agreement that aims to introduce non-tariff barriers throughout the African continent.\n\nBut, the AfCFTA\u2019s success for Kenya and the region as a whole also necessitates more coordination on a technological level. Without it, it may be years before we see supply chain issues corrected and an environment for freer trade realised.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How African startups can build multi-million dollar deals",
          "text": "The year 2021 has set many new standards for Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem. As reporter Alexander Onwukwue states, \u201cIt\u2019s the year African startups normalised $100 million rounds.\u201d It\u2019s the year francophone Africa produced its first unicorn, Wave, which raised $200 million at a $1.7 billion valuation.\n\nIt\u2019s also the year of mergers and acquisitions, with over 333 M&A deals worth $51 billion done in the first half of the year alone, a 567% increase in deal value from 2020\u2019s $8 billion. Following Stripe\u2019s acquisition of Paystack in a $200 million deal in 2020, quite a number of notable acquisitions have occurred. From Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha, MaxAB\u2019s acquisition of Morocco\u2019s WaystoCap, and even Piggyvest\u2019s acquisition of Savi, companies in the ecosystem are consolidating to solve some of the continent\u2019s taxing issues.\n\nOne of the biggest acquisition deals of 2021 is MFS Africa\u2019s deal with Capricorn. In October, MFS Africa\u2014the largest fintech interoperability hub in Africa\u2014signed a deal to acquire Capricorn Digital, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest digital solutions and distribution companies. While the amount is undisclosed, both parties confirmed that the deal is Nigeria\u2019s \u201csecond-largest\u201d fintech acquisition deal, second only to Paystack\u2019s $200 million acquisition deal with Stripe.\n\nBut how do hundred-million-dollar deals get made? And why are more startups hitching their wagons together? On December 3, TechCabal brought Dare Okoudjou, MFS Africa CEO, and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Capricorn together in a live session to answer some of these questions.\n\nBig deals start out small\n\nFor Dare Okoudjou\u2014who has led MFS Africa\u2019s growth in 35 African countries\u2014big deals and acquisitions don\u2019t always start out as big deals. \u201cBig deals are done over time, and sometimes, they start off as minority investments talks which evolve into acquisition talks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first time Degbola and I spoke in 2014, Capricorn had just started and we\u2014MFS Africa\u2014we\u2019re trying to help him raise money. Fast forward to 2020, and we\u2019re speaking about acquisitions.\u201d\n\nDare Okoudjou, founder and CEO of MFS Africa, and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Capricorn.\n\nOn Capricorn\u2019s end, Degbola Abudu and his team had been fundraising for a while, and while they weren\u2019t planning on getting acquired, the deal was a realistic next step for them. \u201cInitially, MFS Africa was supposed to be an investor. Conversations for this present deal started even before COVID, and by the end of 2020, when it became clearer, we were more open to it. There were many conversations between myself and Dare, and many more between myself and the Capricorn board.\u201d\n\nWhile Capricorn\u2019s motivation for taking the deal was geared towards sustainability, MFS Africa\u2019s was targeted at growth and expansion. \u201cMFS has agent networks in 35 SSA countries and the opportunity to merge that with what exists in Nigeria isn\u2019t easily replicated,\u201d Okoudjou said. \u201cWe\u2019d been eyeing Nigeria for a while, hoping that the mobile money network would kick-off, but it didn\u2019t. On the other hand, there was Capricorn which had built a strong agent network of 90,000 agents. When we realised that, it was evident what the next steps were.\u201d\n\nBuilding trust and partnerships\n\nRecognising strategic partnerships is something that can be said of MFS Africa\u2019s earlier acquisitions. Prior to Capricorn, MFS Africa had acquired two other companies. In 2020, the company acquired Beyonic, a Ugandan fintech delivering payment management solutions to SMEs. That deal also started off with several conversations on strategic partnerships between Beyonic\u2019s CEO, Luke Kyouhere.\n\nIn 2016, MFS Africa acquired Sochitel\u2014a company that specialised in international airtime transfers into Africa\u2014and the acquisition, according to MFS Africa, helped create the largest transfer payment network which focuses on Africa.\n\nThe company has also made six minority investments in companies across the continent including Maviance, Numida, Julaya, and Inclusivity solutions. One crucial thing that has helped these relationships\u2014investments and acquisitions\u2014is trust.\n\n\u201cIn considering acquisitions at MFS Africa, we start with our destination, our North star. We want to be in all 54 African countries, and we don\u2019t want borders to matter. You can be in Benin and make transactions with people in Zambia, or in Nigeria. Over time, we\u2019ve calculated what that means, infrastructure and regulation-wise for us. And when we want to invest or acquire a company, we ask ourselves how or if that investment or acquisition will bring us closer to these goals. That\u2019s usually the starting point,\u201d Okoudjou said. \u201cThe thing that usually makes or breaks these things is the people. Because, in the end, if you can\u2019t work with the people, it doesn\u2019t matter what the spreadsheets say.\u201d\n\nAbudu also agrees that trust is a necessary ingredient to any big deal. \u201cOther than being realistic, trust was one thing we had to show, and for that to happen, we had to be open on our end. We had to be clear what the acquisition meant for our people and it was important to be open about everything. That\u2019s what startups need to understand. Hiding things won\u2019t help you in the long run, and with trust, you can even work towards solving some of those crucial points together.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Kwara raises a $4m seed to build Africa\u2019s first credit union-powered neobank",
          "text": "One of the beauties of fintech is its ability to either unbundle or seamlessly bundle fragmented and broken banking services. While some startups focus on building digital consumer banks, others focus on building banks for businesses, or for both.\n\nOne startup building for both is Kenya-based Kwara, a one-stop-shop core digital banking infrastructure for Savings and Credit Co-operatives (SACCOs) to manage all their activities, and it has raised $4 million seed funding.\n\nThe new investment will be used to facilitate the launching of its neobank; further develop its existing app; double down on its marketing efforts; and increase its talent pool.\n\nThe investment was led by Breega, with participation from SoftBank Vision Fund, Emerge, FINCA Ventures, New General Market Partners, Globivest, Do Good Invest, Raba Capital, Launch Africa, Norrsken Impact Accelerator, Future Africa, Samurai Incubate, DOB Equity, and fintech angels.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile many people think that SACCOs are a slow, vulnerable, and outdated way of saving and accessing credit, and that the market needs new agile products that could displace this model, Kwara, founded by Cynthis Wandia (CEO) and David Hwan (CTO), wants to keep it going by enhancing its efficiency through digitising all its core functionalities.\n\nA true cooperative guardian angel\n\nWendia had just rounded up her first startup and joined Finparx, a venture builder in Germany, to work as a venture developer; there she spent most of her days staring eye-to-eye at different problems. But what struck her the most was the problem of coffee farmers not getting much value for their hard work. Wendia\u2019s grandmother was a coffee farmer in Kenya so this was nostalgic.\n\nShe became curious and started digging. Her interest started off from a trade finance angle, looking at the supply chain, to see if there was something that could be done. But the more she looked at the value chain, starting from the farmer\u2019s point of view to export, she kept coming across this institution called the credit union or the cooperative, which is effectively like a financial institution or bank, but owned by its clients.\n\n\u201cI noticed, for example, that for my grandmother, the cooperative had walked with her on her entire economic journey. The more I looked into it, the more we saw just how incredible this institution is in offering extremely affordable financial products like savings, loans and pension,\u201d Wendia told TechCabal.\n\nSo, after further research on SACCOs in Kenya and across the world, Wendia and her team realised that these cooperatives are a sort of informal bank, \u201cthe fairest bank\u201d, in Wendia\u2019s words. But they saw how far behind they were in leveraging technology that could take their efficiency from zero to 100. \u201cSo, we launched Kwara as a technology infrastructure for SACCOs,\u201d Wendia said.\n\nIn 2019, the Kwara core banking product was launched and, ever since, has become a safe haven for Kenyan cooperatives. But the ambition has expanded from just being a banking infrastructure to becoming an operating system for every growth-oriented SACCO in Kenya.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nAccording to Wendia, the platform now powers over 50 cooperatives, with over 65,000 backend users. The company is reportedly growing its credit union customer base by 40% month-on-month, and the listed credit unions are growing their membership by 19% and their loan base by 46%, annually. There are currently more than $142 million assets under management at a $40 million monthly transaction across savings, loan disbursement, pension and lots more.\n\nBecause Kenya is a big market for cooperatives, the company is going through a product expansion as opposed to market expansion. Though it\u2019s reported to be courting some credit union clients in South Africa and the Philippines, which, according to the CEO, validates their solution across multiple markets. The company wants to focus on eliminating the existing frictions in the Kenyan market, a move that will somewhat guarantee seamless replication across other markets.\n\nFor instance, in a bid to become an operating system for SACCO, it has partnered with Workpay, a human resource management and payroll processing solutions company, to enable SACCOs automate their human resource (HR) processes as a complimentary service to Kwara\u2019s products. Onboarded SACCOs will be able to carry out seamless payroll processing into SACCO accounts and enjoy access to an HR module for efficient management of their staff.\n\n\u201cWe have also partnered with Lami insurance API provider, which plugs us into about 20 underwriters in Kenya. Now, our customers [SACCOs] can negotiate or choose fantastic insurance products right from our platform,\u201d Wendia said.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Kwara?\n\nThere are over 300 million people currently banking within emerging markets, and that number is growing at 6% year-on-year. Kwara aims to increase that to at least 1 billion by the end of the decade, positioning itself as the platform for $500bn in transactions between credit unions and their members.\n\nDue to that, it\u2019s launching a new bank that will be powered by its existing credit unions. The play here is to turn over 65,000 backend users into early users of its neobank while onboarding more credit unions to ramp up more users.\n\nThe neobank will allow members of credit unions to deposit money directly to their credit union accounts, repay their loans, and apply for instant loans while tracking their finances and payments, all in a seamless manner. In addition, Kwara is building an open banking infrastructure via an open API that allows credit unions to integrate with payment gateways, banks, and third-party vendors, enabling a full marketplace. Also, any unbanked individual can easily join a credit union and then enjoy the whole banking benefits.\n\nSpeaking on launching a neobank and on the investment that will make it possible. Kwara CEO, Cynthia Wandia, says, \u201cWe are building a solution for people\u2014an estimated 1 billion\u2014who do not currently have access to personalised banking services. This is the result of a gap in banking-grade technology and the lack of neobank-like experiences for the end clients.\u201d\n\nShe said they [Kwara] have been thrilled to see the \u201cexcitement around the Kwara brand among credit unions and their members, which is fast becoming synonymous with a superior user experience and the future of banking. Thanks to our investors, we will now be able to offer an end-client experience that is 100 times better than what they previously had access to\u201d.\n\n\u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve seen an increasing interest in how to build wealth through community, as well as a shift in consumer preferences towards digital-first banking,\u201d said Ben Marrel, Founding partner at Breega, who led the investment. \u201cKwara\u2019s unique approach is a catalyst for a new way of retail banking through digital-first credit unions. We are both proud and excited to be helping this outstanding team scale across Africa and other emerging markets.\u201d\n\nKwara aims\u2014without branching away from its core mission of empowering credit unions across Africa and the rest of the world\u2014to help 1 billion people benefit from credit unions through its neobank by the end of the decade.\n\n\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Mafab Communications: The underdog winner of Nigeria\u2019s 5G license",
          "text": "Mafab Communications Limited, the unexpected winner of Nigeria\u2019s second 5G license last night, was until December 2, 2021, the day the auction was announced, unknown to very few people.\n\nThe entire telecommunication industry has been buzzing about the emergence of Mafab Communications isn\u2019t the $273.6 million it has to pay by 24 February 2022, for the 3.5GHz band license to deploy 5G network in the country. Payment is expected to be made in naira at the prevailing Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) exchange rate. And the interest isn\u2019t because Mafab beat Airtel, a well-known operator with vast experience that spans beyond Nigeria. What has those who know the industry is that there is scant information about the experience of Mafab in telecommunications, much less for a project as big as deploying a 5G network.\n\nThe NCC, however, says according to its Draft Information Memorandum (IM), new entrants were to participate in the bid and if they are successful, the commission will issue the new entry an operating license in line with the extant provision of the Nigerian Communications Act (NCA) 2003 and its licensing regulations.\n\nAt the auction, Mafab was represented by Musbahu Muhammad Bashir, the chairman of the Althani Group, an Abuja-based group that oversees a collection of companies. The companies include Eman Homes & Estate, Althani Investment Limited, Salam Takaful Insurance, and Mafab Communications.\n\nPrior to the auction, BusinessDay had noted a lack of information on the Mafab Communications website regarding the leadership of the communication company.\n\nOn Monday, shortly after it was announced a winner, the company\u2019s website experienced glitches. The glitches continued on Tuesday morning.\n\nHowever, in defense of the company, the NCC said it had previously issued licenses to the company. Mafab secured a 20-year International Data Access (IDA) license and an Interconnect Exchange license from the NCC on 1 October 2020.\n\nThe NCC had noted that only operational telecom providers are eligible for IDA licenses in its guidelines on International Gateway Access and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).\n\nThe NCC in the guideline noted that \u201cAny licensee of the commission who does not have a network shall not be eligible for an IDA license. Specifically, only operational licensees will be eligible for IDA licenses.\u201d\n\nRead also: MTN Nigeria, Mafab pay $546m to get 5G licence\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s search on the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) found that Mafab Communications Limited was registered on 8 July 2020. It, therefore, would suggest that Mafab secured the IDA license in less than 4 months of incorporation. Meanwhile, the company has no record of clients on its website.\n\nHowever, Ike Adinde, Director of Communications, NCC told BusinessDay that the IM from the commission did not preclude any operator from participating in the licensing round. According to him, Mafab Communications was very eligible to take part.\n\nThe Transparency Nigeria Group said it has petitioned the Federal Government of Nigeria and all the relevant security agencies to immediately launch an investigation into the business practices of Mafab Communications Limited.\n\n\u201cMafab Communications was incorporated in 2020, has no comprehensive tax history, and appears to have been specifically set up by connected insiders for the purpose of acquiring one of the highly valued 5G licenses,\u201d the group said in a statement signed by Umar Dadiyata and shared with BusinessDay.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s happened before Teniola Olusola, former President of the Association for Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ATCON) says the emergence of Mafab has precedent in the industry.\n\nFor example in 2014, following several failed attempts to sell off the government-owned Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL), and its mobile arm, the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) announced the national carrier was acquired by a group known as NATCOM.\n\nNATCOM was a consortium of seven Nigerian companies. They emerged as the new owners of NITEL and MTEL by offering to pay $252 million which met the BPE\u2019s bid price. NATCOM went on to transform the national carrier into nTel.\n\nTeniola says what should be a priority is to ensure that the company is able to roll out the service in time.\n\nAjibola Olude, General Secretary and Chief Operating Officer of ATCON told BusinessDay that the auction process was very transparent.\n\n\u201cIs there anything I will say, it is to commend the commission on a world-class auction,\u201d he said.\n\nMeet the chairman of Mafab\n\nMusbahu Muhammad Bashir, the chairman of Al Thani, the parent company of Mafab Communications also serves as chairman on the board of Cobalt International Services Limited, a company the provides pre-shipment inspection agent services for businesses in the oil and gas sector in Nigeria.\n\nHe is also a member of the board of directors at Jaiz Bank, which operates the Islamic banking principles and non-interest loan services.",

          "title": "Petrol subsidy spend equals nearly half of reported 2021 tax income",
          "text": "Between January and September this year, the Federal Government of Nigeria collected N2.81 trillion in taxes but spent over N1.004 trillion, equivalent to 48 percent of total collections on petrol subsidy, an expenditure pattern analysts say puts the economy at risk.\n\nWhat Nigeria has paid to subsidise petrol since January is higher than what it budgeted to spend on education and health, expenses that would have raised the living standards of its people and translated to economic growth.\n\nWorse still, the Federal Government did not make any provision for subsidy in the 2021 budget but according to the review of the government\u2019s expenditure since January, debt service of N1.80 trillion is the single expenditure higher than subsidy.\n\nData collated from the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows the Federal Government collected an estimated N2.81 trillion in the last 9 months from Value Added Tax (VAT) and Company Income Tax (CIT).\n\nProceeds from VAT totaled N1.14 trillion, while CIT collections accounted for N1.33 trillion in the past 9 months.\n\nHowever, petrol imports gulped N1.05tn in the third quarter of this year, up from N782.46 billion in the second quarter and N687.74 billion in the first quarter, according to the NBS data.\n\nRead also: NNPC records \u20a6141.96bn trading surplus\n\nData sourced from NNPC\u2019s report submitted to Federation Account Allocation Committee revealed petrol subsidy totalled N448.3 billion in the third quarter of this year, up 17 percent from the second quarter\u2019s N383.9 billion; the subsidy paid in the second quarter is 94 percent higher than the N197.8 billion spent in the first three months in 2021.\n\nInternational financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund advised governments to cut costly national subsidies and to provide them in a targeted fashion to poor communities.\n\nAnalysts at the World Bank in a recent report said fiscal pressures have increased for Nigeria as higher petrol subsidy costs cut revenues, urging bold reforms to boost income.\n\n\u201cThe Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) subsidy is eroding Nigeria\u2019s limited fiscal space to provide essential services,\u201d it said. \u201cAggressive reform efforts could contribute more to growth than a sustained period of high oil prices.\u201d\n\nNigeria has fallen behind on implementing reforms started at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the bank said, adding that growth rates will lag those of other emerging economies, unless momentum is restored.\n\n\u201cThe subsidies regime in the (petroleum) sector remains unsustainable and economically disingenuous,\u201d Ahmed said during the launch of the report.\n\nMele Kyari, NNPC\u2019s group managing director, said in a recent interview that the ordinary man hardly benefits from this subsidy. \u201cWe sincerely believe this is the perfect time to ensure that these benefits come to the ordinary man and not to the elites.\u201d\n\nThe poor in Nigeria rely heavily on public transit. As a result, their per capita fuel consumption is substantially lower than that of the country\u2019s wealthy, who typically drive private vehicles. Also, petrol subsidy is encouraging petrol smuggling outside Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\nNigeria is planning to replace subsidies next year with N5,000 monthly payment to over 40million poor people but analysts say it is replacing one problem with another.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest oil producer, unlike other countries, does not charge VAT for petrol, a development that denies the country valuable revenue.\n\nA back of the envelope calculation shows if 7.5 percent VAT is applied to an estimated daily imports of 60 million liters of petrol, the Nigerian economy could be generating N742m daily and N271bn yearly.\n\nAs Nigeria moves gradually towards the election, some analysts are concerned the government will be unable to muster the courage to remove petrol subsidies considering the widespread poverty in the country.\n\nAnalysts at the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) said the Nigerian government is unlikely to remove petrol subsidy until after the general elections in 2023 despite the Petroleum Industry Act abolishing the practice.\n\nIn an election, the government may prioritise sound policy for populism but this could worsen poverty and lead to further instability.\n\n\u201cThe Buhari administration has a track record of making U-turns when faced with severe political resistance and this complicates the medium-term economic and fiscal policy outlook,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nThe EIU noted that it may take a new government to finally end petrol subsidies forced by deteriorating fiscal conditions.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nLAGOS- President General of Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria (MWUN), Prince Adewale Adeyanju has decried the work attitude of the new Executive Secretary/Chief Executive of Nigeria Shippers Council (NSC) Hon Emmanuel Jime who was alleged of shunning the industry stakeholders since assumption.\n\nComrade Adeyanju spoke in an interview with journalists in Lagos, at the weekend alleged that since the assumption of the new NSC boss to office he has refused to engage with the industry stakeholders on ways to tackle the myriad of problems confronting the industry with the view of charting the way forward for the nation\u2019s maritime sector.\n\nHe cited the example of the reported invasion of the offices of some of the shipping companies in Lagos by the alleged officials of the Federal Consumers Competition Protection Commission (FCCPC) with heavily armed men, to explain why he so worried over how the Nigeria Shippers Council has abdicated its responsibilities in just few months that Barr. Hassan Bello, the immediate ES/CEO of the Council retired from service.\n\nAdeyanju said: \u201cThis development explains the issue I am raising about the new man at the Shippers\u2019 Council who is not meeting with stakeholders. If the invasion of the shipping companies\u2019 offices had taken place in the time of Hassan Bello you will see him in the forefront of the struggle to engage those invaders. He will be there.\u201d\n\nHe continued; \u201cWe have written to congratulate Emmanuel Jimmy on his appointment, and for a courtesy visit, but he has never deemed it fit to meet with the union so that we can advise him. Back to the question of the invasion of the shipping companies by the said government agency, nobody can enter your compound without due process. When that invasion occurred, we were taken aback with my team. We left this office around 8pm that day. When they came, they attacked Hull Blyte, Cosco and others to the extent that they invaded the shipping Line\u2019s servers.\n\n\u201cWe condemned that act no doubt, but a senior officer of the Nigerian Shippers\u2019 Council (name withheld) called me and asked me where those government officials that invaded the shipping companies with heavily armed came from. My response to him was simple, you are the regulator, and you need to investigate them properly.\n\n\u201cWe, however, wrote to the new man at the Shippers\u2019 Council over the incident, but no response. So we felt we could handle it in our own style. We are watching the new ES. As a regulator of the port industry your door must be open to those you are regulating always. That is how it was in the time of Hassan Bello and that is why the industry is already missing him,\u201d he said.\n\nComrade Adeyanju further recalled with nostalgia the administration of Barr. Hassan Bello, saying, \u201cLeaders come and leaders go, what you do will also be on record and I am telling you today that we are missing somebody in the industry, somebody that has been an intermediary between maritime stakeholders whenever the need arises. When he was there we did not value his performances, we thought what the man was doing was not supposed to be his job but where are we now? I am talking about Alhaji Hassan Bello the former Executive Secretary, Nigeria Shippers\u2019 Council. We are missing him greatly within this short period that he has been retired.\n\n\u201cI am not trying to praise him, but the truth is that when Bello was the ES at the Shippers\u2019 Council, you will see him at the terminals. But now the council is not visible as it was during Bello. It\u2019s a fact whether you like it or not. Since his appointment, has he called any stakeholders meeting, how is he doing his job?\n\n\u201cTo us at MWUN we don\u2019t know if the Executive Secretary of Nigerian Shippers\u2019 Council has been changed, all we know is that Hassan Bello is on leave and that is my word. The acting MD of NPA has been active, whenever there are issues with the terminal operators and if he is not available, he will send the Port Manager to liaise with us\u201d, he said.\n\n...",

          "text": "Christian elders in Northern Nigeria under the aegis of Northern States Christian Elders Forum (NOSCEF) have rejected the idea fielding a Muslim presidential and vice presidential candidates in 2023, describing it as insensitive and selfish.\n\nThe elder\u2019s reaction comes amid speculation that former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu, a Muslim, is seeking to run for president under the platform of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) with a Muslim vice presidential candidate from the North West, and had reportedly told Muslims in the North that his South West region would not mind a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nThere is a move by the Kaduna Integrity Group and 5 others to woo Mr.Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim of the APC into the Presidential race in 2023, insisting that he is the perfect, potential President that would unite Nigeria.\n\nThe group in their reaction in a statement, signed by its Chairman, Engineer Ejoga Oyinehi Inalegwu, made available to newsmen in Kaduna on Tuesday, said \u201cthe Northern States Christian Elders Forum (NOSCEF) read with concerns the reported meeting of a frontline politician with some Northern Elders, advocating a Muslim/Muslim ticket, if given the Presidential ticket and many days after, the report has not been refuted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wonder which Northern Elders were in the said meeting. Let us recall the Chief Abiola Alhaji Kingibe Muslim-Muslim ticket that won the election in a military imposed two-party system in 1993. Majority of Nigerians, including myself voted for that ticket because, a vote for that ticket was a vote for fairness, equity, justice and power rotation between North and South, South East and North East,\u201d they said.\n\nThe elders noted that at the previous election, Alhaji Shehu Shagari (North West)/Dr. Ekwueme (South East) ruled Nigeria and Abiola/Kingibe therefore, meant power shifting between North and South and in the North, power shifting from North West to North East and in the South, from South West to South East.\n\n\u201cRemember there were no other alternatives since it was a two party system. \u201cTherefore, the same injustice, inequity, marginalization that Nigerians fought against to vote a Muslim\u2013Muslim ticket cannot now be promoted by voting same Muslim-Muslim or Christian- Christian ticket,\u201d it said.\n\nThey explained that Nigerians in 1993, bent over backward to vote and affirm with one voice, that the ill of religious and regional differences were more tolerable than injustice, inequity and marginalization.\n\n\u201cNortherners across religious lines voted for Chief Abiola from the south, and expected that thereafter that it would only be fair, for power to shift back to North East or North Central.\n\n\u201cThe voting pattern re-echoed Fayemi\u2019s saying that \u201cunity cannot endure where injustice, marginalization and inequity thrives\u201d. It was a vote against injustice and marginalization,\u201d they recalled.\n\nNOSCEF said that it is deeply concerned about this kite being flown again. According to it, \u201cWhen we remember the speculated rift between Senator Bukola Saraki and the clique that had pressed in 2015 for a Buhari/Tinubu Muslim-Muslim ticket, which Saraki and many like-minded patriots had considered insensitive in the Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cLinking it with the North West, would remind observing Nigerians, who have seen how a similar insensitivity has deepened the divide and mistrust in the North West state,\u201d they pointed out.\n\nThe group said that they had identified with the President in his call for unity and therefore, condemn in strong terms, any move that will further aggravate the lines of divide for selfish political gains at the expense of a peaceful and united Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to all Nigerians across party, regional, ethnic and religious divides to rise up and mobilize the citizenship against any inconsiderate politician or political grouping, seeking to promote exclusion and marginalization of any section of our country.\n\n\u201cThose that do not wish Nigeria well have no business seeking its leadership,\u201d they warned.\n\nThey added that such politicians will make every attempt to manipulate Nigerians as a people, through double talks and deceit but, \u201cwe trust that God who put us together for a great nation, will defeat them in all their antics/craftiness and bring to pass the expectations of true and patriotic Nigerians seeking a truly united and prosperous Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThey therefore, tasked Nigerians to pray that anyone who plans to rise to power in Nigeria, by fueling the embers of discrimination, using the instrumentation of religious ethnic differences will fail, because God is greater and wiser than any manipulation of man.\n\n\u201cNOSCEF being mindful of the various crisis that has bedeviled our nation to date calls on all Nigerians to be vigilante and prepared to defeat the enemies to our peaceful co-existence without regard to party affiliation and persuasion.\n\n\u201cRemember that loyalty to the nation Nigeria, ranks far above loyalty to any party.\n\n\u201cThe nation is in dire need of a selfless, considerate, sensitive, honest, transparent leader who will unite, bind, heal the wounds that have posed a great danger to our corporate existence as a nation, integrate and foster lasting bonds of unity of our dear country.\n\n\u201cWe need politicians across party lines and all peace loving Nigerians across religious, regional and ethnic divides to reject politicians sowing seeds of further polarization and work for/align with inclusiveness, unity, equity, fairness, justice.\n\n\u201cThis might even entail going against regional and party affiliations to drive home the point that power is giving in trust for the good of the people not for self centered ambition.\n\n\u201cAnyone that is seeking the highest political office of the land at the expense of the peace the nation and building of tolerance amongst the diversity of our country, cannot lay claim to being a patriot and would therefore have no business being encouraged or voted to such a position.\n\n\u201cNOSCEF enjoins Nigerians to continue to pray for our country,\u201d it concluded.\n\nMeanwhile ,a Group ,the Kaduna Integrity Group ,two women forums and other related associations, met in Kaduna to join forces in asking All Progressives Congress ( APC) chieftain, Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, to give another shot for the Presidency in 2023.\n\nIn a communique at the end of the meeting, signed by Samaila Gari and Florence Johnson, the groups said\n\n\u201cWith a Muslim father from a highly reverend family in the North ,a Christian mother from the Yoruba Southwest ,many business and political associates from the Southeast and South South, coupled with about 30 years experience in the oil and energy sector ,we believe Mr.Olawepo-Hashim is the right successor to President Buhari, come 2023 by the will of Almighty Allah, \u201d they said",

Significant decline in independent revenue sources reflected lower remittances from ministries, departments, and agencies and government business interests,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe apex bank noted, however, that statutory receipt from the federation account rose by 6.2 per cent to N299bn in August, significantly impacting the government\u2019s retained revenue during the review period.\n\nIt said the aggregate expenditure fell by 18.8 per cent from N962.1bn recorded in July due to a reduction in overhead cost and low capital expenditure.\n\nThe report said, \u201cAlthough recurrent expenditure shrunk by 18.3 per cent to N683.46bn following a 48.9 per cent decline in overhead cost, it maintained its dominance in total spending.\n\n\u201cRecurrent expenditure accounted for 87.4 per cent of total spending in August, while capital expenditure and transfers constituted 7.3 per cent and 5.3 per cent, respectively.\u201d\n\nThe bank attributed the low allocation to capital expenditure to the lag in capital releases during the period.\n\nThe report added that the significant drop in aggregate expenditure outweighed the impact of low revenue outcome on the fiscal balance in August, which led to a 25.2 per cent decline in fiscal deficit, from N541.8bn in July to N405.3bn in August.\n\nOn trade performance, the CBN said that Nigeria recorded a higher trade deficit of $820m in August, when compared with $340m in July.\n\nIt said, \u201cAggregate export receipts decreased by 4.7 per cent to $4.24bn in the review period, compared with $4.45bn in the preceding period, owing to lower receipts from crude oil export.\n\n\u201cMerchandise import grew by 5.5 per cent to $5.06bn in August, from $4.80bn in the preceding month, reflecting increased domestic demand for both petroleum and non-oil-related products, occasioned by an uptick in domestic economic activities.\u201d\n\nThe report said crude oil and gas exports declined by 5.4 per cent to $3.78bn from $3.bn in July, due to inventory build-up in the United States, reinforced by the resurgence of the COVID-19 infections.\n\nNon-oil export earnings, however, grew to $460m in August from $450m in July\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Senate President Ahmad Lawan yesterday spoke on the controversy over salaries and allowances of members of the National Assembly.\n\nHe said contrary to allegations of \u201cjumbo pay,\u201d the National Assembly is grossly underfunded in Nigeria compared to other presidential democracies.\n\nThe Senate President, who was guest lecturer at the maiden edition of the \u201cDistinguished Parliamentarians Lecture, 2021,\u201d organised by the National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS), in Abuja, said the budget of the National Assembly is one of the lowest in the world.\n\nSpeaking on the theme: \u201cThe legislature, legislative mandate and the people \u2013 The reality and the public perception\u201d, Lawan reflected on the misconceptions, budget of the National Assembly and constituency projects.\n\nHe also spoke about the corruption, stigmatisation and negative characterisation of the National Assembly as a \u201crubber stamp,\u201d and purchase of operational vehicles for legislators.\n\nOn the National Assembly budget, Lawan said: \u201cThis is perhaps one of the most persistent and vexatious issues that has dented the image of the National Assembly in Nigeria, with widespread presumptions that the budget of the National Assembly is not known.\n\n\u201cIt is well known that the budget of the National Assembly, which has never been above N150billion since 1999, is a fraction of the budget of the Federal Government, much less than the budget of some ministries in the executive.\n\n\u201cThe aggregate budgets approved for National Assembly from 2005 to 2021 and the relative shares in the national budgets show that the budget trended upwards from N54.8billion in 2006, except in 2009, peaking at N154.369 billion in 2010.\n\n\u201cThereafter, it stabilised at N150billion each year. In 2015/2016 and 2019 however, the aggregate allocation to the National Assembly dropped to N120billion and N115billion respectively.\n\n\u201cIn relative terms, the budget allocation to the National Assembly declined from 4.1 per cent of the total federal budget in 2008 to N1.9 per cent in the 2016 fiscal year.\n\n\u201cHowever, in the last four years, the percentage of the National Assembly budget in the federal budget ranged between 0.82 (2021) to 1.44 (2019) per cent of the Federal Government budget.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly, on average, accounts for 2.81 per cent of the national budgetary over the six years between 2011 and 2016, and much less in the last two years.\n\n\u201cBetween 2011 and 2014, the National Assembly attracted an annual budgetary allocation of N150billion, which is about 3 per cent of the total budgets for those years. Thus, the budget of the National Assembly has actually reduced despite the growing complexity and expansion in the operations of the legislature.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly requires the full complement of institutions and agencies to deliver on its constitutional mandate. The key agencies and institutions of the National Assembly include the National Assembly Service Commission (NASC), the National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS), the National Assembly Budget and Research Office (NABRO) and the Public Complaints Commission.\n\n\u201cYet many Nigerians are not even aware of the existing of these agencies. This is in addition to over 3,000 full time legislative staff and about 3,500 legislative aides that assist legislators both at the National Assembly and the various constituency offices.\n\n\u201cThe budget of the National Assembly appears grossly inadequate given its mandate, membership, the scope of operations and agencies under it. For instance, the Assembly will require additional billions of naira if its core committees are to effectively undertake oversight functions, including visits, as mandated in the constitution and the standing committees.\n\n\u201cConsider the 2022 proposed appropriation where defence and security are allocated N2.41trillion (15%); infrastructure N1.45trillion (8.9%); education N1.29trillion (7.9%) health N820billion (5%); and social development and poverty eradication N863billion (5.3%) of the entire allocation.\n\n\u201cThese are critical sectors of the economy and the importance of adequate funding to them cannot be understated. However, the same level of scrutiny that is given to the National Assembly budget should also be applied to other sectors where bigger chunks of the nation\u2019s resources are utilised.\n\n\u201cWhen compared with the legislatures of other democracies like the United States Congress, the following picture would emerge.\n\n\u201cFirst, while the total appropriation to the Nigerian National Assembly dropped from N150billion ($955.33 million) in 2014 to N120billion in 2015 and 2019 ($621.67million) and about N115billion (i.e. $527.52 million) in 2016, total appropriation to the United States Congress increased from $4.2billion in 2014 to $4.3billion in 2015 and 2019, that is over N1.7trillion.\n\n\u201cThe budget has further increased in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic and the recent attack on the Capitol.\n\n\u201cIn view of the size of Nigeria as well as that of the National Assembly but more importantly, the broad mandates conferred on the National Assembly by the 1999 Constitution, the National Assembly is, in fact, grossly underfunded.\u201d\n\nLawan noted that another issue that has contributed to the poor perception of the National Assembly is salaries and allowances of the legislators.\n\nThe salaries of the members of the National Assembly, as approved by the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC), he said, are included in the budget allocated to the National Assembly.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe total salary of a member of the Senate is about N1.5million and that of the House of Representatives is about N1.3million. The quarterly office running allowance for legislators is what is erroneously conflated with a monthly income to create confusion and mislead the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cThe average office running cost for a senator is about N13million while that of a member of the House of Representatives is N8million.\n\n\u201cThis is to cover the cost of local/international travel and transport, consulting of professional service, medical services, office stationery/computer consumables, books, newspapers, magazines and periodicals, maintenance of motor vehicles and office equipment and constituency outreach, among others. This is one of the lowest of any presidential democracy in the world.\u201d\n\nOn contentious constituency projects, he said: \u201cI am the first to agree that we need a sustainable framework for the management of these projects after completion. This should include formal handing over to the states or local governments for maintenance.\u201d\n\nOn corruption in the National Assembly, the Senate President said: \u201cAllegations of corruption must be supported by evidence to avoid \u2018media trial.\u2019 The National Assembly has taken an active step in improving accountability by establishing bodies such as the EFCC and ICPC to combat corruption. We also passed the Freedom of Information Act that grants access to the public on the activities of government agencies.\u201d\n\nLawan said the purchase of vehicles for use of legislators has also received extensive media attention.\n\nHe noted that the argument against the purchase of official vehicles for legislators is at best counter-intuitive and at worst malicious and intended to turn the public against lawmakers.\n\n\u201cIf civil servants from the rank of assistant director and above are entitled to official vehicles and some ministers have a convoy of cars, why is the allocation of a Toyota Camry to members and a Land Cruiser (to Senators) such a hideous proposition?\n\n\u201cWhile I am not against constructive criticism and engagement, I think it is important that our analysis of issues are fair and objective.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari who declared the event open said that the introduction of the Distinguished Parliamentarians Lecture offers a verifiable platform to enunciate outcomes of research, comparative analysis, best practices, practical reasoning and policy implications of the choices available to the country in her quest to enthrone good governance.\n\nRepresented by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, Buhari noted that\n\nthe theme for the 2021 lecture: is very apt and \u201cI hope that it will present an opportunity to the legislature to remind itself of its mandate and the exercise thereof, to all Nigerians, so as to avoid the frictions always associated with some interpretation.\n\n\u201cI therefore charge the National Assembly and the institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies to ensure that outcome is well documented and circulated.\n\n\u201cl similarly charge you to ensure that this lecture series is sustained and targeted at addressing key national and constitutional issues in a manner that would strengthen our democracy, eliminate grey areas and enthrone best practices.\n\n\u201cThe executive arm of government shall continue to build on the existing good working relationship with the legislature to ensure that the interest of every Nigerian is advanced and public good delivered.\u201d\n\nFormer Senate President, Dr. Ken Nnamani, who was chairman of the event noted that the present National Assembly is raising the bar by organizing the lecture where people come to exchange and cross-fertalise ideas because the art of law making is an ongoing process.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt evolves. It is not static. It is dynamic. And for daring to deem it necessary to organise a gathering of this nature and to have the chairman of National Assembly himself deliver the first of the series, I think it is quite commendable. They have shown that nothing is so good that it cannot be improved upon.\u201d\n\nIn his welcome address, the Director General of NILDS, Prof. Abubakar Sulaiman, noted that the lecture series has been initiated by the National Assembly as a bi-annual event to broaden legislative experience by bringing together eminent Nigerians, speakers, parliamentarians to share knowledge and encourage thought provoking conversations on issues of national importance especially those having relevance to the Nigerian legislature.\u201d Nation\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

Just as collaborations between governments are boosting the advance of Security Forces in the fight against terrorism, alliances and group efforts like LOPIS should be the backbone to rebuilding our terrorism-infested communities.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no gun more powerful than enlightenment and education at the grass-root level.\u201d",

This will go a long way to alleviating the sufferings of Nigerians afflicted by the diseases in one way or the other,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the Chairman, Senate Committee on Water Resources, Bello Mandiya, water and sanitation are very critical in preventing and eliminating the diseases as 72 out of 774 local government councils in Nigeria are free from open defecation, a practice that is most prevalent in Nigeria across the globe.\n\nThe Minister of State for Health, Senator Olorunnibe Mamora, in his submissions, said Nigeria ranks either first or second globally in the prevalence of the diseases aside Malaria which is a massive killer in the country.\n\nGovernment alone he explained, cannot do it all as corporate organisations need to join in the campaign of eliminating the diseases largely domiciled in rural areas.\n\n\u201cRural dwellers too need to help government in getting rid of the killer diseases by being hygienic as regards water they drink and how they empty their bowels as far as defecation is concerned,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "With the 2021 Finance Amendment Bill currently before the National Assembly, Nigerians and business owners may be in for payment of additional taxes if the proposal sails through.\n\nThis is one of the major highlights of the bill which President Muhammadu Buhari transmitted in a letter to the National Assembly December 7.\n\nAmong others, President Buhari, in the letter, said the Finance Bill would guide the implementation of the yet-to-be passed 2022 Appropriation Act.\n\nBesides, he said the bill also seeks to support the implementation of the 2022 Federal Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability by proposing key reforms to specific taxation, customs, excise, fiscal and other relevant laws among others.\n\nMinister explains\n\nSpeaking at a stakeholders\u2019 meeting organised by the House of Representatives Committee on Finance Monday in Abuja, Minister of Finance, Budget and national Planning Hajiya Zainab Ahmed said there might be an introduction of new tariffs and levies in 2022 \u201cas the economy was now on a recovery path.\u201d\n\nThe minister stressed the need for Nigeria to diversify its revenues from oil to fund critical expenditures, adding that Federal Government\u2019s retained revenue was N4.56 trillion (75 percent of budget) as at September 2021; Federal share of oil revenues \u2013 N845 billion (56.3 percent pro-rated performance); N1.31 trillion (117.3 percent above budget) as the federal share of non-oil revenues; N616 billion and N274.4 billion (121 percent and 153 percent of pro-rata targets) of Companies Income Tax (CIT) and Value Added Tax (VAT) and N418 billion Customs collections for the period under review.\n\n\n\nThe minister said a couple of \u201creforms and amendments\u201d were recommended in the draft 2021 Finance amendment bill, hinting that more would be added mid 2022.\n\n\u201cModest changes had been proposed but that more fiscal reforms were still in view as the ministry could not take all the proposals collected from stakeholders.\n\n\u201dOur aspiration is to do a midterm review with a possibility of another Finance Bill in mid-year 2022 to bring in more amendments,\u201d she said.\n\nMrs Ahmed further said there were ongoing Stamp Duties and VAT-related cases in court against the federal government, hence the reason keep off the areas.\n\nThe minister was hopeful that by mid-2022, the legal tussles may have been resolved after which the reforms in those areas could be proposed for parliament to consider.\n\nShe also hinted on the possibility of revisiting the antiquated Stamp Duties and Capital Gains Tax for holistic reform by the parliament.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cWe prepared this draft bill along five reform areas, the first domestic revenue mobilisation, the second is tax administration and legislative drafting, third is International taxation, fourth is financial sector reforms and tax equity and fifth is improving public financial management reform.\n\n\u201cThe provision in the draft bill is proposing to amend the Capital Gains Tax Act, Company Income Tax, FIRS Establishment Act, Personal Income Tax, Stamp Duties Act and Tertiary Education Act, Value Added Tax, Insurance Police Trust Fund and the Fiscal Responsibility Act.\n\n\u201cThis is to amend the Police Trust Fund Act and the Nigerian Trust Fund Acts, the purpose is to empower the FIRS to collect the Nigerian trust fund levies on companies on behalf of the fund itself.\n\n\u201cCurrently, because there is no such provision, the FIRS is unable to start collecting on behalf of the fund. Also, it is to streamline the tax and the levy collection from the Nigerian companies in line with Mr President\u2019s administration ease of doing business policy.\u201d\n\nThe bill also sought a five-year jail term and, or a five million naira fine against any official of tax collecting agencies convicted of failing to remit gross taxes, levies, and other revenues, especially where such is received into accounts not approved by the National Assembly.\n\n\n\nOther highlights of the bill include but not exhaustive, five percent capital gains tax imposed on shares\u2019 disposal transactions where gains exceed N500 million in 12 calendar months; inclusion of gaming, lottery and gambling companies within corporate tax net; imposition of taxes on oil & gas companies\u2019 dividends as well as midstream & downstream oil and gas companies.\n\nGbajabiamila\n\nIn his remarks, Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila told the gathering that the Bill \u201cseeks to introduce strategic and broadminded, positive reforms that will engender best practices and guarantee interest of the investing public and businesses.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila said: \u201cIt is instructive to state that the essence of the 2021 bill is to further reposition our finance system to plug wastes, close openings for corruption, create opportunities for employment as well as stimulate stability and growth in our productive sectors, within the wider context of our quest for economic recovery in our country.\n\n\u201cGiven the democratic credentials of the House of Representatives under my watch as well as the need to further deepen the credibility of the process through wider participation of stakeholders, this stakeholders meeting has been designed to give Nigerians and critical stakeholders in the industry the ample opportunity to own and drive the process.\n\n\u201cIn this hall, we have very proficient professionals and experts, who as stakeholders, investors, development partners and interest groups have submitted memoranda and are ready to make contributions to the bill.\n\n\u201cIt is on this backdrop that I charge this stakeholders meeting to extensively scrutinize the templates in the bill in the general interest.\n\n\u201cWe must strengthen the institution to strategically check reckless borrowings by ensuring accountability in the use of borrowed funds and ensuring that the borrowings shall be on concessional terms or at relatively low interest rates and subject to the rigorous of legislation.\u2019\u2019\n\nEarlier, Chairman of the committee, Hon. James Faleke (APC-Lagos state) said the major thrust of the bill was to shore up the nation\u2019s economy and ensure proper implementation of the 2022 Budget.\n\nThe lawmaker assured every stakeholder would be afforded the opportunity of making inputs into the legislative proposal being passed into law.\n\nSanwo-Olu\n\nAlso on tax matter, Lagos state Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has called on members of the Joint Tax Board (JTB), the apex body for all tax authorities in Nigeria, to expand its focus beyond Personal Income Tax to other tax areas.\n\nSpeaking at the opening ceremony of the 149th meeting of the JTB held at Eko Hotels and Suites, Victoria Island, Sanwo-Olu said members of the JTB should look towards harmonising the interpretations of the various tax laws to achieve true federalism.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu, who was represented by Commissioner for Finance Dr. Rabiu Olowo, also stressed the need for the yearly enactment of the Finance Act to align it with the current economic realities.\n\nHe said: \u201cI implore the Joint Tax Board (JTB) to expand its focus beyond Personal Income Tax, to other tax types. While I acknowledge that some of the extant legal or constitutional provisions are not within the purview of the JTB to review or amend, let me say that it is very crucial that your (JTB) unwavering voice is heard in championing the process for change.\n\n\u201cYou are one of the most important stakeholders on this journey towards a truly fair, equitable and efficient national revenue collection system.\n\n\u201cAs part of this retreat, therefore, I urge you to deliberate and come up with practical solutions on critical revenue issues and fiscal federalism, especially as they relate to Stamp Duties, the regulation of lotteries, Federal/State tax jurisdiction, and the matter of Value Added Tax, which I am aware, is currently subjudice.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne step in the right direction for the country, which must be highlighted, is the yearly enactment of the Finance Act. It is aimed at reviewing and updating all existing financial/fiscal legislations of the Federal Government and aligning them with current economic realities and global best practices\u201d, the governor further added.",

          "title": "Air Force Discharges 27 for Refusal to Get Covid Vaccine",
          "text": "The Air Force has discharged 27 people for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine, making them what officials believe are the first service members to be removed for disobeying the mandate to get the shots.\n\nThe Air Force gave its forces until Nov. 2 to get the vaccine, and thousands have either refused or sought an exemption. Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said Monday that these are the first airmen to be administratively discharged for reasons involving the vaccine.\n\nShe said all of them were in their first term of enlistment, so they were younger, lower-ranking personnel. And while the Air Force does not disclose what type of discharge a service member gets, legislation working its way through Congress limits the military to giving troops in vaccine refusal cases an honorable discharge or general discharge under honorable conditions.\n\nThe Pentagon earlier this year required the vaccine for all members of the military, including active duty, National Guard and the Reserves. Each of the services set its own deadlines and procedures for the mandate, and the Air Force set the earliest deadline. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said the vaccine is critical to maintaining the health of the force and its ability to respond to an national security crisis.\n\nNone of the 27 airmen sought a medical, administrative or religious exemption, Stefanek said. Several officials from the other services said they believe that so far only the Air Force has gotten this far along in the process and discharged people over the vaccine refusal.\n\nAs a result, they were formally removed from service for failure to obey an order. Stefanek said it is also possible that some had other infractions on their records, but all had the vaccine refusal as one of the elements of their discharge.\n\nIt is not unusual for members of the military to be thrown out of the service for disobeying an order; discipline is a key tenet of the armed services. As a comparison, Stefanek said that in the first three quarters of 2021, about 1,800 airmen were discharged for failure to follow orders.\n\nAccording to the latest Air Force data, more than 1,000 airmen have refused the shot and more than 4,700 are seeking a religious exemption. As of last week, a bit more than 97% of the active duty Air Force had gotten at least one shot.\n\nMembers of the Navy and the Marine Corps had until Nov. 28 to get the shots and their Reserve members have until Dec. 28. Army active duty soldiers have until Wednesday, and members of the Army National Guard and the Reserves have the most time to be vaccinated, with a deadline of next June 30.\n\nAcross the military, the vaccine reaction has mirrored that of society as a whole, with thousands seeking exemptions or refusing the shots. But overall the percentage of troops \u2014 particularly active duty members \u2014 who quickly got the shots exceeds the nationwide numbers.\n\nAs of Dec. 10, the Pentagon said that 96.4% of active duty personnel have gotten at least one shot. The number plummets to about 74%, however, when the Guard and Reserve are included. According to the Centers for Disease Control, about 72% of the U.S. population 18 and older have gotten at least one shot.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin has made it clear that the Guard and Reserve are also subject to the mandate, and has warned that those who fail to comply risk their continuing as members of the military. But that has proven to be contentious.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s Republican governor and the state attorney general have already filed a federal lawsuit challenging the military mandate for the state\u2019s Guard. Gov. Kevin Stitt \u2014 the first state leader to publicly challenge the mandate \u2014 is arguing that Austin is overstepping his constitutional authority.\n\nStitt had asked Austin to suspend the mandate for the Oklahoma National Guard and directed his new adjutant general to assure members that they would not be punished for not being vaccinated.\n\nAustin rejected the request and said unvaccinated Guard members would be barred from federally funded drills and training required to maintain their Guard status.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s adjutant general, Brig. Gen. Thomas Mancino, posted a letter on the state Guard\u2019s website, however, warning his troops that those who refuse the vaccine could end their military careers.\n\n\u201cAnyone \u2026 deciding not to take the vaccine, must realize that the potential for career ending federal action, barring a favorable court ruling, legislative intervention, or a change in policy is present,\u201d Mancino wrote.",

          "title": "Nigerian Governors Working to Scuttle Electoral Reform, Lobby Buhari Not to Sign Electoral Bill",
          "text": "After crippling the local government system across the country, a situation believed to have laid the foundation for the current widespread insecurity, some governors have continued to do all within their reach to prevent President Muhammadu Buhari from signing into law, the Electoral Amendment Bill, adjudged to be in the best interest of the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nThe main reason the governors have been putting pressure on President Buhari not to sign the bill into law, as the December 19 deadline for the president\u2019s assent draws near, is because it would whittle down their powers as \u2018godfathers\u2019 in their respective states as well as break their selfish control and financial manipulation of the local government system, THISDAY can reliably report.\n\nThis, nonetheless, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has warned that a prolonged delay in assenting to the new Electoral Bill might hinder preparations and smooth conduct of upcoming elections, including the governorship elections in Ekiti and Osun States, scheduled for June and July, 2022.\n\nINEC has further expressed concerns over the proposed area election for the Federal Capital Territory in February next year, which it claimed could be affected too if the issues around the bill were not resolved and signed quickly.\n\nINEC\u2019s worry, however, came at the same time that the Convener of the Civil Society Situation Room, Mrs. Ene Obi and the Executive Director of the Policy and Legislative Advocacy Centre (PLAC), Mr. Clement Nwankwo made a case for the president to urgently sign the Electoral Bill into law.\n\nSimilarly, the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) on Monday, said proposals in the Electoral Bill 2021 would improve Nigeria\u2019s elections and the political party\u2019s candidate selection process and therefore urged President Muhammadu Buhari to sign it.\n\nUnfortunately, since the two chambers of the National Assembly harmonised their positions on the mode of election to be adopted for primary election and forwarded same to President Buhari for his assent, some governors had been uncomfortable and had been visiting the president to convince him on why the idea was not ideal not, especially, given its cost implications.\n\nAlthough the INEC too had once posited that direct primary was a far more expensive mode of primary election, however, noted quickly that it was not any of its business but that of the political parties to address, adding also that if the parties had been funding indirect primaries, then, it is their business to find a way to fund indirect primaries.\n\nInterestingly, last week, there were speculations that the president, after a lot of pressure, had rejected the amended electoral act bill as forwarded to him by the lawmakers, forcing the presidency and the legislature to issue rebuttals on the reports, saying, \u201cWe are not aware\u201d.\n\nYet, the governors were said not to have relented from stalking the president on why he should not sign the bill, even when this was believed to be stalling the INEC from preparing for other off-season elections, starting from January, when Ekiti State governorship primary election has been slated to hold and February, when the FCT area poll was billed to hold.\n\nAccording to THISDAY findings, \u201cThe 36 governors want to ensure that they continue to collect local government allocations, which they mismanage. And as we all know most of them are always in Abuja every month, they wait, collect fund from the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) and they disappear.\n\n\u201cTheir over 20 years of disinvestment in the local government system is what has led to the rise in insecurity, banditry, kidnapping and increase in social vices across the country.\n\n\u201cNow, these governors are moving to scuttle the electoral process for their own selfish gains. They control their election, they control the local government election, now they want to control the National Assembly and that of the president as well and they are putting pressure on Buhari not to sign and if Buhari does not sign the bill into law, it would have dire consequences for electoral reform,\u201d the source, who wanted to remain anonymous, claimed.\n\nHowever, corroborating THISDAY\u2019s findings, National President, Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), Ambali Olatunji, recently alleged that the illegality perpetrated by governors was responsible for the destruction of the local government system in the country.\n\nAmbali argued that the root of insecurity as well as socio-economic challenges bedeviling the country was traceable to the mismanagement of the local government system by state governors.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAs at today, you can no longer move from one state to another without initially asking if you will get home safely. Insecurity in the south, east, west and north. This is not the Nigeria of our dream. We are bedeviled by abject poverty, joblessness, hopelessness, threat to the nationhood.\n\n\u201cEverybody now resorts to ethnic agitation. We have come this far, because Nigeria is no longer working. The nation has failed the masses. At 61, Nigeria has abandoned her constitutional role in guaranteeing security and peace in the country.\n\n\u201cThis can be traced to the systematic decay and destruction at the local government level. Local government system is the most strategic, most relevant, most popular and most acceptable tier of government in the country.\u201d\n\nHe also called for direct funding of the local governments, saying allowing state governments to be in charge of local government fund was synonymous to giving same food to a lion and a dog and you ask them to go and share them.\n\nAlso, an expert in Electoral Law and Justice, Dr. Akin Oluwadayisi and member of the Center for Socio-Legal Studies (CSLS), at the weekend, urged Buhari to sign the bill into law before the deadline expires.\n\nAccording to him, Section 14(2) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) declares that sovereignty belongs to the people of Nigeria from whom government itself derives all its powers and authority, adding that it would be through direct participation in political parties\u2019 primaries which the proposed legislation promotes, that the participation by the people in their governments shall be ensured.\n\n\u201cIndirect primaries deny them this right of grassroot participation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe law expert noted that political parties over the years had failed to allow direct election of delegates, when primaries are conducted, and argued that if INEC was given the powers to supervise the process, it would not only ensure credibility but also build confidence of the people in the future general elections that would be conducted.\n\n\u201cThe governors in Nigeria have been tested with the required true democratic involvement of local governments but failed through selfish interest, dominating control and financial manipulation of the local government authority,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, allowing indirect primaries into the legislative bodies was to further empower the governors to play the role of gods in determining the future of Nigeria\u2019s democracy, good governance and sacrifice direct participation of the electorate\u2019 desires.\n\nOluwadayisi, therefore, stressed that the bill would benefit the political parties, especially, the ruling party more in that when the party members were given the freedom to choose active and responsive legislators, their performances and delivery would go a long way to promote the party\u2019s image and collective interest of the people, who have chosen them.\n\nOn the dangers of delaying the bill, INEC\u2019s National Commissioner in charge of Voter Education and Publicity, Mr. Festus Okoye, while speaking as one of the panelists at a Situation Room Stakeholders Forum in Abuja, said the Commission would find it difficult to adjust its plans if the Electoral Bill was suddenly signed midway to the series of off-season elections scheduled within the first half of 2022.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe as the electoral management body need to be prepared early enough. As a today, we have a number of elections that we are going to conduct. We have the the FCT Area council elections that we are going to conduct in February and then we have the Osun and Ekiti governorship elections that are going to take place in June and July.\n\n\u201cSo we need to have a hold-on-to new electoral legal framework so we can begin to prepare, do procurement and also begin to design our guidelines and regulations before we get close to the 2023 general election,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the implications of a new Electoral Act would be that INEC would have to draw new guidelines and regulations in readiness for the 2023 general election in the country.\n\nAccording to him, INEC would reach conclusions on how to carry out monitoring of party primaries and the cost implications after the political parties would have decided on nature of primaries and submitted same to the commission.\n\nHe added that one of the landmark issues as far as the amended Act was concerned, was the deepening of the democratic process through the introduction of technology in the electoral process, adding that with a new electoral legal framework coming into effect, political parties would adjust their guidelines and processes to align with the law.\n\n\u201cIf the new electoral legal framework comes to force, political parties are going to conduct their primaries early in 2022 and presupposes that they will also have a guideline for the conduct of party primaries,\u201d he said.\n\nIn her remarks, Obi said though it might not be possible to have a perfect law for the nation\u2019s elections, but the new electoral legal framework was definitely something that could move the country forward in the right direction.\n\nAlso, Nwankwo said Buhari would be doing colossal damage to whatever legacy he might leave behind if he failed to heed the yearnings of Nigerians and sign the Electoral Bill into law.\n\n\u201cWe know that the President has spoken to everyone that he needed to and consulted with everyone that he wants to consult with, so if he doesn\u2019t sign the Bill, it is his decision and not that of anyone else,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother panelist and gender rights campaigner, Mrs. Ebere Ifendu, said women were excited about the newly amended Electoral Act, because some of innovative ideas brought in to further the cause of women participation in governance in Nigeria.\n\nIfendu, however, flayed the recently concluded national convention of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which she alleged failed to uphold the party\u2019s constitution that provided 35 per cent affirmative action for women inclusion in party offices.\n\nThe CDD Director, Idayat Hassan, in a statement in Abuja, also called on President Buhari to sign into law the Electoral Bill 2021, saying this was necessary to represent the most significant legacy of his presidency.\n\n\u201cWith the successful integration of technology into the electoral process, a legal backing for electronic voting and transmission of election results will further President Buhari\u2019s commitment to improving Nigeria\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cThis will surely be President Buhari\u2019s legacy for Nigerian people. CDD believes that the next critical step that must be taken is for the assenting into law, the Electoral Bill 2021. This is particularly as we head to two off-cycle elections in Ekiti and Osun States in 2022 and the 2023 general election,\u201d she said.\n\nHassan, who noted that the Senate had, on October 13, re-amended certain aspects of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill contained in Clauses 43, 52, 63, and 87, respectively, said, \u201cInterestingly, the legislative document represents another beautiful outcome from the collaborative efforts of the Senate and House of Representatives,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to her, with the direct primary election, every registered member of the parties will directly determine their candidates, adding that the CDD believed this would reduce the floodgates of litigation that usually trailed the idea of consensus or imposition of candidates by political godfathers and party owners.\n\nMeanwhile, the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) by INEC, has entered its 10th week in the second quarter, recording 4,681,206 as fresh registration while Completed Online and Physical Registration stood at 2,228,993.\n\nINEC in a weekly update, announced that the new update was as at 7:00 am yesterday December 13, 2021.\n\nA breakdown of the type of registration that made up the completed online and physical registrations of 2,228,993 showed that 922,188 were Online, while 1,306,805 were Physical.\n\nThe update also revealed that Male (Completed Registration) was 1,124,294 while Female (Completed Registration) was 1,104,699.\n\nFor Persons Living With Disability (Completed Registration) was 21,910 and for the Youth (18- 34 years) it stood at 1,586,018.\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos, Chuks Okocha and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government on Monday earned a total of $547.2 million as MTN Nigeria and Mafab Communications Ltd emerged winners of the keenly contested 3.5 GHz spectrum auction for 5G deployment in the country by paying $273.6 million each.\n\nIn addition, MTN had paid $15,900,000 to get lot one of the spectrum, while Mafab paid additional $11, 120, 000 million to get lot two.\n\nThree eligible bidders participated in the mock auction exercise which held last Friday, before the main auction that took place yesterday at Abuja.\n\nThe three eligible bidders that participated at the mock and main auctions, were MTN Nigeria, Mafab Communications and Airtel Networks Limited.\n\nThe bidding which was keenly contested commenced at 11 am and closed at exactly 7.22pm.\n\nAll three bidders reached the 11th round of the bidding process, before Airtel Networks withdrew after the eleventh round at $270 million.\n\nAnnouncing the main auction result, Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, said the provisional licence would be given to Mafab Communications Limited and MTN Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Danbatta, the two winners entered into another stage of auction called the Assignment Stage to determine which operator takes a particular lot of the two lots that were auctioned.\n\nDanbatta said the winners would pay fully for the licence by February 24, 2022, and must be paid in naira.\n\nWhile MTN was represented by its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Karl Toriola; Airtel Networks was represented by its Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Sreeddhar Krishna Menon, and Mafab Communications Limited was represented by its Chairman, Alhaji Musibau Bashir.\n\nEach of the bidders had initially paid N7. 5 billion to qualify for the bidding, which was a 10 per cent non-refundable deposit of the N750 bilion ($197.4 million).\n\nThe three bidders were in contest for two slots of 100MHz each in the 3.5GHz spectrum licence, and each bidder contested for one lot.\n\nBefore the process commenced, the Auction Manager, who is the Director of Spectrum Administration at NCC, Oluwatoyin Asaju, assigned each of the three bidders their bidding rooms and accredited one representative from each of the bidding operators as monitoring agent.\n\nWhile MTN was assigned bidding room two and monitoring room three; Airtel was assigned bidding room three and monitoring room one and Mafab Communications Limited was assigned to bidding room one and monitoring room two.\n\nFor transparency, the bidding process was transmitted real time to two broad screens located at a general location inside Transcorp Hotel, where observers, including journalists, were seated.\n\nAccording to Asaju, the first round of bidding was mandatory for all the three bidders and each bidder was at liberty to exit bidding at any of the bidding rounds.\n\nAlthough NCC had placed the reserve bidding price for the 3.5 GHz Spectrum at $197.4 million, the Auction Manager however commenced round one bidding process at a reserve price of $199,374,000 million and all three contenders agreed with the new reserve price.\n\nAt the end of round one, the Auction Manager increased the reserve price to $201,367,740 million for the commencement of round two. At the end of round two, the Auction Manager, again, increased the bid price to $204, 288,256.1 million for the commencement of round three.\n\nAt the end of round three, the bid price for one lot of the 3.5GHz Spectrum was increased to $215,782,901.38 at the beginning of round five.\n\nRound six of the auction began with $224, 414,217.43 bid price per lot, and all the three eligible bidders were still in competition.\n\nFrom round seven, the bidding time was reduced to from 20 minutes to 10 minutes. The round seven commenced with $231,146,643.96 bid price per lot, while round eight commenced with $240,392,509.71 million bid price per lot, with all the three eligible bidders still in in the competition.\n\nRound nine commenced with all three eligible bidders with a bid price of $251,210,172.65 million.\n\nRound 10 commenced with all three bidders with a bid price of $263,017,050.77 million, while round eleven also commenced with all three bidders with a bid price of $275,904,886.25 million. The main stage auction eventually ended at about 7.22pm with round eleven, with a winning bid price of $273,600,000 million.\n\nThe Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, who declared the auction open, said the Federal Executive Council (FEC) had on September 8, 2021, approved a National 5G policy for Nigerian Digital Economy. He said the national policy contained all the necessary information guiding the processes and procedures for the development of 5G in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Pantami, \u201cThe National Policy noted the key role of the National Frequency Management Council in the allocation of spectrum for the deployment of 5G networks in Nigeria. The NFMC is also to ensure that the required spectrum for 5G standard is made available in the most appropriate and timely manner to enable investments, innovation, and competition in the deployment of 5G services for the benefit of consumers and businesses.\u201d\n\nPantami added that the main spectrum auction followed the successful mock spectrum auctioning process, which held on December 10.\n\nDanbatta, in his opening speech, said the NCC would continue to deepen broadband penetration, protect the consumers and the smart deployment of infrastructure across the country.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to strategically play our unique role in driving the digital economy to support the government\u2019s economic diversification agenda. Consequently, we ensured the implementation of policies tor effective communications resource management, strategic collaboration and partnership, facilitating broadband penetration and improvement of Quality of Service (QoS)/Quality of Experience,\u201d Danbatta said.\n\nAccording to Danbatta,\u201d The 3.5GHz spectrum auction represents a culmination of all the efforts at the international and national levels that have prepared Nigeria tor this momentous leap toward. Therefore, in line with the 5G Deployment Policy and global best practices, the Commission has set in motion the process for the auction and will be offering two lots in the 3.5GHz band with three companies competing to acquire a licence for the available lots.\n\n\u201cThe auction is based on the powers bestowed on the commission by Section 121 of the Nigerian Communications Act 2003 as well as the Licensing Regulations 2019.\u201d\n\nEmma Okonji",

          "text": "Nigeria has regained its top position among crude oil producing countries in Africa with crude oil production averaging 1.27 million barrels per day in November, according to the latest monthly report from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nThe latest OPEC report indicated that Nigeria pumped an additional 47,000 barrels per day; compared to the 1.228 mb/d produced averagely in the month of October 2021.\n\nLast month, Nigeria lost its top oil producer status in Africa to the North African country, as its crude oil production continued to fall mainly due to ageing upstream infrastructure.\n\nIn same month, Nigeria\u2019s oil output fell to about 1.23 million barrels per day from about 1.25 million bpd the previous month, with Libya, which overtook Angola as the second-biggest producer on the continent in December last year, seeing its oil production rise to 1.24 million bpd.\n\nAccording to the latest OPEC report, whereas Nigeria\u2019s figure rose, Libya, which clinched the top spot in Africa in October with 1.24 mb/d declined to 1.211 mb/d in November.\n\n\u201cAccording to secondary sources, total OPEC-13 crude oil production averaged 27.72 mb/d in November 2021, higher by 0.29 mb/d month-on-month. Crude oil output increased mainly in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Nigeria, while production in Angola, Libya and Congo declined,\u201d the report stated.\n\nBut despite the rise, several countries, such as Angola and Nigeria, pumped well below their quotas, increasingly concentrating the group\u2019s spare production capacity in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait.\n\nThis was expected to create a supply squeeze towards the latter half of 2022, if demand returns to or surpasses pre-pandemic levels, as expected.\n\nIn addition, OPEC stated that the near term outlook of Nigeria economy was hindered by the elevated inflationary and labour market pressures, but noted that the improvement in oil prices still supported the economic recovery.\n\nMeanwhile, OPEC has sharply raised its forecast for oil demand in the first quarter, narrowing a projected oversupply, as it expects the omicron variant to have a transitory impact on the global economy.\n\nThe oil cartel said it now sees the world consuming 99.13 million bpd of oil in the first three months of 2022, an increase of 1.1 million bpd from its forecast last month, when pessimism about the spread of omicron.\n\nOPEC and its Russia-led allies decided at their December 2 meeting to stay the course with a 400,000 bpd production quota increase for January. Of that amount, about 253,000 bpd is allocated to OPEC\u2019s 13 members.\n\n\u201cImproved COVID-19 management and rising vaccination rates (will enable) economic activity and mobility to return to pre-pandemic levels, supporting transportation fuels in particular. Meanwhile, as vaccination rates increase, the impact of the omicron variant is projected to be mild and short-lived,\u201d it said.\n\nFor the full-year 2022, OPEC forecast global demand will average 100.79 million bpd, while 2021 demand will come in at 99.63 million bpd.\n\nBoth figures are about 200,000 bpd higher than in last month\u2019s report, with the bulk of the upward revisions coming in Asia, leaving the year-on-year growth rate unchanged.\n\nBut the figures still suggested a surplus for early 2022, though smaller than before, with the call on OPEC crude pegged at 27.89 million bpd for the first quarter, rising to 28.31 million bpd in the second, 29.54 million bpd in the third and 29.58 million bpd in the fourth.\n\nThe report further kept its forecast for non-OPEC liquids supply growth this year largely unchanged at around 680,000 bpd, for an average 63.65mn bod, and still sees this growing by 3mn b/d next year.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
