          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Israel Adesanya has retained his Ultimate Fighting Championship middleweight belt after defeating Italian contender, Marvin Vettori, at the Gila River Arena in Arizona on Sunday.\n\nHe won via a unanimous decision \u2013 50-45, 50-45, 50-45.\n\nThe win is Adesanya\u2019s third title defence after losing to Jan Blachowicz in a bid to add the light heavyweight title to his laurels.\n\nAdesanya showed improvements on his groundwork as he expertly untangled himself from all of Vettori\u2019s takedowns.\n\nRenowned as one of the best strikers in the division, the 31-year-old landed several leg shots and jabs as he dimmed Vettori\u2019s dream of becoming the first Italian UFC champion.\n\nIt is the second time both fighters faced themselves in the UFC with Adesanya running out victorious via split decision in their first meeting in April 2018, which was the Nigerian\u2019s second outing in the UFC franchise.\n\nBoth fighters have had heated conversations on social media and during press conferences but Adesanya had said he was ready to defend his title and rule the middleweight division after failing to secure the light heavyweight title from Poland\u2019s Jan Blachowicz last March.\n\nHe earlier promised to send the Italian to the floor in the second round but the fight ended at Round five.\n\nVettori attempted to make history early Sunday morning as he looks to dethrone Nigerian Israel Adesanya to become Italy\u2019s first UFC titleholder.\n\nVettori, ranked third in the division, has won five straight bouts leading into this championship tussle.\n\nVettori is unofficially nicknamed \u201cAngry Marvin\u201d appropriately as he brings an aggressive, bar-room-brawling stand-up style to his fights. His footwork and movement are choppy, forcing him to rely on his power and belligerent forward pressure as opposed to any fluidity of movement or defensive evasiveness.\n\nAdesanya entered the fight off a March loss to Blachowicz in a battle for Blachowicz\u2019s light heavyweight title.\n\nDetails later\u2026",

          "title": "APC/Buhari @ 6: Requiem for democracy",
          "text": "By Idowu Akinlotan\n\nLate last month, the All Progressives Congress (APC) marked six chequered years in office without fanfare. Three months earlier, the party also marked eight years in existence as a political party. Fittingly, no celebration was attempted on both occasions. The suspicion is that both anniversaries would have been celebrated had the party felt confident about its achievements. Instead, it retreated into its shell and brought a rabbit out of the hat in President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s bombshell television interview and Democracy Day address. The party was barely two years old when it took office in 2015, an unprecedented feat for a political toddler. And in the face of steep opposition, it also won re-election four years later. These are milestones deserving of celebration for an eight-year-old party.\n\nSadly, the precociousness that brought the party into office and the political genius and chutzpah that saw it aspiring to national leadership at two years of age and winning presidential election and re-election with such daring and adeptness have been woefully inadequate in helping it to responsibly manage the enormous power at its disposal. Every challenge it faced \u2013 from insurgency to banditry and kidnapping, and from economic crisis to EndSARS protest, not to talk of the Southeast and Southwest self-determination/secession conundrums \u2013 has been met with incompetence, clumsiness, ideological vacuity and dismal lack of foresight and surefootedness on its part.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe party is supposed to be the most ideological in Nigeria, if not in Africa, going by its claims and posturing. But it has ended up as an organization destitute of ideology. Its only claim to principles has been its sometimes practical but nevertheless ad hoc approach to governance. If it makes sense, regardless of lacking consistency with its manifesto, it will promote it. Beyond that, the party has simply trudged along, groping its way into an uncertain future, hesitant about what kind of legacy it should envision for itself or bequeath the country. The public naturally presumed ideological purity for the party, believing without evidence that the party\u2019s extravagant claims had indemnified them against being duped. They also hoped that the party\u2019s ambitions would be escalated into grander ambitions for the country. Instead, the party has collapsed into internecine conflicts and disseminated barbarous antagonisms across the country, corrupting and weakening every sinew, and poisoning the lifeblood and muscles that sustain the nation.\n\nA celebration would have enabled the APC to renew their contract with the electorate, sell their ideas of how to recreate the country from the ashes of despair and discontent, and instill hope in a greater and inspiring tomorrow. But if the party could not celebrate because it is also facing its own despairing identity crisis and brutal internal struggle for control of both the levers of the party and its soul, then perhaps the president would want to roll out the drums as a modest celebration of his own success in personifying the resilience of a country that stands strong in the face of daunting crises.\n\nHowever, as the president\u2019s Arise Television interview showed last Thursday, his grasp of the existential crises facing the nation remains rudimentary, his snide remarks about who dictates what to the party inflict wounds on loyal party hierarchs, and his panaceas for reclaiming the country from mediocrity remain exasperatingly simplistic. Every leader needs a deep mind that can call to deep, a mind labyrinthine in its reach and network, a mind capable of grasping the complexities of national challenges as well as proffering answers and solutions that are no less complex and visionary than the problems are entangled. That kind of mind is, however, lacking.\n\nFrom all indications, there are no guarantees that the APC would glide into the future stronger than it has shown the capacity to do, despite the president\u2019s exultation last Thursday over the so-called rebuilding of the party, a rebuilding that now appears to be emptying the party of its soul, weakening its hope, and damaging its resolve. In fact the danger for him, much more than his party, is that he may end up being reviled in the Southeast \u2013 but he probably does not care \u2013 dismissed and derided in the Southwest, disapproved in much of the Middle Belt, received with mixed feelings in the Northeast, and ignored in the Northwest. Both the president and his party have just two brutally short years to repair the damage to their image and persons. Whether they will make amends is not quite as clear as whether they can.\n\nThe president\u2019s interviews and Democracy Day address sum up the entire body of his life\u2019s work and person. That summation is not flattering. Contrary to what many people think, not only is it clear that the president is in far greater control of the policies and character of his government, he is also enthusiastic about them, and has openly shown he personifies them, despite his illness and seeming detachment. He speaks of democracy when everything he does wars against it, including his inability to read and appreciate the import of the EndSARS protests. On Friday, he belatedly decided to jaw-jaw with leaders of the Southeast, though he had spent the better part of his years in office undermining the influence and authority of APC leaders in various zones, including the Southwest, and even threatening them. Above all, he has boasted more attachment to Niger Republic and defended the extraordinary commitment of Nigerian resources to that country on the lamentable excuse of familial connections and unsubstantiated business advantages. And he has subscribed to and sanctioned an unconstitutional and unlawful return to grazing routes and reserves though the policies were never enacted nationally even in the First Republic that he extols as a paragon of law and order.\n\nFor some 16 years, the Peoples Democratic Party trifled with democratic principles and acted as if party leaders were both immutable and infallible. But despite their frivolity, they never substantially threatened democracy. On the contrary, partly because hawks and non-democrats accompanied the Buhari administration into office, it has taken only a few years for the administration and the APC to demolish democracy\u2019s building blocks, enthrone regional and ethnic exceptionalism as the guiding principle of state, and displayed inestimable contempt for democrats, other ethnic groups, religions and civil society. In addition to their brinkmanship, they would have declared martial law in order to have a better grip of statecraft had they been sure they would not either come to grief or unite the opposition against themselves. The president said he hoped the APC would go on and on beyond 2023, and he believed that he and the party had done enough to elicit and sustain popular confidence. If only wishes were horses. Having turned Nigeria into a regimented people forced to goosestep behind him, having shortsightedly engrossed the Fulani worldview while displaying cavalier attitude to other nationalities, and having submerged Nigerians in debt to, in his argument, remedy the nation\u2019s infrastructural deficit, it remains to be seen whether the people would place premium on their stomachs or on their freedoms, especially as neither goal is being placated by the president\u2019s purposeless leap into the democratic and economic void which he has created and nurtured.\n\nEx-presidents rally for unity\n\nWorried by the seeming lethargy of the Buhari administration in addressing Nigeria\u2019s worsening insecurity, the Committee for the Goodness of Nigeria (CGN) comprising the Interfaith Initiative for Peace led by Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, and His Eminence, John Cardinal Onaiyekan; the Socio-cultural Consultative Committee led by ex-president Olusegun Obasanjo; and the National Peace Committee led by former military head of state, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, met in Abuja on Thursday for hours. No communiqu\u00e9 was issued; but it was reported that they had sought audience with President Buhari. It is not certain whether they should bother, for the president\u2019s mind is already made up on a number of critical national issues that unfortunately promote insecurity and instability.\n\nThe coalition must, however, not be discouraged from trying. They see the disaster looming in the horizon, which the Buhari administration, because of its nefarious motives, does not see. The president and his administration, including the hawkish advisers who cajole him to be inflexible and to eschew dialogue, will not yield an inch in mitigating the factors promoting insecurity in Nigeria, including the controversial grazing routes and reserves that hark back to the last century, and the restiveness in the Southeast which the administration is exacerbating by its insensitive, provocative and incendiary statements.\n\nBut the country must also remind Chief Obasanjo and Gen Abubakar that they were also partly responsible for the disaster overtaking the country. When Gen Abubakar foisted a secretly written constitution on the country, a constitution that brazenly lied to the public and to itself, what did he expect? When Chief Obasanjo cruelly undermined the then ruling party and manipulated his successors into office against the will of the people, why would he expect peace and progress? Having laid the foundation for disaster and thwarted the will of the people, it was natural that one day a monstrous government would take office and perpetrate atrocities. Now the former leaders are trying to quench the raging inferno with a spoonful of water. Tough luck.\n\nAt last, a presidential interview\n\nThose who clamoured for President Muhammadu Buhari to address the nation on the wave of insecurity drowning the country are probably disillusioned by now. This column had warned that as foreboding as his silence was, it would be better for everyone should the president resist the temptation to speak. From experience, his silence was often more golden than his speeches. But should he surrender to the clamour, this writer painfully concluded, he would probably exacerbate the problem and cause more frustrations. Alas, the president gave in on Thursday by agreeing to be interviewed on Arise Television on wide-ranging issues affecting the country. Now that the people finally had their way, and have heard what he had to say, they would be left deeply mortified that the president again lost the opportunity to endear himself to the world and show himself a statesman.\n\nThe engaging simplicity of his answers seems to portray the president as reluctant to cause anyone grief. However, the answers do not hide the painful fact of his incapacity in addressing the country\u2019s complex challenges with any degree of depth or altruism. The Arise TV anchors asked the right questions, even though follow-up questions seemed curiously stifled. The anchors were as aggressive in their questions to the extent politeness and respect for the president would allow, and they were generally eloquent and dispassionate. If questions alone could produce an enjoyable interview, the Arise TV anchors did enough to arrest the attention of the stupefied audience, most of whom did not know that an interview was in the offing.\n\nNigerians got the interview they craved; but the injury inflicted by the ancient disposition of the president, not to talk of his misconstruction of the questions, the evident lack of substance and depth in his answers, and the revelatory parochialism that many feared has greatly compromised his presidency manifested in vivid and gruesome colours on Thursday. If this interview does not cure the appetite of Nigerians for more presidential interviews, then they must be gluttons for punishment. There was hardly a question the Arise TV panel asked that was not appropriate; but there was no presidential answer that rose to the level of sublimity the public half expected. Since he assumed office, perhaps the president condescended to only three or four television interviews; for the sake of peace and order, there should be no more interviews for the next two years as the influence and relevance of this administration ebb away.\n\nConsider these few questions and the presidential responses. Asked how he hoped to tackle worsening insecurity, the president passed the buck to the governors: \u201cYou were elected like me. Go back to your states and provide security. You can\u2019t just go round, win elections and then sit down and expect others to help you with your work.\u201d Dumbfounded? Well, wait for more. You had thought that given the relentless hemming and hawing of some presidency and government officials on the subject of open grazing the presidency had sensibly modified its position and finally aligned with modernity. How cruelly wrong you were. Said the president, and this is probably the final opinion of the Buhari administration on the subject: \u201cTwo Southwest Governors came to me to say cattle rearers were destroying farms in their states. I asked them what happened to the grassroots security panels from traditional rulers to local governments who meet regularly to identify the root of their problems and identify crooks within their environment and apprehend the criminals. Who destroyed this system? Go back and fix it, give your people sense of belonging. I don\u2019t like it when people campaign to become governors and people trusted them with their votes, and after winning, they can\u2019t perform, they\u2019re trying to push responsibilities to others.\u201d\n\nIt is not just that his answer was misplaced, nor that the buck passing was exasperating, it is also frightening that given how food production has been blighted in the past one or two years, not to talk of the appalling loss of lives all over the country caused by rampaging herdsmen, the president could still hold on to such outdated views of animal husbandry. The way he responded to the question, especially the threat to expropriate land for his favoured herders, most of them foreigners, it was clear that he had so much on his chest, so much rage \u2013 too much in fact that in the same breath, he betrayed his contempt and dislike for those who opposed his perspective. In addition, his views on insurgency, appointment of the Chief of Army Staff, operations of local governments, the EndSARS crisis, and the factors encouraging foreign investment were too simplistic and convoluted to give any hope that these problems would be resolved soon. They will not be resolved; the country can only hope they will not be worsened. The president will keep caressing them, because they are ulcers that won\u2019t heal; but his efforts will be fruitless since his presidency is lacking in both quality advice and nationalistic perspective to understand and treat salient national issues with the astuteness and impartiality needed.\n\nIf the audience needed an answer that exemplified the shortcomings of the presidency in responding to grave national issues, they got one when the president bemoaned his inability to fight corruption as much as he would want because of the strictures of democracy. In other words, the most transparent and least corrupt countries in the world, which incidentally are democracies, are of no significance to the administration. Virtually all the responses of the president were nothing more than excuses to explain why simple issues could not be accurately interpreted, let alone understood, and why the government cannot be effective, despite all the constitutional tools given the administration to impact the society. The general sterility is suffocating. The interviewers must have been pained beyond endurance to see their thoughtful questions pulverized by a contrasting and debilitating lack of understanding from the president.",

          "title": "Tribute to Prophet Temitope Joshua: A great Iroko tree has transited!",
          "text": "By Tiko Okoye\n\nThe proliferation of fake news and fabricated fables have long caused me to withdraw from virtually all media platforms \u2013 with the exception of my Facebook account. This explained why I didn\u2019t get to notice when the news first went viral on social media platforms \u2013 even then I still won\u2019t have swallowed the news hook, line, and sinker.\n\nI\u2019m speaking of the death of Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua, the founder and General Overseer of one of Nigeria\u2019s mega churches called the Synagogue Church of All Nations (aka SCOAN). It was a report very difficult to accept on face value simply because Prophet Joshua, more famously known as T.B. Joshua, loomed much larger than life and death!\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until when a neighbour drew my attention to a public announcement that was displayed on SCOAN\u2019s official Twitter handle that I realized that the morbid joke was on me.\n\nFour factors caused the highly popular cleric to stand out from the crowd: his prophecies, his healing ministry, his philanthropy, and the controversies that dogged him.\n\nProphet Joshua\u2019s prophecies included deaths of political leaders, air crashes, national disasters, and winners of electoral contests in Africa, Europe, and America. His spiritual healing techniques raised eyebrows in several quarters but they were very effective, drawing thousands of miracle-seekers from across the globe to SCOAN\u2019s sprawling international headquarters at Ikotun, a suburb of Lagos.\n\nThe diverse miracles he wrought were positively complemented by his equally great philanthropic acts. A Forbes blogger estimated that he spent about $20million on education, healthcare, and rehabilitation schemes for Niger Delta militants. It was also reported that he has spent millions \u2013 if not billions \u2013 of naira on multitudes of students from primary to tertiary education since the programme commenced nearly two decades ago.\n\nAnd what still remains to be said about his highly celebrated rescue and recovery missions both at home and abroad \u2013 the Haiti earthquake disaster and the Philippine tsaunami, among so many others. In quite a number of them, an agency of his ministry was among the first responders on the ground.\n\nAnd then the litany of controversies that dogged his life and ministry. The spiff between him and the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) was most virulent when Pastor Ayo Oritsejafor held sway as the national president.\n\nWho can easily forget the two famous questions the CAN president kept urging concerned Nigerians to demand answers from Prophet Joshua: (1) What is his born-again testimony? (2) Which Bible school did he attend/where did he receive formal training as a member of the Clergy?\n\nBut Prophet Joshua remained as silent as the grave throughout the period, preferring instead to let his work do the talking for him. During the same period, any minister of the Gospel that had an amiable working relationship with Prophet Joshua was equally tackled by the CAN high command and denominational head pastors aligned with their stance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMost Nigerians would easily recall the gripping in-your-face spat on national TV between the two Chrises \u2013 Rev. Chris of the Household of God, a tag team member of CAN, and Pastor Chris of Christ Embassy, a latter-day ally of Prophet Joshua, although it was also being rumoured that the real cause of the altercations centred on an ownership struggle over a posh plot of real estate in their Ikeja precincts.\n\nUnlike Pastor Oritsejafor, I never thought any less of Prophet Joshua on account of his not attending a Bible/theological school because the likes of Apostle Paul never did, yet see the impact he made on Christendom.\n\nBe that as it may, it was still very hard for me to rid my memory of several of the seemingly unorthodox practices and rituals Prophet Joshua engaged in as he started his ministry work on a sand-filled plot of land along the Igando/Iyana-Oba expressway.\n\nA controversy arose early in his ministry when it was alleged that Prophet Joshua was preaching that Jesus wasn\u2019t the son of God, but a prophet and a special messenger \u2013 a view very much in sync with Koranic teaching. This possibly raised question marks over his true Christian state as the divinity of Jesus as the second person in the Trinity or Godhead is a sacrosanct Christian doctrine.\n\nThe allegation \u2013 if indeed it was true \u2013 may possibly explain why he was initially calling himself Emmanuel in a manner that allowed his followers to deify him as Jesus Christ. And on the number of times he was asked point-blank if he was Jesus, he simply parleyed the question and refrained from unambiguously answering it and clearing the air.\n\nIn 2014, a high rise building within the complex collapsed, killing at least 115 persons, mostly foreigners. But the caustic reaction by the South African government \u2013 majority of victims were South Africans \u2013 did very little to stem the traffic to Nigeria.\n\nProphet Joshua notably refused to appear before the panel established by the Lagos State Government to probe the calamity \u2013 not even the threats of the coroner to throw the full weight of the law at him caused a change of attitude.\n\nMy first and only encounter with Prophet Joshua occurred in 2010 when, as a columnist and member of the editorial board of the Daily Independent newspaper, I had written a birthday tribute in his honour. About 10 O\u2019clock that morning (June 12), I received a phone call from someone who simply announced himself as \u201cThe man in the Synagogue.\u201d\n\nMy reflex response was \u201cYeah, and I\u2019m the king of England!\u201d But the caller persisted until I accepted his invite to pay him a curtsy visit. A majority of my colleagues and associates advised me not to endanger my wellbeing by honoring the invite as they perceived it much in the same manner as the fabled weak, old lion sitting at a cave entrance and luring prospective preys into its den!\n\nIt was with great trepidation \u2013 somewhat balanced by mounting curiosity \u2013 that I made a detour later in the evening to Ikotun from Ogba enroute to my home at Okota. I was directed to his office on the second floor upon my arrival. I met an informally dressed middle-aged man in what seemed like a secretary\u2019s office, and I naturally inquired if he could take my details inside to the prophet to announce my presence.\n\nI received one of the greatest shocks of my life when the \u2018secretary\u2019 standing in the ante office told me in a very quiet voice: \u201cI am he whom you seek.\u201d And his simply furnished office only confirmed his humility and contempt for materialistic showoff, knowing how other founders in his position carried themselves.\n\nAs I was rounding up my tour, I ran into a beautiful light-skinned lady on the ground floor walking all by herself. The pastor detailed to show me around the huge edifice explained to me in a low voice that \u201cShe\u2019s Igbo and the wife of the prophet.\u201d Incredible! No PA nor security guards nor throng of eye-pleasers!\n\nAfter an extensive tour of the facilities that included the studios of the wave-making Emmanuel TV and the new high rise building where foreign guests paid in American dollars for accommodation, feeding and ministry materials, Prophet Joshua offered to give me bags of rice which I rejected on the grounds that I didn\u2019t bring my car.\n\nHe countered that a ministry vehicle will convey me and the bags of rice to my house. I again rejected the offer on the grounds that I lived alone and had no need for bags of rice. He again countered that I could donate them to the needy around me.\n\nBut I stood my ground. I must, however, confess that the stories I had heard of how people have been hypnotized after ingesting water or food emanating from SCOAN caused me to be very wary. If Prophet Joshua sensed that such ruinous gossips were driving my serial rejections of his offer, he neither showed it in his voice nor mien.\n\nAt the end of the day, he asked me to pick any gift from the bookstore, and I chose the latest electronic Bible. Before I finally departed, Prophet Joshua furnished me with four GSM numbers that would enable me reach him on a 24/7 basis. He also invited me to attend one of the Sunday services as a special guest \u2013 an offer I now very much regret not taking up.\n\nIt would be a total repudiation of the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ and the selfless love espoused by Christian doctrine if the officials of CAN and fathers of faith that had an axe to grind with Prophet Joshua in the past choose to act as if nothing has happened or \u2013 worst still \u2013 make uncomplimentary remarks unworthy of their calling.\n\nThey mustn\u2019t forget that at a similar scenario had played out at a certain time in the ministry of Jesus. Mark 9:38-40: \u201cAnd John answered (Jesus), saying: \u2018Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us; and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.\u2019 But Jesus said, \u2018Forbid him not; for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me. For he that is not against us is on our part.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith the exception of Jesus, every other vessel is anointed in progressive degrees. And rather than being churlish and arrogantly dismissive, the holder of a candlelight ought to be meek enough to first ascertain why the holder of a big rechargeable lantern is seeing what he is claiming to see. This is very deep!\n\nA great iroko tree has indeed transited and only God knows how crestfallen the vast majority of SCOAN members around the globe \u2013 particularly in East and South Africa, the Caribbeans, Eastern Europe, and Latin America \u2013 must be.\n\nProphet Joshua was a worthy successor to Archbishop Benson Idahosa as the greatest televangelist Nigeria has ever produced. He did far more to propagate Nigeria in positive light than any other individual or organization.\n\nForeigners were pouring into Nigeria in droves on account of religious pilgrimage-cum-tourism, generating substantial amounts of foreign exchange to the national coffers. He even converted the swampy morass at Ikotun into a wonderland on the scale of Disney theme parks.\n\nAccording to Scriptures, \u201cA tree is known by its fruits\u2026A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things.\u201d So let it be with Prophet Joshua.\n\nIrrespective of the fact that he had already received a national honour, I very strongly appeal to the Buhari administration would quickly move to confer a posthumous high national honour \u2013 not less than Commander of the Federal Republic (CFR) \u2013 on Prophet Joshua for \u201chighly meritous services rendered to the nation and humanity.\u201d\n\nMay Almighty God grant his family, SCOAN members, as well as the government and citizens of Nigeria, in particular, and Christendom in general, the fortitude and wisdom to bear the irreparable loss.\n\nProphet Tee-Bee, you were humble in life but proudly triumphant in death. May your soul rest in perfect peace and your memory continue to be a huge blessing to all you left behind until Resurrection morning in Jesus name.\n\nOkoye is Banker and writer",

          "title": "Rauf Aregbesola Discourse: From Governance to Big Development",
          "text": "By Tunji Olaopa\n\nJust barely two weeks ago, Ogbeni Rauf Adesoji Aregbesola, former governor of Osun State and the current Minister of the Interior of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, celebrated his 64th birthday. Not one given to frivolities, he organized an online colloquium to mark the day. It was themed \u201cGovernment and Big Development.\u201d And I had the honor to have been invited to speak at the resoundingly successful seminal event. William Barclay the Scottish theologian and author said clearly that \u201cThere are two great days in a person\u2019s life \u2013 the day we are born and the day we discover why.\u201d There is no doubt that Ogbeni Aregbesola has discovered his own why. And that has been demonstrated by his knowledge-propelled governance credentials in all his years in public office, and especially from Lagos state to the state of Osun. Both in character and achievements, Aregbesola has remained, in his own unique way, mercurial and sterling. His Marxist principles keeps him firmly entrenched in a populist ideology that keeps the people at the center of his governance model. And the annual colloquium signals his willingness to institute a continuing conversation that keeps reshaping the template of good governance on behalf of Nigerians.\n\nAt this year\u2019s colloquium, the Vice President of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, made two crucial points that will serve as the premise for my intervention. The Vice President\u2019s concerns relate to two correlated issues of the burdensome cost of governance that keeps draining Nigeria\u2019s depleting resources, and Nigeria\u2019s low productivity profile which deeply constrained a return on government investments. These two issues speak in serious terms to the development predicament of the Nigerian state. And it means a lot that the Vice President was able to hit the nail on the head. The bloated nature of the workforce of the public service, however, must be seen in terms of the near absence of the right competency mix, skills composition and organizational IQ, rather than of the number of workers, most of whom do little or nothing but with a very few doing too much. This implies that while creative rightsizing and institutional restructuring are imperative as the change management options, government will not win except it comes to the change dynamics with equity. And this demands that a focus on payroll as a target for efficiency-savings, must also be complemented by the urgency of unbundling the entire expenditure structure of government through rigorous productivity audit.\n\nUnfortunately, the demand for big development that attends sufficiently to the well-being of Nigerians must be a holistic and comprehensive reform. This is essentially what the \u201cbigness\u201d of big development actually suggests. It speaks to a state-induced massive development leap. Such a leap creates the required momentum that is capable of creating desirable multiplier effects that deliver sustainable national transformation. Big development conceptually connotes an optimistic development scenario of macroeconomic possibilities that, for instance, produces a double-digit economic growth through the game-changing sustainable contributions of value-adding and critical growth-propelling sectors and drivers. In the social science literature, big development is often taken to be the task of a capable developmental state. Such a state is developmental to the extent that it is able to deploy the capability readiness of an efficient and flexible public service institutional architecture. Singapore, Japan and the Asian Tigers provides a ready example of states whose development trajectory has been qualitatively transformed as a result of dogged structural, institutional and leadership dynamics.\n\nSince independence, and despite its best efforts, Nigeria has displayed an almost pathological incapacity of moving from governance vision and policies to performance outcomes in terms of development that activates its institutional frameworks to deliver infrastructural development to Nigerians. In summary, Nigeria lacks the capacity to get things done. In institutional reform terms, this is another way of saying that the devil in Nigeria\u2019s non-transforming development initiatives and change management lies in the mix of a number of complex and correlated issues: i) the politics that Nigeria\u2019s political class plays; ii) leadership IQ, sophistication and sincerity; iii) human resource capacity deficits, especially in the dynamics of policy implementation; iv) unstable macro-economic climate; v) policy, programme and project discontinuity, poor programme design, poor resource allocation; vi) lack of disciplined execution; and vii) corruption and the rentier culture. Overall, Nigeria is held in the unfortunate grip of the ever confounding and almighty Nigeria Factor which incapacitates every functional idea, model or paradigms that had worked elsewhere.\n\nThe optimistic news however is that transforming the Nigerian state into a democratic developmental one is not an impossibility. While appreciating the fact that Nigeria has not lacked in significant visions and development planning since independence, we need to note that visions and plans constitute only 15% of the development challenge. On the other hand, 85% is about the political will to push the implementation of development and policy execution through the complex and messy implementation trajectory. In deploying the required political will to jumpstart the change Nigeria needs to get things done, the entire leadership class in Nigeria\u2014from the president to the governors (together with their ministers and commissioners)\u2014is faced with a critical question: What type of changes can be realistically achieved in 4 years that will bring government promise to the point of efficient services delivered effectively to Nigerians? This question speaks to the crucial short time and limited resources any sitting president and governor has to achieve a qualitative move from governance promise to tangible development outcomes.\n\nThe starting point of the whole structural and institutional transformation of the state into a developmental one commences with a deep-seated transformation of the state itself, especially in relation to the market and its dynamics for how government does its business. First, Nigeria needs to craft a formidable and viable national development agenda or plan. And at the heart of such a development plan is the priority given to the need for a national productivity paradigm shift in the national economy that is matched with smart implementable strategies, and the capacity to mobilize all sectors of society to implement it. The deployment of strategies will be fundamental at two levels. The first level requires urgently attending to the cost of governance burden through a national waste reduction strategy that will not only deal with institutional redundancy, but also get all critical sectors of the economy to articulate their productivity plans based on agreed national benchmark. This will also include productivity tools and metrics that will enable labour and management to both sign up for a revised collective bargaining framework that will facilitate the implementation of a new benchmarked ratio of capital-overhead-personnel budget backstopped by a new compensation system.\n\nThe second level of institutional strategies demands attending to the operational and performance dynamics of the MDAs. This is where it becomes imperative for the state to redefine its role and that of the MDAs vis-\u00e0-vis the market and the private sector as a formidable engine that can calibrate the growth of the national economy. Once the role of the private sector is determined, then the strategic recalibration demands an alternative service delivery model that enables the MDAs to focus on their core functions while outsourcing their non-core functions to the private sector. This makes the public-private partnership model a significant model of doing business for government. Once this is taken for granted, it now remains for the MDAs to be taken through rigorous change management procedures that will make them capacity ready to deliver on their core functions of supporting policy making with strategic intelligence, mobilizing required resources to execute, regulate, etc. This is where the execution problematic becomes a critical risk factor in the need to achieve big development. It is in the implementation of the reform of the performance and productivity metrics of the MDAs that the devil really resides in the details.\n\nThus, apart from streamlining the MDAs\u2019 productivity targets into the national development plan, there is the specific need to lay the structural foundation that will shift them from policy designs to policy intelligence and creative implementation capacity. One important step will be to outline critical bureau-pathological issues, like a bloated workforce and declining professional ethics for immediate attention. This also demands that critical gaps\u2014capacity, policy, process, resource and performance\u2014be dealt with. Another important step is to categorize the MDAs for a selective reform capacitation exercise on the strength of their significance. The public institutions to be targeted for capacitation fall into three categories: (a) MDAs that implement national priority programmes, (b) public institutions that regulate rules-based market players, investments points of opportunity, SMEs and the rule of law, and (c) institutions that facilitate welfare-oriented social impact, services and human capital development. And the key is to reengineer the MDAs\u2019 management systems in ways that targets their operational and processual frameworks in ways that enable them to embrace project management culture, particularly ones that leverage strategic PPP modality. This also include putting in place strategic performance metric: job evaluation, skills re-composition, regrading, new pay structure and the rethinking of the intellectual contents of skills for running the business of government.\n\nThe desire for big development, in the final analysis, speaks to the emergence of a critical mass of political and bureaucratic leadership, that will be willing to go the whole hog with rethinking and rejuvenating Nigeria\u2019s governance and development dynamics, with the agenda of making real the goal to build a democratic and developmental state. That, for me, is Nigeria\u2019s future; a date she is meant to keep with her citizens who ought to benefit from the social contract with a great state.\n\n(Paper Presented at the Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola\u2019s Annual Colloquium and Webinar on the theme \u2018Government and Big Development\u2019 held on the 29th of May, 2021)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOlaopa is a Retired Federal Permanent Secretary & Directing Staff, National Institute For Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS), Kuru, Jos",

          "title": "Money, not sex, freaks me \u2013Angel Emeka, actress",
          "text": "By Christian Agadibe\n\nGifted with the talent to crack jokes, Angel Emeka earned herself first movie role a few years ago, and since then she has not looked back.\n\nIn this exclusive interview, the single mother of two talked about her career, love, sex and marriage. Enjoy it.\n\nHow did you get into the movie industry?\n\nA costumier of mine who is a Nollywood script supervisor by name, Ebuka, may his soul rest in peace, came to my boutique with his friend, Chinedu Arinze, a location manager. They came to buy some stuff and I cracked them up, they laughed all day and told me that I can do well in the film industry. I laughed at them and had a flash back on what my mom always told me that she sees me as an actress in future, and since then I have always dreamt of it. So, I decided to give it a trial, and I went with them to the movie location in Asaba where they introduced me to a movie producer called, Solo Amaco, who gave me a role instantly to act with Joyce Kanu. I was so much scared of acting with her because that was my first time of meeting her, and I started crying due to the fear in me. But Madam Joyce Kanu noticed it was my first time and she consoled me and gave me the courage never to be scared. Being a market fight scene, she asked me to see her as my friend and fight her as if we\u2019re fighting for real, which I did in fear and the job came out well.\n\nHow was your growing up?\n\nGrowing up wasn\u2019t easy for my siblings and I, because we lost our dad at an early stage; but my mom is a strong woman. May God keep her for me!\n\nWhat was the first movie or series you acted in?\n\nThe first movie I acted in was Hour of Tears.\n\nWhat were the challenges you faced when you first got into the industry?\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to have a break when you\u2019re new because the producers and directors do not know how good you are. So, many of them find it very difficult to cast you in a movie, but I prayed for God\u2019s favour, which has been working for me till now.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest sacrifice you\u2019ve ever made for your career?\n\nMy kids and my business, I don\u2019t joke with these two. I love spending quality time with my kids and anyone that knows me very well will also tell you that I am a business tycoon and an entrepreneur, but my career has taken most of my time.\n\nHow many movies have you acted in so far?\n\nI can\u2019t recall exactly the number because I stopped counting six years ago.\n\nWhat current projects are you working on?\n\nI am working on my personal movie titled, Highlander, which is on post-production. I also finished a movie project, which I produced last month and it\u2019s currently airing on YouTube as we speak. The title is Village Jagaban.\n\nWhats your first experience in front of the camera, were you nervous?\n\nI wasn\u2019t nervous, because Joyce Kanu carried me along. But in my second movie, I was nervous because an actor made the set so uncomfortable for me. He shouted at me, saying I was not acting well, which made me cry like a baby. I ran to my car and went home because the shame was too much for me. However, the director made him to understand that I was new in the game and he felt bad, apologized and encouraged me to be stronger. Today, he is my bestie.\n\nWhat were you doing before this and what was the experience like?\n\nI was into importation of red wine, and boutique business. I was enjoying it because business is my thing as well.\n\nWhat was the turning point in your career?\n\nWhen I produced my first movies, Love From Panya and Dino`s Family.\n\nHow do you relax?\n\nI go for vacation with my kids, visit the zoo and chill with my girls.\n\nWhat quality or sexy part earned you your first movie role?\n\nIt\u2019s my Chinese baby face, bowlegs, hard work as well as my size. Amaco gave me the first role because of my body size. He needed someone big that can fight Joyce Kanu and I fitted into the character.\n\nWhich movie gave you the big break?\n\nAssembles of God and Ghetto University.\n\nMost men can hardly get their eyes off you; how do you cope with them?\n\nI end up making them my friends because we may end up doing businesses together. All my life I prefer making men my friends.\n\nWhat is the craziest thing a male fan or admirer has done to you?\n\nOne of my male fans poured chocolate ice cream on me while trying to take picture with me. It was fun, but crazy.\n\nHow do you intend to break into the A-list in this highly competitive industry?\n\nI\u2019m focused on my talent; with God by my side, I know I will get to the top.\n\nAs a soon-to-be-married actress, what is your stand on divorce?\n\nBroken marriages have nothing to do with the movie industry, just pray God to keep your home. Marriages break up on daily basis not only in Nollywood.\n\nIs marriage far or near for you?\n\nI now want to focus on my career because my first marriage wasn\u2019t fun and I am not fully healed.\n\nHave you said no to marriage proposal?\n\nYes, I\u2019ve said no to many because I am not ready for marriage yet.\n\nNow, how would you safeguard your next marriage?\n\nI will do everything possible to keep my marriage when the time comes. Marriage is sweet when you marry your man, a man that will love and endure you as his queen, and you respect and submit to him as your king.\n\nWhat does sex mean to you?\n\nSex means nothing to me because I am not a sex freak. I can stay for five years without sex, as long as my business is doing well and my kids are happy.\n\nThere are women who cannot get their eyes off a sexy lady like you; do you also have women that woo you?\n\nYes, but I don\u2019t give room to that madness.\n\nAre you in a relationship now?\n\nI am not in any relationship for now. I am still very much single. I am a single mother.\n\nWhat are the qualities you desire in a man?\n\nHe must be handsome, God-fearing, humble, loving, caring, and well dressed.\n\nHow do you handle sexual urge especially now that you\u2019re not in any relationship?\n\nI am not a sex freak; the only thing that freaks me is money.\n\nDo you have men asking you to be their second wife?\n\nYes, many times, but I believe in one man, one wife.\n\nCan you marry a man much older than you?\n\nNo! I don\u2019t like old men. When I was much younger, I had a bad experience that made me not to give any old man a chance to my heart. So, I don\u2019t see myself marrying someone much older than me except It\u2019s the will of God.\n\nHow would you advise young people who want to go into acting?\n\nThey should be focused and consistent because acting needs a lot of time if you really want to make it in the movie business.",

          "title": "NDDC board: What Niger Delta people want Buhari to do to Akpabio \u2014Comrade Joseph Evah",
          "text": "By Daniel Kanu\n\nNational leader, Ijaw Monitoring Group (IMG), Comrade Joseph Evah has warned that unless something serious is done to salvage the present state of insecurity in the country, there may not be any election in 2023.\n\nIn this interview with Sunday Sun, he also blamed the Southeast leaders for their latest culture of silence and fear as the major reason for the continued violence in the region.\n\nThe activist was also critical on the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s twitter handlers, as well as his lashes out the Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio, advocating for his sack.\n\nHe spoke on other national issues, including the recent constitution review exercise by the National Assembly with a verdict that nothing good will come out of it. Excerpt:\n\nLet\u2019s know the latest happening on the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC)?\n\nThe Niger Delta Ministry Minister, Godswill Akpabio is simply exhibiting madness, so we are following him up. He is the problem of NDDC, constituting stumbling block. Akpabio said we are frustrating them, he thought that NDDC is their political game centre so we are telling him that we have had enough of his arrogance. He went to Tompolo Gharamatu to go and beg him, he thought that Tompolo is someone that can be bribed because he believes that in Nigeria everybody has a price and bribable. No. Tompolo is not that type of person, he is one with credibility and integrity, that is why we have a lot of respect for him. What is the problem of Akpabio for not inaugurating the NDDC board? What is his problem? So, when he looks at the Niger Delta people he feels and thinks that he can put us in his pocket? When did he join politics? It is just like the way some of his former governor friends are behaving like drunkards. Look at the way some of them are behaving, common sense they don\u2019t have. It is disgracing. The problem is that most of them seem to forget their past, they forget where they are coming from and proscribed the memory of their past. In life anybody that forgets about his past when they get little opportunity you see them behaving like drunkards and you are going to leave the office one day, so why the arrogance? They seem to forget that power is transient, just temporary. When you leave the office is it not that same people you despised that you will meet again? Won\u2019t you come back for something else? We expect President Buhari to sack Akpabio quickly, if Akpabio will not face his Ministry of Niger Delta where there is no money to spend. But because of the type of money that the oil companies are giving to NDDC, Akpabio is focusing only on NDDC to build his own political jamboree in 2023, we will not allow it. The Ministry of Niger Delta is dead under Akpabio\u2019s watch, and he is not doing anything about it in Abuja. Because of the controversy in NDDC no money is going to NDDC from budgetary allocation. Akpabio is a confusionist and he should repent, but I expect the president to remove and replace him so that we can have peace. It is because of his gambling for 2023 that Akpabio is causing all this confusion.\n\nHow do you see the constitution review panels of the National Assembly?\n\nI do not see anything good or cheering coming out of it because our politicians are not sincere, if not for their insincerity and deceit something good should come out of it. Are they ready to let us have one chamber instead of this two chambers (House of Representatives and Senate) that we are wasting millions on? Which of them will be patriotic enough to say that this two chambers that we are operating, we are wasting so much money, that we should go back to our parliamentary system so as to save money? How many of the lawmakers are ready to sacrifice for their present positions now? They are ready for this wasteful system that is going on. I See what they are doing as mere jamboree because they are not sincere. Are you saying that they don\u2019t know our problem? Are you saying that they don\u2019t know that the system we are running is wasteful? But because they are benefitting from it themselves you will find out that they will not be genuinely committed to any serious review. Which of them will say: Let us go back to the parliamentary days, that we should have only one National Assembly, one chamber unlike this expensive nonsense we are practicing now. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives are simply wasting money. Let us put that money in education. How many of them will suggest that? Let them start by examining themselves first. I don\u2019t see anything credible coming out of it and the reason as I said is simple. The people who are arranging it, managing it, midwifing it never won election in the first place, so they are alienated from their people. What the people want is not what they want. Can the National Assembly that we have today agree to go back to the parliamentary years so that we have one house (unicameral) making the law. Members of the National Assembly should start from themselves to get credibility and others will follow them and respect them. But for now, they are just wasting money, junketing the entire country, enjoying themselves in the hotels where they stay in the name of public hearing. I do not see any sincerity in what they are doing and I know I will be vindicated at last; nothing good will come out of it.\n\nWhat is your view on President Buhari\u2019s comment against the Southeast on Twitter, the removal of his tweet and the banning of Twitter in the country?\n\nI still think that our President\u2019s Twitter handlers should be more cautious on what they push out. You may find out that Buhari will not tweet such message on his own, sometimes the president is not aware of such tweets. There are many things they are doing in that Villa that the president is not aware of. His Twitter handlers need to exercise caution sometimes, seeing how the country is going volatile. There is need to manage any news, message, information coming from the presidential desk. I can tell you that the president was not aware of that tweet until his attention was drawn to it and they will start damage control. I think the president should caution those media aides that do those tweets with his name, they are taking so many things for granted, we should be sincere to ourselves. The president should caution those individuals who tweet things in his name that are not his ideology, individuals who create imaginary problems for him where there is none. The president I can tell you is not aware, I am not saying may not be aware, but that he was not aware of that tweet because he would not allow it. It is like what Akpabio is doing in the Niger Delta, he will just go and tell one of the personal assistants to the president that this is the thinking of the Niger Delta people and they will be pushing the agenda even without the president knowing. There is so mush deceit over there that a lot is outside the knowledge of Mr. President. They do not have access to the president\u2019s bedroom, but they know people who have such access, those are the people they go and lobby and they come out to say that the president said this and that when in truth the president is in the dark on those issues. Do you think President Buhari will tell the Attorney General to go and start comparing herdsmen with Igbo spare parts dealers? Can you imagine that logic in this 21st Century? If we are in a sane society that minister is supposed to resign. For that minister to open his mouth to compare bandits, herdsmen that are killing people, even in their own area, raping women among other atrocities and you compare them with spare parts dealers, such thinking is worrisome. When you see some of these things you begin to ask yourself, is this still the country that Ahmadu Bello, Tafawa Balewa, Obafemi Awolowo, Nnamdi Azikiwe etc, founded? Some of the things we hear and see these days about Nigeria are disturbing and you begin to ask yourself, how did we get here.\n\nI know you are aware of the massive support that former Lagos State governor and national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is getting with the formation of SWAGA (Southwest Agenda for Asiwaju). What is your take on the development?\n\nThere is nothing wrong with it. They can go on with their massive support for him. He has the right to contest. I know a lot of people seem to be looking at the Southeast, but their political leaders and elders must rise up to the occasion of what is going on there now, the orgy of killings, the violence, destructions etc and stop it. What is going on in the Southeast is a signal, those who are sponsoring them are saying: Don\u2019t mention Southeast for the presidency in 2023, that is the signal. Those who are sponsoring destruction of police stations, burning of INEC offices, destruction of prisons, killing of policemen and other security agencies have a terrible agenda and the elders and political leaders in the Southeast are simply watching, keeping silent. This their new culture of silence and fear is not doing them any good. What are we saying? Are we saying that there is no leadership in the Southeast to stop this carnage, the self-destruction that is going on? Are you saying there is no political leadership and elders that can stop what is happening in the Southeast? When you are burning INEC offices and materials what will you use to conduct election? People that have committed crime and facing punishment you go and release them, why? I hope that the Southeast leaders should sit down and know that the signal is very clear and very dangerous for their political future. The Southeast leaders should investigate what is happening, the Yoruba are doing it. They should stop relying on conspiracy theory and folding their hands. Why can\u2019t they rise up to investigate what is happening? So, even if it is coming from the outside you fold your hands until the police do their investigation? No, they should open their eyes and track down what is happening, they should do their own thorough investigation too to compare with whatever other investigation that will be done either by the police or whoever. Igbo leaders have to arrest the situation, it is not something that they should wait for anybody to come and do for them. What is happening there is unacceptable. If there are saboteurs expose them, nobody will take any excuse on what is happening there because the Igbo must put their house in order. They must call a spade a spade, saying that outsiders are doing it, it is a fake cry, nobody will listen to such excuse; they have to unravel what is happening there. A political zone with not less than five states and the elders, governors, political leaders, senators cannot sit down and say: we must do something to stop this carnage. Even if what is happening is coming from the outside they can, with unity among them resist and stop it. You cannot be there and your environment, your heritage is being destroyed and you are talking of conspiracy theory, you are keeping silent. Are those people doing the destruction spirits? Igbo leadership must swing into action to unravel what is happening if they are serious. And they have the capacity to do it if they want to.\n\nBut you know that orders come from Abuja as far as security issues are concerned?\n\nSo, if Abuja did not respond or yet to respond you wait until you die waiting for Abuja? Look, every community in Nigeria has vigilante, every street has vigilante group, and wherever people are living they have a vigilante group. And we are aware even from reports from the social media of the vigilante in Igbo land which they are boasting off. If you go to Asaba area and see the vigilante group there you will fear, go to Delta North and see the powerful vigilante groups that people from Governor Okowa area has set up, beyond the Nigeria Police Force. In those areas people are contributing money from everywhere, from abroad, to sustain it for their security. Look, I am worried that if this security challenge remains this way there will be a big challenge with conducting any election. As I speak, you cannot travel from Bayelsa to Warri, you cannot travel to anywhere without being afraid, bandits are everywhere. I don\u2019t see the 2023 election taking place from the insecurity that is on now. Do you know the curfew that is in Rivers State? Rivers State is worse than Abia. We are praying that Rivers State problem does not extend to Bayelsa and the riverine areas. Poverty is coming, food is not moving round again because of the insecurity. As we speak now students are still in captivity. I am an educationist, why will I be happy to hear that children are still in captivity. In the house when I look at my daughter I imagine that somebody\u2019s daughter is still in captivity for one month. What is happening in the country is frightening. What are the Imams and the pastors telling our leaders who are members of their congregations? They should stop them from entering the mosques and churches. Let there be ushers on the ground that will be driving them away.",

          "title": "Anxiety as Nigeria\u2019s debt burden hits N32.9 trillion",
          "text": "From Uche Usim, Abuja\n\nWith Nigeria\u2019s total debt stock currently pegged at N32.915 trillion (as at December 31, 2020), many are worried that the country is being boxed into a debt trap it may never wriggle out from in decades to come.\n\nThe figure, released by the Debt Management Office (DMO), includes local and external debt of the federal, state governments and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nAccording to economic experts, plausible reasons for the swell in the external debts include lower oil prices, disproportionate spending, COVID-19, defence of the exchange rate, over-reliance on crude oil receipts (with all its volatilities) and poor economic diversification agenda, among others.\n\nBetween July 2015 when President Muhammadu and December 2020, Nigeria\u2019s debt rose by approximately N20.8 trillion, according to the DMO.\n\nThis period corresponds with the Presidency of Buhari, who assumed leadership of the country on May 29, 2015.\n\nAccording to the statistics, Nigeria\u2019s total debt as at June 30, 2015 stood at N12.12 trillion.\n\nHowever, by December 31, 2020, the country\u2019s debt portfolio had risen to N32.92 trillion.\n\nIn 2015, Nigeria\u2019s debt was N12.6 trillion. It rose to N17.4 trillion in 2016 and then N21.7 trillion in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, the country\u2019s debt had climbed to N24.4 trillion. It ballooned to N27.1 in 2019 and finally N32.915 trillion as at December 31 last year.\n\nThis shows that within a period of 66 months (five and half years), the country\u2019s debt grew by N20.8 trillion.\n\nIt also means that within the period, the country\u2019s debt portfolio rose by 171.62 per cent.\n\nDomestic sources accounted for N20.21 trillion, while external sources accounted for N12.71 trillion.\n\nIn percentage terms, external debts accounted for 38.6 per cent of the total debt portfolio while domestic debts accounted for 61.4 per cent.\n\nThe country\u2019s increasing debt profile is also reflected in the growing cost of debt servicing which has further depleted the nation\u2019s dwindling revenues in recent years.\n\nWithin the period of 66 months under review, the country spent N10.26 trillion on debt servicing.\n\nWhile servicing local debts gulped N8.53 trillion between July 2015 and December 2020, servicing external debts gulped N1.72 trillion from 2016 to December 2020 (external debt servicing converted to naira at the exchange rate prevailing at the time, provided by the DMO).\n\nThe data provided by the DMO showed that from July to December 2015, N489.59 billion was spent on servicing local debts.\n\nFrom January to December, a total of N1.23 trillion was spent to service the country\u2019s domestic debts in 2016. The figure rose to N1.48 trillion in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, the country\u2019s domestic debt servicing bill rose to N1.8 trillion. The cost of domestic debt servicing came down a bit in 2019 to N1.69 trillion. In 2020, it rose again to N1.85 trillion.\n\nOn the other hand, external debt servicing consumed $353.09 million in 2016. It went up to $464.05 million in 2017 and jumped up to $1.47 billion in 2018.\n\nIn 2019, the nation spent $1.33 billion on external debt servicing. In 2020, external debt servicing gulped $1.56 billion.\n\nTo rescue the country from the thorny situation, President Buhari has been going cap in hand begging for debt relief for the country at different international fora, but without success thus far.\n\nHis efforts mimic those of Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala in 2006, when she led Nigeria and the Paris Club to seal a final agreement for debt relief worth $18 billion and an overall reduction of Nigeria\u2019s debt stock by $30 billion.\n\nOn his part, the Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr Godwin Emefiele has called on the state governors to wean themselves off the addiction to loans and monthly federal subvention by investing heavily in agriculture, especially in crops they have comparative advantage. With that, they can help solve the food insecurity nightmare and go into massive exports to pay their debts and build prosperity for their respective states.\n\nThe rise in the country\u2019s debt servicing reflected the nation\u2019s increasing commitment to external loans.\n\nThe debt accumulation is coming at a time when key government officials in the Economic Management Team have repeatedly defended the country\u2019s debt level, arguing that it is still within sustainable limits.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed has severally insisted that Nigeria does not have a debt problem.\n\nAccording to her, what the government needed to do was to increase its revenue generating capacity in order to boost revenue to about 50 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\n\u201cNigeria does not have a debt problem. What we have is a revenue problem.\n\n\u201cOur revenue to GDP is still one of the lowest among countries that are comparable to us. It\u2019s about 19 per cent of GDP and what the World Bank and IMF recommended is about 50 per cent of GDP for countries that are our size. We are not there yet. What we have is a revenue problem\u201d, she posited at a recent Finance Summit.\n\nHowever, the Finance Minister\u2019s position differs with that of some economic experts who said that the huge borrowings portend danger for the economy.\n\nFor instance, a Chartered Accountant, Mr Ezekiel Ifeanyi said the Federal Government\u2019s current fiscal position constrains it from embarking on such huge expenditure as a result of accumulated large deficits over the past few years.\n\nHe said that the huge debt remains a burden for the economy, adding that time has come for Nigeria to begin to seek debt relief from its creditors.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly said that the government should cut its coat according to its cloth. It must look for where and how to reduce its over-bloated governance structure that has been consuming so much. And there are one thousand and one budget heads they can do away with without retrenching workers. The Oronsaye Panel\u2019s report recommendation that ministries and agencies of government should be merged is still unimplemented.\n\n\u201cSo, borrowing is a lazy way of escaping from reality. If you cannot afford a particular lifestyle, commonsense dictates that you should come back and restructure your lifestyle to suit your income. But rather than doing this, the government keeps on borrowing to satiate its appetite for luxury and flamboyance.\n\n\u201cWell, we are not in support of this and we will want the government to be very prudent and mindful of the future of our economy, the future of the project called Nigeria and the future of generations yet unborn\u201d, Ezekiel stated.\n\nAlso, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Kingsley Moghalu, at a virtual conference organised by Elombah Television in 2020, warned that with the rise in the country\u2019s debt service to revenue ratio, Nigeria was heading towards a sovereign debt crisis.\n\nHe noted that the terms and conditions attached to the Chinese loans were not favourable to Nigeria.\n\nThe former presidential candidate canvassed public private partnership (PPP) as the best and sustainable way to fund strategic infrastructure projects.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe number one problem is not just Nigeria\u2019s loan to China, but it is the broader external indebtedness. Nigeria is essentially walking into a sovereign debt crisis.\n\n\u201cWhen you consider that we now spend virtually all that we earn servicing foreign debt.\n\n\u201cIn the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Government\u2019s total revenue was about N950 billion, but we spent N943 billion servicing external debt, which was about 99 per cent. Is a country on this path fiscally viable?\n\n\u201cWe are taking more and more of these loans and we are told by the Debt Management Office (DMO) that our debt to GDP ratio is under control and is below 30 per cent, and that it does not matter.\u201d\n\nHe explained that 90 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s revenue \u201cis from crude oil. So, when those revenues are plunging, then that is a huge risk because your debt obligations are fixed.\n\n\u201cSo, if there is such a serious mismatch between what you are earning and what you have to pay those you are owing, then you have a crisis. And that is the real problem for Nigeria today with its loan from China.\u201d\n\nThe bulk of Nigeria\u2019s lenders are offshore corporations, with China being Nigeria\u2019s biggest creditor.\n\nNigeria has agreed $5.6 billion in loans with China. But as of March 2020, Beijing had disbursed $3.3 billion. With Nigeria already servicing the loans, $3.1 billion was outstanding as at then.\n\nHowever, commenting on the rising debt, the DMO explained that it was not an entirely gloomy situation. It noted that after Nigeria exited recession in 2017, the level of new borrowing at the federal level, as shown in the annual Appropriation Acts, had been declining as part of the government\u2019s measures to moderate the rate of growth in the public debt stock in order to ensure debt sustainability.\n\nThe DMO added that new borrowing to part-finance budget deficits had declined steadily from N2.36 trillion in 2017 to N2.01 trillion in 2018. It was N1.61 trillion in 2019 and N1.59 trillion in the 2020 Appropriation Act.\n\n\u201cThis trend was reversed in 2020 due to the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as new borrowing in the revised 2020 Appropriation Act was N4.20 trillion. Many countries including the advanced countries also increased their level of borrowing as a result of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted though, that apart from the new domestic borrowing of N2.3 trillion, the other new borrowings were concessional loans from the International Monetary Fund ($3.34 billion) and other multilateral and bilateral lenders.\n\n\u201cThis incremental borrowing to part-finance the 2020 budget and the additional issuance of promissory notes to settle some arrears of the Federal Government of Nigeria, contributed to the increase in public debt stock. New domestic borrowings by state governments also contributed to the growth in the public debt stock.\n\n\u201cTotal public debt to GDP as at December 31, 2020 was 21.61 per cent which is within Nigeria\u2019s new limit of 40 per cent. The various initiatives of the government to increase revenues such as the Strategic Revenue Growth Initiative and the Finance Act, 2020, should help shore up government\u2019s revenue and reduce the debt service to revenue ratio\u201d, the DMO explained.\n\nBut amid fears of Nigeria\u2019s high debt exposure to China, the DMO reassured that there was nothing to panic about as the loans were concessional with interest rates of 2.50 per cent per annum, tenor of 20 years and a moratorium of seven years.\n\nIt added that the communist country was not a major source of funding for the Federal Government, despite the fact that total borrowing from China, as at March 31, 2020, stood at $3.121 billion or N1,126.68 trillion using the N361/$1 conversion template.\n\nThe DMO ruled out the possibility of China taking possession of the projects financed by them if Nigeria defaults in servicing the loan.\n\nThe DMO emphasized that Nigeria explicitly provides for debt service on its external and domestic debt in its annual budgets, adding that a number of the projects being (and to be) financed by the loans are either revenue generating or have the potential to generate revenue.\n\nIt added that the $3.121 billion Chinese debt represents only 3.94 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s total public debt of $79.303 billion (N28,628.49 trillion at $1/N361) as at March 31, 2020.\n\nDMO said: \u201cSimilarly, in terms of external sources of funds, loans from China accounted for 11.28 per cent of the external debt stock of $27.67 billion at the same date.\n\n\u201cThese data show that China is not a major source of funding for the Nigerian government.\n\nThe terms of the loans are compliant with the provisions of Section 41 (1a) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007. In addition, the low interest rate reduces the interest cost to the government, while the long tenor enables the repayment of the principal sum of the loans over many years.\n\n\u201cThese two benefits make the provisions for debt service in the annual budget lower than they would otherwise have been if the loans were on commercial terms\u201d.\n\nThe DMO further explained that the $3.121 billion Chinese loans are project-tied facilities.\n\nIt listed the 11 projects as; Nigerian Railway Modernization Project (Idu-Kaduna section), Abuja Light Rail Project, Nigerian Four Airport Terminals Expansion Project, (Abuja, Kano, Lagos and Port Harcourt), Nigerian Railway Modernization Project (Lagos-Ibadan section) and Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Abuja \u2013 Keffi- Makurdi Road Project.\n\nIt further noted that the impact of these loans is not only evident but visible. For instance, the Idu \u2013 Kaduna rail line has become a major source of transportation between Abuja and Kaduna. Also, the new International Airport in Abuja, has improved air transportation for the populace, while the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan rail line when completed, will ease traffic on the busy Lagos-Ibadan expressway.\n\n\u201cThe projects also have the added benefits of job creation, not only by themselves but through direct and indirect service providers, a number of which are Small and Medium Enterprises.\n\n\u201cIt is widely accepted that investment in infrastructure is one of the most effective tools for countries to achieve economic growth and development. Using Loans from China to finance infrastructure is thus in alignment with this position.\n\n\u201cThe principal process and requirements for borrowing by the government are expressly stated in the Debt Management Office Establishment (ETC) Act, 2003 (DMO Act) and the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007. Section 21 (1) of the DMO Act, \u2018No External loan shall be approved or obtained by the Minister unless its terms and conditions shall have been laid before the National Assembly and approved by its resolution\u2019 and Section 41 (1a) of the FRA, \u2018Government at all tiers shall only borrow for capital expenditure and human development, provided that, such borrowing shall be on concessional terms with low interest rate and with a reasonable long amortization period subject to the approval of the appropriate legislative body where necessary\u2019, are instructive in this regard.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning works with the MDAs under whose portfolio a proposed loan falls and also with the DMO. Thereafter, the approval of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) is sought. It is only after the approval by FEC that His Excellency requests for the approval of the National Assembly as required by Section 41 of the Fiscal responsibility Act, 2007. More importantly, it is only after the approval of NASS that the loans are taken and Nigeria begins to draw down on the loans.\n\n\u201cThe loan agreements are reviewed by legal officers of the Federal Ministry of Justice and the Legal Opinion of the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice is obtained before any External Loan Agreement is signed\u201d, the DMO added.\n\nCommenting on Nigeria\u2019s ballooning debt profile, Nigeria\u2019s first professor of the Capital Markets and former Imo State Finance Commissioner, Prof Uche Uwaleke explained that the crash in revenue generation always leads the Nigerian government to borrow.\n\n\u201cThe way forward is to make conscious efforts to have multiple streams of income, including through embracing the private sector to develop the enabling environment for this to happen. The economy has remained vulnerable to external shocks due to inability to hugely diversify revenue sources.\n\n\u201cNot surprisingly, the economy went into recession twice since 2015 owing in part to fall in crude oil prices and the forex challenge that came with the two cycles.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, there is no evidence to suggest that the bulk of the borrowing has gone into self-liquidating capital projects. A major cause of naira depreciation is the huge forex spent importing petroleum products in a period of rising crude oil prices. The huge cost of servicing external debt is also a drain on external reserves.\n\n\u201cThe lasting solution is to create multiple sources of forex via export diversification and to curtail demand through import substitution and patronizing locally made products\u201d, he stated.\n\nBut the Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Ita Enang, said at a recent Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria 2021 Fellow Conferment ceremony in Lagos, that Nigeria was adopting the best practices of sustainable debt management.\n\nAccording to him, the repayment plan of the debt is tied to the projects for which the loan is taken.\n\nThe presidential aide noted that \u201call the terms and conditions of the loans are laid before the National Assembly and approved in detail before execution.\n\n\u201cThis is to avoid the terms being approved by the National Assembly after the loan agreement must have been executed. A number of projects being and to be financed by the loans are either revenue generating or have the potential to generate revenue\u201d.\n\nThe above assertion notwithstanding, experts insist there is a need for Nigeria to build revenue to have more space to spend for infrastructure, social safety nets and others. This is to avoid interest on the loans eating up the bulk of the revenue.",
          "summary": "The figure, released by the Debt Management Office (DMO), includes local and external debt of the federal, state governments and the Federal Capital Territory.\nBetween July 2015 when President Muhammadu and December 2020, Nigeria\u2019s debt rose by approximately N20.8 trillion, according to the DMO.\nThe country\u2019s increasing debt profile is also reflected in the growing cost of debt servicing which has further depleted the nation\u2019s dwindling revenues in recent years.\nWithin the period of 66 months under review, the country spent N10.26 trillion on debt servicing.\nThe huge cost of servicing external debt is also a drain on external reserves.",

          "title": "COVID-19 2nd jab: Fear as first batch of AstraZeneca vaccine expires in few weeks",
          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nOn Tuesday, March 2, this year, Nigeria took delivery of four million doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine said to be the first batch of expected vaccines, preparatory to vaccination exercise in Nigeria.\n\nThis was after several \u201cdelays\u201d and shift in arrival date, perhaps due to failed logistics arrangements or other unforeseen circumstances that elongated the arrival of the vaccines.\n\nGAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), with the help UNICEF was said to had faciliated the procurement and shipping of the vaccine.\n\nOn Friday, March 5, the vaccination exercise was flagged off in Abuja. This was after the National Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) had certified the vaccine safe for use.\n\nA brief ceremony to herald the commencement of the exercise was held at the Trauma Centre, National Hospital, Abuja, with impressive representation of the officials of the Federal Government and other stakeholders.\n\nAt about 11:05 a.m, Dr. Cyprian Ngong, a family physician, Senior Registrar at National Hospital, Abuja, was administered the first dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria, marking the historic commencement of COVID-19 vaccination in Nigeria.\n\nExecutive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib, administered the vaccine to Dr. Ngong, who was deeply appreciated for giving his best professionally to COVID-19 patients at one of the isolation centres in Abuja.\n\nThereafter, vaccination began across the states. Several parameters were used to distribute the vaccines to states, and that include adequate maintenance of cold chain storage facilities, transportation of logistics to the ward/ health facility, adequate security during transportation and at vaccination sites, completion of training of health workers, efficient social mobilization activities in place, as well as adherence to protocol for vaccine deployment.\n\nData from the national call-in dash board domiciled at the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) indicated that as at June 6, when the administration of the first dose of vaccines ended, 1,966,128 million persons were vaccinated. Lagos State led with 313, 433 persons vaccinated. FCT, Kano and Kaduna states followed with 132,483; 95,963; 92,999 people vaccinated, respectively.\n\nData, however, obtained from the NPHCDA indicated that second dose of the vaccination begun immediately, after about four months.\n\nAs at June 6, data from NPHCDA vaccination dash board indicated that 336,501 had received their second jab.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s fear and anxiety on the ability of the vaccines reaching clients before its expiration.\n\nThere are indications that millions of doses of the vaccine in the first batch of consignment will expire in few weeks, precisely, June 28 and July 9, respectively.\n\nNPHCDA Executive Director, Dr. Faisal Shuaib, was quoted to have confirmed at the National media briefing of the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 recently that the AstraZeneca vaccine will expire soon\n\nHe said: \u201cThe batches of AstraZeneca we received some months ago have expiring dates of June and July, respectively. Howbeit, vaccination again is ongoing in all states of the federation. Our collaboration with health officials and other stakeholders at the national, state, and community levels in the vaccination exercise has yielded substantial results.\u201d\n\nHe also said there would be delay in the arrival of another consignment of the vaccines which may also affect and impact the remaining phases of the vaccination campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, a credible source at the PSC hinted that procurement of another batch of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is not in the plan of the Federal Government, rather the government is considering Johnson and Johnson (J&J) vaccine because of cost, storage facilities and other unique features.\n\nRecall that NAFDAC, few weeks ago, confirmed J&J COVID-19 vaccine safe for use in Nigeria, after a report by its vaccine committee confirmed that data on the vaccine were robust and met criteria for efficacy, safety and quality.\n\nNAFDAC boss, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, had noted that most commonly reported side effects of the J&J vaccine are pain at injection site, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and nausea, and most of the side effects are mild to moderate in severity and last for one to two days.\n\nShe said the data also showed that the vaccine\u2019s known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks thereby supporting the manufacturer\u2019s recommended use.\n\nShe confirmed that the J&J vaccine is administered as a single dose as against the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine that is administered twice to confirm its efficacy, adding that the results from a clinical trial involving people in the United States, South Africa and Latin American countries found that the vaccine was effective at preventing COVID-19 in people from 18 years of age.\n\nShe added: \u201cThe phase III clinical trial involved over 44,000 people. Half of them received a single dose of the vaccine and half were given placebo (a dummy injection). Many of them did not know if they were given J&J COVID-19 vaccine or placebo.\n\n\u201cThe trial found a 67 per cent reduction in the number of symptomatic COVID-19 cases after two weeks in people who received J&J COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d\n\nShe explained that J&J COVID-19 vaccine works by preparing the body to defend itself against COVID-19, and an unopened vaccine vials can be stored and/or transported frozen at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C for up to 24 months and three months when stored at 2 to 8\u00b0C.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Ngong, who was the first to take AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine said that he took the second dose of the vaccine after 10 weeks, and he had no reaction.",

          "title": "Legislature, Judiciary Paralysed in Nigeria, Says Afe Babalola",
          "text": "\u2022Explains N\u2019Assembly has power to give Nigeria a new constitution\n\n\u2022Posits an amendment includes substitution\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi and Victor Olakitan in Ado-Ekiti\n\nA renowned Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) and founder, Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti (ABUAD), Chief Afe Babalola, has said the current state of the nation presents a democracy with a paralysed legislature and judiciary, thus defeating the very essence of democracy as the most viable system of government.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with THISDAY, the legal luminary and businessman, who reckoned that Nigeria was yet to have an ideal democracy given that scenario, argued that the National Assembly has the power to give Nigeria a brand new constitution contrary to the position of NASS leadership. \u201cLet me say that it was totally wrong for the National Assembly to say they cannot produce or write a new constitution. Under the 1999 Constitution, the National Assembly can produce a new constitution. One, the 1999 Constitution gave the National Assembly the power to amend. In its broad interpretation, an amendment includes substitution.\n\nThey can exercise their powers and say the 1999 Constitution needs a substitution. They gave a narrow interpretation to the amendment clause. This same process was undertaken in Sudan and many other countries. All the National Assembly needed to do is to call for a conference where people will advise on where and how the 1999 constitution can be substituted. That is all.\u201d\n\nBabalola also spoke on the recent Twitter row with the federal government, and posited that President Muhammadu Buhari erred by his decision to suspend the operations of the microblogging giant in the country.\n\nAnswering to a question on the autonomy of the judiciary, which had prompted a strike by judicial workers for over two months, Babalola said, \u201cDemocracy thrives on three fundamentals pillars \u2013 the executive, legislature and judiciary. If a man with two legs has one of its legs cut off, will he be able to move freely?\n\n\u201cBut out of the three arms we have, two have been paralysed. I mean the legislature and judiciary. Do we now say we have a democracy? Where can people ventilate their anger? Do they want them to resort to self-help? There can be no fairness and justice, where the executive continues to pay those in the judiciary.\u201d\n\nSupporting his claims, the Ekiti-born lawyer, noted: \u201cI have been in the legal practice for 60 years or thereabouts. I knew how our courts were when I came back to the country from England in the early 60s. Then, we had lawyers from Ghana, West Indies and many other countries competing with us in the Nigerian courts. So, it was very competitive. In my 60 years of practice, however, Nigerian courts have never been shut for a day. Even in those days, lawyers and judges were respected.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget the aphorism that says he who pays the piper dictates the tune. Commonsense dictates that there should be independence for legislature and judiciary. If the car of a judge breaks down and he only relies on a president or governor to get it fixed, then, it will be difficult for him to pass a judgment that will be against the state.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the process of recruiting members of the Bench in Nigeria, he said,\n\n\u201cThat is critical. But we have not got it right. A practice, whereby people are asked to apply to become a judge, is affecting the system. The process cannot guarantee fairness and justice. After filing the application, the governor will now decide, who to pick among them. In those days, people did not need to apply to become judges.\n\n\u201cIt is the system itself that looks for qualified men of integrity to become judges. That is part of the rot in our system. I believe that the judiciary must not only be autonomous, but also the courts must be accessible and open to all. The president and governors, as high as they are, are equal before the courts. That is the beauty of it.\u201d\n\nOn the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria, Babalola said, \u201cI do not believe the president was right to have given the directive just because Twitter removed his post about the security in the Southeast. Don\u2019t forget that the English law we are operating presumes that you are innocent until the court proves otherwise.\n\n\u201cTwitter, like human beings, has the right to suspend Buhari\u2019s personal account in this context. The president cannot be a judge in his own case. If he felt wronged by what Twitter did, what he ought to have done is to approach the court of law, which has power of adjudication. He cannot jail Twitter for removing his comment. Only the court has such powers and not the president.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "June 12: Nigerians Stage Protests Nationwide",
          "text": "Our Correspondents\n\nNigerians yesterday staged protests and rallies around the country to mark the second anniversary of declaration June 12 as Democracy Day and protest the state of affairs in the country.\n\nAnd in what has been widely condemned as double standard, the Nigeria Police, yesterday, protected and permitted pro-President Muhammadu Buhari campaigners to hold a solidarity rally in Abuja without any form of harassment, while at the same time disrupting the rallies organised by anti-Buhari groups in many parts of the country, using teargas.\n\nA mega rally organised for the president by his supporters, who trooped to Unity Fountain in Maitama, Abuja, to celebrate Democracy Day, was populated by dozens of youths drawn from the Youth Coalition for Development (YCD). They closed a section of the Shehu Shagari Road to traffic.\n\nInterestingly, there was heavy security in place, including a helicopter, which hovered above to protect those at the rally convened by Aminu Aminu.\n\nThat was in stark contrast to the riotous atmosphere at the Gudu area of Abuja, where activists, led by Omoyele Sowore, who were opposed to the Buhari administration, clashed with policemen who were sent to disperse them with teargas. The police also dispersed anti-Buhari marchers in other parts of the country, like Lagos, Port Harcourt, and Abeokuta,\n\nBut the Federal Capital Territory Police Command justified its decision to disperse the anti-government protesters.\n\nMany of those who showed up for the solidarity procession for the president were clad in branded white T-shirts with the inscription, \u201cI Stand With Buhari, How about You?\u201d boldly on the shirts. They also held placards bearing messages, like \u201c#IStandwithBuhari\u201d, \u201cWe are Indivisible\u201d, \u201cWe stay as one, We are Nigeria!\u201d\n\nOne of the president\u2019s supporters also carried a declarative message that read: \u201cProtest is only about getting your voice heard not a means of changing the government\u201d.\n\nSpeaking with reporters at the rally, the organiser said the solidarity march was put together in recognition of the efforts of many people, who campaigned and laboured to institute a culture of democracy in the country since 1993. He lauded Buhari for recognising the importance of the day.\n\nAminu said, \u201cJune 12 is a watershed in the annals of Nigeria\u2019s democratic history. It is a day to celebrate the beginning of a consistent and ideological struggle that eventually gave birth to a foundation for the democratic renaissance Nigeria is now building.\u201d\n\nBut, earlier, the police teargased a group protesting at the Gudu area of the Federal Capital Territory. Sowore, the Publisher of Sahara Reporters, led the protesters comprising many youths and middle-aged persons. They said they were gathered to protest against the prevailing insecurity in the country.\n\nThe anti-Buhari rally began about 8.30am and was peaceful until the police stormed the area and started firing teargas to disperse the rally. The Gudu road was also cordoned off while traffic flow was disrupted as a result.\n\nThe development forced the protesters, who carried placards bearing inscriptions, such as \u201cBuhari must go\u201d, \u201cSay no to injustice\u201d, \u201c33.3% Unemployment Rate is Criminal\u201d, \u201d Digital Right is Human Right\u201d, to scamper to safety.\n\nThe FCT Police Public Relations Officer, Yusuf Mariam, in a statement said policemen had to disperse the protesters to prevent members of the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria and others from \u201cinciting public disturbance.\u201d Mariam added that calm had been restored around the axis and said nobody was arrested.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u201cFCT Police foils attempt to incite public disturbance, disperse members of the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria and others\u201d, Mariam stated, \u201cThe FCT Police Command on Saturday, June 12, 2021, successfully restored calm at Apo-Gudu axis after professionally dispersing a protest by some members of the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria \u2013 Shiites and others targeted at inciting public disturbance and breaching public peace.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the action of the command was necessitated by the concerns of some agitated residents. However, no arrest was made.\n\n\u201cIn view of the above, the command wishes to state that it is committed to ensuring that FCT residents enjoy a hitch-free Democracy Day celebration and will not hesitate to bring to book every person or entity that attempts to breach the peace or cause a breakdown of law and order in the Federal Capital Territory.\n\n\u201cThe command implores residents to remain calm and law-abiding while reaffirming its unwavering commitment to the protection of lives and property within the FCT.\u201d\n\nIn Yola, the Adamawa State capital, residents staged a protest and demanded a revolution to change the present leadership of Buhari, citing incompetence in handing the country\u2019s affairs. The protesters, who came under the banner of #Buharimustgo, defied a heavy rainfall and continued their protest for about three hours, demanding good governance and a leader who would pull Nigeria out of its numerous challenges. They also called on Buhairi to relinquish power, brandishing banners of #revolutionnow, which asked Buhari to quit immediately.\n\nSporting black T-shirts marked with inscriptions, such as \u201cBuhari Must Go\u201d, the protesters chanted, \u201cFreedom comes by struggle\u201d and maintained, \u201cwe must come together to salvage our nation\u201d.\n\nLeader of the group, Tony Sudan Gompwel, told journalists that Buhari and other political leaders had failed the country.\n\nGompwel stated, \u201cThe kind of political leaders we have in our nation cannot give us the desired change.\u201d He said bad leadership was the reason the country was bedevilled by insecurity and economic backwardness.\n\n\u201cThey are hardened, they are tyrants, they are bankrupt of ideas. That\u2019s why great Nigerian youths are converging all over the nation to demand that they should leave the stage,\u201d he maintained.\n\nHowever, while the protest against the Buhari administration subsisted, his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Adamawa State read out Buhari\u2019s scorecard to residents to mark the second year of designating June 12 as Democracy Day.\n\nSecretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, who was represented by Honourable Abdulrazask Namdas, commended the Buhari administration. Namdas, a member representing Jada, Ganye, Toungo and Mayobelwa Federal Constituency at the National Assembly, said the celebration was also to intimate the citizens of the performance of the APC in the state.\n\nAt the event held at Muna Hotel, Yola, to mark the June 12 celebration, the scorecards of all serving senators and House of Representatives members from the state, and that of Buhari, were read out.\n\nAdamawa State Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri praised the courage and desire of the citizenry to allow democracy thrive after two decades of uninterrupted process.\n\nFintiri, in a press release by his Press Secretary, Mr. Humwashi Wonosikou, commended the electorate for trusting him with their mandate.\n\nThe governor said in the release, \u201cWe will continue to ensure we keep to our promise \u2013 a government that is a progressive instrument of the common good, rooted in our values of opportunity, responsibility, determined to give our people the tools they need to make the most of their lives in a difficult period made worse by the dwindling economic hardship.\n\n\u201cOur desire to strengthen democracy and give it its true meaning informed the investment we are making in the social reengineering of the state through the provision of infrastructure and human capital development needed to unlock the growth and development of the Adamawa of our dream. The projects spread across the state represent the value and meaning of Democracy Day.\u201d\n\nIn Lagos, it was quiet in most parts of the state even though there were reports of skirmishes between protesters and men of the Nigerian Police at the Gani Fawehinmi Park at Ojota.\n\nAt the Mile Two area of the state also, there were reports of violent confrontations, which were promptly quelled by security operatives.\n\nHowever, all was peaceful in known flashpoints in the state, like Oshodi, Ojodu-Berger, Ojuelegba, Fagba, and Ketu, as many residents celebrated the June 12 Democracy Day in their homes.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that although the protesters at Gani Fawehinmi Park were peaceful initially, it was the attempt by the police to forcibly disperse them from the venue that resulted in a face-off, leading to the use of teargas by the police. There were no reports of casualties or injuries.\n\nThere were no reports of breakdown of law and order in any other part of the state, even though many businesses were closed.\n\nIn Iju, Agege, Ojodu, Ikeja, Abule Egba, and Ogba areas, many people were indoors as commercial buses also stayed off roads.\n\nTHISDAY checks revealed that security was normal in most of these places, as no policemen and other security agents were noticed on the streets, and traffic was light.\n\nSpeaking on the conduct of the police, human rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana, SAN, said even though he had to go and effect the release of some youths arrested by the police, he was glad that there were no reports of killings. He said the situation was remarkably better than the previous months.\n\nFalana alleged that last year, the Nigeria Police had no canister of teargas to quell protests, hence their resort to the use of live bullets, as happened during the #EndSARS protest.\n\nFalana, who spoke at the 25th Anti-Corruption Situation Room organised by the Heda Resources Centre, disclosed that it was the lack of the teargas canisters that led to the killing of 99 persons during the October 2020 protest.\n\nIn Edo State, protesters called on the federal government to deliver good governance and adequate security, stating that the ineptitude of Buhari has brought Nigeria to its knees. The protesters, who began their match at King Square (Ring Road), Benin City, were provided security by the police, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, and the state vigilante group. They accompanied the protesters to the Government House, where the Deputy Governor, Comrade Philip Shaibu, received them.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of about seven groups of protesters and civil society organisations, Marxist Kola Edokpayi of the Talakawa Assembly, lamented that the nonchalant attitude of the president towards security of life and property had brought the country to its present unacceptable situation.\n\nEdokpayi said, \u201cThe ineptitude of President Buhari has brought us to this sorry state. His nonchalant attitude has caused a lot of security problems. It has been difficult to combat Boko Haram, banditry and kidnapping. Nigerians now live in fear and nobody knows what will happen next.\n\n\u201cWhat we now hear is \u2018unknown gunmen\u2019 who are killing people in the South-east, while other parts of the country are becoming unsafe to live in because of insecurity. The prices of goods and services are moving up daily beyond the reach of the common man.\u201d\n\nResponding, the deputy governor commended the protesters for conducting themselves peacefully and promised that all their grievances would be channelled to the right quarters.\n\nShaibu used the opportunity to speak on some political issues in the state. He said of the 14 state lawmakers whose seats were declared vacant, \u201cWe did everything possible to have them in the House but they decided to follow a godfather, who misled them. Even with a month until their seats would be declared vacant, we urged them to join the assembly but they were asking for a second proclamation.\n\n\u201cThey also went to court and that had stopped the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from conducting a fresh election. The INEC has said no new election can be conducted until the cases are decided. So, we have to wait for the courts before the next move can be made.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, governors and prominent Nigerians across the country, yesterday, spoke on the second anniversary of June 12 as Democracy Day, focusing on the swirling frustrations in different parts of the country.\n\nKWARA\n\nGovernor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara State says the country has made progress despite its current challenges, which include the challenges of nation building, population bulge, and insecurity. In a statement issued in Ilorin on Saturday by his Chief Press Secretary, Rafiu Ajakaye, to commemorate June 12, the governor said, \u201cI felicitate with Kwarans, and, indeed, all Nigerians, on this day of June 12, which has come to symbolise the struggle of our people for human rights, participatory democracy, and development.\n\n\u201cWhatever the challenges of nation-building confronting our fatherland, the truth is that we are pacing ahead in all indices of development while institutions of democracy are growing stronger and getting more mature.\u201d\n\nGOMBE\n\nThe Gombe State governor, Alhaji Inuwa Yahaya, yesterday, praised Nigerians for resolving to maintain democracy as the means of governance, saying 22 years of interrupted democratic rule has proven naysayers wrong. Yahaya said Nigeria\u2019s \u201cdemocratic maturity has shattered the myths about African democracy being under the grip of one single leader or political party.\u201d\n\nHe noted that as the largest country in Africa, Nigeria would continue to hold the torch of nation building, democratic pluralism, and political stability in Africa and the world at large.\n\n\u201cAfter 22 years of uninterrupted democracy, I make bold to say Nigeria\u2019s democracy has come of age. We have witnessed successful transitions of power from one administration to the next, and from one political party to another,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nBAUCHI\n\nBauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed, saluted the courage and patriotism of all democrats \u2013 dead or alive \u2013 who strived to ensure that democracy was well grounded in the country.\n\nIn a goodwill message, the governor said, \u201cWe laboured together to arrive where we are today and we shall continue to march the state forward to greatness with determination and sincerity of purpose with your support and prayers.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who explained that his two-year journey in power had not been a bed of roses, added, \u201cBut with determination and the support enjoyed from the good people of the state, we were able to pilot the affairs of government to a sound socio-political pedestal.\u201d\n\nEKITI\n\nEkiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, urged Nigerians to be more determined in ensuring that democracy worked in the country. Fayemi said despite its imperfections, democracy remained the best option for the country, adding that through the determination of the citizens and their active participation in the democratic process, Nigerians can achieve a truly great country of their dream.\n\nHe urged Nigerians not to relent in their search for lasting peace as a necessary condition for progress and prosperity.\n\nThe governor saluted the heroic deeds of patriots, who worked assiduously to actualise democratic rule in the country, especially, the symbol of the June 12 struggle, the late Chief Moshood Abiola, saying only a truly great, peaceful and prosperous Nigeria can be a befitting compensation for their sacrifices\n\n\u201cWe may not have reached the promised land, but we have left Egypt. We may not have attained the best, but we surely have made some progress as a nation,\u201d Fayemi said.\n\nABIOLA\u2019S DAUGHTER\n\nHafsat Abiola-Costello, one of the daughters of the presumed winner of the June 12 1993 presidential election, Chief Moshood Abiola, said her family would not forget the role played by the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, in ensuring that their late patriarch was immortalised for his contribution to democracy. Abiola-Costello also praised the minister for his role in the renaming of Kudirat Abiola Road, in memory of her mother, who was brutally murdered during her struggles to regain the stolen mandate of her husband.\n\nShe said long before President Muhammadu Buhari came in as president, Aregbesola, who was then governor of Osun State, had embarked on a one-man campaign to press for recognition of Abiola as winner of the 1993 election and, indeed, to be recognised as a former president.\n\nOGUN\n\nOgun State Governor Dapo Abiodun said the best way for Nigerians to immortalise and celebrate the acclaimed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, the late Chief MKO Abiola, and June 12, was to build bridges and demolish sectarian fences. Abiodun stated this on Saturday in his speech at the 2021 Democracy Day celebration, held at the MKO Abiola International Stadium, Kuto, Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.\n\nThe governor, who said Nigerians could not afford to bring down the country or despair in its future, noted that the supreme price paid by the Abiola and his mandate should serve as a reminder that Nigerians were stronger together as a nation.\n\n\u201cUntil Nigerians embrace the essence of the MKO persona, internalise belief in self, faith in a united country and other initiatives that help to engender a sense of shared heritage amongst Nigerian people, we will continue to be a country in search of nationhood,\u201d he said.\n\nAbiodun urged Nigerians to push all the negative and divisive forces and policies on the back-foot and embrace the symbolism of June 12, saying, \u201cLet us join hands to make Nigeria work for all Nigerians. June 12 represents what will strengthen the country\u2019s unity, indivisibility and oneness.\u201d He added that such unity would end all quests for self-determination and other sectarian agitations, as well as calm frayed nerves.\n\nBAYELSA\n\nBayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, expressed his administration\u2019s determination to change the development narrative of the state. Diri spoke on Saturday at Government House, Yenagoa, during his maiden media chat that was broadcast live on all Yenagoa-based radio stations.\n\nThe media interaction was part of activities to commemorate this year\u2019s Democracy Day.\n\nThe governor, in a press statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Daniel Alabrah, said democracy was about the people and Nigeria had come a long way with 22 years of uninterrupted civil rule, which he said had not been smooth but worth celebrating.\n\nHe noted that the urban renewal programme and other projects and policies of his administration were part of the drive to give the state a new look and make it more attractive to investors.\n\nDiri said the state had a lot of tourism potential and the government was open to discussion and ready to sign memorandum of understanding with partners to develop projects in the sector.\n\nOn the federal government\u2019s infrastructure development refund to the state, the governor clarified that the actual amount it received was N27.5 billion and not N38.4 billion, as being speculated in some quarters.\n\nHe explained that though the total refund due the state was N38.4 billion, according to the federal government, its release would not be possible in the next four years. He said the state was offered a second option of a discounted amount of N27.5 billion through the Debt Management Office, which it got last December.\n\nResponding to a question on President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s recent directive to revive cattle grazing routes across the country, Diri said there were no such routes in the state. He explained that although he was not countering the federal government\u2019s decision to resuscitate grazing routes, his administration had put in place a legal framework to ban open grazing and movement of cattle on foot.\n\nThe Bayelsa governor also emphasised that the southern governors had adopted the same position on the issue as part of measures to check farmers/herders clashes across the country.\n\nDiri maintained that his government could not afford to expose its citizenry to the looming danger.\n\nKADUNA CAN\n\nChairman of the Kaduna State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Joseph Hayab, said June 12 could not be celebrated as Democracy Day because Nigerian leaders were not democratic. Hayab said Nigerians could not be governed by intimidation and still celebrate June 12 as Democracy Day.\n\nIn an interview with THISDAY on Saturday, Hayab said in a true democracy, there was rule of law and freedom of speech.\n\nAccording to him, June 12 is merely a date set aside by the government, though there is no evidence of democracy worth celebrating.\n\nHayab stated, \u201cWe are simply celebrating a date set aside by the government but there is no evidence of democracy worth celebrating. The spirit behind June 12 is supposed to make our current leaders truly democratic but what we see is governance by intimidation and creating fear in the minds of citizens.\n\n\u201cA true sign of democracy is the freedom citizens enjoy and respect for the rule of law, which is visibly absent in the way we have been governed in this country. I wish the government should have remembered that in a few days or in the second week of June. We will have this day to be reminded to celebrate before announcing the ban on Twitter and many uncomplimentary comments about other regions by the president.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom said he was not against Buhari as a person but often disagreed with him on the constitutionality of issues and policy. Ortom said those who insinuated that his disagreement with the president was bone out of hatred were wrong. He stated that the attack on him would not force his administration to repeal the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law in the state.\n\nThe governor declared that anyone who thought the state government would be intimidated to repeal the law was making a great mistake. He said his administration was trying to amend the law to increase the penalties against anyone who flouted it.\n\nSpeaking yesterday at the Banquet Hall of Government House, Makurdi, while giving his midterm scorecard as part of activities marking this year\u2019s Democracy Day, Ortom said, \u201cI have always prayed and supported the president but when it comes to issues of fairness and illegality, I will disagree.\n\n\u201cThe law on ranching has come to stay and no amount of intimidation can make us to repeal it. Instead, we will soon amend the law in order to increase the penalties against offenders.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who listed his administration\u2019s achievements in the areas of education, agriculture, infrastructure, and health, among others, lamented the humanitarian situation caused by the continued attacks by armed herdsmen, bandits and other criminals in Benue communities.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe security threat from armed herdsmen, bandits and other criminals in our communities has resulted in wanton killings and the displacement of people in large numbers across the state.\n\n\u201cToday, Benue State has over one million IDPs with many of them living in the camps we have set up and others staying with their relations. The situation has created an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in the state.\u201d\n\nHe said despite the huge sums of money his administration had been spending to cater for the Internally displaced persons, resources were always inadequate because the number of IDPs increased daily.\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cMy desire is to ensure that the IDPs return to their ancestral homes. Most of them are farmers, and the longer they stay in the camps, the more food production is affected. We hope that the federal government will also fulfil its promise to assist Benue and other states in the North-central, which have been badly affected by the attacks to resettle the victims.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that many of his colleagues had been coming around to encourage him on his stand to hold the presidency accountable over insecurity in the country but were too afraid to talk.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Adeniyi of the High Court of Justice, Abuja Division, seeking among others, the nullification of the March Congresses (1st defendant, PDP) to the extant list of already inaugurated party officers and delegates that emerged \u201cfrom the Anambra PDP congress conducted on 28 November, 2017 and 1st December, 2017, validated by the Senator Grace Bent Ward Congress Appeal Panel Report under the supervision of Sir Chukwudi Umeaba as acting chairman, State Caretaker Committee.\u201d\n\nIn the suit with reference numbered HC/CV/774/2021, Anyakorah, on behalf of himself and all local government chairmen and ward executives, who emerged from the 28th November 2017 and 1st December 2017, by way of originating summons, sought a declaration that by virtue of Article 2 of the Constitution of the PDP (amended in 2017), \u201cthe said constitution is supreme,\u201d arguing that it has \u201ca binding force on all members and organs of the PDP and that any action or step taken contrary to the relevant provisions of the constitution is unlawful, illegal, null and void and of no effect whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff also argued that it was unlawful for the PDP, \u201cwhether during its Southeast Zonal Congress of 6th March 2021, or at any other time, to adopt or publish the name of a state chairman, alongside persons purporting to be EXCO members, local government chairmen and national delegates without recourse to the officers and delegates that emerged in 2017.\n\nHe further sought an order nullifying or setting aside all Congresses, designations or appointment made by the PDP with respect to the state chairman for PDP in Anambra State, EXCO members, local government chairmen and national delegates amongst others.\n\nThis is as the plaintiff further prayed the court for an order of perpetual injunction restraining the PDP, its allies or cronies from further recognising or dealing with persons names on pages 14, 15 and 16 of the Bronchure for the South-East Zonal Congress of 6th March, 2021, \u201ceither as state Chairman, EXCO members, local government area chairmen or national delegates of PDP, Anambra State chapter.\n\nIn its judgment of June 9, 2021, the court upheld the prayer of the plaintiff, citing Article 2 of the PDP constitution,\n\nAccording to Justice Adeniyi, after listening to the claimant, Anyakora, local government chairmenand ward executives that emerged from the Anambra PDP Congresses conducted on November 28 2017 under the supervision of the chairman state caretaker committee said, \u201cI find merit in the Claimant\u2019s case and the same hereby succeeds. For avoidance of doubts and abundance of clarity, it is hereby adjudged as follows:\n\n\u201cIt is hereby declared that by virtue of Article 2 of the Constitution of the Peoples Democratic Party (amended in 2017), the said Constitution is supreme and it has a binding force on all members and organs of the Peoples Democratic Party, and any action or step taken contrary to the relevant provisions of the Constitution is unlawful, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever.\n\n\u201cIt is hereby further declared that it is unlawful for the 1 Defendant, (PDP) whether during its Southeast Zonal Congress of 6th March, 2021, or at any time to adopt or publish the name of a State Chairman, alongside persons purporting to be his Exco members, Local Government Chairmen and National Delegates, without recourse to the extant List of already inaugurated Party Officers and Delegated that emerged from the Anambra PDP Congresses conducted on 28th November, 2017 and 1 December, 2017 validated by the Senator Grace Bent Ward Congress Appeal Panel or and Barrister Ukpai Ukairo Local Covernment Appeal Panel Report, under the supervision of Sir Chukwudi Umeaba, as Acting Chairman, State Caretaker Committee.\n\n\u201cIt is hereby further declared that the arbitrary imposition by the 1st Defendant on its members of a State Chairman, Exco members, Local Government Chairmen and National Delegates, as contained atPages 14. 15 & 16 of the Defendant\u2019s Brochure for the Southeast Zonal Congress of 6th March, 2021, in ultra vires its power, unlawful, invalid, void and of no effcet whatsoever\u201d, Justice Adebiyi declared.\n\nIn view of this, Justice Adebiyi further ordered that, \u201cAll Congresses, designations or appointments made by the 1st Defendant with respect to the positions of the State Chairman of PDP Anambra State Chapter, Exco Members and Local Government Chairmen, as contained at Pages 14, 15 & 16 of the Southeast Zonal Congress Brochure of 6th March, 2021, are hereby nullified and set aside for being invalid, unlawful and ultra vires the powers of the 1st Defendant, the same not being in alignment with the List of already inaugurated Party Officers and Delegates that emerged from the Anambra PDP Congresses conducted on 28th November, 2017 and 1st December, 2017, valided by the Senator Grace Bent Ward Congress Appeal Panel Report and Barrister Ukpai Ukairo Local Government Appeal Panel Report, under the supervision of Sir Chukwudi Umeaba, as State Caretaker Committee. Acting Chairman.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, Justice Adebiyi said the \u201cfirst defendant is hereby ordered and compelled that during the conduct of all elections in Anambra State, to henceforth adopt, employ, recognise and use only the list of already inaugurated Party Officers and Delegates that emerged from the Anambra PDP Congresses conducted on 28th November, 2017 and 1st December, 2017 validated by the Senator Grace Bent Ward Congress Appeal Panel Report and Barrister Ukpai Ukairo Local Government Appeal Panel Report, under the supervision of Sir Chukwudi Umeaba, who shall continue to act in the capacities for which they were duly elected.\n\n\u201cAn Order of injunction is hereby issued, restraining the 1st Defendant, whether by itself, cronies, allies or representatives, from further recognising, dealing with or parading any person or group of persons listed at pages 14, 15 & 16 of the Brochure for the Southeast Zonal Congress of 6th March 2021, either as State Chairman, Exco members or Local Government Area Chairmen of the Peoples Democratic Party, Anambra State Chapter, except the list of already inaugurated Party Officers and Delegates that emerged from the Anambra PDP Congresses conducted on 28th November, 2017 and 1st December, 2017 the Senator Grace Bent Ward Congress Appeal Panel Report and Barrister Ukpai Ukairo Local Government Appeal Panel Report, under the supervision of Sir Chukwudi Umeaba.\u201d\n\nHe contended that all parties shall bear their respective costs of the action.\n\nThe implication of this is that unless the party succeeds at the appellate court, if it chooses to challenge the ruling of the lower court, it may find itself fielding parallel delegates in the November 6 election, which may call for the replication of the Zamfara scenario, which cost the All Progressives Congress, the North Western state in 2019.\n\nHow the Uche Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC) handles this slippery judicial rulingwill determine the fate of the party in Anambra, a state it governed for some years before losing out to the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA).\n\nHowever, Umeaba, at a press conference yesterday told journalists that: \u201cBased on the above (his reinstatement), I, Hon Chukwudi Umeaba, the acting chairman caretaker committee of PDP, Anambra State, working in concert with the terms of reference and the powers of my office will make pronouncements.\n\n\u201cI hereby suspend the ward congress of 9th June to elect a three-man Adhoc committee for the governorship primary. I will contact the NEC of our great party to give me a new date for the ward congresses that will elect the three-man ad hoc committee for the governorship primary.\u201d\n\nHe urged the party members to keep calm and look forward to new developments as his leadership was out to ensure growth of the party in the state. He insisted that the primary election would go on as planned, and would not be truncated by the change in leadership.\n\nMeanwhile, the emergence of a new chairman of the party in the state has polarised the party, leaving many of its members switching camp to the faction of the new leadership.\n\nA chieftain of the party, Mr Samuel Anyakorah, who was at the press conference described the Umeaba-led party as the authentic leadership of the party, having been unjustly removed in 2017.\n\n\u201cI was the one who dragged the party to court, because of that unjust act. We wrote to the then national vice chairman of South east, Mr Austin Umahi and even to His Excellency, Uche Secondus, but they ignored us.\n\n\u201cThat was why we went to court, and thank God today, the authentic leadership of the party has been restored. You can see how happy everybody is. We hope that the party will move on now.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Christopher Isiguzo and Gideon Arinze in Enugu\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said the Nigerian government cannot afford the amount of funding needed to revive the country\u2019s educational system. Buhari also said the competition for funds had become keener because of the recent increase in the number of tertiary institutions in Nigeria.\n\nThe president spoke on Saturday at the 49th convocation ceremony of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. He said the financial situation had been worsened by the global economic downturn, which also affected the national revenue.\n\nBuhari, who was represented at the ceremony by the Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, however, said his administration was committed to addressing the needs of tertiary institutions through budgetary allocations to the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND).\n\n\u201cI am optimistic that the on-going drive to diversify the national economy will provide the government with additional resources to improve funding for the education system,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president said the universities should also leverage other funding sources, such as from alumni, friends, the private sector, institutional linkages, and research grants, to attract additional revenue for infrastructure, research, and development.\n\n\u201cWe must also address the problems of poor work ethics and the albatross of prolonged and recurrent industrial actions by staff of universities,\u201d the president stated.\n\nBuhari advised academic institutions across the country to embark on the kind of innovative research that could help boost production and diversify the economy.\n\n\u201cOur universities must continue to emphasise training in entrepreneurship so school leavers and graduates are able to become job creators instead of perennial job seekers,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, said the government should make effort to address the perennial challenge of poverty and inequality in the country or risk losing the youth to crime. Amaechi, who delivered the 49th convocation lecture of the university, stated that the series of protests held across the country of late, such as #ENDSARS, were as a result of increasing poverty and disaffection on the part of the citizens.\n\n\u201cAlthough, the current administration has introduced a number of programmes to help eradicate poverty, such as Transport Track for individuals who were into the transportation business, several Nigerians are yet to be lifted out of poverty,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe stated that policies should be focused on the rural majority, and targeted at giving the citizens a good life and lifting them out of poverty.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Soldiers of 14 Brigade, Army Headquarters have invaded Ohafia in Ohafia Local Government, Abia State, searching for a soldier allegedly shot by gunmen suspected to be members of the Eastern Security Network.\n\nIn a report by Daily Trust, this has caused an exodus of residents and indigenes of Elu, Amangwu, Ebem and Amaekpu, Ohafia LGA from their respective communities to neighbouring villages.\n\nFile photo used to illustrate story.\n\nA source said, \u201cWe learnt that some boys believed to be members of the Eastern Security Network came to the popular Ebem motor park and started shooting and later left.\n\n\u201cSoldiers from 14 Brigade Ohafia, whose command headquarters is located in the area, later came and went after them.\n\n\u201cWe learnt that the unknown gunmen shot a soldier with a double-barrel gun but not dead; he\u2019s currently at Federal Medical Center Umuahia, currently receiving medical attention. Since that time, there have been sporadic gunshots from all corners.\u201d\n\nA civil servant from the area said the residents had suffered all manners of intimidation from soldiers, adding that marriages billed to occur in the community at the weekend had been shifted.\n\nHe also stated that many houses in the Amangwu Ohafia community were burnt. The soldiers had claimed that members of the ESN were using the houses as their hideout.\n\n\u201cWe have suffered all manner of intimidation from soldiers. Some of our relatives have relocated to Uzuakoli, Umuahia, Aba, and anywhere they think that is safer for them. We are in the village but soldiers determine our right to movement.\n\n\u201cMarriages ceremonies billed to take place any time soon have been shifted indefinitely. We learnt that at Elu, soldiers went to the market and started pursuing people.\n\n\u201cA lot of houses have been burnt at Amangwu Ohafia community. They said that members of ESN were using the houses as their hideout, which I can\u2019t validate. You need to call anyone from Amangwu to validate such claims. But what I can tell you right now is that Ohafia is on fire,\u201d he said.\n\nAn indigene of Amangwu Ohafia, who spoke from his hideout, confirmed the invasion of his community by soldiers of 14 Brigade, Ohafia, with the claim that members of ESN that shot their personnel were hiding in the Amangwu community.\n\nThe source, who disclosed that they later started hearing heavy gunfire in their village in the early hours of Saturday, confirmed the burning of people\u2019s houses, arrest and indiscriminate harassment of indigenes of their community by the soldiers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the actual number. Some persons said six soldiers were killed; others said four and some ESN members were killed in the heavy gunfire. But the truth is that the Amangwu community, including Elu, Ebem and Amaepku, are all on fire.\n\n\u201cWhile we were running away from our community just like other persons, we saw a detachment of soldiers heading towards Ohafia from Umuahia end. We don\u2019t know the fate of our people in the village. Their phone numbers are not connecting. It is feared that they have been either arrested by soldiers or other security agents in the state.",

          "text": "Seven months after taking up an initial 20% stake in BetKing, South African pay TV operator MultiChoice plans to increase its shareholding in the online gambling company to 49% in a $281.5 million deal.\n\nBetKing is the trading name of Blue Lake Ventures Limited, a pan-African sports betting and entertainment business with major operations in Nigeria. The value of MultiChoice\u2019s initial investment in BetKing was said to be worth more than $100 million.\n\nThe decision to double down on the gambling company, approved by the MultiChoice board on Thursday, is in line with the company\u2019s strategy to expand its entertainment ecosystem and develop meaningful drivers of future value, a statement from the South African entertainment giant reads.\n\n\u201cConsumers have a growing abundance of entertainment options available to them. It is therefore important for MultiChoice to maintain its relevance and grow its share of engagement time and consumer spend by expanding its entertainment platform with a more comprehensive offering and a greater number of products and services,\u201d the company said, explaining the rationale behind its increased investment in BetKing.\n\nAccording to MultiChoice, pursuing an adjacency such as sports betting creates a \u201cnatural extension\u201d to its video entertainment platform to further enhance its product offerings. In other words, sport betting augments the company\u2019s business given sports is a major revenue source.\n\nWidely known as one of the leading sports betting sites in Nigeria, BetKing was founded by CEO Byron Petzer and Adekunle Adeniji, who once served as Bet9ja\u2019s virtual product manager.\n\nBetKing\u2019s annual statement for the financial year ended December 2020 shows a growth in revenue to $77.9 million, from $54.7 million in the previous year. Meanwhile, net asset value stood at $100.2 million.\n\nIt is thus not hard to see the appeal in investing in the major sports betting company also considering that the market is growing significantly globally. Between 2020 and 2024, the industry is expected to grow by more than $134 billion, a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 10%, according to Technavio.\n\nSeveral sports betting companies currently operate in this part of the world too. In Nigeria, some popular names apart from BetKing include Bet9ja, Nairabet, Naijabet, Sporting Bet, Surebet24, etc.\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that an estimated 60 million Nigerians between the ages of 18 and 40 were involved in active sports betting. Also, almost \u20a62 billion was spent on sports betting daily in Nigeria, equivalent to nearly \u20a6730 billion in a year. Yet, Africa accounts for only 2% of global sports betting revenue. As the regional market begins to play catch up, it is poised for significant growth.",

          "text": "With decentralised digital currencies like bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, the world\u2019s central banks have \u2013 in the past two years at least \u2013 been working towards developing government-backed digital currencies.\n\nNigeria may pilot an official digital currency in 2021, going by the words of Rakiyat Mohammed, a Central Bank Director in charge of the Information Technology Department, who revealed on Thursday that the banking regulator will soon launch a digital currency.\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) represents a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. As against printing money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government, unlike existing cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria has made \u201ctremendous progress\u201d exploring the technology for digital currency for over two years now, Mohammed revealed at a press briefing after a meeting of the Bankers\u2019 Committee. \u201cBefore the end of the year, the Central Bank will be making a special announcement and possibly launching a pilot scheme in order to be able to provide this kind of currency to its populace.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes on the back of efforts by Nigerian authorities targeted at regulating the use of decentralised cryptocurrencies in the country. The apex bank in February directed all local banks to close accounts linked to crypto platforms.\n\nDespite the clampdown, Nigerians continue to use digital currencies as a store of value and remittance tool and in a change of tone, the CBN governor later clarified that crypto trading is not banned in the country.\n\nWhy would the CBN get into virtual currencies?\n\nAccording to the CBN director, about 80% of central banks in the world are currently exploring the possibility of issuing central bank digital currency and Nigeria could not be left behind.\n\nChina in April 2020 became the first major economy to pilot a digital currency and is working towards achieving a wide, domestic use of the digital yuan by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nLast year, the Bahamas launched the world\u2019s first central bank digital currency. Other countries where national digital currency trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden and South Korea and in Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Ghana, Morocco and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nBeyond just following the global trend, there are lots of potential reasons for the planned rollout of an official digital currency in Nigeria later this year.\n\nThe CBN director particularly cited the need to make remittances travel easier from abroad to Nigeria as one motivation. \u201cWe all know how money has to travel for someone to send money from Nigeria to abroad and it is a huge money in Africa,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nWhen it eventually becomes operational, the digital currency will complement the existing forms of currency in the country and could help reduce the high cost of managing and transferring cash.\n\nDigital currency could also boost financial inclusion as those unbanked can get easier and safer access to money through their phone. A recent report by the Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFiNA) shows that Nigeria did not meet its financial inclusion targets for 2020 and at the current rate, they might not be achieved anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWe know that the recent report by EFiNA was that our target was to achieve 80% financial inclusion. We are about 60% and at the rate at which we are going, we are not going to meet this target,\u201d Mohammed said, adding that the Central Bank digital currency could \u201caccelerate\u201d the CBN\u2019s ability to meet this target.\n\nAfter the announcement, the apex bank will now explore technological options and engage various industry players, as well as move to the next stage of proof of concept to pilot the scheme, according to the CBN director.",

          "title": "What is a VPN and how does it work in Nigeria?",
          "text": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN) are all the rage right now in Nigeria since the government banned Twitter. The rise in popularity of VPNs has brought up questions about how exactly they work.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about how VPNs work.\n\nOn the internet, different computers send and receive information between Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Think of it as sending items between two or more physical addresses. When we surf the internet with our IP address, different websites will know specific information about us such as our location, device type, browser and operating system.\n\nWhat does a VPN do?\n\nWith VPNs, our IP addresses change and online activities are hidden.\n\nBefore turning on my VPN, my device was in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nAfter turning on my VPN, my device is in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n\nThe images above show how my location changed from Nigeria to Dominican Republic after turning on my VPN.\n\nThink about it this way: The internet is like a highway that connects different cities across different countries. These highways are mostly public roads that many people use. If you drive on a public road anyone can follow you and track where you go, how long you spend at your destination, and when you return. They might even be able to spy inside your car and learn more about you.\n\nWith a VPN, you have your own private tunnel/road. A tunnel where no one can see what you\u2019re doing or where you\u2019re going.\n\nWhat can a VPN do for you?\n\nNo monitoring: As we mentioned earlier, your internet service provider (ISP) can see your internet traffic and probably log your browsing history. With a VPN, information about your activities online are scrambled in an encrypted tunnel so that external parties, your ISP included, can\u2019t read it.\n\nAccess any site: Every now and then, websites or services you want to use may be inaccessible from your location. VPN enables access to these sites or services from anywhere. If a website isn\u2019t available to devices located in Nigeria, VPNs can change your device location to a different country which has access to this website.\n\nProtection: Free public Wi-Fi might make you forget all your life\u2019s problems but it can also be the beginning of a new set of problems. Public Wi-Fi can easily be accessed by hackers on the same network, who can read your personal data. A VPN encrypts your entire internet connection to protect all your communications, even over unsecured networks.\n\nWhat is the difference between a VPN app, a VPN plugin, and a VPN browser?\n\nCurious about which you should use? VPN browsers or browser plugins only protect your web browser traffic. Note, however, that the rest of the network traffic from your device is still exposed to internet service providers and potential hackers. A VPN app encrypts and protects all network traffic from your device.\n\nIs it safe to use a VPN for online banking?\n\nYes\u2013 but ensure you are using a reputable VPN service. VPNs help protect your privacy while you perform online banking transactions. But remember, a VPN is a tunnel that encrypts your data. It cannot protect you from viruses or guarantee that you won\u2019t be hacked. Remember to create a strong password and adhere to online safety measures.\n\nWhat else should I know about VPNs?\n\nVPNs aren\u2019t without flaws. They have their fair share of practical drawbacks. Internet speed can be slower because VPNs have to reroute and encrypt your data while sending and receiving information between your device and a website.\n\nAlso, some sites and services look at VPN traffic as suspicious and won\u2019t let you connect. It becomes suspicious when a device is in different locations within a short time \u2014 in New York, Lagos and Tokyo within an hour. This could become a real problem, especially when it\u2019s your bank that blocks you.",

          "title": "TECNO CAMON 17 Pro: A Creative Nod to the Selfie and the Selfie Culture",
          "text": "A few weeks back, TECNO launched the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro smartphone, focusing on the selfie with a 48MP AI selfie camera and 90 Hz super-high refreshing rate at 6.8-inch FHD Screen. The brand showed sincerity in understanding their consumers\u2019 needs, seeing as the pandemic era amplified people\u2019s need for documenting personal memories.\n\nIt really is no surprise that the social phenomenon of selfies has gained momentum and has become central to how people express themselves and keep in touch with the world. Personally, I have taken more pictures, recorded more videos this past year than I have in years.\n\nI guess that is why TECNO\u2019s Camon 17 Pro stood out to me. It seemed to me like they were the first brand to put this behavioural shift into focus and offer a solution backed by the brand\u2019s usual innovation and sweet price range.\n\nSo, today, I am going to be sharing the things I love about the Camon 17 Pro.\n\n48MP AI Selfie Camera\n\nLike I already stated. The selfie camera of the Camon 17 Pro is one of the highlights of the phone. The 48 MP selfie camera captures the beautiful details in an elegant way even adding a professional finish. The embedded artificial intelligence (AI) technology\u2019s algorithms elevate the pictures by identifying features based on gender. The algorithms also adjust the surrounding light to make me the focal point of the shot. The wide selection tools helped me personalize the images just as I wanted them portrayed. I was able to conceal blemishes on my face. There is also a tool that helped hide the dark circles around my face.\n\nCamera LAB \u2013 The TAIVOS\u2122 Imaging Laboratory\n\nThe TECNO CAMON 17 Pro comes with trademarked TAIVOS technology. TAIVOS, which stands for TECNO AI Vision Optimization Solution provides users with an unprecedented visual experience, especially in low-light environments. TAIVOS filtered out the image noise of my pictures quite nicely and optimized the images\u2019 clarity. The end result of that were photos with enhanced night photography effects.\n\nOne of my favourite things about TECNO\u2019s TAIVOS\u2122 is how it lets in more light and optimizes details against a low-light background, adding clarity to the photos. The camera literally found light for my pictures despite how dark the night was. The super night mode of the device delivered impressively.\n\nApparently, TECNO has carried out much research to incorporate better technology on the Camon 17 Pro. And it shows in how grand the camera solutions are on the device.\n\nOf course, the camera features of the Camon 17 Pro aren\u2019t all there is about the device. Here are some of the other features that ticks the boxes for me.\n\nElegant Appearance with both Aesthetics and Functionality\n\nThe 6.8-inch 1080\u00d72460 FHD display of the Camon 17 pro provides incomparable clarity and is a feast for the eyes. Every edge feels sharper and every colour is brighter. These worked together to get me truly immersed in the high-definition video and intense games. The 90 Hz super-high refreshing rate offered me a smooth, snappy and refreshing experience.\n\nIt is obvious that the appearance of the device was constructed with ample consideration of both practicality and aesthetics. TECNO made use of light and shadow, as well as accurately crafted nanoscale textures. I should also state how the optical coating incorporated makes the device fingerprint resistant.\n\nThe device comes in distinct California dream silver and Malibu blue colours. Its ergonomic design for easy hold, slim body and adjusted edges gives it a great look.\n\nLong Lasting Battery and Peak Performance\n\nCamon 17 Pro offers users the performance they deserve. Animations are smoother, games are more immersive, and networking is faster. The Media Helio G95 Processor contains an 8-core CPU with Hyper Engine game optimization, making it TECNO\u2019s fastest chip yet, and at the same time still providing exceptional performance. Network optimization with the prediction engine allows for WIFI/LTE concurrence so my connection remained uninterrupted while gaming.\n\nWith an enormous 5000mAh battery you do not have to worry about your phone dying during crucial moments. Furthermore, the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro comes with fast charging so, the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro will be ready to leave when you are.\n\nUser Focused OS 7.6 System\n\nI specifically like how TECNO prioritised privacy with the Camon 17 Pro. The device allows users to use fingerprints to lock apps away and keep data as secure as possible. The phone also comes with a privacy film that ensures only the user looking directly at the screen can see what is being shown.\n\nIt\u2019s One-click blockbuster feature allows the users to pick from professional templates to create dynamic and exciting albums to be played back for friends and family. The device makes sharing precious and fun moments a lot easier.\n\nThe Camon 17 Pro sells for N125,000 and is available in authorized stores nationwide. Good thing about buying the Camon 17 Pro as soon as you can is that you will be given the TECNO Buds 1 for free.\n\nHere\u2019s what you will be getting from the buds;\n\nSmooth Connectivity\n\nI went through a seamless process of pairing the TECNO buds 1 to the Camon 17 Pro over a Bluetooth v5.0 connection. With your phone\u2019s Bluetooth on, the earbuds are automatically seen and asks that you pair both devices.\n\nWireless Stereo Sound and Deep Bass\n\nThe TECNO Buds 1 has a deep bass effect that locks out noise and allows you enjoy every single sound be it music or movie.\n\nEasy User Experience with the Smart Switching Function\n\nLet me say first that the buds fit perfectly into the ears and wouldn\u2019t fall out easily. I especially love that I didn\u2019t have to bring out my phone each time I had to do basic things like answer phone calls, or move a song to the next one. All I had to do was tap the touch sensitive buttons on the buds.\n\nBattery\n\nThe TECNO Buds 1 comes with an interesting battery capacity. Each earbud has a 40mAh battery capacity that lasts over 4 hours. The charging case itself is 300mAh and delivers over 12 hours of charge to the earbuds\n\nEach earbud has a 40mAh battery capacity that lasts over 4 hours. The charging case itself is 300mAh\u2026",

          "text": "The journey into tech for women in Africa is an ongoing discussion largely influenced by cultural norms and societal expectations concerning gender. Bolt, an inclusive mobility company, recognises this and as part of efforts to drive participation and inclusion for women in technology, launched the #Drive4WITech (Drive for Women in Tech) initiative to support young women in Africa. The initiative is an immersive internship programme for young women to challenge the status quo and kickstart a career in the tech space. The goal for Bolt is to equip the interns with preliminary knowledge and hands-on tools required to expand their career paths into areas in technology.\n\nFrom the vast number of applicants across Africa, nine interns were selected with three from Nigeria. Two of them \u2013 Onyekachukwu Orji and Oluwakorede Oseni spoke about their experience. The interns chosen are made up of undergraduate and post-graduates across different interests.\n\nQ: Among the many applications received, you were selected to intern with Bolt in the #Drive4WITech initiative. How did you feel when you were selected?\n\nOluwakorede: I was excited when I was notified that I had been selected. I saw this as an opportunity to work with a global and inclusive brand that is committed to solving the mobility challenge in Africa. It is an opportunity I have been waiting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I felt elated to have been selected. I have always been curious about what it would feel like working at Bolt. I am happy and satisfied with the knowledge I have gained during my time as an intern.\n\nQ: What area did you specialise in during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I supported the marketing team at Bolt Nigeria. This provided me with a basic understanding of the necessary skills needed to supervise teams, programmes, and strategically plan for maximum impact.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I specialised in City Operations. I worked closely with Heads of Departments to build strategic solutions to issues as they arose, and it has helped me develop core competence in identifying and resolving issues.\n\nQ: Tell us about the experience and the new skills you learnt during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I had a great experience working at Bolt. In the marketing department, I discovered that marketing plays in promoting business goals and driving sales of products or services. Some of the skills I learnt include creative writing and how to structure the language of blogs and messages, using Emails and push notifications to pass across a clear message. I also learnt how to research and identify the organisation\u2019s target audience which helps in crafting content.\n\nOnyekachukwu: My experience was very exciting. I learnt the importance of teamwork, communication, staying up to date on issues that concern the company, professionalism, time management and discipline. The most important thing I have learnt is the ownership mentality. I must act like I own the business, that way, I would be at my best to ensure that everything runs smoothly and the business stays functional. To observe and think of ways to improve the business, it is paramount to communicate doubts and concerns where necessary. In addition, ask for clarity when in doubt and always being courageous enough to say when or where I lack knowledge. I have also developed analytical skills.\n\nQ: What impact has Drive4WITech had on you and how will it enhance your career?\n\nOluwakorede: The programme was very impactful. It exposed me to the importance of marketing and the role it plays in the business world. I am more confident, and I believe I more versatile and can provide useful insights. With all these learnings, I am positive of adding immense value in my future roles.\n\nOnyekachukwu: The skills I learnt will play an instrumental role in helping me to build a successful career. I am more equipped to confidently make significant contributions to my future work team.\n\nQ: How do you plan to use the knowledge gained to your advantage in the tech industry?\n\nOluwakorede: I aspire to own a tech company and to run the company successfully. I have learnt that it is important to manage the brand\u2019s image and proper representation of the brand. I want to use the knowledge gained to build my brand having realised that there is a misconception by tech enthusiasts about other fields. So, the knowledge will be very instrumental to my success in the industry.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I plan to pursue a career in data analytics. With the knowledge gained, I will be able to help businesses optimise their performances and make better consumer decisions, while leveraging on trends and insights for a better customer experience.\n\nQ: Did you have any challenges interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: A major challenge was writing and developing content because I initially had little knowledge about how to structure and develop detailed content with accurate language to pass across the right message. However, with the support of my team members who constantly provided guidance, I was able to overcome the challenge and I can boldly say that I am better off than I joined.\n\nOnyekachukwu: No, the company made my internship as accommodating as possible. Whenever I felt overwhelmed, I reached out to my team for support. This has also helped me develop strong organisational skills, where I am more focused on important things.\n\nQ: The Drive4WITech initiative positions Bolt as an inclusive and diverse organization. How immersing was it for you?\n\nOluwakorede: It was very immersing and educating beyond a regular internship. The programme provided an effective vehicle for me to learn and grow. It also helped me develop strong work ethics that enhance productivity while building expertise working with a diverse team.\n\nOnyekachukwu: It was very engaging. Every team did their best to take us through their task and how they work. The operations team taught us several new processes in data analytics. From what was taught, I now understand more about data, how it is stored, and how to use it better. I also learnt how data can be used to tell a story and find useful insights.\n\nQ: Did the programme meet your expectations?\n\nOluwakorede: My experience during the programme exceeded my expectations as I did not expect to learn a lot from marketing. It was fun and challenging because there is always a new technique to learn, a case to study, and strategies to research which is very interesting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I came in with a curious mind and some expectation to learn and practice analytical skills. Even so, the internship curriculum covered more than I expected. It was highly satisfactory.\n\nQ: What is that one thing you will miss about interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: I will miss the friendly environment and meetings where I am encouraged to share ideas and ask questions, motivating me.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I will miss the work culture and healthy workspace that encourages growth, as well as my team; especially Onyinye, Bimbo and Miracle.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "From ballot paper to blockchain ledger, can the tech behind Bitcoin heal Nigeria\u2019s democracy?",
          "text": "Elections are perhaps the core of democracy, a process where people have a say in who leads and how they are led. It\u2019s the point where citizens exercise their power.\n\nIn Nigeria, however, rather than exercise their power during the democratic process, Nigerians have to exhibit courage and bravery. The annulled presidential election of June 12, 1993, is widely regarded as a constant reminder of how democratic power was, and perhaps still is, stripped from the people.\n\nFor Jerry Ojumah, a blockchain developer and designer, election season in Nigeria is a time of anxiety; the focus is on surviving the process and not on the election outcome.\n\n\u201cHow can performing your civic right be an endangerment to your life?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was a recurring question as Ojumah narrated how he lost his friend, a National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member, during the 2011 Nigerian presidential election.\n\nThe country\u2019s 2019 general election claimed 626 lives, according to a Premium Times report.\n\nGiven the violence and conflict that characterise Nigerian elections, questioning election results isn\u2019t out of place. Unfortunately, election violence isn\u2019t the only problem plaguing Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nAccording to a report by the Law Library of Congress Global Research Center, the 2007 elections observed by the National Democratic Institute reported an obscene amount of irregularities such as underage voting, ballots without names of some candidates, errors in voter registration, and inadequate polling stations.\n\nThe report also highlighted the observations of the European Union Election Observation Mission (EU EOM), which found out that the election did not meet basic regional and international standards.\n\nIt cited lack of organisation, absence of basic transparency, \u201cwidespread procedural irregularities and significant evidence of fraud.\u201d\n\nTo bring transparency and safety back to elections, perhaps a technological intervention, a process that is immutable and free of external influence, should be considered.\n\nBlockchain technology is often tied to the flagship cryptocurrency \u2014 Bitcoin. But in truth, cryptocurrencies are only an application of blockchain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlockchain is to Bitcoin what the Internet is to email. It is just the technology upon which cryptocurrencies work.\n\nAlso known as distributed ledger technology (DLT), blockchain has been considered an answer to election problems.\n\nIn a Forbes article, Frank Palermo advocated blockchain voting in the US after an alleged hack of the current voting system in 2016. He says with blockchain, hackers will need to do the impossible \u2014 hack through a network of computers.\n\nFrom ballot paper to blockchain ledger\n\nBlockchain has been used for elections in some countries, but the technology is very far from mainstream adoption.\n\nPer tech publication Hacker Noon, blockchain was used for voting in Sierra Leone, Japan, and Russia.\n\nIn Sierra Leone, the exercise was controversial as it turns out the blockchain company contracted for the job might not have used blockchain at all.\n\nThe tech was also introduced in Tsukuba City, Japan. However, it has only been used to vote for social development proposals.\n\nIt was in the US, however, that the use of blockchain began to look like a real replacement for the current system of elections.\n\nIn May 2018, according to NBC News, West Virginians living abroad were able to send their votes in for a primary election with a blockchain voting system. The news says it was a success as over 140 people voted.\n\nBlockchain is a relatively new technology. This raises the question of how people who are not familiar with the technology will use it during the elections.\n\ni-Elect is a blockchain voting platform with a use case in Nigeria created by blockchain developer and designer Jerry Ojumah. It was made for the Covenant University Alumni Association (CUALA) election.\n\nAccording to Ojumah, the platform will be easier to access than traditional voting methods, with people voting from the comfort of their homes.\n\nVoters can access the platform with a computer or Internet-enabled mobile device. All they have to do is click on their preferred candidate, and the information goes into the blockchain network.\n\nInterestingly, Ojumah adds that blockchain-powered voting will reduce the cost of running elections tremendously. The Guardian reports that \u20a6245 billion was budgeted for elections in 2019.\n\nA large portion of the budget went to logistics and security. Ojumah believes that without the need for logistics and security costs, less than a fraction of that budget would be required to conduct a blockchain-powered election.\n\nNevertheless, usability and scalability remain crucial considerations. Ojumah\u2019s response to this is; a simple user interface, available in most Nigerian languages combined with text to speech features for those who cannot read or are visually impaired.\n\n\u201cThanks to new generation blockchain networks, the platform will be able to process large amounts of data simultaneously,\u201d Ojumah says.\n\nIn cases of poor Internet coverage or lack of smartphones, Ojumah submits that Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) can be integrated.\n\nCan it work in Nigeria\u2019s political space?\n\nSegun Amure, a one-time aspirant for councilorship in one of the local governments in Osun State, believes that the government should consider anything that will keep elections free and fair.\n\n\u201cIf blockchain technology can guarantee ease of voting in elections, the safety and will of the people I think is good,\u201d Amure says.\n\nOrowale Triumph, a young politician with dreams of one day becoming president, says, \u201cIt sounds like a process that is not faulted by humans; the creator of the platform or the government cannot influence the data. I think the credibility and transparency of the technology can be vouched for, so why not?\u201d\n\nThough Triumph is sure that blockchain will change Nigeria\u2019s current political climate, he doesn\u2019t think Nigerian politicians will adopt such technology.\n\n\u201cThe entire system needs a change\u2026most politicians will stop at nothing to make sure elections go their way. In such a political situation, they will not succumb to a technology that assures free and fair elections.\u201d\n\nClamouring for electoral reform, Triumph says, \u201cThe power again lies with the masses. If they push for the electoral reform act, then there is a possibility that such a technology will be adopted to foster free and fair elections.\u201d\n\nArguments against blockchain elections\n\nA report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), published November 2020, sees blockchain elections as a threat to democracy.\n\nClaiming that online voting would increase cybersecurity concerns, the MIT says \u201cVoatz\u201d \u2014 the platform used for elections in the 2018 West Virginia in the US \u2014 suffers from security vulnerabilities.\n\nIt also says the growing proposals for blockchain elections is borne out of the enthusiasm to improve and modernise elections.\n\nThe report also cites crypto investors\u2019 losses over the years as a reason to distrust blockchain.\n\nAccording to the report, voter verifiability and contestability are some problems blockchain cannot solve. It, therefore, called for a return to the paper balloting system as it is safer than online voting.\n\nConsidering that money can be stolen online and physically, MIT\u2019s report somewhat strangely predicts that the vulnerabilities associated with online shopping and banking will affect voting with blockchain.\n\nCould these positions and submissions result from a misunderstanding of how a blockchain-powered election works?\n\nHow a blockchain powered-election works\n\nAdedayo Adebajo is the Managing Director of Jelurida Africa, the African arm of Jelurida, the Swiss company behind the creation of Ardor, a blockchain network with smart contracts capability.\n\nAccording to Adebajo, creating a poll on the Ardor network requires all voters to have a funded Ardor account. This new generation of blockchain gives the option of KYC for users. So, various conditions can be set before a person is allowed to vote. However, voting is not free.\n\n\u201cEvery single vote is a transaction,\u201d he says.\n\nA transaction needs to be made to vote, and a voter needs at least one Ignis \u2014 a child chain of Ardor and a cryptocurrency \u2014 to vote.\n\nAlternatively, the creator of the polls could pay for everyone\u2019s vote. This means that if the federal government creates polls on the Ignis network, they could pay for everyone to vote.\n\nResponding to whether Jelurida will make money if Nigeria holds elections on its platform, Adebajo says, \u201cWe can not really say they make profit from this because it is still made free and the amount paid is merely for usability purposes.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing this piece, one Ignis was approximately 30 cents. Voting for a population of say 150 million people will cost approximately $45 million, which translates to \u20a621.5 billion \u2014 a fraction of the \u20a6245 billion budgeted for the 2019 election.\n\nWhen it comes to the safety of this data, he reveals that in a scenario where 51% of the nodes running Ardor suffer an attack, data could be compromised.\n\nHowever, there are 2,000 Ardor nodes spread across different parts of the world, making the possibility of an attack very slim.\n\nAs a Nigerian, Adebajo feels Nigeria should adopt blockchain voting but he believes it will not happen anytime soon because \u201cthere are a lot of people who benefit from the lack of transparency and lack of digital trails\u201d in elections.\n\nAdebajo suggests that a way to adopt this system of voting is to start small. From voting within associations to voting in local government elections before getting to the national level.\n\nFor Nigerians, adopting a technological solution to solve election problems transcends a desire for ease and convenience during voting. It is perhaps the only alternative to reviving a dying democracy.\n\nNews reports give statistics of lives lost during elections in Nigeria; the pain, however, is inestimable.",

          "title": "Global Wellness Day: Protecting mental health with technology",
          "text": "In Africa, mental health resources are scarce, reflecting the weakness of mental health services on the continent. Also, it mirrors how governments and citizens turn a blind eye to the problem.\n\nPerhaps, that\u2019s why Ted Malanda, a Kenyan humour writer, couldn\u2019t comprehend why American actor Robin Williams \u2014 who suffered from depression \u2014 committed suicide in 2014.\n\nWriting via The Standard, Malanda describes how depression \u2014 a mental health disorder \u2014 is such a non-issue on the continent that African languages do not have a word for it.\n\nImpact of mental health disorders\n\nPhoto by Sam Moqadam on Unsplash\n\nA study shows that 13% of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) is primarily due to mental health disorders. Almost three-quarters of this burden lies in low and middle-income countries due to extremely scarce health resources and investment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMental health is an integral aspect of wellness because it reflects in daily living, relationships, physical health, work, and school productivity.\n\nA World Health Organization (WHO) fact sheet reveals that mental health disorders, otherwise known as mental health illnesses, vary and come with different presentations.\n\nThese disorders include depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other psychoses, dementia, and developmental disorders.\n\nThey are characterised by a combination of abnormal thoughts, perceptions, emotions, behaviours, and relationships with others. Therefore, mental wellness should receive as much care as physical health.\n\nGlobally, the impact of mental health illnesses on the economy is significant. The cost of productivity lost annually is approximately $1.15 trillion, while almost 4.7 billion days of productivity are lost.\n\nMayo Clinic \u2014 a US-based non-profit hospital \u2014 mentions that people will always have mental health concerns from time to time. Nonetheless, a mental health concern becomes a mental health disorder when signs and symptoms cause recurring stress and affect the ability to function.\n\nHence, protecting your mental health is essential.\n\nProtecting your mental health with technology\n\nImage by Firmbee from Pixabay\n\nThere are effective strategies to prevent and alleviate the suffering caused by mental health disorders, and technology is one of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe use of social media can be a cause of mental health disorders like depression and anxiety. However, technology can be advantageous to someone with mental health disorders.\n\nIt has opened a new frontier of mental health support and data collection. Research shows that mobile phones and Internet-connected devices provide an opportunity to collect objective information on individuals\u2019 behaviour.\n\nThis information helps generate a data set that provides insight into an individual\u2019s mental health needs.\n\nThe University of Illinois, Chicago, encourages Internet-based support groups, telehealth, and mobile apps to protect one\u2019s mental health.\n\nMobile mental health support can be simple and effective. Globally, about 800 mobile apps help users cope with symptoms, share their stories, and meet with psychiatrists and psychotherapists.\n\nFurthermore, they provide valuable data to physicians, therapists, and health care informatics experts.\n\nInternet-based support groups help people with mental health disorders, guiding them while they reveal their struggles anonymously. And telehealth provides consultation with a health care provider via phone or video conference.\n\nHow technology is protecting mental health in Africa\n\nA study by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) shows that doctors, researchers, and the public can access help, monitor progress, and increase understanding of mental wellbeing with mobile devices like phones and tablets. In Africa, some startups and non-profit organisations already do this.\n\nWe examine two startups and one user-led community helping people with mental health disorders in Africa.\n\nShezlong\n\nFounded in 2015 by Ahmed Abu ElHaz, an Egyptian software engineer, Shezlong is a healthtech startup that offers people in the Middle East and Africa (MENA) region on-demand mental health care.\n\nIt is the first online psychotherapy clinic in the region.\n\nShezlong has a mobile app that aims to help people with mental health disorders become more confident and make better life decisions. They also offer relationship counselling.\n\nShezlong homepage\n\nThe app is used in more than 60 countries. Over 300 certified and trusted therapists and psychiatrists are conveniently, privately, and anonymously connected with people with mental disorders in MENA.\n\nTruthshare\n\nTruthshare is an online mental health application that helps people get counselling. It was co-founded in 2019 by two Nigerians: Kuro Briggs and Fortune Bekee.\n\nTruthshare homepage\n\nThe online app aims to improve the mental health of Nigerians. It leverages the Internet to provide a safe place where people can express themselves anonymously, get access to certified counsellors, and feel better.\n\nMoreover, the public can offer advice to people struggling with their mental health.\n\nMentally Aware Nigeria Initiative (MANI)\n\nMANI is a user-led community that uses social media platforms to reach its audience.\n\nFounded in 2016 by Victor Ugo, MANI is based on two core beliefs: to alleviate the stigma and suffering which arises from mental disorders and to know that people who have mental health disorders have a right to life and assistance.\n\nMANI attempts to fight stigma, improve mental health literacy, and drive policies that benefit mental health service users and those at risk.\n\nIt also engages in activities and services that promote and prevent mental health issues.\n\nWhen asked how MANI has helped people with mental health disorders, Max, a writer, told Techpoint Africa, \u201cWhen I was depressed last year, Mentally Aware Nigeria helped me get better. They assigned someone \u2014 who should be a counsellor \u2014 to me. They followed me up on WhatsApp until I started feeling better. That worked for me.\u201d\n\nTechnology has made mental health care affordable and convenient. And anyone with a mental illness can get care anywhere. The use of mobile apps and online platforms offer users the option of anonymity, helping them avoid stigmatisation as they share their stories.\n\nIn recognition of Global Wellness Day, we want you to take care of your mental health as much as you do your physical health. If social media is a source of depression or anxiety for you, you could take a break and take advantage of the Internet.\n\nWe care about your mental health and hope you get the help you need.\n\nHappy Global Wellness Day.",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nVictoria here.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing\n\nIncrease in fintech app installations\n\nApple Health features for the elderly\n\nPlentywaka partners with GUO\n\nIncrease in fintech app installations in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nThe global fintech industry recorded impressive growth in 2020. This is according to the State of Finance App Marketing 2021 report by US-based mobile marketing analytics company, AppsFlyer. The report reveals that beyond funding, fintech app installations grew by160% in the last quarter of 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria alone, loan app installations grew by 43.3%; financial services grew by 34.6%, and investment apps by 20.3%.\n\nSimilarly, Kenya saw 100% growth, and South Africa 52% growth, in fintech app installations.\n\nWhy this growth? The economic effects of COVID-19 led to the rise in fintech app installations.\n\nBesides, in Nigeria, about 56% of the population is unbanked. Also, the unfavourable regulatory conditions could have prompted some of them to make use of loan apps while they explored other financial services.\n\nInterestingly, the fintech space recorded a significant boom in marketing investment. Over 150 Nigerian fintech startups reportedly generate annual revenues of over $5 million.\n\nTo read more on the state of fintech apps, click here.\n\nApple introduces new iPhone features for the elderly\n\nApple, at its World wide developer conference (WWDC) event, announced new features for iOS 15 on the iPhone. The event which started on Monday, June 7 will end today, Friday, June 11.\n\nThoughtfully, among the new features, Apple introduced two health-focused ones \u2014 Walking Steadiness and ability to share health data with family members \u2014 for the elderly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy these features? Older people are prone to falling, and it is the major cause of accidents, injury, and death for older people.\n\nHow does it work? The feature intends to track people as they move through their daily lives.\n\nNot to be confused with fall detection on the Apple Watch, which prompts users to call emergency services, Apple says Walking Steadiness is different, as it focuses on prediction rather than response.\n\nThat is, it is able to predict your risk of falling, using metrics like walking speed, step length, and the time both feet are in contact with the ground.\n\nWhile this may seem exciting, I doubt its ability to help everyone, as walking patterns differ. Moreover, it is only effective if users carry their phones around at all times; some don\u2019t.\n\nStill, it\u2019s good to know Apple does not just target only the young, but the elderly too.\n\nWalking Steadiness will be available for everyone who has an iPhone 6s and above.\n\nPlentywaka partners GUO to expand inter-state\n\nPlentyWaka bus. Source: PlentyWaka Twitter\n\nPlentywaka, a Nigerian bus-hailing tech company, has announced its partnership with interstate bus company, GUO Transport, to expand its reach.\n\nThis will lead to the opening of new routes on Plentywaka\u2019s inter-state offshoot, Travelwaka. About 200 routes are expected to be launched. Plentywaka will onboard 600 new buses from GUO, bringing total buses on the platform to 850.\n\nThis partnership is mutually beneficial because GUO doesn\u2019t have to build and maintain proprietary tech for commuters to find them online. Plentywaka, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t need to buy buses to expand inter-state.\n\nThe end goal of PlentyWaka is to give its users an easy way to compare their choices from a range of travel companies. So perhaps we can expect it to onboard more inter-state bus companies in the near future.\n\nSounds familiar? You might remember Oya.com.ng, the bus ticketing website that was acquired by Wakanow in 2015, barely 2 years into operation. They employed a similar inventory-less model.\n\nSidebar: It might interest you to know that GIGM, another major bus company, has a tech-enabled platform that allows investors to place their buses on its inter-state network.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching this weekend\n\nImproving early child development with words. Watch.\n\nHow China lost patience with its loudest billionaire. Watch.\n\nHave an amazing weekend ahead.\n\nVictoria Fakiya for Techpoint Africa.",

          "title": "Six years of APC in the saddle: Whither the rosy promises?",
          "text": "Before the 2015 general election, it was Muhammadu Buhari all the way. In fact, at a point, the name became a household name, especially for die-hard supporters, who threw their all into making sure Buhari won the election.\n\nAfter his failed attempts at winning the 2003, 2007 and 2011 presidential polls, three biggest opposition parties \u2013 the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) and the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) came together and formed the All Progressives Congress (APC) in February 2013.\n\nDesperate to win the 2015 presidential elections, the party made all manner of promises, including ban on government officials from going abroad for medical treatment; generation, transmission and distribution of at least 20,000 megawatt of electricity within four years; making naira stable at the international market; amending the Nigerian Constitution to ensure devolution of powers, duties, and responsibilities to states in order to entrench true federalism; ending gas flaring and ensuring sales of at least half of gas produced within the country, among others.\n\nRegrettably, six years down the line, Buhari and his party have failed to even deliver on the three cardinal points of reviving the economy, improving security and fighting corruption, which were the main thrust of their campaign.\n\nBut the presidency has reeled out Buhari\u2019s achievements in different sectors in celebration of his sixth anniversary: They are: infrastructure, power, housing, agriculture, education, health, asset recovery, security and justice reform, diplomacy and international relations.\n\nIn agriculture, for instance, the presidency noted that the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) of the Central Bank of Nigeria, launched by President Muhammadu Buhari on November 17, 2015, has made more than N300 billion to more than 3.1 million smallholder farmers of 21 different commodities (including Rice, Wheat, Maize, Cotton, Cassava, Poultry, Soya Beans, Groundnut, Fish). When you put this in context, it means empowering 3.1 million smallholder farmers would invariably improve food production, but the reverse has been the case as food inflation keeps hitting the roof. In the last two years, more farmers have been killed more than any other time in the history of the country.\n\nTo say the least, President Buhari\u2019s six years in office has been hell on earth. It is nothing to write home about as woes, anguish and insecurity has become the order of the day.\n\nObviously, Buhari\u2019s government has clearly demonstrated that it lacks the capacity to bring governance closer to the people. The economy is not shaping up. Key economic indicators show that inflation rate has moved 9.00percent in 2015 to 18.12percent in 2021; unemployment rate from 8.19percent in 2015 to 33.28percent in 2021; debt profile from N12.60trn in 2015 to N32.92trn in 2021; exchange rate from $1/N197 in 2015 to $1/N410 in 2021; foreign reserves from $28.57bn in 2015 to $34.27bn in 2021 and GDP growth rate 2.79percent in 2015 to 0.5percent in (Q1 2021).\n\nNigeria\u2019s unemployment rate has been described as a \u2018time bomb\u2019 waiting to explode. But the stark reality is that the time bomb has since exploded before our very face in the form of terrorism, banditry, armed robbery, cultism, kidnapping, rapists and ritualists.\n\nEvery part of the country is facing one form of security threat or the other. For instance, in the North-East, it is terrorism, North-West is banditry, while in the North-Central, it has been Fulani herdsmen killing hapless farmers, especially in Benue State.\n\nIn the southern part of the country, South-East precisely, it is attack on police stations, INEC offices and correctional centres, in the South-South; it is more of kidnapping and cult clashes. In the South-West, it is communal clashes.\n\nThe recent attack in Igangan, a community in Ibarapa North Local Government of Oyo State, where over 20 people were killed, was one of such clashes.\n\nAs a retired general, many Nigerians had thought that with Buhari at the helms of affairs, the security challenges undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence would have effectively been nipped in the bud. Alas! Six years after, Nigerians are asking: how did we get to this state of hopelessness? Unfortunately, this ugly situation has largely scared away foreign investors.\n\nCorruption under this government is mind-boggling. A president, who is serious about fighting corruption, championing transparency and accountability in governance, should have sent a strong message to some officials of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) accused of looting and financial rascality.\n\nUnder this administration, the country\u2019s external and domestic debts have continued to rise with no commensurate improvements in the quality of life of the people. According to the Debt Management Office, external debt has risen exponentially to hit $33.34bn by December 2021 compared to $10.31bn in June 2015.\n\nNo doubt, Buhari\u2019s six years in office is something Nigerians will not forget in a hurry because of the untold hardship many have been subjected to. They argued that the remaining two years look bleak and uncertain.\n\nThe question many now ask is: can he redeem his image with the two years left in his tenure? Can he listen to voices of reason and truly be a president for all Nigerians? Can he assert himself as the president and Commander-in-Chief and stop playing aloofness in matters of national importance?\n\nAs it stands, what Buhari will be best remembered for are hunger and destruction of life and property. The hue and cry in the land is quite alarming. This is certainly not a legacy any sane man would want to be remembered for.\n\nTherefore, the president should, as a matter of urgency, use his remaining two years to redeem himself by rising to the occasion when the need arises, listen to voice of reasons and be prompt and decisive in dealing with criminal elements bent on destroying the country. He should look into the wanton killings, especially those ones being committed by his fellow Fulani people. At this challenging time, he should be in the fore front of uniting the country. In fact, now is the time for him to sit up and call the shots.\n\nBuhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) made lots of promises to Nigerians, including restructuring of the country to give every section of the country a sense of belonging. The Nasir el-Rufai Committee has since 2018 submitted its report. He should go ahead and implement the report. Not doing so will not only bring him in a bad light, but also as a man who lacks integrity and courage.\n\nAs the ninth National Assembly gears towards passing the Electoral Act Amendment bill before going on its long recess in July, Buhari owes Nigerians a duty to sign that bill into law. It is high time credible and competent men, women and the youths in Nigeria occupied exalted positions and not charlatans.",

Dep Gov\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo Deputy Governor, Mr. Philip Shaibu on Saturday in Benin, called on Nigerians to work together in sustenance of democratic ideals so as to provide room for equity, freedom of speech and sustainable development.\n\nShaibu stated this while addressing a cross section of protesters who were in a peaceful protest to Edo Government House, Benin City.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe have distinguished between the military and civil rule. We have agreed that the difference is freedom of speech. Democracy is here to stay. We have fought for the sustenance of democracy.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of the 14 lawmakers-elect who abdicated their roles, he said, \u201cI also want to address the issue of the 14 Edo State House of Assembly members-elect who failed to make themselves available for swearing-in after Governor Godwin Obaseki issued a proclamation letter.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, I don\u2019t have a representative from Etsako West Constituency II because these characters decided to follow a godfather shortly after they were voted into office. Today, godfathers have taken over our democracy.\n\n\u201cThey have taken over democracy that you and I struggled for. The democracy that the likes of Ransome Kuti and Gani Fawehinmi fought for. All of them struggled to have democracy.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the development has destroyed the fabric of our society, adding, \u201cIn Edo, these characters decided to follow a godfather. One of our Comrades, Adams Oshiomhole, led us in the struggle in Edo to say no to godfatherism.\n\n\u201cBut unfortunately, he removed his khaki and now wears the armor of a godfather. This led to the kind of House of Assembly we now have in Edo State.\n\n\u201cWe did everything to beg them; we said you are not representing one godfather you are representing the good people of your constituency. But they refused to come back and be sworn-in. Somebody far away in Lagos, instead was giving them instructions. He said that the governor should issue a second proclamation letter which is against the law. How can somebody from Lagos be dictating for us in Edo? We said no to that, and insisted that Edo people must decide for themselves.\n\nShaibu said that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has been unable to conduct a bye-election, because the matter was still in the court.\n\nThe deputy governor also advocated for a unicameral legislature to reduce the cost of governance, adding that the funds saved from the restructured legislative system would be used for the development of states.\n\nHe further advocated for state policing, noting that the policing arrangement should be given consideration in the ongoing constitution amendment process so as to check insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nOne of the protesters, Abraham Oviawe, said the quest was for all Nigerians to enjoy the dividends of democracy, noting that the present administration has stifled free speech.\n\nHe urged the government to ensure adequate security of lives and property, saying that the Federal Government is paying lip service to the issue of security.\n\n\u201cAfter 22 years of democracy, Nigerians are still suffering as the standard of living has gone from bad to worse in the country. We enjoy freedom of speech but not freedom after speech. Democracy is a reminder to the people the quality of service before them,\u201d he said.\n\n...",

          "title": "Buhari\u2019s anti-corruption failure fuels insecurity, undermines democracy \u2013 Report",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s often repeated promise to fight corruption with zero tolerance has remained \u201clargely unmet\u201d, a think tank has reported, saying the president\u2019s failure fuels Nigeria\u2019s worsening insecurity and undermines democratic promises.\n\nThe Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) slammed Mr Buhari for not doing enough to combat the endemic corruption in the public service, despite having gained power on the back of the promise to fight the ill, that is largely responsible for Nigeria\u2019s rarely improving development crises.\n\n\u201cAs the candidate who rode into office in 2015 on a wave of popular anger with entrenched elite corruption, he has made little effort to reform Nigeria\u2019s patronage-fueled, scandal-prone public sector or hold his top officials accountable for their business-as-usual approach,\u201d CDD said in its report, titled, \u201cBuhari\u2019s Anti-Corruption Record at Six Years: An Assessment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the 2023 election season already ramping up, and Buhari\u2019s hands-off governing style largely unchanged, his government\u2019s anti-corruption track record is set to go down in history as one characterised by missed opportunities and, in some respects, outright hypocrisy. His 2016 promise to \u201cdemonstrate zero tolerance for corrupt practices\u201d remains largely unmet.\u201d\n\nPresidential spokesperson, Femi Adesina, did not respond to calls placed to have him comment on this report, nor did the anti-corruption aide, Abiodun Aikomo. But Mr Buhari himself in his Arise TV interview aired on Thursday said he would \u201cease out\u201d any official found to be corrupt with \u201ccorrect intelligence\u201d.\n\nCDD said, however, its criticism does not mean the Buhari administration has done nothing in the area of anti-corruption. It then gave an outline, including improved financial centralisation, referring to TSA and IPPIS; and higher conviction rates by anti-corruption agencies. The civic group also praised the president for appointing as a substantive EFCC chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, whom it described as \u201ca dynamic and experienced investigator\u201d.\n\nNotwithstanding, CDD said it noted \u201cseveral significant shortcomings,\u201d including the president\u2019s \u201cwillingness to appoint individuals of questionable integrity to key positions; his tendency to shield political allies from investigation and prosecution; his disinterest in how the ruling party funds its election campaigns; his failure to make key petroleum sector reforms; and his corruption-prone economic and fiscal policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of these challenges remain largely unaddressed,\u201d CDD said.\n\n\u201cTwo Pandemics: COVID-19 and Corruption\u201d\n\nIn the name of controlling the spread of COVID-19 and cushioning the effects of the restrictions, CDD said the Buhari administration \u201copaquely\u201d awarded contracts worth N450 million or $1 million to \u201cbriefcase firms\u201d not registered with the Bureau of Public Procurement. It said the emergency spending was disbursed to politically-connected contractors and channeled through existing corrupt structures.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, some government agencies used the pandemic as a pretext to spend lavishly on themselves The Niger Delta Development Commission, for example, disbursed 1.5 billion ($4.2 million) in large cash payments to its own staff members in the name of COVID relief. When questioned by legislators, the Commission\u2019s managing director tried to justify the payments, saying: \u201cwe used it to take care of ourselves\u2026we need to take care of ourselves\u201d,\u201d the think tank said.\n\nCorruption and insecurity\n\nSince Mr Buhari came to power in 2015, insecurity has intensified and spread, affecting virtually all parts of the country. In the north, apart from the Boko Haram in the North-east, armed bandits and terrorists alike are crumbling communities and mass-abducting students at schools in the North-west and North-central zones.\n\nIn the South, herders\u2019 violence has intensified and armed militias of the separatist Indigenous People of Biafra are operating, with attacks on INEC and security facilities and personnel and innocent citizens. The separatists were initially unarmed and Nigerian forces under Mr Buhari extra-judicially killed scores of them betwe\n\nen 2015 and 2016, a PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 Global Shinning Light Award investigation found.\n\n\u201cHollowed out by strategic- and operational-level corruption, Nigeria\u2019s military and police appear incapable of safeguarding many parts of the country,\u201d CDD said, drawing a link between the problem of corruption and insecurity, \u201cThe normalisation of security sector corruption means that military and police leaders failures\u2019 offer them new opportunities to racketeer and profiteer, as well as embezzle from increased emergency security spending.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cFor Nigeria\u2019s top brass, peace is much less lucrative than perpetual low-intensity conflict. Yet President Buhari has done little to change their calculus, hold them accountable or exert strong oversight over their activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder President Buhari, security sector corruption has become both a cause and a consequence of rising insecurity across the country. Defence procurement remains as opaque and graft-prone as it did under his predecessor and largely exempt from due process rules designed to prevent corruption.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDemocratic Backsliding Fuels Corruption\n\nUnder Mr Buhari, the civic space has continued to shrink, CDD said, mentioning violent crackdown on protests and moves to \u201cimpose tighter regulations on legitimate civil society groups while at the same time bankrolling hundreds of fake\u201d NGOs.\n\n\u201c90% of Nigeria\u2019s 360-plus progovernment NGOs have started operating since President Buhari took office, a correlation that suggests many enjoy high-level political support,\u201d CDD claimed.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, ruling party legislators have, in recent years, introduced two bills aimed at regulating NGOs through the creation of a new government agency. If they succeed, the Buhari government may be inclined to use such an agency to target civil society voices that criticise its governance, human rights and corruption record.\u201d\n\nThe think tank expressed pessimism that the president would have the time or political capital to push through sustainable anti-corruption reforms, and called on other stakeholders to fill the gap.\n\n\u201cIntegrity-conscious National Assembly members could, for example, introduce legislation outlawing security votes at the federal, state and local levels. Such a ban should be accompanied by transparent and comprehensive budgeting procedures and criteria for security expenditures that meet international best practices and incorporate robust oversight mechanisms,\u201d CDD recommended.\n\nIt also called on Nigeria\u2019s international partners to prioritise anti-corruption in their engagements and assistance toward the African nation.",

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nDespite the current status of Nigeria as the world\u2019s poverty capital, President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday claimed that his administration has lifted 10.5 million people out of poverty in the past two years.\n\nThis was part of his Democracy Day address to Nigerians.\n\nNigeria has one of the highest number of extremely poor people, according to the World Bank.\n\nBut the President had in 2019 promised to work towards lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years.\n\n\u201cI will be the first to admit that in spite of our efforts and achievements which are there for all to see, there is still much more to be done and we are doing our best in the face of scarce resources and galloping population growth rate that consistently outstrips our capacity to provide jobs for our populace,\u201d Buhari said.\n\n\u201cOur over-all economic target of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years is our goal notwithstanding COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIn the last two years we lifted 10.5 million people out of poverty \u2013 farmers, small-scale traders, artisans, market women and the like.\n\n\u201cI am very convinced that this 100 million target can be met and this informed the development of a National poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy. The specific details of this accelerated strategy will be unveiled shortly.\n\n\u201cIn the last one year, Nigeria and the whole world faced COVID-19 for which no one was fully prepared.\n\nAccording to Buhari, the National Social Investment programme of his administration is \u201ca first in Africa and one of the largest in the world where over 32.6m beneficiaries are taking part.\n\n\u201cWe now have a National Social register of poor and vulnerable households, identified across 708 local government areas, 8,723 wards and 86,610 communities in the 36 States and the FCT.\n\n\u201cOur conditional cash transfer program has benefited over 1.6 million poor and vulnerable households comprising more than 8 million individuals. This provides a monthly stipend of N10,000 per household.\n\n\u201cI have also recently approved the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy Plan that augments existing plans to further reduce poverty in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs at the end of 2020, the Development Bank of Nigeria had disbursed 324 billion Naira in loans to more than 136,000 MSMEs, through 40 participating Financial Institutions. I am to note that 57% of these beneficiaries are women while 27% are the youth.\u201d",

          "text": "First Bank of Nigeria Limited has announced its lead sponsorship of a movie titled \u2018Ayinla\u2019, which is billed to premiere on Sunday, 13 June 2021.\n\nThe movie is suspense-driven, narrating the life of Ayinla Yusuf, popularly known as Ayinla Omowura (an Apala musician), his rise to fame, his identity, the depth of his craft and music, and the basis for his relevance after his tragic death forty years ago as a result of a stab from his manager, Bayewu, during a bar fight on the 6th of May, 1980 in Abeokuta.\n\nAyinla is directed by multiple award-winning and globally acclaimed Nigerian filmmaker and director, Tunde Kelani, and produced by Jadesola Osiberu.\n\nAccording to Tunde Kelani, filmmaker and founder, Mainframe Opomulero Productions,\u201d the making of Ayinla allows us to throw a glance over our shoulders to our often-neglected intangible heritage. Nigeria is blessed with huge cultural diversity and locked away are thousands of stories we can share with a global audience. FirstBank\u2019s partnership with us at this stage is not a mere coincidence, owing to its over hundred years of historical contribution in unlocking the huge potentials in Nigeria which can offer continental and global audiences\u201d.\n\nWith the sponsorship of similar socio-cultural initiatives in the creative arts industry like Moremi, Makaliki, Oba Esugbayi stage drama, October 1st (a movie) and the Calabar Festival. The Bank\u2019s sponsorship of \u2018Ayinla\u2019 affirms the Bank\u2019s support for the development of arts in Nigeria under its [email protected] initiative.\n\n[email protected] is FirstBank\u2019s platform for consolidating all its efforts in the arts, supporting the entire value chain of the creative arts, providing much-needed financing and advisory support, showcasing and facilitating the successes of the industry, and enabling customers to explore and access the wealth of opportunities the creative industry has to offer.\n\nAchieving these and a host of many others have been implemented through strategic partnerships with organizations like the British Council, Duke of Shomolu Productions, Live Theatre Lagos, Freedom Park, Terra Kulture, and the Cross Rivers State Government (Calabar Festival), amongst many others.\n\nAyinla appeals to a multifaceted audience that cuts across fans of highlife and afrobeat music, the youth, and the elite Yoruba demography. It features some of Nollywood\u2019s favorite stars including Adedimeji Lateef who played the role of Ayinla Omowura, Kunle Afolayan, Bimbo Ademoye, Mr. Macaroni, Omowunmi Dada, Ade Laoye, Jumoke Otedola, and Bimbo Manuel.\n\nSpeaking on the movie, Jadesola Osiberu, Movie Producer & Founder, Greoh Studios said, \u201cWorking with the great Tunde Kelani is something I have wanted to do for a long time, and I am so glad that we were able to do it on a project like Ayinla. This collaboration was an interesting experience, and I am glad everyone finally gets to see the film we made in the cinemas nationwide from 18 June 2021. I\u2019d like to thank the management of First Bank of Nigeria Limited for choosing to come on this journey with us.\u201d\n\nExpressing her delight on the movie, Folake Ani-Mumuney, Group Head, Marketing & Corporate Communications, FirstBank said; \u201cFor over 127 years, FirstBank has been at the forefront of nation-building; enabling Nigeria and Nigerians through resourceful partnerships to build the Nigerian creative industry value chain, especially the arts and entertainment sub-sectors. We remain proud of this sponsorship that creates an excellent platform to showcase Nigeria to the world as being part of a collective goal to continually keep dreams and hope alive; holding strong to our commitment to reignite cultural heritage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, the movie industry remains part of the creative and entertainment industry value-chain across the globe and indeed a powerful channel to drive our heritage and culture, which resonates with our legacy of being woven into the fabric of society.\u201d\n\nAccording to research disclosed in PWC\u2019s recent Entertainment & Media Outlook report, Nigeria\u2019s entertainment is expected to rise from $4.46 billion in 2018 to a $10.5 billion market by the end of 2023.

We must all note that each and every one of us, our actions and inactions, will either propel the country forward or fuel the already tensed situation\u201d said the governor\n\nHe opined that Nigeria should rise and fulfill its full potentials in the comity of nations, stressing \u201cwe should not limit that mandate and success to 1993. We must ensure that the hope is kept alive. We cannot afford to bring down our country or show despair in our future. Truly, Nigeria shall rise again.\u201d\n\nThe governor noted that Ogun had continued to show serious interest in the Nigeria\u2019s unity, because indigenes of the state have made the greatest contributions, sacrifices for the unity, oneness and solidarity of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMy administration will continue to focus on the individual prosperity of the people and continued socio-economic development of the state, in line with what MKO Abiola offered and preached, which earned him the mandate of the good people of Nigeria in 1993\u201d Abiodun added.\n\nHe pointed out that Abiola\u2019s campaign programme of \u2018Farewell to Poverty\u2019 is akin to his administration\u2019s \u2018Building our Future Together Agenda\u2019, which is being executed through our I.S.E.Y.A mantra.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to be fair, just, equitable, accountable, open, transparent, inclusive and obey the rule of law. It is part of our forward and deliberate approach to saying a \u2018Farewell to Poverty\u2019 two years down the line. I am proud to say that we are a promise keeping Administration.

          "text": "First City Monument Bank (FCMB) has funded smallholder farmers across the country to ensure adequate food supply for local consumption as well as for export.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nSmallholder farmers are farmers owning small-scaled plots of land where they grow subsistence crops and one or two cash crops while relying almost exclusively on family labour.\n\nWhile highlighting challenges faced by these farmers, the bank listed them to include; small plot sizes, limited access to markets, inputs and finance, thus, making production unprofitable.\n\nTo promote and initiate sustainable development in the agricultural sector, FCMB said, in recent times, it has committed a lot of funding effort and facilitated innovative infrastructure, by providing credit facilities to outgrower initiatives targeted at helping smallholder farmers to maximize their yields.\n\nSpeaking on all this gesture, the divisional head, Agribusiness of the bank, Mr. Kudzai Gumunyu, said: \u201cthrough our work with partners such as Babban Gona, Psaltry and many others who have set up robust outgrower programmes, we are able to provide smallholder farmers with tillage services, fertilizers, as well as extension services. This helps to make their farm yields higher than those of the average farmer, which means more income. As a result, these farmers are able to send their kids to school, build houses, and many are coming on board to join the scheme because of the great impact\u201d.\n\nA critical part of how FCMB helps improve the welfare of smallholder farmers, he stressed, is by making banking and financial services accessible, even in some of the most remote locations in the country.\n\nFor instance, he said, FCMB has supported over 100,000 farmers in Nigeria to boost food production and foster financial inclusion through its various cutting-edge schemes andpartnerships with individuals, groups, and other stakeholders in the agric sector.\n\nThrough the Babban Gona Agricultural Franchise Model supported by FCMB, he added that, member farmers received training, credit in the form of agricultural input and tillage services, harvesting and marketing support that resulted in increased productivity and profitability that is 2 to 2.5 times the national average.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOver the years too, he disclosed that, FCMB has worked extensively with Psaltry International Company Limited (PICL), an indigenous agro-allied company established in 2005 to market cassava produce.\n\nWith support from FCMB and other stakeholders,he pointed out that, Psaltry\u2019s robust outgrowers\u2019 programme has grown to more than 2,000 farmers cultivating within 80 km radius from the factory in 4 different local governments in Oyo State.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, Plantation Industries Limited (PIL) is a leading cocoa processing company that engages in the processing and conversion of raw cocoa beansinto cocoa liquor, cocoa butter, cocoa cake and cocoa powder. Under the Anchor Borrowers Programme, FCMB supported 1,424 outgrower farmers that rely on PIL for offtake,\u201d he disclosed.\n\nThrough this model and several efforts, he noted that, FCMB aligns with the government\u2019s financial inclusion drive to expand financial services access and use to underserved populations.\n\nThe lender has also formed partnerships with some organisations including, World Savings Banks Institute (WSBI), German International Development Cooperation (GIZ), Technoserve, DFID-LINKS, to further the financial inclusion push.\n\nAnalysts and experts are of the opinion that the bank is well positioned to create more opportunities for farmers to add significant value to the quest of Nigeria to attain food security and wealth for the nation.",

Considering the potential for employment when completed, this will definitely reduce youth restiveness in the Niger Delta area and will also address the problem of illegal refining in the area,\u201d Kyari stated.\n\nIn his remarks, the Executive Secretary of NCDMB, Simbi Wabote stated that this milestone was as a result of strong interagency collaboration and public-private sector partnership. \u201cThe NCDMB will continue to drive such partnerships across the industry to bring development in Nigeria,\u201d he noted.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEarlier, the Coordinator of the Project and Group General Manager, National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS), Mr. Bala Wunti stated that the project would enhance the economics of marine petroleum products distribution.",

          "title": "Stocks To Gain As Investors Position For Companies\u2019 Interim Dividend",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s equities market is expected to remain positive this week as investors position in interim dividend-paying stocks.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nAn interim dividend is the distribution of earnings to shareholders before the end of the fiscal year. Such dividends are typically paid out monthly or quarterly and in smaller amounts than an annual dividend. On the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited, an interim dividend is paid at the end of the half year.\n\nIn the new week, analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited expected the equities market to trade positively as investors position in stocks of companies, which are expected to pay interim dividends and which have good fundamentals. Also, we have seen the stop rates at the money market remain relatively flat; further moderation in that space may trigger buy sentiment in equities market.\n\nCordros Capital Limited said: \u201cthis week, we expect investors to continue cherry-picking stocks ahead of the H1, 2021 dividend declarations. With the recent development in the fixed income (FI) market, we are approaching an inflexion point; we, therefore, see scope for increased buying interest from risk-averse investors. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.\u201d\n\nAnalysts at Afrinvest Limited said: \u201cin the coming week, we expect to see profit-taking in early trades. However, we believe this will be short-lived before the end of the week on account of bargain hunting by investors.\u201d\n\nThe chief operating officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion said: the profit-taking may slow down on buying momentum and sustained positioning in good fundamental stocks.\n\nAccording to Omordion, the high buying pressure and inflow of funds into the equity space shows institutional investors or smart money are taking position ahead of economic data and half year earnings reporting season that are around the corner. This, he stressed, suggest that, discerning investors and traders should look the way of sectors and companies with high consumption and demand, capable of impacting positively on company numbers, while hedging against the nation\u2019s galloping inflation.\n\nHe also urged investors to target dividend-paying stocks and fundamentally sound companies with growth prospects in 2021, looking the way of mispriced equities ahead of interim dividend announcement, saying that this is especially given that despite the seeming improvements, fixed income yield continues to offer negative real rate of return due to the galloping inflation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHowever, the strong and faster recovery may continue, depending on market forces, going forward, as propelled by expected second quarter (Q2) earnings reports, until the next Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in July,\u201d he said.\n\nLast week, sentiment was broadly positive as bullish trading dominated the market. Notably, bargain hunting on blue- chip stocks such as SEPLAT Petroleum Development Company (SEPLAT), Dangote Cement and Zenith Bank buoyed market performance.\n\nResultant of this effect, the All-Share Index advanced week-on week (W-o-W) by 430.18 points or 1.11 per cent to close at 39,156.28 points. Similarly, market capitalisation rose N224 billion W-o-W to close at N20.409 trillion.\n\nSectoral performance across sub-sector gauges tracked was positive. The NSE Banking, NSE Consumer Goods, NSE Oil & Gas and the NSE Industrial indices rose by 0.89 per cent, 1.06 per cent, 1.37 per cent and 2.36 per cent to close at 358.61 points, 199.42 points, 310.95 points and 1,952.38 points respectively. On the flip side, the NSE Insurance index rose by 2.36 per cent to 1,952.38 points.\n\nMarket breadth for the week was slightly negative as 35 equities appreciated in price, 36 equities depreciated in price, while 89 equities remained unchanged. Cutix Plc led the gainers table by 23.56 per cent to close at N2.25, per share. Okomu Oil Palm followed with a gain of 20.73 per cent to close at N116.50, while Morison Industries went up by 9.73 per cent to close to N1.24, per share.\n\nOn the other side, CWG Plc led the decliners table by 26.14 per cent to close at N1.13, per share. FTN Cocoa Processors followed with a loss of 15.38 per cent to close at 33 kobo and NEM Insurance declined by 13.46 per cent to close at N1.80, per share.\n\nOverall, a total turnover of 1.058 billion shares worth N12.831 billion in 17,854 deals were traded last week by investors on the floor of the Exchange, in contrast to a total of 1.082 billion shares valued at N9.548 billion that exchanged hands previous week in 17,933 deals.\n\nThe Financial Services Industry, measured by volume led the activity chart with 714.677 million shares valued at N5.951 billion traded in 9,718 deals; contributing 67.53 per cent and 46.38 per cent to the total equity turnover volume and value respectively. The Consumer Goods Industry followed with 97.181 million shares worth N3.297 billion in 3,006 deals, while ICT Industry pulled a turnover of 75.987 million shares worth N583.715 million in 679 deals.\n\nTrading in the top three equities; Zenith Bank, Sterling Bank and Fidelity Bank, measured by volume accounted for 261.344 million shares worth N2.712 billion in 2,862 deals, contributing 24.70 per cent and 21.13 per cent to the total equity turnover volume and value respectively.\n\nOn Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) platform, a total of 1,026 units valued at N160,140.75 were traded last week in eight deals compared with a total of 706 units valued at N5.127 million transacted previous week in 6 deals, while on the Bonds market, a total of 5,335 units valued at N5.350 million were traded last week in 10 deals compared with a total of 91,560 units valued at N96.346 million transacted previous week in 30 deals.",

Gen. Buba Marwa as hailing the synergy between various government agencies at the Onne port.\n\nHe charged them not to rest on their oars as they continued working hard daily, to keep Nigeria safe.\n\nIn particular, he commended the Commander, officers and men of the Port Command in the Rivers capital, and their Abuja airport Command counterparts, for their vigilance and commitment to the task of ridding Nigeria of illicit drugs.\n\n\u201cThe damage 100,000 bottles of codeine could have done to our youths, if they had slipped through the port to our villages, towns and cities, is unimaginable. 146.95 kgs of khat could have done the same damage if allowed to go unto our streets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to motivate our officers and men so that they can give their best in the discharge of their responsibilities across the country.\n\n\u201cWe will ultimately, with the support of all our stakeholders and partners, win the battle against illicit drug trafficking and abuse\u201d, he said.",

So he was a studio rat,\u201d Banky said.\n\n\u201cWiz would just go to any studio where they would let him hang out all day. He would hope for the end of the day, waiting for engineers or the producers to just take pity on him and say, \u2018oya, come record for 15-30 minutes\u2019.\n\n\u201cAll day, he would work on hooks and melodies while coming up with things in case he was given an opportunity to jump on the mic for a few minutes. He didn\u2019t have time to be thinking about what to write at that moment.\n\n\u201cAnd so that became his process. Now, one of the fastest songwriters that I\u2019ve ever encountered in my life. He\u2019ll sit and listen to the music. He\u2019ll start freestyling a melody that will become a song the whole world will want to sing.\u201d\n\nBanky W\u2019s Empire Mates Entertainment (EME) signed Wizkid in 2009. Two years later, he released the \u2018Superstar\u2019 album, followed by his self-titled LP \u2018Ayo\u2019 in September 2014.\n\nOn Wizkid\u2019s choice of stage name, Banky W added: \u201cI think that\u2019s where the name Wiz comes from and why it\u2019s so appropriate. It\u2019s a genius-level melody creation at the spur of the moment. I don\u2019t think there are a lot of people.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve written a lot of songs but I take time. He has this ability honed from years of not being able to afford studio time. He would say, \u2018man, when they give me 15 minutes, I got to be ready to go and knock it out of the park.\u2019\n\n\u201cI think that says something to everybody. No matter where you are just developing yourself, develop your skills. Work on it, get better. Get so good that once you are given an opportunity to knock it out, you score a home run.\u201d\n\nWatch full docuseries here:",

Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi, for his drive and tenacity towards achieving the milestone recorded today, as well as the wonderful team in the Ministry that assisted in achieving this feat.\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi earlier in his remarks expressed gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari for summoning the courage to take the loan from China Exim bank to execute the rail project.\n\nHe also thanked the Chinese government for the loan with the hope that the Asian country will also approve the loan for the Ibadan to Kano axis which he said the Buhari led administration intends to start and complete before the end of its tenure.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful that the Chinese government through the China Exim bank was able to give us the loan at a concessionary rate to construct from the seaport down to Ibadan.\n\n\u201c We hope that we get money to be able to construct from Ibadan -Kano so that we can complete the track and make sure that business takes place,\u201d he said\n\nThe Board Chairman, Nigerian Railway Commission NRC in his welcome address reiterated that the importance of the project cannot be over emphasized as it would be of great impact to the Nation\u2019s citizens and her economy.\n\nThanking President Buhari for his support in ensuring the project is a success, he stressed that the occasion is the third time of the President commissioning railway project completed during his tenure.\n\nHe equally thanked the Minister for being the chief pilot of the project in which the project wouldnt have been successful without his tenacity.\n\nDignitries at the event include Professor Wole Soyinka, Minsters of Info and culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed , Works and Housing SAN Babatunde Fashola, Youth and Sports, Dr Sunday Dare, Minister of State for Health, Dr Olorunnimbe Mamora, Minister of State for Transport, Sen Gbemisola Saraki, Perm Sec Dr. Magdalene Ajani.

          "text": "G7 leaders on Saturday confronted China and the threat of future pandemics as the elite club of wealthy nations advertised a newfound Western unity at its first physical summit since 2019.\n\nAfter an informal evening get-together \u2014 featuring a Royal Air Force aerobatics display, beach barbecue, firepit marshmallows and a Cornish troupe singing sea shanties \u2014 the leaders were to wrap up their three-day summit on Sunday.\n\nAt their concluding session in Cornwall, southwest England, US President Joe Biden and his colleagues will back new conservation and emission targets to curb climate change, according to the UK hosts.\n\nIn a \u201cNature Compact\u201d to be released Sunday with the G7\u2019s final communique, they will commit to nearly halving their carbon emissions by 2030 \u2014 relative to 2010 \u2014 as well as vowing to halt and reverse biodiversity loss.\n\nThe leaders are also set to promise more financial support for developing countries on the sharp edge of climate change, in the buildup to the UN\u2019s COP26 environmental summit in Scotland in November.\n\nSuch actions were unthinkable under former president Donald Trump, but Biden is touting a message of revived US leadership on his first foreign tour.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the same page,\u201d Biden told reporters as he met French President Emmanuel Macron on the summit sidelines, pushing to rally the West against a resurgent China and recalcitrant Russia.\n\nAsked if other G7 leaders agreed with him about a US diplomatic renaissance, Biden pointed to Macron, who replied: \u201cDefinitely.\u201d\n\n\u2018Build back better\u2019\n\nPromising to \u201ccollectively catalyse\u201d hundreds of billions of infrastructure investment for low- and middle-income countries, the G7 leaders said they would offer a \u201cvalues-driven, high-standard and transparent\u201d partnership.\n\nTheir \u201cBuild Back Better World\u201d (B3W) project is aimed squarely at competing with China\u2019s trillion-dollar Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, which has been widely criticised for saddling small countries with unmanageable debt.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose nation has huge investments in China, called it an \u201cimportant initiative\u201d that was much needed in infrastructure-poor Africa.\n\nBritain meanwhile hailed G7 agreement on the \u201cCarbis Bay Declaration\u201d \u2014 a series of commitments to curb future pandemics after Covid-19 wrecked economies and claimed millions of lives around the world.\n\nThe collective steps include slashing the time taken to develop and license vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for any future disease to under 100 days, while reinforcing global surveillance networks.\n\nThe G7 \u2014 Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States \u2014 will formally publish the pact on Sunday, alongside the summit communique containing further details on the B3W.\n\nCovid vaccines\n\n\u201cThe #CarbisBayDeclaration marks a proud and historic moment for us all,\u201d British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Twitter.\n\nWorld Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, criticised in some quarters for being too accommodating towards China where the coronavirus originated, welcomed the health pact.\n\nThe G7 leaders are also expected to pledge to donate one billion vaccine doses to poor countries this year and next \u2014 although campaigners say the rollout is much too slow to end the crisis now.\n\nAfter briefing the leaders in Cornwall, Tedros said he had set them the challenge of vaccinating at least 70 percent of the world\u2019s population by their next summit in Germany in 2022.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the generous announcement made by G7 nations about donations of vaccines but we need more and we need them faster,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cImmediate donations are vital.\u201d\n\nAid charity Oxfam said the declaration \u201cdoes nothing to address the fundamental problems that are preventing vaccines being accessible to the vast majority of humanity\u201d.\n\n\u2018Concrete action\u2019\n\nThe G7 was joined Saturday by the leaders of Australia, South Africa and South Korea, with India taking part remotely, for a wide-ranging discussion about foreign policy challenges.\n\nThe regimes of Belarus and Myanmar are among those in the G7\u2019s sights. Biden pushed also for measures against China\u2019s alleged forced labour practices, including against the Uyghur minority.\n\nA US official said Biden wanted \u201cconcrete action\u201d on the forced labour accusations, calling them \u201can affront to human dignity, and an egregious example of China\u2019s unfair economic competition\u201d.\n\nChina denies allegations that it is waging \u201cgenocide\u201d by forcing up to one million Uyghurs and people from other ethnic-Turkic minorities into internment camps in the region of Xinjiang.\n\nPutin weighs in\n\nThe US president will also seek to address frayed relations with Moscow, in particular over its cyber activity.\n\nMost of the G7 leaders will reconvene Monday in Brussels for a NATO meeting, before Biden heads on to his first summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva, vowing to deliver a blunt message about Russian behaviour.\n\nIn an interview with US network NBC News released Friday, Putin voiced hope that Biden would exhibit none of the \u201cimpulse-based movements\u201d of Trump, who notoriously sided with the Russian leader against the views of his own intelligence chiefs.\n\nAFP",
