          "title": "Okagbare: Nigeria disqualified from World Championships women\u2019s relay",
          "text": "Nigeria have lost their potential qualification place for the women\u2019s 4\u00d7100-metre relay at next month\u2019s World Athletics Championships in the United States of America.\n\nHead of the Athletics Integrity Unit, Brett Clothier, made this known in a statement on Monday.\n\nAccording to him, this is because Blessing Okagbare, who was part of the team that secured Nigeria\u2019s qualification, was found to have committed anti-doping rule violations.\n\nHe explained that six days after Okagbare evaded sample collection in June 2021, she competed in the 4x100m relay event at the Nigeria Olympic Trials, with her relay squad qualifying for this year\u2019s World Championships.\n\nWhile noting that all individual and relay results involving Okagbare, from June 13, 2021, are now disqualified, Clothier said, \u201cOver the years, we have repeatedly seen how one person\u2019s actions adversely affect team-mates who have trained hard and worked honestly for their results.\n\n\u201cIn a relay team, if one member violates the anti-doping rules, everyone bears the brunt of results being expunged. They all pay the price. In this instance, Nigeria has lost an important qualification spot. Those are the rules and we will not compromise on integrity.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Okagbare has had her current 10-year ban from athletics extended by one year (now 11 years in total).\n\nAccording to a copy of the document obtained by our correspondent, Okagbare is deemed to have admitted the anti-doping rule violations (under Rule 2.3 and Rule 2.5 of the World Athletics Anti-Doping Rules) and to have accepted the consequences.\n\nThe 33-year-old, who is also a sprinter, was expelled from the Tokyo Olympics last year before the women\u2019s 100m semi-finals after testing positive for human growth hormone at an out-of-competition test in Slovakia on July 19.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that in February 2022, the Disciplinary Tribunal banned Okagbare for 10 years \u2013 consecutive five-year bans for the presence and use of multiple prohibited substances, and for her refusal to co-operate with the AIU\u2019s investigation into her case.\n\nThe prohibited substances were human Growth Hormone (hGH) and recombinant erythropoietin (EPO).\n\nThe decision stemmed from charges which the AIU brought against Okagbare on October 7, 2021.\n\nOn June 10, 2022, the AIU further charged Okagbare with Evading Sample Collection, and Tampering or Attempted Tampering with the Doping Control process.\n\nThe charges related to the circumstances of the athlete\u2019s whereabouts failure on June 13, 2021, and were pursued based on information in a criminal charge, brought against US-based \u201cnaturopathic\u201d therapist Eric Lira, on 12 January, 2022, by the United States Department of Justice under the Rodchenkov Act.\n\nLira was alleged to have supplied performance-enhancing drugs to athletes before the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games (delayed until summer 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic).\n\nPart of the document read, \u201cOn the basis that the Athlete is deemed to have admitted the anti-doping rule violations under Rule 2.3 ADR and Rule 2.5 ADR and accepted the consequences set out in the Second Charge, the AIU confirms by this decision the following consequences for the anti-doping rule violations: an increase of one (1) year to the period of Ineligibility of five (5) years already imposed upon the Athlete by the Tribunal in the Decision in accordance with Rule 10.4 ADR\u201d.\n\n\u201cDisqualification of the Athlete\u2019s results since 13 June 2021, with all resulting Consequences, including the forfeiture of any titles, awards, medals, points prizes and appearance money; and\n\n40.3. disqualification of the results of any relay team in which the Athlete competed since 13 June 2021 in accordance with Rule 11.3.1 ADR.\n\n\u201cThis decision constitutes the final decision of the AIU pursuant to Rule 8.5.6 ADR.\n\n\u201cFurther to Rule 13.2.3 ADR, the Athlete, the World Anti-Doping Agency (\u201cWADA\u201d) and the Nigerian National Anti-Doping Committee have a right of appeal against this decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland, in accordance with the procedure set out at Rule 13.6.1 ADR.\u201d",

          "title": "Scarcity: FG to sanction erring fuel stations, maintains N165 pump price",
          "text": "The Federal Government has threatened to sanction any fuel stations or depot selling above the stipulated approved pump price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS).\n\nThe threat followed the persistent fuel scarcity being witnessed in the FCT and its environs as well as in other parts of the country.\n\nMr Farouk Ahmed, Authority Chief Executive, Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) gave the warning on Monday during a joint inspection on fuel stations in Abuja.\n\nThe exercise was carried out in collaboration with some top officials of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), Petroleum Pipeline and Marketing Company (PPMC) and the NMDPRA.\n\nHe said the inspection aimed at taking action to enforce the regulations by following up warning given to the oil marketing companies, particularly those selling over the official price of N148 kobo.\n\nHe explained that the pump price of PMS was still N165 per litre and remained sacrosanct, adding that nothing had changed and government had not made any other decision on that.\n\nHe said it would take an action against defaulters because based on its engagement with the Depots and Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPMAN) and Major Oil Marketers of Nigeria (MOMAN), they were warned against over price at the depot.\n\nHe said as a regulator, there were series of actions it could take which included withdrawal of service from a particular depot, shutting and sanctioning them because nobody was above the law and we must enforce the regulations.\n\nAccording to him, the inspection has been an on-going exercise; the authority has seven teams going round in different locations while NNPC has its own teams going round in many locations with support from the security agencies.\n\n\u201cWe are actually trying to monitor the dispensing to ensure that all the stations with petrol are dispensing all their trucks to reduce the long queues and ensure efficiency in service.\n\n\u201cWe are monitoring the depot sales also, checking the number of truck that loaded; this is a serious fact which we look at.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of improvement in the distribution of PMS, we have gone round the Airport road and saw a lot of stations selling and discharging fuel.\n\n\u201cThe queues are not long like before and the average trucks we have received in Abuja in the last three days are about 140 trucks against 70 trucks to 80 trucks received before; so there is a lot of improvement.\n\n\u201cCredit also goes to transporters because now they are reacting to the President\u2019s offer of additional N10 as an incentive on their transportation charges. At least we are seeing the improvement,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that President Muhammadu Buhari recently approved the upward review in freight rate of oil transporters to alleviate challenges associated with PMS distribution nationwide.\n\nThe revised freight rate of PMS took effect from June 1, still maintaining the current regulated pump price of N165 per litre.\n\nAhmed explained that the president in his wisdom increased the freight rate of transporters by N10 which was a huge jump from N10.46 kobo to additional N10 and now N20.46 kobo\n\nAhmed said this was just to show that the transporters could still transport the product across the nation without loss of revenue which they were complaining about.\n\nOn black marketers, he said it was engaging with key oil marketers and had advised them to warn their station managers to stop selling to Jerrican peddlers because it was one of the causes of the problems.\n\n\u201cOnce they do not comply, we are going to shut and deal with that particular station affected,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMr Adeyemi Adetunji, Group Executive Director, Downstream, NNPC Ltd. reassured Nigerians that there was adequate supply of fuel.\n\n\u201cToday we have 1.9 billion litres of PMS; Lagos is cleared in a couple of days; we will clear the queues in Abuja,\u2019\u2019 Adetunji added.\n\nNAN reports that the fuel stations inspected were Shafa Energy, Shema, Ardova Plc. and NIPCO fuel stations on Lugbe \u2013 Airport Road.\n\nSome of the motorists at the stations expressed excitement with the availability of fuel as against previous days and urged the government to sustain it to ease the queues and difficulties being witnessed.\n\nThe inspection also had in attendance Mr Isiyaku Abdullahi, Managing Director, PPMC, Mr Garbadeen Muhammad, Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, NNPC Ltd. and Mrs Abdulkadir Maijiddah, Abuja Regional Coordinator, NMDPRA, among others.

          "text": "\u2026Says only the Commander-in-Chief constitutionally empowered to give directive to Armed Forces on Policy Implementation\n\nBy Kingsley Omonobi\n\nFollowing the directive by the Zamfara State government to citizens of the state to bear arms to defend themselves against unstoppable banditry and terrorist\u2019s attacks, the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor has said that the Attorney General of the Federation has a duty to tell Nigerians if the Governor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle has the powers to ask citizens to bear arms.\n\nThis is just as the CDS insisted that only the Commander-In-Chief has the constitutional powers to give directives to the armed forces as an instrument of policy implementation\n\nHe pointed out that already there are actions that members of the security agencies and the armed forces, in particular, and the police and other security agencies, are taking to address insecurity in Zamfara and environs.\n\nSpeaking at the opening of a Joint Exercise for the National Defence College and War Colleges of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, code named \u201cExercise Grand Nationale,\u201d in Abuja, Irabor said the directive to citizens was not right, as the armed forces and other security agencies were there to handle the challenges.\n\nReiterating that he was yet to understand the basis for asking the citizens of Zamfara to bear arms, he said,, \u201cIt was the responsibility of the Attorney General of the Federation to look at the constitution and the laws to see whether the governor had such powers.\n\n\u201cI believe that, in my view, it is not the right way to go.\n\n\u201cOf course, there are actions that members of the security agencies and the armed forces, in particular, the police and other security agencies, are doing to address insecurity in Zamfara and environs.\n\n\u201cBeyond that, of course, there are other legal issues, other issues of governance, issues that the government could have addressed using the instrumentality of the law that are available for him to bring greater peace and security.\n\n\u201cBut like I said, I do not intend to say much about it, but I believe that the Federal Government, using the Attorney General, will look at the details of that press release and give further instruction.\n\n\u201cIf what I read is true, I do not also think that the governor has the power to instruct the commissioner of police to issue licenses, because the commissioner of police does not have the powers to issue licenses.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the armed forces was only an instrument of policy implementation, which do not take instructions from state governments adding that the constitution gave such rights and powers only to the Commander-in-Chief for the use of the armed forces.\n\nHis words, \u201cI believe that what we are doing in Zamfara and of course, across the states of the federation, is in deference to the provisions of the constitution.\n\n\u201cSo, we are there because we are there to give support to the civil authority, in this case, the police.\n\n\u201cWe do not need to restate what the issues are that have led to the deployment of military across the country are, but then, like I said, we are doing the very best to ensure that peace returns to every part of the country.\u201d",

I had advised you even in the days preceding your election as Governor that the Imo people deserve and will only be enamoured by bold, ambitious and visionary legacy projects such as the Owerri/ Okigwe Road and Owerri/ Orlu Road. I am glad that your audacious ongoing reconstruction of those roads tallies directly with that advice.\n\n\u201cMy office has constantly been the first to respond to breaking news about your government. Since my appointment, I have consistently used my intellectual acumen to counter the attacks on your government and advanced unimpeachable arguments on your behalf which have been widely acclaimed even by your opponents. Your political opponents have been my political opponents and your allies have been my allies.\n\n\u201cThis is not to say that I am not disappointed in your failure to run an inclusive government outside your chosen insular inner circle. Your undemocratic and opaque leadership style has caused me no small unrest. I have been appalled not merely for my political interest but on account of common decency. I was repeatedly left in the dark and denied access to power in a government and vision I played an unwavering and consistent leading role in birthing from 2001 to 2020. During this period, I never changed, disbelieved, vacillated or cross-carpeted.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs your political adviser, I was not afforded the respect of my office or reimbursed my legitimate expenses such as Imprest of my office from inauguration till date. Your Excellency, for 28 (twenty-eight) months, I spent the sum of N2,400,000 (Two Million Four Hundred Thousand Naira) monthly from my pocket in running the office which you appointed and inaugurated me into.\n\n\u201cThese expenses were made on account of payment of staff salary, logistics, feeding, media, printing, travel, events, meetings and several other sub-heads of payment. Furthermore, I spent the sum of N10,000,000 to furnish the government residence in Commissioners Quarters which I was allocated. This is a total amount of N77,200,000 (Seventy-Seven Million Two Hundred Thousand Naira). I humbly use this medium to once again request your Excellency to instruct that these expenses be reimbursed to me,\u201d he said.\n\nReacting, the Imo state governor, through his State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, said: \u201cThe state government has received the resignation letter of Batos Nwadike as the Special Adiviser to the Governor on Political Afffairs. His Excellency, the Governor of Imo state Senator Hope Uzodimma has accepted his resignation. He thanks him for his services and wishes him well in his future endeavors.\u201d",

We do not want this to recur.\n\n\u201cThe education of the girl-child is very paramount in our hearts. No Muslim girl should ever be told to choose between her faith and education. Both are her rights.\n\n\u201cWe demand that the Lagos State Government issue a circular within 30 days after the delivery of the judgement allowing Hijab.\n\n\u201cThe Lagos State Government should sanction officials who go against the Supreme Court judgment and hold a meeting with MSSNLagos, Muslim leaders and other Islamic organisations on the size and modalities of using the hijab.\u201d\n\nOn her part, Asiyat AbdulKareem, who sued the Lagos State Government, urged that victimisation of Muslim students should stop.\n\n\u201cWe suffered to get this judgement and it is my hope that it will be an end to the victimisation someone like me suffered,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, the Ameerah (female head) of MSSNLagos, Basheerah Majekodunmi, called on all Muslims to be lawful and report any violation to the appropriate quarters.\n\n\u201cWe call on all Nigerians, irrespective of tribe or religion to join this voice as part of solidarity with the Muslim women most especially the female secondary school students, who are brazenly and incessantly harassed and assaulted because they wear hijab to schools in their own country,\u201d she said.\n\nOn her part, Executive Secretary of Hijab Rights Advocacy Initiative, Shereefat Enessi, commended the Supreme Court for the judgement.\n\n\u201cIt is not a victory for the Muslims alone, it is a victory for civilization, for democracy and for peace.\n\n\u201cWe are not all Muslims and as such understanding the importance of a religious command like hijab may not be easy.\n\n\u201cBut at least we are all in the same boat that is Nigeria, pulling each other down would only take us all down,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, the National Amir of MSSN, Uthman Abubakar, lamented that Muslim students have for long suffered discrimination.\n\nAbubakar, who was represented by the General Secretary of MSSN Lagos, Hamzah AbdulFattah, said, \u201cThe MSSN salutes the courage, understanding and application of the Constitutional law as it is by the panel of the justices.\n\n\u201cThe judgment is manifestly credible and guarantees as one of the fundamental human rights granted to Muslims and any other adherents of a religion.\u201d\n\nVanguard News",

The school is lacking in everything, including security, because the children have traumatic experiences almost every day with the seniors brutalizing them and stealing their belongings.\n\n\u201cMy late brother-in-law\u2019s son by name, Emediong Akpan, was admitted into SS1, and that same term, a senior student hit him on the chest and he started vomiting blood.\n\n\u201cWhen my husband tried to arrest the student, the school management promised to handle it. Since that day, Emediong\u2019s life has never been the same until he graduated,\u201d another parent recalled.\n\nExplaining the circumstances surrounding Rita\u2019s death, the Chairman of the Parents Teachers Association (PTA) of the school, Dr. Itoro Ikoh, appealed for calm, after meeting with the school management on the matter.\n\nHer words: \u201cMiss Rita was a JS1 student. I was told she felt pains in her stomach at night. The following morning, while her house mistress was on routine check, she ordered that Rita be taken to the sickbay. She was attended to, but on cross-examination, she was observed to be a complicated one which required referral.\n\n\u201cUmbilical hernia was diagnosed and the attention of Rita\u2019s parents were required. When we spoke, the mother told us that she usually gave her vinegar to calm the stomach ache, but she was later taken to the hospital where she died,\u201d Dr. Ikoh said.",

          "text": "Bureaux de Change (BDC) operators are seeking stake in the $20 billion yearly diaspora remittances that constitute a large part of dollar inflows to the economy, President, Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON), Aminu Gwadabe, has announced.\n\nThe ABCON chief, who spoke in Lagos at the weekend, said expanding dollar receipt points through over 5,000 BDC operators would deepen dollar inflows and significantly raise Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange position.\n\nGwadabe said globally, BDCs remain one of the channels through which the diaspora remittance funds come into countries.\n\nHe said the BDCs remain at the centre of economic development and have the capacity to attract needed capital for the development of the Nigerian economy and deepening of forex market.\n\nHe said success of BDCs would be boosted by access to multiple streams of forex earnings to deepen the market, keep the naira stable and boost BDCs operations.\n\n\u201cMaking BDCs one of the channels through which over $20 billion annual Diaspora remittances enter the economy will give depth to forex market and boost BDCs operations. Nigerian BDCs operators have also identified with the immense opportunities presented by Diaspora remittances and want to play greater role in attracting more foreign capital into the economy.\n\n\u201c The reason for this is that remittances are known to help poorer recipients meet basic needs, fund cash and non-cash investments, finance education, foster new businesses, service debt and essentially, drive economic growth,\u201d Gwadabe said.\n\nHe said naira volatility despite foreign exchange interventions by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is being compounded by rising inflation, interest rate hike and slow economic growth with consequences for middle- and low-income earners, has said.\n\nHe said the unfolding scenarios raise the risk of stagflation with potentially harmful consequences for the poor within the economy.\n\nHe said already, global growth is expected to slump from 5.7 per cent in 2021 to 2.9 per cent in 2022\u2014 significantly lower than 4.1 per cent predicted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in January.\n\nTo keep the economy strong, Gwadabe called for improved local production and diversification of the economy from oil.\n\nHe said the naira exchanges at N614/$1 at the parallel market, dollar bids continues to rise as inflation rose to11-month high (17.71 per cent) in May.\n\nThese occurrences, the ABCON boss said, are eroding the purchasing power of households. \u201cThe biggest driver of inflation is the stubborn rise in food inflation. The average price level of the food basket rose by 1.13 per cent to 19.50 per cent in May from 18.37 per cent in April. This can be reversed by increased support for agriculture and government policies that support the sector,\u201d he said.\n\nGwadabe said Nigeria\u2019s huge population and diaspora market, which attracts an average of $20 billion yearly could be explored to deepen dollar inflows to the economy.\n\nGwadabe urged the CBN to liberalise the foreign exchange market, ensure paradigms shift from demand to supply measures, support SMEs infrastructure /joint venture finance, promote skills awareness for operators, ensure more collaborations among stakeholders and make industry-friendly policies for the good of the economy.",

The nation\u2019s foreign exchange reserves have dropped four per cent this year to $38.8 billion, despite the government tapping the overseas bond market twice.\n\nThe naira weakened to N614 per dollar at the parallel market from N610 a week earlier, according to Abubakar Mohammed, a Lagos-based bureau de change (BDC) operator.\n\nThe global head of Index Management Research at MSCI Craig Feldman, said given the prolonged nature of the issues affecting the market\u2019s accessibility, the company has put forth the consultation to reclassify the MSCI Nigeria Indexes.\n\nAlso, President, Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON), Aminu Gwadabe, said more individuals and businesses are finding it difficult to buy dollars at the banks and are resorting to the black market. \u201cThere is no liquidity, the banks are not meeting up,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the official market, the naira rate declined 0.2 per cent to 417.79, widening the spread over the parallel market rate to 47 per cent.\n\nCordros Capital reported at the weekend that Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange reserves recorded another accretion this week, as it grew by $220.04 million week-on-week to $38.88 billion. Across the FX windows, the naira appreciated by 0.3 per cent to N420.17 per dollar at the Investor & Exporter (I & E) window but depreciated by 0.8 per cent to N614 per dollar at the parallel market.\n\nSenior Research Analyst at FXTM, Lukman Otunuga expressed concerns that despite oil prices surging to multi-year highs, Nigeria has failed to cash in.\n\nHe said the destructive combination of sub-optimal oil production, poor infrastructure, and fuel subsidies have drained oil revenue that account for roughly 90 per cent of foreign exchange earnings.\n\n\u201cThe negative impacts continue to be reflected across the economy and local currency. But now the dollar shortages have attracted the attention of MSCI Inc. which is considering downgrading the MSCI Nigeria indexes to the status of a standalone market from frontier markets,\u201d Otunuga said.\n\nHe explained that a developed market is the highest ranking, followed by emerging markets, frontier markets, and then finally standalone markets at the bottom.\n\n\u201cGiven the difficulty in repatriating funds from Nigeria, this has placed the MSCI Nigeria Indexes in the crosshairs. Such a negative development may hit sentiment toward the county\u2019s assets at a crucial period where economic growth remains fragile.\n\n\u201cTo add insult to injury, the NGX All Share Index has gained roughly 20 per cent this year in local currency terms. A blockbuster performance when compared to the MSCI Emerging market Index which is down roughly -19 per cent,\u201d Otunuga said.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s mobile network operators (MNOs) last year recorded 14.86 per cent increase in total assets, despite global challenges and domestic inflationary trend that impacted operating expenses.\n\nAccording to financial data obtained from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the MNOs as at last December reported total assets of N3.955 trillion as against N3.444 trillion recorded in comparable period of the previous year.\n\nThe report also showed total operating cost (opex) of N1.658 trillion in 2021 compared with N1.395 trillion recorded the previous year. This translated to an increase of 18.74 per cent from the figure reported in 2020. Total revenue nonetheless witnessed an increase of 22.29 per cent.\n\nThe increase in operating cost of the MNOs may not be unconnected with the ever increasing cost of doing business across the country, no thanks to excruciating energy cost, multiple taxation and regulation and other asphyxiating factors.\n\nThe data indicated that telcos recorded an approximate total revenue of N2.774 trillion in 2021 as against N2.268 trillion in 2020, an increase of 22.29per cent.\n\nOn capital expenditure (capex) the end of last year, the operators reported a total capex of N1.124 trillion as against the N831.976 billion in 2020.\n\nThe subscriber and service data \u2013 voice subscriptions segment of the NCC data showed that as at last December, total active voice subscriptions for the entire market segments was 195,463,898 as against 204,601,313 recorded as at December 2020. This indicates a decrease of -4.5per cent in 2021. The teledensity was 102.40per cent in 2021 as against 107.18per cent recorded in 2020, which indicates a decrease of 4.78 per cent in Teledensity as at last December.\n\nWikipedia defined telephone density or teledensity as the number of telephone connections for every 100 individuals living within an area. It varies widely across the nations and also between urban and rural areas within a country. Telephone density has significant correlation with the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of the area.\n\nAccording to the Commission, the slump in operators\u2019 subscriber base was attributed majorly to the effect of its December 2020 directive to all operators to suspend the sale and registration of new subscriber identity modules (SIMs), SIM swaps and all porting activities following from the Commissions audit of Subscriber Registration Database in the country.\n\n\u201cThe objective of the audit exercise was to verify and ensure compliance by MNOs with the set quality standards and requirements of SIM Card Registration as issued by the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy and the Commission,\u201d the Commission explained.\n\nFurther analyses of the annual Active Voice Subscription for Mobile (GSM) Segment showed that total active voice subscriptions decreased from 204,228,678 subscriptions as at December 2020 to 195,128,265 subscriptions as at December 2021. This indicates a 4.5per cent loss in GSM active voice subscriptions year on year.\n\nOn the market share analysis of the MNOs done through the breakdown of each operator\u2018s subscription, MTN; GLO; AIRTEL and EMTS (9mobile) each recorded 73,594,682; 54,817,353; 53,926,886 and 12,789,344 subscribers respectively. In that order MTN; GLO; AIRTEL and EMTS had 37.7per cent; 28.1per cent; 27.6per cent and 6.6per cent share of the mobile GSM market respectively of the Mobile GSM Market Segment.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nJustice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad made history, yesterday, as the second Chief Justice of Nigeria(CJN) to have abruptly resigned from office.\n\nBorn on December 31, 1953 his resignation came about 18 months ahead of the mandatory retirement age of 70 years.\n\nAlthough he cited health condition as grounds for his resignation, there are speculations that his decision may not be unconnected with raging crisis at the apex court.\n\nIn a protest letter, 14 Justices of the court had accused the CJN of corruption and other administrative lapses bordering on his ineptitude on issues such as judges\u2019 welfare among others.\n\nThe letter which was leaked to the public further fueld the impasse between him and his brother Justices.\n\nThe crisis was further escalated by the ex-CJN who in his response to the memo accused his colleagues of dancing naked in the market square.\n\nDaily Sun was told by competent sources of how the Senate and Body of Benchers had waded into the crisis between the aggrieved Justices of the Supreme Court and the retired jurist.\n\n\u201cSeveral meetings were held last week between the CJN and the 14 aggrieved justices in an attempt to resolve the crisis, but they all failed as the justices who threatened to embark on strike, insisted on a thorough and comprehensive investigations of the allegations.\n\n\u201cThe Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, had directed the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters to wade into the crisis on behalf of the upper Legislative Chamber.\n\n\u201cAt the early stage of the crisis, the Emir of Lafia, Alhaji Sidi Bage Muhammed 1, who is a retired Justice of the Supreme Court, was invited to wade into the crisis but his efforts were unsuccessful, \u201c our sources revealed.\n\nWhile further attributing Justice Tanko\u2019s sudden resignation to the crisis at the apex court, another source disclosed that it got to a point where the 14 justices refused to honour further meetings with the former CJN.\n\nThe aggrieved \u201cLordships\u201d had alleged serious infirmities and irregularities in administration and his commitment and loyalty to the nation\u2019s judiciary.\n\nOther issues were the non-signing of amended Court Rules, an abrupt stoppage of foreign workshops and training per annum for justices and no provision of qualified legal assistants.\n\nThe judges specifically questioned Justice Tanko\u2019s rationale for discontinuing the nomination of justices for international seminars and training for justices on a yearly basis, accompanied by experienced legal assistants. This they said was a long consistent practice until his Lordship assumed head of the Judiciary\n\n\u2022 Buhari warns judiciary\n\nWhile swearing in Justice Olukayode Ariwoola as Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) at short ceremony at the Council Chambers of the State House, President Muhammadu Buhari urged the judiciary not to fail Nigerians so as not to lose confidence in them.\n\nPicking the gauntlet, Ariwoola assured that he would not fail Nigerians in his new assignment.\n\n\u201cWhat Nigerians expect from me is to comply, preserve and abide and protect the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. And so be it. That is what I will do especially with the cooperation of my brother Justices of the Supreme Court. We shall not fail Nigerians.\u201d\n\nOn how he intends to handle the controversy in the Supreme Court, he said: \u201cThere is no controversy in the Supreme Court. We are one with the Chief Justice. That\u2019s why you heard the president said His Lordship is disengaging on the grounds of ill-health. No controversy we\u2019re one.\u201d\n\nOn welfare issues raised in the letter addressed, he said: \u201cIt was an internal memo of the court. It was not a petition. It was not a letter. It was addressed by the brother Justices of the Chief Justice and presented to him, His Lordship directly. There were issues to be resolved amongst justices.\u201d Asked if those issues would be resolved under his leadership, he said: \u201cYeah, we\u2019ve started resolving it.\u201d\n\n\u2022NBA tasks new CJN on Judicial reforms\n\nOn its part, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) called for urgent reforms and cleansing of the Augean Stable in the nations judiciary.\n\nIn a statement, NBA President, Olumide Akpata, commended the immediate past CJN for his \u201clengthy service to the nation, and wished him quick recovery even as we pray for a well-deserved peaceful retirement.\u201d\n\nThe body of lawyers, however, added that thehis resignation could not be divorced from the raging crisis in the Supreme Court with the 14 other Justices of the court accusing him of poor handling of the affairs of the court.\n\nHe said there was near-universal agreement that public confidence in the judiciary and indeed the legal profession is at an all-time low,\n\nThe NBA said the first tasks before the acting judge should include taking steps aimed at \u201curgent reforms in the Judiciary\u201d and rebuilding \u201cthe almost dissipated confidence that Nigerians have in the Judiciary and the wider legal profession in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAkpata said the association is \u201cready to work together with His Lordship (Mr Ariwoola) and the judiciary in cleansing the Augean stable and addressing the ills that have continued to plague not just the Judiciary but the entire legal profession.\u201d\n\n\u2022Makinde hails\n\nOyo State Governor, \u2018Seyi Makinde, described the Iseyin-born Ariwoola\u2019s elevation as Acting CJN as a deserving development and reward for diligence, patriotism and service to the nation.\n\nA statement by the Special Assistant (Print Media) to the governor, Moses Alao, quoted Governor Makinde as saying that he has no doubt that the jurist would restore the glory of Apex Court and the judiciary.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that the new Acting CJN will turn around the fortunes of the judiciary and the apex court for good by bringing his wealth of experience to bear in restoring the glory of the judiciary.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the good people and government of Oyo State, I celebrate Justice Ariwoola and pray to God to grant him the needed enablements to succeed in the new office.\u201d",

          "text": "*Athletics Integrity Unit extends her ban now to 11 years\n\nDuro Ikhazuagbe\n\nThe Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) yesterday announced that banned Nigerian sprinter, Blessing Okagbare, 32, has been found to have committed additional anti-doping rule violations \u2013 specifically evading sample collection, and tampering or attempted tampering with the doping control process.For this, Okagbare\u2019s current 10-year ban from athletics has been extended by one year (now 11 years in total). Sadly for Nigeria, this decision against the former Nigerian and African champion, the country has lost the opportunity to field her ladies for the women\u2019s 4x100m relay at next month\u2019s World Athletics Championships in Oregon, USA. \u201cThis is because six days after Okagbare evaded sample collection (13 June 2021), she competed in the 4x100m relay event at the Nigeria Olympic Trials, with her relay squad qualifying for this year\u2019s World Championships,\u201d observed the AIU last night.\n\n\u201cTherefore, all individual and relay results involving Okagbare, from 13 June 2021, are now disqualified under the rules,\u201d concludes the statement from AIU last night. Okagbare was suspended on July 31, 2021 from the semi finals of the women\u2019s 100m of the last Olympic Games in Tokyo. On the even of the event last year in Tokyo, AIU announced that the double Commonwealth Games sprint winner in Glasgow had tested positive for human growth hormones. Further investigation of the case by FBI revealed that Okagbare was involved in an orchestrated doping plot involving a US-based \u201cnaturopathic\u201d therapist Eric Lira. United States Department of Justice under the Rodchenkov Act picked Mr Lira for his involvement in supply of performance-enhancing drugs to athletes. Okagbare\u2019s telephone exchanges with Lira were obtained by the FBI. Initial plans to prosecute her for criminal offenses were later dropped by the American Justice Department but this lengthy ban has sort of called time on her illustrious track & field career. Before the running into this dope matter that has now truncated her career, Okagbare won a silver medal in the long jump at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and at the 2013 world championships, the Nigerian track queen also collected a silver in the long jump as well as a bronze in the 200m at the 2013 worlds in Moscow behind gold medal winner Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce.",

The first set of the courts were fully developed and handed over to communities and schools across Africa in the last quarter of 2021.\n\nThe project being handled through the Giant of Africa Foundation which he co-founded has donated courts in Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Rwanda and Senegal between September and May 2022.\n\nIn the last few weeks Ujiri played a prominent role in getting the Nigerian government to reverse a decision that would have kept the country out international basketball for at least two years.\n\nBorn in the U.K., Ujiri spent his childhood in Nigeria. He and his peers played soccer, but Ujiri used to pass a basketball court on the way to school and would often stop to shoot a few hoops \u2013 with a soccer ball. \u201cI fell in love with the game,\u201d he told GQ magazine. \u201cI was more talented in soccer, but the game of basketball \u2013 it just blew me away.\u201d\n\nBy the early 2000s, Ujiri decided he wanted to stay in basketball, but not as a player. He coached the junior Nigerian national team and caught the eye of the NBA\u2019s Orlando Magic, becoming an (unpaid) international scout.\n\nHe was lured to the Denver Nuggets with a paid position and, over the next several years, worked in increasingly senior jobs for Denver and the Toronto Raptors before being named the Raptors\u2019 president and general manager in 2013. He was the first African to lead a North American major-league sports team \u2013 a distinction that Ujiri struggles with. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the only one. I hate that,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, being the first \u2013 I have a problem with being the only one.\u201d\n\nIn his senior role, Ujiri says it\u2019s his responsibility to promote diversity. \u201cWe have to give more Black people opportunity in our own institutions and organizations,\u201d he said in the CNN interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not only \u2018hire an intern\u2019 or \u2018hire a diversity and inclusion officer.\u2019 We have to be in positions where decisions are being made.\u201d He has also advocated for a more prominent management role for women in professional basketball and the business world.\n\nAs a leader, Ujiri is known for his exceptional ability to spot talent. In Toronto, he took a team not known for winning and turned it into a playoff contender. In 2019, the Raptors earned their first NBA championship title in their 24-year franchise history \u2013 a testament to Ujiri\u2019s skills as president, but also to his passion for the game. \u201cWe all want to be ambitious, but passion will lead you to incredible places,\u201d he said in the GQ interview. \u201cI will serve (the game) with every last breath in my body, with all the blood in my body. I believe in [it] that much.\u201d\n\nIn 2003, Ujiri founded Giants of Africa, a non-profit basketball camp active in 10 African countries that aims to give young players \u2013 both boys and girls \u2013 the skills to compete at an international level.",

          "text": "Fellow Americans,\n\nNobody knows the joy of winning better than I do, believe me. I have always been a winner for as long as I can remember. Okay? Nobody knows the beauty of fighting to win better than I do. I am always a fighter and when I fight, I win. Everybody knows that.\n\nI have reached the very top. Absolutely. And I reached the top at a very tremendous speed. You all know it. The first time I ran for office, I ran for president. It was beautiful. Right? What usually takes great men three attempts before they get a win, I won in a landslide the very first time I ran. I heard that it has never been done anywhere else in the world.\n\nIn the last four years, I have accomplished for America things that presidents that were in office for twelve years did not accomplish. It is not even close. I made America a big-league winner again. I put billions and billions of dollars into your pockets through my amazing tax cuts. I have shown you that everything is possible if you have the right man to do the right job. Everybody is saying so.\n\nAll over the world, there is huge respect for America again, in some cases, even massive fear. Bigly! Which is good. I made it happen. Nobody messes with America because I highly insisted on it. I placed America first, which is fair. I stopped those out of control dope and overrated countries that get away with murder at the expense of America. It didn\u2019t happen again. Not on my watch! I was tough so that America would be triumphant.\n\nThe world had never seen anything like that before.\n\nBecause of me, the next generation of Americans will grow up knowing that America is the greatest nation on earth, full of courageous men like me. Thanks to me, they will grow up knowing that ours is a Christian nation where it is allowed to say Merry Christmas. Our children and grandchildren will grow up knowing that the whole world is out there for them to dominate and not bow to the sissies who think that we must worship the environment at the expense of the staggering economy that I built.\n\nFrankly, I have done everything that I set out to do \u2013 most of which were things that have never been done before. I have in place the greatest military that humans ever assembled for our incredible men and women in uniform. I assembled it in just four years by rebuilding our powerful military that they destroyed due to neglect and incompetence. I secured America from coast to coast with walls and wires, cages and visa bans. I took care of it, just as I promised I would do. I returned America under God. Before I came, they had taken America to the shrines of the devil.\n\nAmericans love me because of these outstanding accomplishments. I have seen it on the faces of fabulous Americans while I travelled around the country in the last few weeks.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I could stay around and fight.

I won\u2019t be surprised if, by January 20, 2021, my face would go up on Mount Rushmore to join other presidents of my calibre. It won\u2019t surprise me one bit. People think it is going to happen.\n\nTo all my special supporters, I say thank you for the unbelievable fantastic ride. Don\u2019t despair, for I will send you a brilliant comforter. Those stupid little lightweights on the other side who have no clue may taunt you. When those clowns do, remind the goofy and crooked losers that I made America great again. Tell those terrible lowlifes that they have proved themselves unworthy of Donald Trump\u2019s genius and have opted to reduce America to a Second Class nation in the world. Total Disaster!\n\nSo, my fellow American, I bide you all farewell. May God bless you, and my God bless the United States of America.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPresident Donald J.

          "title": "The Teflon President With Nine Lives Is On His Way Out By Dr. Wumi Akintide",
          "text": "You probably know who I am talking about. The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump. Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives?\n\nNot by a long shot. The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.\n\nYou would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.\n\nWhat is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that. America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God\u2019s own country.\n\nIn cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.\n\nEven though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a \u201cdump.\u201d\n\nThe guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education. Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the \u201cC\u201d average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything. He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world. Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today. His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America\u2019s traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nDonald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined. He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House.\n\nThe one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin. He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years. He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen.\n\nThe Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House.\n\nEven though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.\n\nMy point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.\n\nIi is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year.\n\nIf Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life.\n\nI seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up. Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness. Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud. Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source.\n\nGerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.\n\nGeorge Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his \u201cread my lips\u201d pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.\n\nI gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America. Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America. Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by \u201cgrabbing their pussies\u201d because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder. He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan. Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again. Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years.\n\nRepublicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years.\n\nThey elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI. Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman\u2019s mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea.\n\nRepublicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin. He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way. Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders. They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East. Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor.\n\nThe list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less. Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as \u201cfake news\u201d disseminators.\n\nHe has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few.\n\nWhat atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed? The list is inexhaustible. The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do. Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it.\n\nIt is a complete outrage and totally incredible!\n\nI rest my case.\n\nDr. Wumi Akintide",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

MTN claims that the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts maintained by the 18 banks\u2019 customers.\n\nIn the suit, Chief Executive Officer of MoMo PSB, Anthony Usoro Usoro, also claimed that the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period. Upon realising the fraud on May 24, MoMo PSB reportedly shut down its service to prevent further liability.\n\n\u201cThe transfers were due to the fact that the plaintiff suffered system exploitation which led to the said debits. There is no transaction between the plaintiff [MoMo PSB] and the recipient account holders that warranted the transfer of the funds to those accounts,\u201d Usoro said in the supporting affidavit.\n\nThe CEO also mentioned that it was resorting to legal action upon the banks\u2019 insistence that only court orders could bring action for reversal.\n\nThe affected banks, listed as defendants in the suit, include Access Bank, Ecobank, Fidelity Bank, FirstBank, First City Monument Bank, Guaranty Trust Bank, Heritage Bank, Polaris Bank, Providus Bank, Stanbic IBTC, Standard Chartered, Sterling Bank, SunTrust Bank, Union Bank, United Bank for Africa, Unity Bank, Wema Bank, and Zenith Bank.\n\nMoMo PSB is now seeking a court\u2019s order for a refund for the \u20a622.3 billion ($53.7 million) it claims. \u201cBy virtue of the provisions of the CBN Regulation on Instant (Inter-Bank) Electronic Funds Transfer Services, made pursuant to sections 2(D), 33(1)6) And 47(2) of the CBN Act 2007 the plaintiff is entitled to a return of its money and the provision of the information which it requires from the defendants,\u201d the suit read.\n\nThis event is coming 2 months after MTN gained approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria to run a payment service bank.\n\nIt is presently not clear how these actions will affect MTN\u2019s MoMo customers.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "BY NSE ANTHONY-UKO, Abuja\n\nThe group managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mallam Mele Kyari has attributed the LEADERSHIP Award to the teamwork of the management and staff of the company, noting that the recognition would not have been possible without the collective efforts of all NNPC staffers.\n\nHe spoke yesterday when he received the award letter, presented to him by the editor-in-chief, LEADERSHIP Group Ltd, Mr Azu Ishiekwene, who led other management staff on a courtesy visit to the NNPC Towers.\n\nKyari emerged LEADERSHIP CEO of The Year2021 for his strategic intervention in turning the NNPC into a profit-making national oil company and driving the present administration\u2019s gas revolution among other innovations.\n\nAn elated Kyari said, \u201cIt is really a privilege to be recognised by LEADERSHIP as \u2018CEO Of The Year\u2019. To me, CEO means chief education officer, if you cannot educate you shouldn\u2019t be a CEO, and you can\u2019t execute if you don\u2019t have people to work with you.?\n\nHe described NNPC as the largest enterprise in the country, saying it hosts the brightest of people that can be found in the oil industry.\n\nHe said, \u201cThey (multinational oil companies) know that we have better-skilled people in NNPC than they do. They know that we have better capacity than they do.\n\n\u201cWe are very proud of this and any recognition anyone has here is to all of us. It would not have been possible without the collective efforts of all of us. And I congratulate our team for the recognition and we\u2019ll continue to execute in a critical manner, particularly in an area where we can get our economy supported by making sure that energy is available to all Nigerians in an affordable and sustainable manner so that prosperity can be generated in a bigger way and ultimately many of the indices that you have seen around including lack of security and peace would be minimised.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the gesture and the consideration and on behalf of all of us here, we thank you most immensely.\u201d\n\nKyari said the overall plan is to make NNPC operate as a multi-trillion naira company, the most capitalised company in the country, having the highest assets of any company in Africa and be the biggest company in Africa.\n\nHe admitted that the NNPC has had its constraints which were being addressed through the Petroleum Industry Act.\n\n\u201cIt simply means that this is the company that will compete with anyone else in any manner possible as allowed by the law, and we will do better than any other company. More than that we have a responsibility to be accountable to our shareholders, the over 200 million Nigerians and that is why we are doing very many strange things that companies don\u2019t do. One of them is that we are the only company that publishes its activities on monthly basis, it\u2019s not done anywhere in the world. We have challenged many companies to come out and do the same and no one can do this.\n\n\u201cSecondly, against all odds that you may think, we dared and published our audited financial statements and with the team spirit that we have, we were able to cut our costs and shape our business and we came out with positive numbers subsequently.\n\n\u201cWe are now publishing all the PMS evacuation from the depots. Every litre of product that has left the depot, we publish it and those that are available. Anyone can cross check it. We are also moving down to the level of the states, we will know for each state which area and which filling station it goes to and whether or not it was sold in the filling station. We have full data around every litre of product that comes into the country.\n\n\u201cNext, we are trying to refine so that we\u2019ll have refined product data. We can also tell Nigerians, what this subsidy conversation means and put numbers around it and publish for Nigerians to see\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the Editor-in-Chief of LEADERSHIP, Mr Azu Ishiekwene told the NNPC Management that the award was in recognition of Kyari\u2019s modest efforts in repositioning the NNPC and putting it on the path to profitability.\n\nMr Ishiekwene was accompanied on the visit by the group managing director, LEADERSHIP Group Ltd, Muazu Elazeh and director, LEADERSHIP Group Ltd, Mr Abraham Nda-Isaiah.\n\nThe formal presentation of the award and conference is scheduled to be held on 17th May, 2022 at the International Conference Centre.",

We neither authored nor own any such document, and it certainly did not emanate from our Party\u201d, said Felix Morka, spokesman of the APC.\n\nHe alleged that \u201cthe document is the handiwork of very sick elements of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in a desperate quest for unmerited electoral advantage by attempting to smear our Party with wrong doing.\n\n\u201cIn their zealous attempt to mudsling, the document\u2019s authors senselessly alleged that our Party proposes to apply nearly half of the country\u2019s entire 2022 budget to buy votes. How in the world does a government operating a national budget of N17trillion dole out N6.5trillion to rig elections? It clearly betrays the authors\u2019 extreme ignorance of the complexity of the systems and processes for the appropriation and utilization of state funds.\n\n\u201cOnly a party that is a masterful looter of the national treasury such as the PDP can even imagine another capable of engaging in the kinds of atrocious acts the document suggests\u201d, he stated.",

          "text": "I Was Admitted Into Secondary School But Dropped Out Due To Poverty \u2013Tinubu Once Admitted Not Attending Government College Ibadan\n\nReactions have continued to trail the reports that the Presidential Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, did not submit his primary and secondary school certificates to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nTinubu had in an affidavit submitted to INEC as part of his eligibility filings for the 2023 presidential elections claimed that his school certificates were stolen by unknown persons during the military regime.\n\nThe documents released last Friday showed that the APC presidential candidate left the columns for his primary and secondary education unmarked.\n\nThe latest claims however contradict his previous election submission in 1999 when he contested as Lagos State Governor. He claimed both times that he attended primary and secondary schools.\n\nAccording to him, he attended St Paul Children\u2019s Home School, Ibadan, between 1958 and 1964 while his secondary education was at Government College, Ibadan, between 1965 and 1968.\n\nThe controversies about the former governor\u2019s certificates however started not later than 1999, documents seen by SaharaReporters revealed.\n\nOn August 12, 1999, one Alhaji Jameed Seriki wrote a petition accusing Tinubu of perjury and forging the credentials that qualified him to run for the gubernatorial election in Lagos State.\n\nAccording to the allegations, there was a discrepancy in the age of the governor since the profile published during his inauguration stated that he was born in 1952 and the age on his transcript at the Chicago State University claimed that he was born in 1954.\n\n\u201cThat the governor did not attend Government College, Ibadan, as was stated in his profile and INEC FORM CF.001.\n\n\u201cThe governor did not attend University of Chicago as claimed in INEC FORM CF and an affidavit sworn to at the Ikeja High Court of Justice on 29th December 1998,\u201d Seriki had claimed in the petition.\n\nConsequently, the then Lagos Speaker, Olorunimbe Mamora, on Tuesday, September 21, 1999, set up a five-man ad hoc committee to investigate the allegations and report back to the House.\n\nThe committee comprised Hon. Babajide Omoworare (Chairman), Hon. Thomas Ayodele Fadeyi, Hon. Adeniyi Akinmade, Hon. Ibrahim Gbola Gbabijo and Hon Saliu Olaitan Mustapha.\n\nIn its report to the House, the Committee stated that Tinubu appeared before it on Thursday, September 23, 1999.\n\n\u201cThe Governor of Lagos State started his evidence by admitting \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for some of the \u201cneedless errors\u201d being pointed at in recent publications and which formed the basis of allegations against him. The governor told the Committee that as a result of the acrimonious primaries of the Alliance for Democracy in Lagos State and its attendant crisis, the information contained in both the INEC form and affidavit of loss of certificates was supplied by Senator Tokunbo Afikuyomi.\n\n\u201cThe governor then submitted to the Committee a copy of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) senatorial candidate form dated June 1, 1992, which he used to contest the 1992 senatorial election as candidate of the party for Lagos West. In the form, which he personally filled, the governor attached the certificates of Richard Daley College and Chicago State University. For his educational qualifications he filled B.Sc Accounting only,\u201d part of the report read.\n\nIt read further, \u201cThis according to him demonstrated that \u201cneedless errors\u201d spotted in the 1999 INEC form were not consistent and that they were \u201cgenuine errors\u201d. He further directed the attention of the committee to the INEC form CFO1 that bore a wrong date of twenty-eight December 1999 instead of twenty-eight December 1998. The error he said was made by INEC which printed the form. And not even the Commissioner of Oath detected the error.\n\n\u201cThis in his view further confirmed that the hurried and confused manner under which the preparations for the governorship primaries of 1998 were gave room to error on all sides\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Governor spoke about his difficult and traumatic youth and how he scaled the hurdles of life as a self made man. After his primary education, the Governor said he was admitted into secondary school but he could not further his education because of his poverty.\n\n\u201cThe Governor thus had to engage in menial jobs before he proceeded to the United States of America in search of the Golden Fleece. The Governor informed us that in America, he undertook various odd jobs and tried to improve himself academically. After five years of the most harrowing work experience, the Governor said he enrolled at Richard Daley College in Chicago, which among others offers basic, remedial and academic classes, preparatory to entering Chicago State University. He presented a photocopy of a certificate issued by Richard Daley College (City Colleges of Chicago), a copy of which is attached as herewith and marked as \u201cAnnexure 5\u2033.\n\n\u201cThroughout the time he studied in Chicago, the Governor said he also had to fend for himself and that he actually paid his way through school by working extra hours as a tutor in the same university. He said he studied for extra hours, especially during summer. The Governor said 27 (twenty-seven) credit hours were transferred from Richard Daley College to Chicago State University, where he obtained Bachelor of Science in Business and Administration. His major was in Accounting.\u201d",

          "text": "By Kenneth Atavti\n\nNewly licensed Mobile Money Payment Service Bank Limited (MOMO PSB) a banking subsidiary of MTN Communications Limited has in less than a month operations suffered a massive fraud worth over N22 billion on its network.\n\nCourt processes in a suit instituted by the Mobile Money Bank against 18 Banks and obtained by Nigerian Pilot revealed that an aggregate sum of N22.3 million, equivalent to about $53.7 million was erroneously transferred to accounts maintained by customers of 18 different banks in the country.\n\nIn an originating summons dated May 30, 2022 and filled before a Federal High Court, MTN\u2019s MOMO payment Bank is seeking court declaration that the deposits of the said sum of N22.3 billion allegedly erroneously transferred by the company to the accounts of customers of the 18 banks having been done in error belong to MTN\u2019s MOMO PSB and not to the customers of the banks.\n\nThe requests formed part of the reliefs sought in the suit filed by a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chief Lotanna Chuka Okoli (SAN) on behalf of Momo Payment Service Bank Limited.\n\nAmong other reliefs, the MTN bank is also seeking an order of the court directing the 18 banks to individually account for the sums available in their customer accounts and the sums which have been removed by the customers and are no longer available.\n\nIn an affidavit in support of the originating summons, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), MOMO PSB Ltd, Mr. Anthony Usoro Usoro claimed that MOMO PSB Ltd is the bona fide owner of the aggregate sum of N22.3 billion which is maintained in its MOMO settlement account.\n\nHe averred that on or about the 24th day of May, 2022, it was noticed that funds had been erroneously transferred from its settlement account to various accounts maintained by the 18 banks.\n\nAnthony in the affidavit further claimed that a total of about 700, 000 transactions were processed with credits made into about 8,000 various accounts in the listed 18 banks.\n\nUpon becoming aware of the incident, he further asserted that MOMO PSB Ltd management responded by immediately shutting down the service to limit the impact and triggered engagement with the banks for the commencement of recovery activities from the accounts of the various beneficiaries in the various banks.\n\nThe erroneous transfers, he claimed, were due to the fact that MOMO PSB Ltd suffered a system exploitation which led to the said debits.\n\nThe MTN\u2019s MOMO Bank\u2019s boss in the affidavit asserted that the 18 banks requested for an order of court mandating them to reverse the credits made into their customers account before they can do so, hence, the filing of the suit.\n\nThe plaintiff therefore prayed the Federal High Court to compel the 18 commercial banks operating in the country to refund about N22. 3 billion erroneously transferred into their customers\u2019 accounts.\n\nIt also asked the court to order the banks to provide information about the customers into whose accounts the said funds were unintentionally paid.\n\nMPSBL is contending that, under the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Regulation on Instant (Inter-Bank) Electronic Funds Transfer Services, made pursuant to Sections 2(D), 33(1)6) and 47(2) of the CBN Act 2007, it is incumbent on the 18 banks to make refund and provide the required information.\n\nIt added that its resort to the court was informed by the insistence of the 18 banks that they needed to be ordered by the Federal High Court before they could act.\n\nThe affected banks were listed as defendants in the suit marked: FHC/L/CS/960/2022.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nExperts at a One-Day Interactive Workshop on Effective Customer Service Delivery for Tourism and Hospitality Professionals organized by the FCT Chapter of the Institute for Tourism Professionals of Nigeria, ITPN, have asserted the obvious fact that an effective service delivery in the sector was dependent on the quality of practitioners and their professional competence.\n\nIn the paper titled \u2018Effective Customer Service Delivery for Tourism and Hospitality Professionals\u2019 presented at the occasion, Alhaji Abdulmalik Hassan, an advocate for quality service, stated that excellent customer service delivered in the appropriate way, is a prerequisite for effective and efficient business management that guarantees customer satisfaction, patronage and retention.\n\nHassan said service delivery in the tourism and hospitality industry deserves much more than it has because, due to lapses in the manner and way personnel and staff of individual tourism and hospitality organizations conduct themselves with customers, they end up losing customer patronage and running down their businesses, noting that we take for granted the way the gateman and receptionist welcome guests, and that once the guest does not receive an amiable reception from the on-set at the entry point, the organization losses the ability to command customer satisfaction let alone retain customer patronage.\n\nIn his submission, the tourism expert advocated for more attention on training and equipping lower cadre staff with the necessary skills to deliver better customer service than the current trends in which most organizations spend huge resources training their top executives.\n\nAnother facilitator at the occasion, Capt. Emmanuel LordsGreat who delivered a paper on \u2018Re-Inventing Customer Experience for Tourism and Hospitality Industry\u2019 posited that businesses have changed from manufacturing dependence to providing timely and quality service, and that due to increase in technology and globalization, there has been a dramatic change in customer behaviour which service providers must understand and come to terms with.\n\nLordsGreat stressed that Customers are increasingly becoming aware of the need to get value for their money and will frown at poor quality service delivery from mediocre organizations. This therefore meant that hospitality and tourism organizations must work on customer satisfaction and retention efforts which were key to keeping them from running away.\n\n\u201d What drive customers away is rude and discourteous behaviour, inept, and incompetence dispositions of staff during service delivery,\u201d he added.\n\nHe alluded that knowing the obvious fact that customers are the most important people to an organization, and also that organizations depend on customers not the other way round and are in fact the lifeblood of an organization, taking measures to serve them to the best of their satisfaction was fundamental and should not be compromised.\n\nAlso the Director General of the National Institute for Hospitality and Tourism, Nura Sani Kangiwa, who was the special Guest of Honour at the occasion, represented by Dr. Taiwo Famogbiyele, Director, General Studies, Research and Development, delivered the keynote address in which he affirmed that the success of harnessing the country\u2019s tourism potentials through effective service delivery was highly dependent on the quality of professionals and practitioners in the sector, noting that there was urgent need for adequate sensitization in terms of education and impacting of relevant training and skills to the personnel and drivers of the industry such as the one organized by the FCT Chapter of the Institute for Tourism Professionals of Nigeria, ITPN.\n\nEarlier in her welcome address, convener of the workshop and Chairman of the FCT Chapter of ITPN, Dr. Mrs. Ebikaboere Seimodei said a flourishing tourism industry can only be achieved via quality service delivery which the country stands to benefit from its economic values such as generating income, providing job opportunities, ensuring foreign exchange earnings, increase in internally generated revenue via taxation and the attendant multiplier effects on other sectors of the economy, and when service delivery was poor, the result will be dwindling fortunes in the industry and low economic value to the national economy.\n\nSeimodei then called on practitioners in the industry to support efforts of the FCT Chapter of ITPN in capacity development for enhanced service delivery, particularly in this age of increased technological skills and changing visitor/consumer preferences as well as meet the expectations of tourists in conformity with global best practices.\n\nOther guests who gave goodwill messages at the occasion includes Chief Abiodun Odusanwo, National President of ITPN; Mrs. Susan Akporiaye, President of the National Association of Nigerian Travel Agents, NANTA and Barr. Funmi Kazeem, Hotel Owners Forum of Abuja, HOFA; who praised efforts of the FCT Chapter of ITPN by bringing to the front burner the issue of training and re-training of practitioners in the industry for better and quality service delivery by professionals in the sector.\n\nCertificates were later presented to participants at the workshop as testimony of attendance and acquisition of the requisite knowledge and skills in the ethics of customer service delivery as professionals in the travel tourism and hospitality industry.",

In any case, Alhaji Abubakar Atuku is our presidential candidate and I can tell you for sure that he will be the President in 2023 insha Allah.\u201d\n\nOn the the outcome of the Presidential primaries and subsequent picking of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as running mate of Atiku which may have angered Governor Nyesom Wike, the BoT Chairman disclosed that a high powered reconciliatory committee is soon to be constituted to meet Governor Wike and appeal to him.\n\n\u201dGovernor Wike is a great party man who fought for the party, when the committee is constituted, in which we will also bring other contestants together, we will go and meet with Governor Wike and appeal to him even if it means kneeling down to beg him,\u201d he said.",

No reason for the visit was given by the military but it appeared to be linked to the tension with Ethiopia over the executions.\n\n\u201cIn an act that violates all laws and customs of war and international humanitarian law, the Ethiopian army executed seven Sudanese soldiers and a citizen who were their captives,\u201d the Sudanese armed forces said in a statement late on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThis treacherous act will not pass without a response.\u201d\n\nThere was no immediate response from Ethiopia to Khartoum\u2019s accusation.\n\nRelations between Sudan and Ethiopia have been fraught in recent years, mostly over the contested border region of Fashaqa, a fertile farming strip long settled by Ethiopian farmers protected by pro-government militias.\n\nThe eastern territories of Sudan, which border Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region, have been the site of deadly clashes between the Sudanese and the Ethiopian sides in the past 18 months.\n\nThey coincided with the outbreak of fighting in Tigray in November 2020 between local secessionist rebels and the government.\n\nThe conflict has sent tens of thousands of refugees from Tigray fleeing into Sudan.\n\nThe border dispute is part of wider tensions between the two countries, which include differences over Ethiopia\u2019s hydroelectric dam on the Blue Nile about 20 kilometres from the Sudanese border.\n\nSudan and Egypt oppose the project and have been pushing for a legally-binding agreement on the filling and operation of the dam. Ethiopia said guidelines should be enough.\n\nThe three nations\u2019 last round of talks on the dam broke down in April last year.\n\nThis month, Ethiopia said it was ready for another round of talks. Egypt and Sudan have said nothing in public about the prospect of resuming talks.\n\nSudan said it needs real-time data on the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam to safeguard against destructive flooding and ensure its own hydroelectric dams on the Blue Nile work smoothly.\n\nEgypt, which depends on the Nile for nearly all of its fresh water, said any reduction in the volume of water reaching it would jeopardise hundreds of thousands of farming jobs and disrupt the delicate food balance for its 103 million people.",

Over the weekend, the national parliament began a debate tabled by the opposition on removing him from office. It is set to conclude later this week.\n\nThe extent of the disruption caused by the mass demonstrations is significant.\n\nThe blocking of key roads has led to fears of food shortages in the capital, Quito, as agricultural workers outside of it campaign for fairer food prices.\n\nLeonidas Iza, the leader of Conaie who was briefly arrested over the protests, asked his supporters to guarantee \u201ccorridors\u201d into the capital over the weekend for essential supplies.\n\nThe weekend was broadly calm, as demonstrators took a break amid the political movements.\n\nBut concerns about supplies and the broad economic impacts remain.\n\nOn Sunday, the energy ministry issued a statement warning that oil production \u2013 a key export which the country\u2019s economy relies on \u2013 could come to an end within 48 hours if protests and roadblocks continued this week.\n\nProduction was at a \u201ccritical\u201d point, it said, and could stop because of \u201cvandalism, takeover of wells and closing of roads\u201d.\n\nThe country was hard-hit by the Covid pandemic and its economy is still recovering.\n\nBBC",

          "text": "South African mourners expressed anger and despair on Monday at the death of 21 teenagers in a tavern over the weekend, as investigating authorities said the youths were probably accidentally poisoned by something they ate, drank or smoked.\n\nThe still unexplained deaths of the teens, some of whom were celebrating the end of school exams and others a birthday party, have brought an outpouring of grief and shocked a nation accustomed to injuries linked to a binge drinking culture. Authorities ruled out an earlier-touted notion of a stampede.\n\nResidents of Scenery Park, on the edge of East London, said they had asked authorities to close Enyobeni Tavern down weeks ago because it was serving under-aged kids.\n\nThe tavern\u2019s licence was revoked on Monday.\n\nAt a prayer meeting at a local church, mourners and priests sang, prayed, drummed on hymn books and cried over the loss of the youngsters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so devastated. We are so angry,\u201d Maxhabiso Sibotoboto, 50, whose 17-year-old granddaughter, Monelo, was among the dead, told Reuters by phone from a church memorial service for them.\n\n\u201cPeople were complaining about the tavern. No one was happy about it. The community wanted the tavern to be shut,\u201d he said.\n\nMonelo did not live with her parents, because he father had died and her mother worked a long way from home, he said.\n\nPictures circulating on social media, still unverified by authorities, showed the bodies of youths lying scattered across the floor of the tavern, some also seen motionless on tables and couches.\n\n\u201cWe are so heartbroken, guys. We lost one of our family members, a child who was doing grade 12 (final year) this year. We can\u2019t accept it,\u201d said Yandiswa Ngqoza, an aunt, as she choked back tears outside the morgue dressed in black attire.\n\n\u201cBy the look of the child she has no visible injuries,\u201d Ngqoza said, before breaking down sobbing. Minutes earlier she had entered the morgue and identified her niece, whose name she did not disclose.\n\nEastern Cape police spokesperson Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana told Reuters that the youngest victim was a 13-year-old girl.\n\nAn emotional Police Minister Bheki Cele had to pause speaking as he started weeping on Sunday, triggering cries among his audience outside a morgue.\n\n\u201cIt is either something they ingested which will point to poisoning, whether its food or drinks, or it is something they inhaled,\u201d Unathi Binqose, spokesperson for Eastern Cape\u2019s provincial community safety department said by phone on Monday, ahead of a toxicology report still being awaited. He said hookah pipes were visible in CCTV footage of the scene.\n\n\u201cWe are ruling out a stampede,\u201d he added, after initial media reports suggested this may have been the cause. read more\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa said on Sunday he was worried about the circumstances under which young people, at least some under the age of 18 years, were allowed to gather at the tavern. It is illegal to serve drinks to under-18s in South Africa.",
