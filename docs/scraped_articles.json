          "text": "NO fewer than seven traditional rulers and their family members have been abducted in the past two weeks, Sunday PUNCH findings have revealed.\n\nChecks by our correspondent indicated that between December 15 and 31, gunmen attacked traditional leaders in different parts of the country, including the South-East and South-West, after a security advisory by the Department of State Services.\n\nWhile some were abducted and forced to part with huge ransoms to regain their freedom, others were killed by the criminals.\n\nFindings showed that four monarchs were abducted and two killed.\n\nAlso, three family members of a district head were kidnapped during the period under review.\n\nThe DSS had on December 15 issued an advisory that Very Important Persons, especially lawmakers and holidaying workers, were prone to attacks during this period.\n\nThe secret police Public Relations Officer, Dr Peter Afunanya, handed down the warning at a press briefing in Abuja.\n\nAfunanya had said, \u201cRecessing members of State and National Assembly and other public /private sector workers on vacation may be predisposed to threats of various degrees. These individuals are susceptible to kidnapping, hijack, assassination, armed robbery and political manipulations.\n\n\u201cThey are advised to be security-conscious in order not to fall victim to these attacks and destructive political maneuvers.\u201d\n\nHowever, checks by Sunday PUNCH revealed that on December 15, gunmen abducted and killed an Imo monarch, Paul Ogbu, and one other in Okigwe.\n\nAnother traditional ruler, Acho Ndukwe, who was kidnapped with Ogbu, disclosed that the abductors killed him.\n\nOn December 23, a traditional chief, Emmanuel Obafemi, the Odolofin of Ijan-Ekiti, was abducted and N40m was demanded as ransom. He was later released after paying N2m.\n\nOn December 26, the paramount ruler of Gindri in the Mangu Local Government Area of Plateau State, the Sum Pyem, Mr Charles Mato, was abducted. A whopping N500m ransom was demanded for his release.\n\nAlso, on December 21 bandits kidnapped the wife and three children of a District Head in Adamawa State, Ardo Mustapha Ahmadu.\n\nOn December 22 ,the Adamawa State Coordinator of the National Land Development Authority, Zakaria Kraha, was also abducted.\n\nIn Eha-Amufu in the Isi-Uzo Local Government Area of Enugu State, suspected herdsmen reportedly kidnapped seven holidaying workers on December 29.\n\nAlso, on December 30, bandits killed five persons, including the 82-year-old Head of Gada District, Alhaji Umar Allah, in the Bungudu Local Council of Zamfara State.\n\nMeanwhile, the DSS similarly experienced an attack on its base in the Abaji Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory as suspected kidnappers killed one vigilante and abducted one DSS officer.\n\nThe coordinator, Northern Alliance Movement, Yahuza Getso, said the development showed that no one was safe in the country.\n\n\u201cAnd Lai Mohammed (Minister of Information and Culture) said the Buhari regime has recorded significant progress in the area of security. This administration has exhibited it lacks the competence to tackle insecurity. The truth of the matter is that no one is safe; the president is an absolute failure . We will not forget this administration for bad. This is a very unorganised and confused government,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe Director-General, International Institute of Professional Security, Tony Ofoyetan, said the inability to rein in the criminal elements have emboldened them to carry out dastardly attacks.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "THE National Drug Law Enforcement Agency confiscated cash, assets and drugs valued at N120bn from 11,341 traffickers and drug barons in 2021.\n\nThe agency also successfully prosecuted and jailed 1,111 out of the 11,341 traffickers arrested between January and November, 2021.\n\nThe spokesman, NDLEA, Mr Femi Babafemi, who disclosed this in response to an inquiry from Sunday PUNCH, said the agency had counselled and rehabilitated 7,066 drug users.\n\nHe stated, \u201cBetween January and November 2021, over 11,341 drug traffickers were arrested; 1,111 jailed and 7,066 drug users counselled and rehabilitated while a total of six drug barons were arrested with over N120bn in cash, assets and drugs seized from offenders within the same period.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be able to capture the entire figures until January because several operations have been conducted after the last compilation in November.\u201d\n\nBabafemi said the agency would further take the battle to drug traffickers and barons in the New Year, noting that the NDLEA would continue to frustrate traffickers.\n\nMeanwhile, the agency has observed that patients could not access controlled drugs such as opioid medication.\n\nIt sought improved access and appropriate use of controlled medicines in the country.\n\nAccording to the NDLEA National Drug Control Master Plan, 2021-2025, the agency in 2018 confiscated 124.864kg of cocaine; 273, 249.087kg of cannabis; methamphetamine, 270.084kg; heroin, 59.617kg; ephedrine, 326.560kg and tramadol 22,562.300kg.\n\nIn 2019, the agency seized 112.996kg of cocaine; 602,654.500kg of cannabis; methamphetamine, 146.380kg; heroin, 23.894kg; ephedrine, 454.085kg and tramadol, 2,078.831kg.\n\nTo improve access to controlled drugs by patients, the plan recommended an uninterrupted yet monitored process that allows professionals to diagnose and dispense needed medication, while ensuring that patients access controlled medicines at the right time and place, and at affordable prices.\n\nThis process, it added, requires close monitoring as it moves through all phases, from manufacturing to consumption, including procurement, production, inventory management, distribution and use, noting that it was at the dispensing stage at public and private health facilities where patients were most impacted by lack of access.\n\nThe plan stated, \u201cInput from stakeholders shows a compounding crisis involving a lack of availability of controlled medicines for genuine patients and its severe impact on the health and wellness of Nigerians\n\n\u201cHowever, the supply chain in its entirety must be examined to understand the situation in Nigeria. If not well managed, it will significantly contribute to the challenges of accessing medication for patient use. To improve access at public and private health facilities, it is critical to have one coordinating body or mechanism that reduces the barriers for access to medication for the patient. These barriers include, but are not restricted to, rules and policies on licensing requirements, dispensing practices, labeling requirements, inventory management, taxes and policies that affect price.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "NLC to FG: We'll shut down Nigeria if fuel price increases",
          "text": "The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) is not about to back down on its objection to the plan by the federal government to hike petrol price and electricity tariff.\n\nLabour vowed yesterday to shut down the country should government proceed with the planned price hike in the new year.\n\nNigerians, it said in its new year message, have had enough of what it labeled anti-people policies and would not tolerate such any longer.\n\nIn the message signed by NLC President Ayuba Wabba, congress declared that Nigerians \u201chave suffered enough and will not endure more punishment by way of further petrol and electricity price increases.\u201d\n\nIt hinged its opposition to the planned fuel price hike on four points including \u201cdeceit and duplicity associated with the politics of \u2018petrol price increase\u2019 by successive Nigerian governments\u201d and government\u2019s inability to make the nation\u2019s refineries function.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt said: \u201cThe truth is that the perennial increase by government of the pump price of petrol is actually a transfer of government failure and inability to effectively govern to the poor masses of our country.\n\n\u201cWe are talking of the failure of government to manage Nigeria\u2019s four oil refineries and inability to build new ones more than thirty years after the last petrochemical refinery in Port Harcourt was commissioned; the failure to rein in smuggling and the failure to determine empirically the quantity of petrol consumed in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe shame takes a gory dimension with the fact that Nigeria is the only OPEC country that cannot refine her own crude oil.\n\n\u201cDuring the negotiations that trailed the last increase in petroleum prices, Organised Labour made a cardinal demand on government which is that it must take immediate steps to revamp and rehabilitate Nigeria\u2019s refineries.\n\n\u201cA Technical Committee was set up to monitor progress in this regard. As we all know, the work of the Technical Committee like our abandoned public refineries has ground to a halt and further negotiations with government adjourned sine die for nearly one year now.\n\n\u201cAs a responsible social partner, we have at different times called on government to show us what they are doing in response to our demands but silence is the response we get.\n\n\u201cAll we hear from government are half-hearted media pronouncements on efforts to allocate funds for the rehabilitation of our public refineries. On ground, there is no commensurate action.\n\n\u201cBetween 2012 and now, about $9.5 billion has been spent on Turn Around Maintenance (TAM), Greenfield Refinery Projects and even public investments in private refineries.\n\n\u201cThe tragedy is that despite these humungous investments of public funds, government continues to present the crisis of mass importation of refined petroleum products into Nigeria and the consequent import-based pricing regime of refined petroleum products as a fait accompli.\n\n\u201cThis neo-colonial narrative in Nigeria petroleum sub-sector is what the Nigerian working-class family has rejected as unfathomable and unacceptable as it is antithetical to the notions of sovereignty and self-actualization and a mockery of the sacrifice of our heroes past.\n\n\u201cEven in the classic example of capitalism, there is something called the theory of comparative advantage where a country deploys its strategic assets to secure the highest possible positive outcomes for its citizens.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, successive governments in Nigeria have failed to take strategic advantage of our natural endowment in oil and gas, especially our prime position as the highest producer of crude oil in Africa, to expand our economy, induce economic growth and engender sustainable national development.\n\n\u201cToday, instead of referring to crude oil as the blessing that it is, we now commonly describe this gift of God to Nigeria as \u201cResource Curse\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe quagmire of the Dutch Disease or Resource Curse in our country is most exemplified in our downstream petroleum sub-sector.\n\n\u201cThe despair of our unfortunate Catch 22 situation is that government increases the pump price of petroleum products when the price of crude oil increases and falls in the international commodities market. The explanation is that such increases automatically translate to increases in the price of refined petroleum products.\n\n\u201cWhen the price of crude oil falls, the excuse is that the enormous pressure on the value of the Nigerian naira occasioned by drop in forex revenue exacerbates the crisis of naira devaluation and causes hike in petrol price.\n\n\u201cEven to the blind, the solution is clear \u2013 Nigeria must regain her capacity to locally refine petroleum products. There is no escaping the fact that our public refineries must be made to work.\n\n\u201cThere is no short cut to the reality that we must replace the exploitative and subservient policy of Import-Based Price Regime with Local Production Based Price Regime for refined petroleum products.\n\n\u201cThere is no explaining away through disingenuous Power Point presentations, procured rallies and over-rehashed publicity in the media the simple fact that as a major Oil Producing country in the world and after nearly seventy years of oil exploration in Nigeria, our country cannot deliver on efficient and effective public petroleum refineries.\n\n\u201cNothing dents the image of Nigeria and presents us as a country incapable of providing governance as the failed narratives in our downstream petroleum sub-sector.\n\n\u201cSecond, we are concerned about the missed opportunities and hemorrhage of potential revenue to public coffers that government\u2019s continued apathy to reconstructing the current negative narrative in our downstream petroleum sub-sector.\n\n\u201cThe advantages and multiplier effect of local refining of petroleum products in Nigeria are enormous. There is the angle of mass job creation, increase in revenue accruable to government, promotion of environmental integrity in oil bearing communities as the scourge of artisanal refining with its deleterious impact on the environment and the consequent unrests and agitation such oil pollution precipitates would take a nose dive.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that with self- sufficiency in oil refining, Nigeria will be able to meet not only demand for local consumption but also will be in a grand position to cater for the refined petroleum needs of the sub-region and the African continent as a whole.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the comparative advantage that government fails to see as strategic business opportunity, private investors such as Dangote Group are taking this advantage and are moving mountains and valleys to syndicate finance from institutional lenders to establish one of the largest petrochemical refineries in the world in Lekki \u2013 Lagos State.\n\n\u201cFor us in the labour movement, we do not believe that government is shortsighted to the huge benefits accruable to the commonwealth by the robust development of the downstream petroleum sector especially through investment in the rehabilitation of our four public refineries and building of new refineries.\n\n\u201cGiven the direct relationship between the outrageous amount said to be invested in the payment of the so-called petroleum subsidy and the pressure to get foreign loans from Bretton Wood Institutions to meet perennial shortfall in revenue, we believe that the crisis of the under-development of Nigeria\u2019s downstream petroleum sector, the comatose of our four public refineries and the inability of successive government to right this economic sabotage smacks of an international conspiracy at the behest of local collaborators to keep the Nigerian economy and people perpetually on their knees.\n\n\u201cThe suggestion by government that the remedy to this malady is to stop further payment of the so-called petrol subsidy is akin to cutting one\u2019s nose in order to spite one\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cWhat the government is proposing is to abandon the Nigerian workers and people to very cruel market forces whose sole drive is profit maximization.\n\n\u201cThis is why we believe that private investment in building petroleum refineries is not enough. Government must ensure that public refineries also work.\n\n\u2018This way, there would be true competition and Nigerians would be able to derive the most benefit from a resource that God freely and amply made available to the Nigerian nation.\n\n\u201cWe have also already described the idea of paying transport allowances as robbing ourselves to pay ourselves as the amount being bandied for such transport subsidy clearly outstrips the amount that is currently expended on the so-called petrol subsidy.\n\n\u201cThird, as a pan Nigerian organisation, Organised Labour is concerned that the crisis in Nigeria\u2019s downstream petroleum sector is further aggravated by the persisting tumult in the upstream subsector.\n\n\u201cIt was recently reported that almost 200 million barrels of crude oil were lost in 2021. This was as a result of crude oil theft, ageing infrastructure, poor long term investment outlay, poor security of our inland waterway, and challenges arising from conflicts with oil bearing communities and host communities of oil facilities. This is very unfortunate.\n\n\u201cEven more disturbing is the fact that just like the failed TAMs, no major culprit has been arrested and successfully prosecuted.\n\n\u201cOur fourth ground for rejecting any further increase in the pump price of petrol is based on our agreement with government in September 2020 that any further increase in the price of petrol should be shelved until government and labour undertakes a review of the state of local refineries in Nigeria and until government takes commensurate action to revamp our public petroleum refineries.\n\n\u201cIt is in these lights that we consider the current proposals by government at the clear promoting of Bretton Woods Institutions to increase the pump price of petrol as anti-people, insensitive and a disservice to the welfare of Nigerian people which government is constitutionally mandated to protect.\n\n\u201cAt our organ meetings which took place between December 15 and 17, 2021, the Nigeria Labour Congress took a decision to protest the planned hike in the pump price of petrol by government. The protest has been scheduled to take place in all the 36 states of the federation on the 27th of January 2022.\n\n\u201cThe protest in the states would culminate in the submission of protest letters to the 36 State Governors. Subsequently, on the 1st of February 2022, there would be a national protest to be held in the Federal Capital Territory.\n\n\u201cWe urge Nigerian workers and people to dust their sneakers and fully participate in the peaceful protests and rallies aimed at salvaging our economic future.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the Nigeria Labour Congress has already barred its mind on the recent signing into law of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cThe agitation by different segments of society clearly shows that this very important piece of legislation which Nigerians have kept vigil over for so many years still does not sufficiently address the deficits of governance, oversight, investment, environmental integrity, local beneficiation and the use of petroleum resources to advance the cause of the ordinary Nigerian worker and citizen.\n\n\u201cWe call on the two chambers of the National Assembly to immediately commence the process of reviewing the Petroleum Industry Act to reflect the aspirations of Nigerian workers and people.\u201d\n\nOn the National Minimum Wage, the NLC expressed disappointment that some states have failed to implement their agreement with labour on the issue.\n\nIts words: \u201cNigerians would recall that the national minimum wage was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari in April 2019. Since then, the implementation of the national minimum wage has been a tale of mixed fortunes across the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory. While some states are in compliance, others are not.\n\n\u201cWhile most of the states in the North West geopolitical zone have started implementing the new national minimum wage, there is an exception in the case of Zamfara State which has refused to pay the national minimum wage and consequential salary adjustment to workers in the state.\n\n\u201cIn the North East, the exception is Taraba State which is yet to fully implement the new national minimum wage. In the North Central, there are still challenges of full implementation in Benue and Kogi states.\n\n\u201cIn the South West, most of the states are already in compliance. In the South South, the weak link is Cross River State which has spurned all negotiation agreements and entreaties to pay workers in the state the new national minimum wage and consequential salary adjustment.\n\n\u201cIn the South East, the Imo and Abia State governments remain thorns in the flesh of workers. Apart from refusing to fully implement the national minimum wage and consequential salary increase, the state governments have also been promoting clandestine and rogue labour leaders unknown to the labour movement.\n\n\u201cIn line with the directives of the National Executive Council of the Nigeria Labour Congress, we have asked our state councils to commence industrial actions against state government that are yet to implement the new national minimum wage and pension.\n\n\u201cIt is disheartening that amidst the current economic crunch prevalent in the country, some state governors still need persuasion to pay workers the national minimum wage.\u201d\n\nLabour also spoke on the security challenge in the country and next year\u2019s elections, saying it would not sit by and allow the current situation derail democracy.\n\nIt said: \u201cTwo days ago, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) released a statement warning that with the increasing siege of insecurity all over the country, there is a huge risk that the 2023 general elections might not take place. This is serious.\n\n\u201cNigerians would recall that a similar situation played out during the last governorship election in Anambra State where upsurge in killings, kidnap, militancy, thuggery and sit-at-home directives from non-state actors elicited concerns from a spectrum of stakeholders on the possibility, feasibility and viability of the elections.\n\n\u201cFortunately, given the massive deployment of security forces all over the country to Anambra State, INEC was able to conduct free, fair and largely peaceful election in Anambra State.\n\n\u201cClearly, the current state of insecurity in the country is now no longer a threat just to life and economic activities but also constitutes a potent danger to Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\n\u201cUnlike the Anambra State elections, the variables would not likely be the same in the prosecution of the 2023 general elections as the polls are expected to take place at the same time all over the country and security resources would be thinly spread.\n\n\u201cThere is no gainsaying the fact that all hands must now be on deck to solve once and for all the escalation and persistence of insecurity in different parts of the country.\n\n\u201cIt is pursuant to this clarion national call that Nigerian workers would no longer afford to stay on the fence while the country burns and politicians party. Nigerian workers are now ready to proactively engage the political process in the quest for active demands for the recovery of our common sanity and collective wellbeing.\n\n\u201cAfter all, Nigeria does not belong to only professional politicians who now see the national endeavor as a cash-out exchange. Certainly, Nigerian workers must make their votes count in 2023.\n\n\u201cAlready, the Nigeria Labour Congress has developed a Charter of Demands of minimal irreducible expectations of the Nigerian people from the ruling political class. The Congress aspires to use this document to engage politicians and leaders of thought going into the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cThere is no gainsaying the fact that the era of cheap political sloganeering has passed. Now the Nigerian electorate led by the working class are ready to ask the pertinent questions of development.\n\n\u201cWe would demand from politicians and the political class the dividends of the investment of our hopes for a stronger, inclusive and resilient economy; a Nigeria that is secured, stable, sustainable, peaceful and united; a Nigeria of equal opportunities where the child of the cobbler can still aspire to reach the top through a dint of integrity, resourcefulness, hard work, and faith; a country where public infrastructure works and inspires pride in citizens; a Nigeria where workers and pensioners reap the fruits of their reward on earth especially through prompt payment of decent wages cum pension benefits; and a land where the things that sustain a productive and full life are available, abundant and affordable.\u201d\n\nFinance, Budget and National Planning Minister Zainab Ahmed had announced, last year, that the government would remove fuel subsidy and replace it with a monthly N5,000 transport grant to about 40 million poor Nigerians.\n\nThe subsidy removal will automatically result in an increase in petrol price and other costs of living.",

We need peace,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cI was looking at the images in the television programme \u2018In His Image\u2019 today, about war, displaced people, the miseries. This is happening today in the world. We want peace.\u201d\n\nPeace, according to him, requires \u201cconcrete actions,\u201d including attention to the most fragile, forgiving others and promoting justice.\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cAnd it needs a positive outlook as well. One that always sees in the Church as well as in society; not the evil that divides us, but the good that unites us!\n\n\u201cGetting depressed or complaining is useless. We need to roll up our sleeves to build peace.\u201d\n\nWe need to end endless agitations, says Jonathan\n\nImmediate past President Goodluck Jonathan, in his new year message, urged President Buhari and other African leaders to continue to work towards building inclusive, just and peaceful societies in 2022, which, according to him, presents new opportunities to \u201cbuild our nation for ourselves, our children and grandchildren.\u201d\n\n\u201cAcross the world, there is a global demand for justice, peace, hope, security and sustainable development,\u201d Jonathan said.\n\n\u201cThe attainment of these global and national aspirations should occupy the hearts and minds of citizens and leaders in our nations in this New Year 2022 if we are to rebuild a better world for the upcoming generations.\n\n\u201cBuilding an inclusive, just and peaceful society is a task that we must prioritise in 2022, as we cannot afford the luxury of a nation with endless agitations.\n\n\u201c2022 presents to us new opportunities to build our nation for ourselves, our children and grandchildren.\n\n\u201cLet us therefore live in love and unity, pursue peace and justice in all spheres and in all our engagements. God bless Nigeria, God bless Africa and the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nShun divisiveness, consolidate on gains, Sanwo-Olu urges Lagosians\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State urged genuine love by all Lagosians by consolidating on the gains made by individuals and the State in 2021, especially the fight against COVID-19.\n\nHe was optimistic that \u201cwe will triumph over it and the Year 2022 will usher in a fresh lease of life for the world.\u201d\n\nHe also acknowledged the perseverance of Lagosians in the face of the current socio-economic challenges caused by the coronavirus pandemic, saying: \u201cIn the true spirit of Lagos, we will remain resolute with a renewed vigour to face the new year, more determined to succeed together as a people.\u201d\n\nZulum: There\u2019ll be new lease of life for rural dwellers\n\nIn a similar message, Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State said his administration would continue to open up rural communities by working on selected roads and making lives better in the local government areas.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that better life in rural communities will translate to improvement in security and well-being of our people. What is good for the state capital is good for the remotest community of Borno,\u201d the governor said.\n\nThe governor said his administration\u2019s determination to \u201cwork tirelessly for the people of Borno State\u201d stemmed from the fact that the state \u201csuffered the most from insurgency with so much carnage and damage to lives and livelihoods.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOur peculiar situation in Borno State basically means that if we are not focused, we would have a significant gulf in development to catch up with.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m hopeful over Nigeria\u2019s unity, progress, says Lalong\n\nGovernor Simon Bako Lalong of Plateau State asked Nigerians to look forward to a great year in 2022 with optimism and hope as they prepare to make personal sacrifices and unite in supporting government address the critical issues militating against the peace, unity and progress of the nation.\n\nHe said with the determination and collaboration of the people, insecurity and unemployment, which are major factors that threaten the future of the nation, would be overcome.\n\nHis words: \u201cNigeria is tremendously blessed and endowed with not only natural resources but good people who want to live in peace and pursue legitimate endeavours in peace, unity and tranquility.\n\n\u201cThat is why we must all work together in the new year to confront those who want to take away the collective destiny of Nigerians through terrorism, banditry and other criminal activities.\n\n\u201cWe must deny them such opportunity and also ensure that we put them to shame. We should do so believing that evil cannot triumph over good.\u201d\n\nAbdulrazaq assures Kwarans of continued focus on poverty eradication\n\nGovernor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara State advised residents of the state to \u201cwatch over one another and work for a greater Kwara and Nigeria, irrespective of our differences\u201d in the new year.\n\nHe assured Kwarans of his administration\u2019s continuous focus on projects and programmes aimed at boosting inclusive growth, reduce poverty and create a better environment for sustainable job opportunities in the state.\n\nHe urged them to continue to \u201crelate with one another as one people bound by a common destiny under God.\u201d",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said that notwithstanding the threat of insecurity in the country, his administration remains resolute to continue with its programmes and plans.\n\nHe said this in his New Year message to Nigerians as the country joins the rest of the world to welcome 2022.\n\nThe President, who commended the nation\u2019s security agencies for the efforts to restore peace, stressed that the issue of security will remain at the front burner, adding that as a follow up to his promise to re-energize and reorganize the security apparatus and personnel of the armed forces and the police, his administration has invested heavily in re-equipping the military in line with upgrading the platforms and firepower required to tackle the current challenges being faced in the country.\n\nPresident Buhari noted that to win the war on insecurity, the hearts and minds of the affected citizens must be won. To this end, he said working with international partners and neighbouring countries, the Federal Government would be deploying multi-faceted solutions that will be targeted at addressing human security at the grassroots, before it leads to insecurity.\n\nWhile commiserating with Nigerians who have lost loved ones as a result of insecurity in different parts of the country, he assured that every life matters and every single death caused by any form of insecurity is a matter of personal concern to him both as a citizen and as the President of this great country.\n\nHe assured that his administration remains fully committed to upholding the constitutional provisions that protect all Nigerians from any form of internal and external aggression.\n\nOn job creation, the President said in the New Year, his administration would leverage ICT platforms to create jobs, while ensuring that the diversification of the economy creates more support to other emerging sectors.\n\nThe New Year Message reads thus:\n\nWe remain grateful to the Almighty God for yet another year attained as a country, united by a common destiny and resolute in our determination to overcome the several challenges along the path to build the great and prosperous nation of our dream.\n\nI salute the courage and resilience of all Nigerians, which was evident in 2021 as this nation, like other countries of the world, faced significant challenges that occurred as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to restore the global economy and social order.\n\nThe persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country may have threatened to unravel the incremental gains achieved in the real sectors of the economy and in the administration\u2019s overall objective to position the nation on the irreversible trajectory of sustainable growth and progress, but I assure you that we will remain resolute in our commitments and shall continue to press ahead with our programmes and plans.\n\nThe path to nationhood is often fraught with unpredictable difficulties and challenges, and most tried and tested nations have often prevailed through dogged determination, resilience, concerted commitment to unity, and the conviction that the whole of the nation, standing together against all odds, is by far greater and would ultimately be more prosperous and viable than the sum of its distinguishable parts.\n\nThere is no doubt that the issue of security remains at the front burner of priority areas that this administration has given utmost attention to. As a follow up to our promise to re-energize and reorganize the security apparatus and personnel of the armed forces and the police, it is on record that this administration has invested heavily in re-equipping our military in line with upgrading the platforms and firepower required to tackle the current challenges being faced in the country.\n\nThe net results of these efforts have been the number of insurgents and bandits who have willingly surrendered to our security forces and continue to do so through various channels and the safe corridor created for that purpose.\n\nGovernment, however, realizes that victory on the battlefield is just one aspect of sustainable victory. We know that to fully win this war, we must also win the peace and real security lies in winning the hearts and minds of the affected citizens. To this end, working with our international partners and neighbouring countries, we would be deploying multi-faceted solutions that will be targeted at addressing human security at the grassroots, before it leads to insecurity.\n\nOnce again I would like to take a moment to remember and honour the gallant military, police officers, and other security agents who have lost their lives in the cause of protecting the territorial integrity of this nation against both internal and external aggressors, assuring their families that their sacrifices would not be in vain.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nWe equally remember and commiserate with Nigerians who have lost loved ones as a result of insecurity in different parts of the country. Every life matters and every single death caused by any form of insecurity is a matter of personal concern to me both as a citizen and as the President of this great country.\n\nWe remain fully committed to upholding the constitutional provisions that protect all Nigerians from any form of internal and external aggression.\n\nOn the economy, we have shown a high level of resilience to record some significant achievements despite the turbulence that has characterized our economy and indeed the global economy. The lessons we have learned and keep learning from COVID-19 have encouraged us to intensify efforts to mitigate its socio-economic effects on our nation.\n\nThe major wins we have recorded can be clearly seen in Nigeria\u2019s most recent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The 4.03% growth recorded in the third quarter of 2021 is indicative of the recovery being recorded in our economy and the confidence that is being shown through the policies that our administration has put in place after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nWe may also recall that this recent growth is closely followed by the 5.1% (year on year) growth in real terms recorded by Nigeria in Quarter 2 of 2021. This growth was one of the best recorded by any nation across Sub-Saharan Africa. The 5.1% growth at that time was and remains the highest growth recorded by the Nigerian economy since 2014.\n\nDespite the challenges we have faced as a nation, the good news is that we have so far recorded four consecutive quarters of growth after the negative growth rates recorded in Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 of 2020 due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn August 16, 2021 I signed the landmark Petroleum Industry Act into law. The signing of this legacy legislation is a watershed moment in the history of our nation, considering the massive positive impact the new Act would have on the economy. I would like to sincerely commend the 9th Assembly for the grit they demonstrated, succeeding where others have failed, and the cooperation that led to the completion of this process after almost two decades.\n\nJust like I stated during the investment trips and fora that I have attended recently, the legislation is expected to serve as a liberalizing force in the energy industry, and we are optimistic that this law will provide the much-needed legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the development of the energy sector, the host communities, and Nigeria as a nation. Our objective to increase Liquefied Natural Gas exports and expand our domestic market is still very much at the forefront of some of the policies we would be pushing in the New Year.\n\nIn year 2022 and going forward, our administration would intentionally leverage ICT platforms to create jobs, while ensuring that the diversification of our economy creates more support to other emerging sectors. I am proud to announce that several foreign investors are taking advantage of our ranking as one of the leading start-up ecosystems in Africa to invest in our digital economy.\n\nWe have given the utmost priority to fighting corruption and other related offences, which have been a bane to the growth and prosperity of our dear nation. We have made major strides and breakthroughs through the innovative use of technology and forensics in the investigative and prosecutorial procedures with commendable results to show that the anti-corruption drive of our administration is succeeding.\n\nIn the meantime, the accomplishments that have been recorded so far can be traced to the dedication of the nation\u2019s anti-corruption agencies who have received the necessary support needed to effectively prosecute their duties.\n\nDespite our challenges in 2021, it was also a year in which the administration executed successfully, key projects, programmes, and initiatives to fulfil the promises made under the Security, Economy Anti-corruption (SEA) agenda.\n\nAs we welcome 2022, let us, with hope, envision a year of continued progress against our combined challenges arising from security and socio-economic issues.\n\nAs it is said, the past is but a story told, the future will still be written in gold. Let us be united in our fight to keep our nation united against all odds and with gratitude, celebrate life in this new epoch.\n\nI wish you a very happy and prosperous New Year.",

          "text": "New Year: Jonathan preaches peace\n\nAs the world prepares to usher in the new year, former President Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has charged Nigerians and other Africans to continue to work towards building inclusive, just and peaceful societies.\n\nDr. Jonathan stated this in his new year message in which he noted that 2022 presents new opportunities to \u201cbuild our nation for ourselves, our children and grandchildren .\u201d\n\nThe message read: \u201cI congratulate fellow Nigerians, Africans and friends across the world for the opportunity of entering into the New Year, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe past year was characterized by many global challenges amid the ravaging effect of COVID -19 and its variants.\n\n\u201cWe have continued to live with the new realities imposed by the pandemic and consequences resulting from existing problems such as insecurity, poverty and climate change.\n\n\u201cAcross the world, there is a global demand for justice, peace, hope, security and sustainable development.\n\nThe attainment of these global and national aspirations should occupy the hearts and minds of citizens and leaders in our nations in this New Year 2022, if we are to rebuild a better world for the upcoming generations.\n\n\u201cBuilding an inclusive, just and peaceful society is a task that we must prioritize in 2022, as we cannot afford the luxury of a nation with endless agitations. 2022 presents to us new opportunities to build our nation for ourselves, our children and grandchildren.\n\n\u201cLet us therefore live in love and unity, pursue peace and justice in all spheres and in all our engagements,\u201d the statement noted.\n\nAtiku tasks Nigerians on peace, unity\n\nFrom Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nFormer Vice President, Atiku Abubakar has charged Nigerians to commit themselves to the pursuit of peace and unity in the New Year.\n\nAtiku, in a New Year message, yesterday, noted that hate and strive do not build a nation, rather they destroy individuals faster. He noted that in the New Year, Nigerians must seek to do \u201csomething different and, in doing so, let us become peace ambassadors of God.\u201d\n\nHe noted that \u201cthe outgone year came and went with challenges, especially with the second, third and fourth waves of the dreaded Corona Virus Disease; sundry upsets that troubled the peace and security in different parts of the country; a depressing economy and many touching stories of tragedies.\n\n\u201cFor Nigerians, who lost dear ones to these calamities, it is my prayer that God shall continue to comfort the bereaved families.\n\n\u201cBut this New Year, 2022 promises to be a remarkable one. It is one year that is filled with hope and optimism. It is one year that comes with a unique opportunity for us to redefine the remainder of this decade.\n\nMoving forward into the decade of the 2020s, our New Year resolution should be about eschewing divisive and parochial tendencies and embracing inclusion and general good.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue to kick the same can down the road, yet again. We need a reawakening. And it is a reawakening that must invigorate our unity as one people of one good country. That is the commitment that we must pursue in this New Year.\u201d\n\nNew Year: Kalu cautions political class against hate speech\n\nFormer Governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr Orji Kalu has urged Nigerians to be steadfast, patriotic and optimistic ahead of the New Year.\n\nKalu, while applauding the citizenry for their continued support for President Muhammadu Buhari, cautioned the political class against inflammatory utterances capable of polarising the country.\n\nThe former governor stressed that leaders at all levels of government must ensure the welfare of the people is a top priority in their agenda, adding that the government and the governed must play complementing roles in building a prosperous, united and indivisible Nigeria.\n\nKalu, who made these remarks in his Igbere country home, during the distribution of end of year gifts to his constituents as part of his annual end-of-year activities, called on well meaning Nigerians to embrace philanthropy.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs we approach the new year, it is imperative to reflect on our achievements and challenges as individuals and as a nation.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, 2021 was a year of sober reflection and celebrations. For the country to attain enviable heights, we must shun acts that will divide the country.\n\n\u201cThe time is now for Nigerians, regardless of political, ethnic and religious differences, to sustain peace and harmony in a bid to build a just society. No country can thrive in an atmosphere of disharmony.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s cultural, ethnic and religious diversity must be harnessed for growth and progress of the country. We must not allow political or religious sentiments to take Nigeria backward.\n\n\u201cLet us engage people in government in constructive criticisms as against hate speech and campaign of calumny.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cIn the new year, we must imbibe good moral conduct in our daily pursuits for the sake of peace and unity.\u201d\n\nThe former governor wished Nigerians a prosperous new year.\n\nLet\u2019s enter New Year with hope, Tinubu charges Nigerians\n\nNational leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has charged Nigerians to support President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s efforts to curtail insecurity and other challenges confronting the country.\n\nIn his New Year message, Tinubu said 2021 was a difficult year but urged Nigerians to enter the New Year \u201cwith hope and with the unyielding determination that our hope and collective toil will succeed in bringing forth a more prosperous and just nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsecurity is here in many areas. But we will battle and battle until it is subdued and extinguished from the face of the nation. President Muhammadu Buhari and our security agencies are doing their best to confront the menace. The President has vowed to end this evil. Let\u2019s us join and support him in this common cause regardless of partisan or other affiliation.\n\nWe have an economy to continue to build. Youths in need of jobs. The elderly and the sick in need of care. Infrastructure in need of building. Poverty in need of chasing away. Hunger in need of disappearing. Compassion and care in need of growing.\n\n\u201cLet us focus on these things. For in achieving these things, we achieve a better Nigeria for us all. I urge Nigerians to continue to be law-abiding, peaceful and most strongly committed to the national project upon which we have embarked and for which so many have toiled and sacrificed.\n\n\u201cLet us vow in unshakable promise to dedicate this year and our strongest effort to the welfare and progress of our people.\u201d\n\nOyetola urges Osun people to approach New Year with renewed hope, faith\n\nGovernor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun has urged the people of Osun State to approach the new year with renewed hope and faith, just as he appreciated them for their patience, support, cooperation and constructive criticism shown to his government.\n\nHe urged the people to continue to support his administration\u2019s policies and programmes so as to achieve more desired development.\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press secretary, Ismail Omipidan, Oyetola said: \u201c2022 is no doubt an election year for us in Osun. But I want to assure the good people of Osun that governance will not go on holiday. As we have proved in the last three years that it is not our style to mix politics with governance, we will continue to deliver on our camping promises.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to achieve inclusive socio-economic growth that is rooted in our Ten-Year Osun Development Plan (2019-2028). Our plan rests on four developmental pillars: Economic Development, Infrastructure Development, Human Capital Development and Security, and Environmental Sustainability. This plan is on autopilot.\n\n\u201cWe are resolute on gearing up the momentum of building on the achievements so far, and by so doing, delivering accelerated economic growth and development.\n\n\u201cI rejoice with Nigerians, particularly citizens and residents of Osun, on behalf of my family and the government on the celebration of the New Year \u2014 2022.\n\nAnyim felicitates Nigerians on New Year\n\nFormer Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim has charged Nigerians to demonstrate courage and determination to pull the country back from the precipice in the new year.\n\nIn his new year message, the former Senate President noted that 2022 offers us new hope and fresh opportunities.\n\nSaid he: \u201c2021 was a challenging year. A combination of natural disasters and man-made crisis put Nigeria and Nigerians through very challenging life-tests that stretched our capacities for endurance to the limits.\n\n\u201cEconomic crisis manifested in inflation, unemployment, under-employment, job losses, weak Naira and general low earning capacities that brought Nigerians face to face with threat to their very survival.\n\n\u201cInsecurity which many citizens had wished would abate got a resurgence in 2021, compounding the already difficult life for most Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAgain, there was the COVID-19 pandemic which made a devastating come- back in other variants that shrank social and economic interactions further, and retarded the initial modest economic recoveries made after the first pandemic in 2019.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we all still mourn many Nigerians that died and lament for those that got dislocated, some permanently, from these sad developments of 2021.\n\n\u201cFrom the ashes of 2021, I see hope for Nigerians in the New Year 2022. God promises us hope in times of despair, strength in times of weakness, recovery after tragedies. Our maker also promised that He will never forsake us in times of trouble.\n\n\u201cI therefore charge Nigerians to key into the promises of God in this New Year and stand strong as the overcomers we are as children of God. In 2022, let us demonstrate courage and determination to pull our country back from the precipice. One way of achieving this triumph is by taking even more seriously, our duties as citizens and obligations to be our brothers\u2019 keepers. We must dedicate ourselves to building a more peaceful and cohesive society with justice and equity for all our people and neighbours.\u201d",

          "text": "From Priscilla Ediare, Ado-Ekiti\n\nMr Oluwasola and Mrs Adedoyin Fadare, both from Ekiti State, are the parents of the late Demilade Fadare, the seven- year-old girl that was murdered on December 6 in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State. She was allegedly killed by one Sikemi Olajiga, 31, daughter of Pastor Olajiga, a minister with the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) in Ado-Ekiti.\n\nFadare, a civil servant, works and resides in Lagos State while his wife, also a civil servant, and their children live at Boluwaduro Street, Adehun, in the Ekiti State capital.\n\nThe late Demilade turned 7 on October 8, 2021, about two months before she was despatched to her grave\n\nSaturday Sun reporter recently sat with the disconsolate parents of the young girl in Ado-Ekiti. And they poured out their grief.\n\nHer mother, Mrs Fadare, explained how the tragic incident happened.\n\nRelationship with my daughter\u2019s alleged killers\n\nWe have been living in that house since 2016 and our house is just a stone\u2019s throw from the house of the Olajigas. The only demarcation between our compound and theirs is just a fence. If you are at the backyard of our house you will be looking at their house directly.\n\nAs for our relationship with them, we are not cordial and we are not enemies. Pastor Olajiga parks his car in our compound. I used to drop my kids in their house, but when they started complaining of being maltreated, I stopped dropping them there. My kids call Pastor Olajiga and his wife grandpa and grandma.\n\nHow incident happened\n\nOn December 6, at 8:45am, I sent Demilade to get pap from the next street and I was doing the laundry. When by 9am I didn\u2019t see her, I told her sisters to stay inside, that I wanted to go and call Demilade and know what might be delaying her. I went there, and the man said he told her that it was only one pap that was available, and that she had returned home. I went back home, I called her name, I asked her sisters, they said she was not back. I went back to the pap seller. Then I went to Alhaja\u2019s place, as she also sells pap. Alhaja said she didn\u2019t see her but Alhaja\u2019s children said they saw her. I went back home, I didn\u2019t see her. I went back to the middle of that road and started shouting her name. Pastor Olajiga came out of his house and he said ah, God will make you see her. When Alhaja heard my voice, she joined me and some other people too. We started shouting her name together. I went her school to check, but she was not there. I ran back to the house, I picked her younger sisters and dropped them with another person on the street and I started looking for her. Seconds turned to minutes, minutes turned to hours. I called my husband who had travelled back to Lagos the previous day and he contacted the Flush department of Ekiti State. I kept on shouting that wherever Demilade was they should bring her out. From there, I was told to go to the Civil Defence office, I went there and made my report, I wrote my statement. My husband called and told me that some pastors had been praying and they said Demilade was in that street, that we should go back and start from house to house, that we would find her. I went back to the street. I thought the Yahoo boys in the area might have kidnapped her. I stood in front of their house and started shouting. People had barricaded the roads, that there should be no movement of vehicles or motorcycles out of the street. I received a call from the Civil Defence office that I didn\u2019t sign a particular document that I should come back. Meanwhile, the Flush operatives had decided that they would start a house-to-house search. I went back to the Civil Defence office, and by the time I got back home they said they had searched all the houses on the street, that nothing was found. The search went on for hours, I didn\u2019t see Demilade. I had contacted my friends that Demilade was missing, and flyers were made, the social media had been awash with her pictures in raising the alarm and people had started praying. From there, I went to the police station at Okeila, I was told it was not yet up to 24 hours, that it must be 24 hours before they would declare her missing, that we should go to the one at Okesa, that there is a control room there that they will radio the information all around in case she has been transported away from that street so that the patrol team on the road will be able to get the information. I went there. They got the information. It was radioed all around. From there, I headed to the Ewi\u2019s Palace to lay my complaints. From the palace we went to Amotekun office at Poly Road. Different search parties were going one.\n\nWhen I came back in the evening, I heard that Pastor Olajiga didn\u2019t allow the Flush operatives to enter his apartment, that his wife took the key to work. Mr Olajiga takes his wife to work every morning, and he comes to our compound to pick his car as early as 6:30 or 7:00am. Then he would return home before 9:00am. That means he was back already after dropping his wife at work when he came out to meet me. I started wondering why he would lie to the operatives that his wife took the keys to work. But I just waved it off because he had joined us in the search.\n\nMeanwhile, when Demilade\u2019s playmate came back from school that day, she said she saw Demilade that morning standing in front of our gate talking with someone. The girl said the person was wearing a blue top and black clothes. Then I remembered that on my way to the palace, I saw Sikemi on the road. What she wore was like what the little girl described. The search went on and on till late in the midnight. I could not sleep, my husband could not sleep. We were out on the street. I said if they kidnapped her, they would probably drop her in the middle of the night and she wouldn\u2019t be able to come home on her own in the dark. We didn\u2019t go inside, we were out till 3:00 am. We were even sitting rightly opposite the Olajiga\u2019s house.\n\nI did not even know they were not at home. When Mr Olajiga\u2019s wife came back from work, she joined us in prayers that we would see Demilade, she was speaking in tongues and praying, the husband was praying too.\n\nBut I noticed something, in the morning when I was looking for Demilade, Pastor Olajiga was putting on a blue shirt when he came out. Later when I saw him, he was putting on an orange shirt. It was the second day when I heard that my daughter was killed by the Olajigas that my instinct went there. Perhaps it was after they killed and cleaned her blood, probably his shirt was stained that was why he changed it. Sikemi did not change her clothes till she was found the next day.\n\nThere was no stain of blood on her clothes. Now he is claiming that Sikemi is mad, that she is the one that killed Demilade. She did not change her clothes, there was no stain of blood on her. So, his lies are so transparent and I still want to see them and ask what my family has done to them to deserve this horrible thing. I don\u2019t know why they have done this to my family.\n\n\u201cIt was on Tuesday, December 7 that I was told that my daughter was murdered by the Olajigas. I didn\u2019t know people in the area had known late in the evening on the day of the incident and nobody told me anything. People had told me in the afternoon that all of them were going to do a vigil, that nobody was going to sleep. But I noticed that they all just dispersed and went home. They all left and I was wondering what happened. It was me, my husband, my husband\u2019s friend and Alhaja, the four of us that sat in the middle of the road, waiting for the kidnapper to drop Demilade. My husband said we should go inside at 3:00am, and we went inside. When it was 4:30am, I ran out again and started looking for Demilade, in fact, I was throwing stones on gates that neighbours should come out, that they were not even bothered anymore and they all could sleep overnight. I was so furious. I sat in front of Joy Estate till 8:00am then they stylishly took me away from there and took me to a friend\u2019s place, from there to my in-laws place. That was when they told me that my daughter had been murdered.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cNow, Mr Olajiga is claiming that Sikemi is mad. Sikemi that I know has her full senses in check. Sikemi grinds pepper. She still ground the pepper and moin-moin that we ate at home. She sews clothes. Sikemi once came to my house about some months ago to borrow my laptop and I refused to give her. It was my husband that said I should lend her after she told my husband that she wanted to use it to type church programme. Only God knows what she did, may be she took the pictures of my children from my laptop I don\u2019t know.\n\nThey said Sikemi is mad, there were some neighbours that did drop their children in their house until they left our street. Those people were dropping two children with them every day until they moved out of our street some months ago, but before they moved out, those children were staying in that house from morning till night until their parents come back, Sikemi didn\u2019t kill those children. Sikemi is not mad at all.\n\n\u201cWill Mr Olajiga say he didn\u2019t know when Sikemi brought Demilade inside? Because there is only one entrance to their house. Will he say he didn\u2019t know when Demilade came inside? Will Mr Olajiga say he didn\u2019t know someone was inside? After it happened and I was shouting my daughter\u2019s name, will he say he didn\u2019t know what was going on? All this period Pastor Olajiga had taken his wife to the office and was back home. So, saying that Sikemi is mad is a big lie. I want justice for my daughter. I want nothing but Justice. Demilade did not deserve this at all. Demilade was loved by everybody. She was an innocent girl. She wanted a good life. She said she wanted to be an actor, that she wanted people to see her on the television and in movies. She just learnt a new dance step and she was showing me on Saturday before the incident happened on Monday.\n\nDemilade\u2019s father speaks\n\nDemilade\u2019s father, Mr Oluwasola Fadare also spoke with the reporter. His words: I had been in Ado-Ekiti to see my family and had spent some days with them. I left on Sunday, December 5. I work in Lagos State and I come on a visit periodically to see them. On Monday morning, which was December 6, I had called them earlier that morning because I used to call them every morning before they went to school, when they get back from school, that is if they are in session in school and before they sleep at night. Even while I was around with them I was the one who drove them to school for their Christmas Carol, which came up on Thursday December 2.\n\nOn Monday morning, my wife called me, that she sent Demilade on an errand and that she had been looking for her, that she was nowhere to be found. Immediately, I called my friends here in Ado-Ekiti who are security agents. I called the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) and Flush department and I called some officers of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) that I know in Ado-Ekiti.\n\nThough, before I left Lagos that Monday morning for Ado-Ekiti, I had called a pastor and the pastor said Demilade was somewhere close to our house where we live, that we should be swift about it, that she was held hostage. Later, one of my friends called me back that they had searched all the houses, and barricaded every entrance and exit to the street. Because we stay around Yahoo boys, the search was focused on Yahoo boys on the street. When my friend called me, he said they went to a house, that they met a man sitting outside that they told the man that they had been searching around, they identified themselves, that they wanted to search his house but the man told them that the wife had taken the key to the whole apartment to work. My friend said someone was passing by and the person said this man is a pastor, so, they left the place and conducted a recheck on other houses.\n\n\u201cMuch later, I was worried while I was on my way from Lagos. When I got to Ekiti around past five or to six in the evening, I told my friend who came to pick me up from the park that I wanted to drop in front of Joy Estate. So, immediately I dropped in front of Joy Estate, I sighted Pastor Olajiga.\n\nHis house is not far from Joy Estate. I was at the building after Joy Estate. Immediately he saw me, he fidgeted. This was somebody that parked his car in our house. We call him grandpa. I even felt he wanted to sympathise with me but instead, he went to his car. He didn\u2019t say anything. But I noticed inside his car were his wife in the front seat and his two female children at the back. Upon sighing me, he went towards his car, entered it and drove off.\n\n\u201cIt was the following day that I got to know that Pastor Olajiga went to report at the police station at Okeila that his daughter had murdered Demilade. It was the following day in the morning that they called me. Immediately I got to the street, I was driving and my friend said why would I be driving by myself? They told me to come down. I saw a police van stationed in front of Pastor Olajiga\u2019s house. There is a prison officer that stays on our street. So we all went \u2013 myself, my cousin, the prison controller and the police officers to the police station. From there, we went to the state CID. That was where they narrated everything to me that Mr Olajiga came to report on Monday evening that his insane daughter murdered Demilade, I wept.\n\nSo, at the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) homicide department, I requested that I needed to see Mr and Mrs Olajiga since they told me that they came to report and were detained, to ask some certain questions from them. They brought Pastor Olajiga and his wife out, I asked that what have I done to them to deserve this? We are neighbours, you park your car in our compound, I don\u2019t know what I have done. We are not age mates. We don\u2019t have anything in common. Mr Olajiga didn\u2019t utter a word at that point while I was asking the questions, but the wife said \u201cWe are not the ones.\u201d\n\nAfter meeting with the DCP and Pastor Olajiga and his wife, my wife called that I should help her get some of her clothes. I went to the house. While leaving the house, someone called me that Sikemi had been accosted. Pastor Olajiga\u2019s daughter, the alleged killer of Demilade, that they had accosted her at Carwash junction, Adehun, Ado-Ekiti. My cousin drove me down to the place. When I got there, the mob was so much. Sikemi was found with a brand new two edged cutlass, a bunch of keys to their house, two beef sausage rolls (Gala),and a debit card ,all in a sack. They held and walked her to her father\u2019s house. The mob was too much. On getting to their house, when I noticed the mob was about putting tyre round her neck. I went to beg the mob not to kill her so that I could get justice.\n\n\u201cAt the time I was inside the car, the police vans were already around, I think about four or five of their vans. By God\u2019s grace and with the efforts of the police, we were able to arrest the situation. We got her into the van and drove her off.\n\nQuestions\n\n\u201cBut I am still left with some questions. They said Sikemi is not mentally stable, but she grinds pepper, she sews clothes. If she is mad, why is she staying with her parents? Mr Olajiga\u2019s grandchildren do come around. If she is mad, she should have in one way or the other attacked them. No sane person will live with someone who is mad. You claim she is insane, I believe anyone who is insane should be confined or maybe should be going through a psychiatric treatment. I am still trying to wrap my head round the whole scenario. We see him as a man of God and accorded him that respect. He parked his car in our compound and even had a portion where he parked his car.\n\n\u201cI went to the mortuary to see Demilade on Tuesday. I saw her body. With what I saw, she struggled with her killers. They slit her throat and they stabbed her. I want justice on this matter. My family wants justice.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2018We remain grateful to the Almighty God for yet another year attained as a country, united by a common destiny and resolute in our determination to overcome the several challenges along the path to building the great and prosperous Nation of our dream\u2019\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has urged Nigerians to welcome the year 2022 with hope and envisions a year of continued progress against combined challenges arising from security and socio-economic issues.\n\nThe President, in his New Year message to the nation, said the persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country might have threatened the incremental gains achieved in the real sectors of the economy and in the administration\u2019s overall objective to position the nation on the irreversible trajectory of sustainable growth and progress.\n\nAccording to him, the path to nationhood is often fraught with unpredictable difficulties and challenges, and most tried and tested nations often prevailed through dogged determination, resilience, concerted commitment to unity, and the conviction that the whole of the nation, standing together against all odds, is by far greater and would ultimately be more prosperous and viable than the sum of its distinguishable parts.\n\nBuhari, while noting that the issue of security remains one of the priority areas that his administration had given utmost attention, said as a follow up to its promise to re-energise and reorganise the security apparatus and personnel of the armed forces and the police, his administration had invested heavily in re-equipping the military in line with upgrading the platforms and firepower required to tackle the current challenges being faced in the country.\n\nThe net results of these efforts, according to him, have been the number of insurgents and bandits who have willingly surrendered and continue to do so through various channels and the Safe Corridor created for that purpose.\n\nThe President said his government realised that victory on the battlefield was just one aspect of sustainable victory, \u201cas to fully win this war, the government must also win the peace and real security lies in winning the hearts and minds of the affected citizens.\u201d\n\nTo this end, he said his administration would be working with international partners and neighbouring countries, as well as deploy multi-faceted solutions that would be targeted at addressing human security at the grassroots, before it leads to insecurity.\n\nBuhari lauded the courage and resilience of all Nigerians, which according to him, was evident in 2021 as the nation, like other countries of the world, faced significant challenges that occurred as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to restore the global economy and social order.\n\nHe expressed gratitude to the gallant military, police officers, and other security agents who had lost their lives in the cause of protecting the territorial integrity of the nation against both internal and external aggressors, assuring their families that their sacrifices would not be in vain.\n\nBuhari equally remembered and commiserated with Nigerians who had lost loved ones as a result of insecurity in different parts of the country, noting that every life matters and every single death caused by any form of insecurity is a matter of personal concern to him both as a citizen and as the President.\n\nOn the economy, he said his administration had shown a high level of resilience to record some significant achievements despite the turbulence that has characterised the nation\u2019s economy and the global economy.\n\nBuhari stressed that the major wins recorded could be clearly seen in Nigeria\u2019s most recent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), with a 4.03% growth recorded in the third quarter of 2021, indicative of the recovery being recorded in the economy and the confidence that is being shown through the policies that his administration had put in place after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cWe remain grateful to the Almighty God for yet another Year attained as a country, united by a common destiny and resolute in our determination to overcome the several challenges along the path to build the great and prosperous Nation of our dream.\n\n\u201cWe have given the utmost priority to fighting corruption and other related offenses which have been a bane to the growth and prosperity of our dear nation. We have made major strides and breakthroughs through the innovative use of technology and forensics in the investigative and prosecutorial procedures with commendable results to show that the anti-corruption drive of our administration is succeeding.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, the accomplishments so far can be traced to the dedication of the nation\u2019s anti-corruption agencies who have received the necessary support needed to effectively prosecute their duties. As we welcome 2022, let us, with hope, envision a year of continued progress against our combined challenges arising from security and socio-economic issues.\n\n\u201cAs it is said, the past is but a story told, the future will still be written in gold. Let us be united in our fight to keep our nation united against all odds and with gratitude, celebrate life in this new epoch. I wish you a very happy and prosperous New Year.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says lawmakers will find way forward on direct primary clause\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nThe President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan yesterday announced that the Senate would review the rejected Electoral Act Amendment Bill and the 1999 Constitution immediately it resumes plenary on January 18.\n\nThe National Assembly transmitted the Bill to President Muhammadu Buhari on November 19, last year, with recommendations on electronic transmission of results and direct primaries for political parties, among others.\n\nBut in a letter addressed to the upper and lower legislative chambers, Buhari kicked against the recommendation of direct primaries for political parties on the grounds that it \u201cviolates the spirit of democracy\u201d and subsequently declined to sign the Bill.\n\nIn a New Year statement he personally signed, titled \u201cLet\u2019s keep faith in Nigeria,\u201d Lawan said the Electoral Act Amendment Bill was handled with the spirit of patriotism, even though it was rejected by the President.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe believe that sustainable democratic governance requires a transparent and credible electoral process. Following the decision of President Buhari to withhold assent to the Bill, we shall make further consultations on the issues on our resumption of plenary in January.\n\n\u201cWe shall find a way forward on this critical legislation in the new year. We are determined to deliver an Electoral Act that stands the test of time in safeguarding democracy and the electoral process in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking forward to receiving the report of our Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution upon our resumption from recess. We believe that the outcome of this very important exercise will promote unity, stability and peaceful coexistence in our country.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act Amendment Bill and review of the 1999 constitution will be topmost on our agenda as we reconvene for Legislative business in the New Year.\u201d\n\nLawan also revealed that the promises made to Nigerians with respect to focusing on legislation had been kept by the ninth National Assembly.\n\nPointing out the gains of the Assembly, Lawan stated that the jinx of the Petroleum Industry Bill, which had defied passage for about two decades, was broken by the Assemblywhich got it signed last year.\n\nHe stated that the Assembly was focused and would never be distracted from the implementation of its Legislative Agenda as spelt out following its inauguration in 2019.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Year 2021 was challenging for people all over the world. It is praiseworthy that beyond the challenges, we can see the rays of a bright future from the New Year.\n\n\u201cAs your elected representatives, our new year pledge is to continue to pursue our common desire of a just, peaceful and prosperous country. We promise to continue to discharge this responsibility without fear or malice, confident that by working in harmony, Nigerians will build the great country that is their abiding dream andmanifest destiny.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, insecurity is today one of our biggest challenges. However, I can attest that the government is resolutely addressing these challenges. As a critical contribution to that effort, the National Assembly has appropriated more funds in the 2022 budget to enhance the operational capabilities of our security agencies.\u201d\n\nLawan urged Nigerians not lose faith in the country and its democratic institutions.\n\nHe said Nigeria\u2019s challenges would be overcome and become mere footnotes in the nation\u2019s glorious national history.\n\nThe President of the Senate said the ninth National Assembly was focused and would never be distracted from the implementation of its Legislative Agenda as spelt out following their inauguration in 2019.\n\nHe said: \u201cWithin the context of that Agenda, we have passed many critical bills and have many more to roll out in the New Year.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of 2021, we made specific promises to the Nigerian people with respect to our legislative focus. We are proud that we have kept those promises.\n\n\u201cFor instance, breaking the jinx of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which had defied passage for about two decades, was high on our agenda in 2021. With the cooperation of the Executive and the support of the key stakeholders, we were able to break the jinx. We passed the Bill and got it signed into law in 2021.\n\n\u201cThis piece of legislation will significantly impact the Nigerian economy and propel a significant turnaround in our oil and gas sector.\u201d\n\nOn the annual national budget, Lawan said: \u201cUpon our inauguration in 2019, the ninth National Assembly had promised to reset the national budget calendar to January to December cycle, to make our fiscal system predictable and consistent with international best practice. We have since 2019 passed the national yearly budget every December to enable the President to sign it into law before the New Year. In accordance with this, on Friday 31st December 2021, we witnessed the signing into law by the President, the 2022 Appropriation Bill.\n\n\u201cTimely passage of the budget enhances the performance of the economy and has specifically aided our recent quick recovery from recession. We are determined to sustain this trajectory to act as an impetus to our economic planning and projection.\n\n\u201cThe much that we have been able to accomplish this far can be attributed to the commitment and dedication of my fellow distinguished colleagues and honourable members and the prevailing atmosphere of cordiality between the National Assembly and the Executive. We intend to sustain and even improve on this in the New Year and beyond.\n\n\u201cI appeal for the continued understanding and support of all Nigerians for the government at all levels. As your legislators at the federal level, we will continue in the true spirit of our mantra to \u201cwork for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Ready to submit amendment bill early 2022, assents to 2021 finance bill\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nAfter expressing deep concern about changes effected on the 2022 budget by the National Assembly, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday reluctantly signed the N17.127 trillion 2022 Appropriation Bill into law.\n\nThe presidency had submitted a N16.391 trillion proposal to the national assembly but the lawmakers increased the budget size to N17.127 trillion.\n\nThe President, who also assented to the 2021 Finance Bill at a brief ceremony at the Council Chambers of the State House, Abuja, further hinted of the readiness of his administration to submit an amendment to the 2022 Appropriation law to the legislative arm early in 2022 to take care of the alterations by the National Assembly.\n\nBuhari, while signing the two documents in the presence of Senate President, Ahmed Lawan; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, and members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), expressed strong reservations about the \u2018\u2018worrisome changes\u2019\u2019 to the budget.\n\nBuhari said the lawmakers reduced the amount allocated to some projects, but added 6,576 projects of their own to the 2022 budget.\n\nHe announced that he would revert to the National Assembly with a request for amendment as soon as the Assembly resumed, to ensure that critical ongoing projects cardinal to the administration did not suffer a setback due to reduced funding.\n\nThe President said: \u2018\u2018I signed the 2022 Appropriation Bill into law to enable its implementation to commence on 1st January 2022. \u2018\u2018It is in this regard that I must express my reservations about many of the changes that the National Assembly has made to the 2022 Executive Budget proposal.\n\n\u201cSome of the worrisome changes are as follows: Increase in projected FGN Independent Revenue by N400 billion, the justification for which is yet to be provided to the Executive.\n\n\u2018\u2018Reduction in the provision for Sinking Fund to Retire Maturing Bonds by N22 billion without any explanation.\n\n\u2018\u2018Reduction in the provisions for the Non-Regular Allowances of the Nigerian Police Force and the Nigerian Navy by N15 billion and N5 billion respectively.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is particularly worrisome because personnel cost provisions are based on agencies\u2019 nominal roll and approved salaries/allowances;\n\n\u2018\u2018Furthermore, an increase of N21.72 billion in the Overhead budgets of some Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) while the sum of N1.96 billion was cut from the provision for some MDAs without apparent justification.\n\n\u2018\u2018Increase in the provision for Capital spending (excluding Capital share in Statutory Transfer) by a net amount of N575.63 billion, from N4.89 trillion to N5.47 trillion.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari also expressed concern about the reductions in provisions for some critical projects, including N12.6 billion in the Ministry of Transport\u2019s budget for the ongoing Rail Modernisation projects; N25.8 billion from Power Sector Reform Programme under the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning; N14.5 billion from several projects of the Ministry of Agriculture, and introducing over 1,500 new projects into the budgets of this Ministry and its agencies.\n\nThe President expressed his reservations about the \u2018\u2018Inclusion of new provisions totaling N36.59 billion for National Assembly\u2019s projects in the Service Wide Vote which negates the principles of separation of powers and financial autonomy of the Legislative arm of government.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2018The changes to the original Executive proposal are in the form of new insertions, outright removals, reductions and/or increases in the amounts allocated to projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018Provisions made for as many as 10,733 projects were reduced while 6,576 new projects were introduced into the budget by the National Assembly.\n\n\u2018\u2018Reductionbin the provisions for many strategic capital projects to introduce \u2018Empowerment\u2019 projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018The cuts in the provisions for several of these projects by the National Assembly may render the projects unimplementable or set back their completion, especially some of this Administration\u2019s strategic capital projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018Most of the projects inserted relate to matters that are basically the responsibilities of State and Local Governments, and do not appear to have been properly conceptualised, designed and costed.\u201d\n\nAccording to the President, the 2022 Budget provides for aggregate expenditures of N17.127 trillion, an increase of N735.85 billion over the initial Executive Proposal for a total expenditure of N16.391 trillion.\n\nThe President explained that N186.53 billion of the increase however came from additional critical expenditures that he had directed the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning to forward to the National Assembly.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Minister will provide the public with the details of the budget as passed by the National Assembly, and signed into law by me,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuhari announced that as the 2023 Budget is going to be a transition budget, work would start in earnest to ensure early submission of the 2023-2025 Medium-Term\n\nExpenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper, as well as the 2023 Appropriation Bill to the National Assembly.\n\nHe, therefore, directed Heads of MDAs to cooperate with the Ministry of Finance,\n\nBudget and National Planning, more specifically with the Budget Office of the Federation, to realise this very important objective.\n\nOn COVID-19 and budget implementation, the President said despite the lingering adverse effects of the pandemic, he was happy with the success recorded in the implementation of the 2021 Budget.\n\nPresident Buhari commended the understanding and speedy action of the National Assembly on this matter.\n\nTo achieve the laudable objectives of the 2022 Budget, President Buhari pledged that the federal government would further intensify revenue mobilisation efforts.\n\nHe expressed optimism in the ability of the government to finance the budget considering the positive global oil market outlook and the continuing improvement in non-oil revenues.\n\nBuhari said: \u2018\u2018I also appeal to our fellow citizens and the business community at large to fulfill their tax obligations promptly.\n\n\u2018\u2018However, being a deficit budget, the specific Borrowing Plan will be forwarded to the\n\nNational Assembly shortly.\n\n\u2018\u2018I count on the cooperation of the National Assembly for a quick consideration and approval of the Plan when submitted.\n\n\u2018\u2018All borrowings will be judiciously utilised and invested in our future growth and prosperity.\u2019\u2019\n\nLawan Defends Lawmakers\n\nThe President of the Senate has said the National Assembly was correct in its judgment by tampering with Budget 2022.\n\nLawan spoke at the Presidential Villa shortly after the President signed the budget.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think the most important thing is that Mr. President is happy with the majority of what the National Assembly has done. That is the most critical thing that we need to focus on.\n\n\u201cAs for the observations Mr. President has raised, this is a natural and logical tendency between the executive and the legislature. Sometimes, our views on certain issues may not be the executive\u2019s view.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t think what the President did, by raising some observations, is something we should worry about. I\u2019m happy that the President signed the budget in the first place. And he said it\u2019s going back to the National Assembly to seek amendments or virement. This is a natural, logical legislative process.\n\n\u201cI believe that the National Assembly was right in its judgment, but there is nothing wrong in the executive arm of government coming back to the National Assembly to see how we\u2019re able to dialogue and go through the process and see where the misunderstanding is. But I don\u2019t think that is supposed to be a worrisome development for us.\u201d\n\nLawan further explained that government-owned enterprises should contribute double the N500 billion revenue reflected in the budget.\n\n\u201cThis is based on judgments why we asked for more resources coming from the independent sources, especially from the government-owned enterprises of about N400 billion to N500 billion is because we believe that these government-owned enterprises should contribute even much more. In fact, I hold the opinion that they should have contributed about a trillion, at least, not N500 billion or so.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Dangote Oil Refinery, which is reputed to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refinery, may soon run into a deep financial crisis as a result of a $7 billion debt burden \u2013 a situation which indicates a possible takeover of the project by the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON).\n\nDangote Refinery is an oil refinery owned by the Dangote Group that is under construction in Lekki, Nigeria.\n\nDangote Group is a Nigerian multinational industrial conglomerate, founded by Aliko Dangote, Africa's richest man.\n\nThe Group's interests span a range of sectors in Nigeria and across Africa.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Money Management Series, Dangote Oil Refinery, a 650,000-barrel per day (BPD) integrated refinery project under construction in the Lekki Free Zone, Lagos, Nigeria, was expected to commence production in 2016 with $3.3 billion financing secured in 2013.\n\nWith the refinery now projected to commence operations in 2025, Dangote Group\u2019s indebtedness to financial institutions is estimated to hit $8.4 billion by 2025.\n\nPresently, this debt burden has risen to $7 billion with debt servicing of almost $700 million per annum.\n\nThe completion date of the refinery has been moved eight times.\n\nWhilst some might say this is not in the character for Dangote Industries and their numerous projects across different sectors, the problem is deeply rooted.\n\nA contractor at the delayed refinery project, speaking under the condition of anonymity, said that poor planning, underpayment of contractors, and a lack of proper project management with over 40 contractors on site have led to most of the delays. He also added that of the 40, none is willing to commission as there is no clear delegation of duty and over-decentralisation leading to absolute chaos.\n\nWith these incessant delays, some financing banks are already calling in their loans amid fears of liquidity crisis, while others are elated by the guarantee of huge interests to be recouped as soon as the refinery comes on stream.\n\nDangote has been able to restructure the facilities from various local and international banks twice so far, but most banks have totally refused to restructure for the third time with principal repayment also falling due as well as the annual interest payments.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has made available $3.8 billion as part of federal government\u2019s 20% equity in the project, providing $1 billion cash, while the remaining $2.8 billion will be in crude supply.\n\nHowever, analysts have pointed out that NNPC\u2019s 20% equity at $3.8 billion makes the Dangote refinery overvalued at $19 billion.\n\nWhen Aliko Dangote unveiled early plans for the refinery in September 2013 and announced that he had secured about $3.3 billion in financing for the project, the refinery was estimated to cost about $9 billion, of which $3 billion would be invested by the Dangote Group and the remainder via commercial loans, and begin production in 2016.\n\nHowever, after a change in location to Lekki, construction of the refinery did not begin until 2016 with excavation and infrastructure preparation, and the planned completion was pushed back to late 2018.\n\nIn July 2017, major structural construction began, and Dangote estimated that the refinery would be mechanically complete in late 2019 and commissioned in early 2020. Experts, however, posit that the construction would likely take at least twice as long as Dangote publicly stated, with refining capability not likely to be achieved until 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, last week the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, reiterated that Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the acquisition of 20 per cent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refinery.\n\nSylva, while briefing State House correspondents after the virtual FEC meeting presided by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo last Wednesday at the Presidential Villa, said the acquisition was in the sum of $2.76 billion.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Council also approved the acquisition of 20 percent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refineries in the sum of $2.76 billion,\u201d he said.\n\nThis development has been described by industry observers as strange because $2.76 billion falls short of 20 percent of the Dangote project valued by the sponsor at $16 billion. Using the $16 billion value, 20 percent should be $3.2 billion and analysts have expressed dissatisfaction at the disparity in the project\u2019s value and NNPC\u2019s funding.\n\nSpeaking with MMS Plus on the complexities with funding Dangote refinery, the Managing Director of Cowry Assets Management, Mr. Johnson Chukwu, argued that the banks wouldn\u2019t have any challenge from the financing because Dangote would have to pay the interests.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the banks being unable to meet their liquidity because of the monies tied down in the Dangote refinery. Ultimately, if the investment is economically viable, when it starts operation it should be able to meet up the arrears. I believe the banks that went into this project understood some of these constraints and didn\u2019t break their balance-sheets in the move to finance Dangote refinery. I don\u2019t envisage any bank having a liquidity challenge as a result of investing in Dangote refinery. If there is any challenge it would come from Dangote, but it should be resolved when the project takes off,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on the possibility that NNPC over-valued or under-valued the project in its 20% equity, Chukwu opined that NNPC may be looking at an enterprise valuation while the other value could be the net value.\n\n\u201cThe enterprise value could be higher than the amount Dangote has invested in the project. However, I wasn\u2019t involved in determining that, so anything I say will be purely speculative,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the massive support of the Nigerian government on the refinery project, things have got so bad for the billionaire that even income from his other businesses may not be enough to cover the interest rates, let alone the principal.\n\nThe $8.4 billion debt represents 75% of Dangote\u2019s net worth at $11.1 billion and Africa\u2019s richest man has to seek innovative ways to prop up his business now as the refinery project continues to be consistently delayed.",

          "text": "Some residents of Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital, whose businesses were destroyed by the fire outbreak that occurred at Next Cash and Carry, a popular mall in the Jahi District of the city on Sunday have lamented their huge losses.\n\nThe fire, which started around 9:00 am, razed the entire mall owned by a former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi.\n\nObi is also the vice-presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 election.\n\nThe fire began on the first floor of the facility as workers settled down to begin operations for the day before spreading to other parts of the shopping centre.\n\nDecrying the situation, the owner of a fast-food outlet at the mall, Funmilayo Modupe, revealed that her entire investment and a major source of livelihood had gone down with the fire.

I am left with nothing. I could not save anything.\n\n\u201cThe situation could have been different had officials of the Federal Fire Service and National Emergency Management Authority arrived on time to help put out the fire and rescue valuable items.\n\n\u201cFirefighters only showed up when the entire building had been reduced to ashes. This type of thing cannot happen in a country where things work normally.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where to start from after this huge loss. I am totally confused at the moment.\u201d\n\nAnother business owner within the burnt mall, Ifeanyi Matthias, said he was looking forward to raking in huge profits from sales on Boxing Day before the fire broke out at the place.\n\nAccording to him, efforts by him and others to help combat the inferno didn\u2019t yield much result as the fire was too wild and spreading fast.\n\nMatthias revealed that he doesn\u2019t know if he will ever recover from the loss the incident plunged him into.\n\nHe said, \u201cI'm in pain. I have lost everything. With rapid emergency rescue, I may have at least salvaged something.\n\n\u201cWe called the fire service and NEMA, none of them showed up until after the damage had been done.\n\n\u201cIf those two agencies cannot respond immediately when there is an emergency, I do not see any reason why they exist. I feel really sad over the huge loss.\u201d\n\nA handful of other business owners, while also lamenting the loss of their investments as a result of the fire outbreak at the Abuja shopping mall, called on the Nigerian Government to enact policies that will make emergency agencies respond fast to crises.\n\n\u201cThere should be sanctions for agencies such as FFS and NEMA whenever they fail to respond quickly to an emergency.\n\n\u201cIf there are sanctions in place, it will ensure that officials of these agencies are more responsible while on duty and help save a lot of lives and valuables during tragic events,\u201d Stella Odeh, another affected business owner, said.\n\nRevealing that many items could not be saved during the fire, Mustapha Samson, a security guard at the mall, said it will be difficult to put a monetary value on what was lost to the inferno.\n\nHe said, \u201cI witnessed everything. The fire condemned many items worth billions of naira.\n\n\u201cWe tried to recover the little we could, we did our best but a lot of money was lost.\u201d\n\nThe owner of a barbershop close to the shopping centre, Austin Daniel, confirmed that firefighters and other emergency teams arrived at the scene when the entire building had gone up in flames.\n\nHe said, \"When we got to the place to help them to remove electronics, particularly Plasma televisions and home theatre, the firefighters had not come. The reason why the fire spread to the other side is that the firefighters came late.\n\n\"Some people came to loot but we stopped them with the help of vigilantes.\n\n\"Those firefighters came about one hour after they were called and some of their trucks that first got here did not have water, it was here they started looking for a fire hydrant to fill their tanks.\u201d\n\nDisaster management expert, John Okewu, while reacting to the incident, called on the government to scrap the FFS and NEMA for failing to respond swiftly after the fire outbreak.\n\nHe said, \u201cDo you know that FFS and NEMA receive millions of naira monthly? How many times did we have fire outbreaks in Abuja this year that they responded immediately?\n\n\u201cI think both agencies should be scrapped by the government and replaced with more responsible agencies that can save lives and valuables during emergencies.\u201d\n\nSpokesperson for the Federal Capital Territory Police Command, DSP Josephine Adeh, while revealing that at least four persons had been arrested for looting items from the burnt mall, said an investigation was currently ongoing to determine the cause of the fire outbreak.\n\nIn July, another popular mall in Abuja \u2013 Ebeano Supermarket \u2013 was consumed by fire following an outbreak.",

The post-mortem was carried out in Lagos. The result is out. As of now, it has not brought out the issue of murder on anybody (sic),\u201d he was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cToxicology is still to be carried out which is the final one. The interim one has not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBased on that, the court order we got has elapsed and we have released the housemaster and others on bail as of yesterday because they have not been indicted of murder. It is only murder cases that are not subject to bail.\n\n\u201cSince the medical report has not indicted them so far, I think there is a need for them to have their freedom because bail is not the end of the case.\u201d\n\nThe development comes after the court had granted bail to five students charged with the alleged murder of Oromoni.\n\nIn his reaction, Perry Oromoni, a member of the bereaved family, who spoke to TheCable Lifestyle, kicked against the outcome of the police probe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also accused the Lagos police and the government of hoarding the second autopsy result of the corpse.\n\n\u201cThe Lagos state government has decided to go in favour of Dowen College Lagos and murderers involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Oromoni family has been quiet because we\u2019ve been patiently waiting for the Lagos government to conclude their autopsy and also see how swift they are in carrying our justice for Sylvester.\u201d\n\nBelow are documents showing the result of the autopsy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable.

          "text": "The Kaduna State Schools Quality Assurance Authority (KSSQA) on Friday shut down two Islamiyah schools indefinitely over cases of alleged rape and impregnation of two girls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NAN, Madrasatul Ulumul Deeniya wa Tahfizul Qur\u2019an, one of the schools located in Rigasa, was closed over the alleged rape of a six-year-old girl inside the school premises.\n\nThe other Islamiyah school, located at Tsohon Masallacin Juma\u2019a in Kachia, was also closed following the alleged impregnation of a 12-year-old girl by a 50-year-old teacher at the school.\n\nIdris Aliyu, the overseer of the KSSQA, said the six-year-old girl was violated within the school premises. He also said that the school authority allegedly covered it up and claimed ignorance of the incident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAliyu added that the information before the ministry of education showed that the victim\u2019s grandmother went to the school authority to complain, but was allegedly beaten by students and teachers.\n\nHe said Nasir el-Rufai, the state governor, had ordered that the Islamiyah be shut down indefinitely until an investigation is concluded and the culprit produced.\n\nHe added that the headmaster of the school would be held responsible for the act until all persons in the school were profiled and the perpetrator identified by the girl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe individuals responsible for the violence against the grandmother, especially the headmaster, will also be prosecuted,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is in line with the state government\u2019s responsibility in protecting the vulnerable population in the state.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction, Kabir Abdullahi, the headteacher of the school, Kabir Abdullahi, denied the allegation, saying \u201cit is not rape. What we gathered is that an unidentified boy injured the girl in her private part with a stick.\u201d\n\nAbdullahi said that the case was already being investigated by Abubakar Bauranya, the divisional police officer (DPO), Rigasa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn his part, the DPO confirmed receiving the case and equally aligned with the narrative of the headteacher of the Islamiyah school.\n\nBut Batul Gambo, the grandmother of the girl, insisted that her grandchild was violated and had been confirmed by the sexual assault referral centre, Yusuf Dantsoho Memorial Hospital Tudun Wada, Kaduna.\n\nA medical report signed by a doctor and obtained by NAN also confirmed Gambo\u2019s claim that the six-year-old was raped.\n\nThe doctor\u2019s report attributed the bleeding to \u201cvirginal bruising of the labia minora, bilaterally periureteral bruising, hematoma of the clitoris and laceration of the hymen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the rape and impregnation of the 12-year-old girl in Kachia, Aliyu said that the little child is six months pregnant.\n\nHe said that the school was equally closed as directed by el-Rufai, stressing that the safety of the pupils could not be guaranteed.\n\nHe added that Hafsat Baba, the commissioner of human services and social development, and Halima Lawal, the commissioner for education, would work closely with the police to investigate and ensure justice.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the two schools will remain closed until investigations are concluded and the culprit prosecuted in accordance with the law,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable.

          "text": "EDITORS\u2019 NOTES\n\nOur dear readers, I want to say a big thank you for loving the brand, engaging with the publication, sharing our articles and reports, attending our events, and doing business with us. It\u2019s been an incredible year for us in which we launched TechCabal 3.0 to build a truly pan-African technology publication. We established a physical presence in Kenya and hired Nairobi-based African American technology journalist, Alexandria Williams. Our newsroom grew in order to expand our coverage beyond startup reporting to include consumer tech and Big Tech, which covers the telecoms and banking payment sectors. We broke the earth-shattering news of the dissolution of First Bank\u2019s board by the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele, and the unsuspected high churn of tech talent within Nigeria\u2019s fifth-largest lender Guaranty Trust Bank, which was responsible for its poor mobile services. We have held hands with high-profile leaders in technology and governance to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill to straighten things up as the country\u2019s startup ecosystem witnessed shocking regulatory interruptions this year. Thankfully, the bill has been approved by the executive and is now headed to parliament, hopefully for passing into law soon. 2022 will see us expand into more countries and hire writers on ground across the continent to bring you unrivalled reports on the impact of technology in Africa. Thank you once again and remember to share our articles with your network, because everyone is invited! Happy new year! Adegoke Oyeniyi, Editor-in-Chief Hey everyone, So, how about 2021, am I right? What a whirlwind of a year for Africa\u2019s technology and business ecosystem. We raised money, backed new founders, launched new venture funds, acquired smaller companies, and expanded into new markets. I joined TechCabal in January of this year to help drive TechCabal\u2019s transition from a Nigerian tech publication to a pan-African tech and media publication. This transition had already begun before I said \u201cyes\u201d to the job, but TechCabal 3.0 really grew legs and picked up speed in 2021. And what a hectic year it was for the newsroom. Two brilliant TechCabal reporters moved to other companies (Alexander Onukwue is now at Quartz, and Muyiwa Olowogboyega is doing great work with Lemonade Finance). We brought in new reporters, contributors, and editors onboard (Michael Ajifowoke, Damilare Dosunmu, Timi Odueso, Alexandria Williams, Sultan Quadri and Kelechi Njoku). And as always, we wrote about the impact of technology in Africa. TechCabal Wrapped is our way of walking you through our most-loved and most-read articles in 2021. I encourage you to (re)read, share, and discuss your favourite pieces with your friends and peers. Thanks for sticking with us this year. I can\u2019t wait to connect with you in the new year. Happy holidays. \ud83e\udd42 Koromone Koroye, Managing Editor\n\nHere\u2019s what you enjoyed reading from TechCabal in 2021\n\nIn 2021, TechCabal published 683 articles, 265 editions of TC Daily\u2014including this one\u2014and 50 editions of Next Wave. the Next Wave. Of all these articles, here are the top ten you enjoyed reading the most:\n\n1. iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple released the iPhone 13 series with newer features like larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 terabyte storage), new A15 Bionic processors, smaller notches, and new camera features. In this article, we reached out to trusted Apple retailers across the country and explored the prices of the new iPhones in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. 2. The Next Wave: When tweeting becomes a crime The Next Wave is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that serves as a post-pandemic guide. In this edition, Alexander Onwukwue examined digital regression and social media activism in the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing Twitter ban. 3. Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nIn October, the High Court of Kenya finally issued its ruling on the issue, highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry. 4. Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures\n\nThe Great Resignation hit one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks and, like in other countries, was brought on by rampant stress and the shift to remote work.\n\nIn this article, Daniel Adeyemi and Goke Oyeniyi took us behind the scenes of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures, a phenomenon that plagued many of the bank\u2019s customers in the first half of 2021.\n\n5. Five top instant loan apps in Nigeria\n\nThis year, loan apps on the continent have garnered a reputation for their uncouth recovery methods. Loans, however, still remain the go-to outlet for developing businesses or personal finances.\n\nAs countries continue to clamp down on the unethical practices of some of these apps, TechCabal made a list of some of the best instant loan apps democratising access to credit and bridging financial inclusion with healthy practices.\n\n6. Meet Abeg, Big Brother Naija sponsor and app of the hour\n\nWith an audience of 309 million and billions of impressions across social media, Big Brother Nigeria is one of West Africa\u2019s most-watched television programmes.\n\nLast year, tech companies like Kudabank, Patricia, and even Flutterwave threw their weight behind the show with sponsorship. This year, one of the biggest sponsors of BBN, however, was a newcomer platform called Abeg, who reportedly sponsored the show with $2 million.\n\n7. Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank freezes bank accounts of fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka\n\nAs this year marks several wins for the Nigerian startup scene at large, it\u2019s also the year the Nigerian government came down hard on the ecosystem. From crippling bans to questionable policies, Nigeria went after creators and founders in the economy.\n\nIn August, this manifested with the Central Bank of Nigeria freezing the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka.\n\n8. From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate\n\nOne of the trending questions of the ecosystem in 2021 was: How can more people get into tech?\n\nTo this end, TechCabal wrote quite a number of articles and flagships to help people navigate the wonderful world of tech. This article, however, takes a different approach with a narrative voice that follows the story of Kemi, who went from hawking dry fish to working as a software engineer at Bloomberg.\n\n9. How Herconomy raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours\n\nIn 2021, Nigerian startups raised about $1.4 billion. TechCabal has done a number of stories on some of these raises, most of which are led by venture capitals or private equity firms.\n\nVery few have angel investors leading the raises and even fewer have product users participating in those ventures. In this article, we explored how one startup, Herconomy, raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours, with members of its community as angel investors.\n\n10. Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem pays tribute to Nnena Nkongho\n\nNnena Nkongho.\n\nThe African tech ecosystem mourns the passing of Nnena Nkongho, an African investor who championed diversity and excellence.\n\nAs a way of remembering Nkongho\u2019s greatness and contribution to technology communities at home and abroad, TechCabal published tributes sent to us by people who knew and worked with Nkongho during her lifetime.\n\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed any of our articles, please forward and share them with your networks on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "21 things that happened for the first time in 2021 in the African tech scene",
          "text": "2021 has been a noteworthy year that has seen the African tech sector bounce back from the difficulties it faced in 2020. Here\u2019s a list of 21 things that happened for the first time in the African tech scene this year.\n\nAfrican artists raked in thousands of dollars from selling NFTs (digital art)\n\nThe growing popularity of NFTs has puzzled many, yet it has opened the door for artists and creators from Africa to sell their content to a global audience. With global sales of NFTs topping $2.5 billion in the first half of 2021, we saw African artists like Niyi Okeowo and Nyahan Tachie-Menson sell thousands of dollars worth of NFT; Osinachi sell $75,000 worth of crypto art in 10 days; and Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s work got featured on the New York Times Square billboard.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened in Malawi.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened its doors in July, in Malawi. The school was built by 14Trees, a joint venture between a British development firm and a Swiss company that specialises in building materials. The school\u2019s walls were printed in just 18 hours, compared to the several days it takes to build with conventional building materials. The process in general significantly minimises the time, cost, and materials used for building houses and schools. Hopefully, this technology can help address the severe shortage of schools in the country.\n\nThe African startup ecosystem raised a record $4 billion+ in venture capital funding\n\n2021 year was a landmark year for the African tech ecosystem, raising over $4 billion via 754 deals in venture capital funding. The Big Four\u2014Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt\u2014accounted for 80% of the total amount raised and 76% of the deals.\n\nAn autonomous drone was deployed to attack humans in Libya, the UN says\n\nA report published in March 2021 by the United Nations (UN) Panel of Experts on Libya stated that a drone had been used to \u201chunt down and remotely engage\u201d soldiers who are believed to have been loyal to Libya\u2019s General Khalifa Haftar. This case revisits the conversation on the ethics of using drones in military attacks. How reliable is the technology behind drones, and what could be the implication of a malfunction or error?\n\nApple appointed its first-ever country leader for Nigeria\n\nApple has sold over a billion smartphones (iPhones), yet they account for less than 10% of the smartphone market in Nigeria. In March, the announcement of the appointment of Teju Ajani as Apple\u2019s first-ever managing director for Nigeria is an indication of the tech giant\u2019s interest in Nigeria.\n\nAfrican regulators began responding to the unethical practices of digital lenders\n\nAfter many years of complaints about the predatory tactics of digital lenders, regulators in Nigeria and Kenya began taking steps to curtail it. A Nigerian regulator imposed a \u20a610 million naira ($18,000) fine on Soko Lending company and the Kenyan government recently put a law in place to curtail the excesses of digital lenders.\n\nApple Pay launched in Africa\n\nEight years after Apple launched Apple Pay, its payment and digital wallet system, the tech giant finally brought it to Africa, with its launch in South Africa this year. This launch came three years after Samsung launched its Samsung Pay in South Africa. This move speaks of Apple\u2019s intention to increase its penetration in sub-Saharan Africa where the adoption of digital payments has increased since the start of the pandemic.\n\nGhana kicked off its first fully digital census in West Africa\n\nIn June, Ghana started its first fully digital national census\u2014the first ever in West Africa. The country\u2019s last census was in 2010, and it put the population at 24.6 million. The country has, every 10 years since 1981, conducted the Population and Housing Census (PHC) but was forced to postpone the 2020 census due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nNigeria became the first African country to roll out a digital currency\n\nOn October 25, Nigeria became the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world, to introduce a digital currency. Developed by Barbados-based fintech company Bitt Inc., the eNaira is a legal tender just like the naira. According to the country\u2019s central bank, it must be accepted by all merchants and business outlets as a form of payment in Nigeria. The digital currency is expected to boost cross-border trade and financial inclusion, make transactions more efficient as well as improve monetary policy.\n\nSenegalese TikTok megastar Khaby Lame hit a 100 million followers milestone without saying a word\n\nIn August, Senegalese-born Khaby Lame became the second person ever to hit and cross the 100-million-followers mark on TikTok. Lame, a 21-year-old former factory worker living in Italy on a Senegalese passport, has crafted a comedic brand that has resonated around the world by putting so-called life hacks or complicated manoeuvres through the lens of intuitive everyday options.\n\nGoogle announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa\n\nAt the first virtual Google for Africa event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company\u2019s plan to invest $1billion over five years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\neCommerce giant Amazon stepped up its presence in Africa\n\nFor a long while, there have been questions about when Amazon will kick off operations in Africa. Well, Amazon answered that question this year. First, it affirmed its commitment to Egypt by replacing Souq.com as Amazon\u2019s selling platform in the country with Amazon.eg. This announcement also came with the inauguration of an Amazon fulfilment centre in Egypt. There was also the announcement of Amazon\u2019s controversial African headquarters in South Africa.\n\nThere was an acquisitions spree across Africa\n\nThis year saw a number of companies being acquired, most of them for undisclosed amounts. MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider, was acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nMFS Africa acquired Baxi. MaxAB, an Egyptian B2B marketplace, acquired WaystoCap. Ghanaian fintech startup, Zeepay, acquired 51% of Zambian counterpart Mangwee. Plentywaka acquired Stabus Ghana after $1.2m seed funding. Other notable acquisitions include JIji acquiring Autochek, and Ourpass acquiring Storemia.\n\nThe Ethiopian government launched its own mobile money service\n\nIn May 2021, Ethio telecom launched its own mobile money service, TeleBirr, to cater for the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. Two months after its launch, TeleBirr reported that it has gained six million users. The new service is expected to make a difference in Ethiopia where the banking system is seen as inefficient, with only 19 commercial banks serving the entire population.\n\nFrancophone Africa got its first unicorn in Wave\n\nWave, a spinoff from Asia- and Africa-focused remittance company Sendwave, raised $200 million in a Series A round to become the first unicorn from the French-speaking region of Africa. Why Wave? The startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nSix months and counting: Nigerian Twitter ban\n\nThe Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in June, following the social media platform\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by Buhari, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter has since then triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nSudanese tech got its first foreign funding in 30 years\n\nalsoug, the largest digital marketplace in Sudan, raised a $5 million investment round co-led by Egyptian fintech unicorn, Fawry, and a \u201cwider consortium of Western venture capital firms\u201d. This investment marked the first foreign venture capital investment into the Sudanese tech ecosystem since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period.\n\nSomalia got its first Visa card payment service\n\nVisa partnered with the International Bank of Somalia (IBS Bank) to launch Somalia\u2019s first Visa card payment service. This came six years after Mastercard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market. This partnership is an important indicator that Somalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headway towards reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nEthiopia awarded its first telecom license\n\nIn May, Ethiopia awarded its first telecom licence to a consortium made up of Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc, and Sumitomo Corp. The next month, Ethiopia launched a tendering process for the proposed sell-off of a 40% stake in the state-owned Ethio Telecom to private investors. These actions are all parts of the government\u2019s broader plan to open up the economy.\n\nTwitter opened its first Africa office in Ghana\n\nIn April 2021 social media giant Twitter announced Ghana as its choice for an African headquarters. The move came as a surprise to some who expected it to be Nigeria, a country with more Twitter users and a larger population overall. Twitter cleared the air by stating that its reasons for choosing Ghana were because the country was a \u201csupporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet\u201d.\n\nThe continent produced a record number of new unicorns in a year\n\nThere are a total of eight tech unicorns in Africa right now, with five of them\u2014Flutterwave, Andela, ChipperCash, Wave, and Opay\u2014attaining this status in 2021. Notably, fintech is having its moment as the majority of the unicorns are fintechs. The other companies that attained unicorn status before this year are Interswitch, Jumia, and Fawry.\n\nThat\u2019s all for 2021! What events did we miss out on, and what first-time surprises do you think await us in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ask an Investor: Twelve insights from Africa\u2019s top investors",
          "text": "At one point or the other, every startup founder or CEO was a newbie in navigating the murky waters of institutional investment. They maybe even got burnt because they didn\u2019t know the right questions to ask, or what to look out for.\n\nSo, we started the Ask an Investor series to help explain why and how investments in companies happen in Africa from the people who make them happen.\n\nIn the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed over 20 investors who\u2019ve shared their thoughts on what investors look out for in founders and startups before investing, the lessons learnt and mistakes made, key trends, and other relevant nuggets.\n\nI\u2019ll be highlighting a few insights from the published interviews here and think you should read the full version of the interviews.\n\nFounders Factory: A hands-on approach\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that I learnt early on from my conversations with different investors, it\u2019s that all investors are not the same. Their approach to investing is often influenced by their background and experiences. While most people easily associate investors with just money, Founders Factory Africa (FFA) would rather have you think of more.\n\nIn a conversation with Sam Sturm, one of the founding partners of FFA, he explains why:\n\n\u201cWe believe that capital isn\u2019t the only way to support a business. You need it so that you can execute but at the end of the day, capital isn\u2019t what solves problems. We believe that the challenges of product-market fit, customer acquisition, or retention are not the kind of challenges that capital alone can solve. Those are the challenges that you\u2019re looking to entrepreneurs to solve, that you\u2019re looking to the team to solve. If you can supplement them with experienced and talented people, you\u2019d be successful.\u201d\n\nAlongside providing capital, FFA is a venture building studio, this means that a portfolio startup can expect to get support from private coaches, product managers, product designers, etc.\n\nMicrotraction: A novel approach\n\nFive years ago, Yele Bademosi saw that it was difficult for people to raise funds if they didn\u2019t have a wealthy relative or network, so he set out to make it easier for founders to raise money.\n\nBut first, the Microtraction team had to do away with the status quo. This meant no batches, no programmes, and no demo days. Microtraction invested on the go.\n\nAnother different thing about Microtraction\u2019s approach is its bias for investing in startups with technical founders/co-founders. Why?\n\n\u201cIf we give you money, and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders.\u201d Bademosi explained. \u201cWe\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\u201d\n\nAcumen: Patient capital\n\nThe original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. So Acumen goes a step further beyond providing donations and grants to startups. It\u2019s a non-profit that uses donations received to invest in startups working on socially relevant issues.\n\nMeghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen, explained this: \u201cIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen, and we redeploy and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\u201d\n\nAcumen is able to invest at an early stage and wait a little longer than other traditional venture capital firms because they don\u2019t have to return the money back to donors.\n\nSawari Ventures: North Africa\u2019s leading VC firm\n\n2021 was an exciting year for North Africa as it garnered a lot of attention and funding. Before the boom, Sawari Ventures, which was founded over a decade ago, has been backing North African startups. The founders of Sawari Ventures also founded Flat6Labs\u2014the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator.\n\nIn our conversation, Tamer Azer explained the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup.\n\n\u201cVC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime. They have a 10-year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing, and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\n\u201cJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing cheques, we have to get the money to be able to write these cheques first. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these cheques. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\u201d\n\nUnconventional Capital: Removing gut feelings and bias in startup investment\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of my conversation with Franziska Reh, CEO of Unconventional Capital, I understood why the word \u201cunconventional\u201d was befitting.\n\nHere\u2019s how early-stage investment mostly happens: An investor and an ambitious entrepreneur get talking. After a few background checks and business plan conversations, the investor decides whether to invest. But not before checking their gut feeling. Along the way the investor is constantly asking, \u201cDoes this feel right?\u201d\n\nAt Uncap, the team decided to flip this approach upside down by relying on algorithms to make these decisions.\n\nReh explained, \u201cAt Uncap, in our investment process, no one in our team makes investment decisions. The selection process is based on an algorithm that focuses very much on the potential of the entrepreneur. It\u2019s a model that measures entrepreneurial potential as a predictor of future success. Afterwards, we invest through a standardised model.\u201d\n\nThis model allows Uncap to invest in thousands of entrepreneurs. Interestingly, Uncap exits the portfolio companies gradually over a period of time\u2014an unconventional exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThese companies we invest in buy back their equity through 5% of their quarterly revenues. They transfer 5% of their quarterly revenues to us. By this act, over time, they buy back the whole investment, plus the price that we\u2019ve paid before. It\u2019s a fixed multiple on the investment, it\u2019s basically the same for everyone.\u201d\n\nTomi Davies: Tales of an African angel Investor\n\nThe conversation with Tomi Davies, or TD as he\u2019s fondly called, started off with him explaining how he was able to partner with some of the brightest minds on the continent to build the angel investment space in Africa. He was part of the team that started the Lagos Angel Network and the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nWhile many know TD for his role in the African Angel community, but he\u2019s more than that.\n\n\u201cI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, and sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum,\u201c Davies said.\n\nHe also shared his proprietary framework for investing in startups.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\n\u201cFinally, you ask: is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also, is the business model sustainable? Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\u201d\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: Angel investor and startup advisor\n\nWhen I visited Ghana in July, Ato Bentsi-Enchill was one of the people I met. One thing that stood out to me was that he moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did he learn all these?\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network.\u201d Bentsi-Enchill explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\u201d\n\nAs a startup advisor, he helps African startups raise capital and protects them from difficult investors. In our conversation, he cites some instances where he\u2019s helped.\n\n\u201cFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts\u2014a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\u201d\n\nAdam Molai: African industrialist\n\nZimbabwe is known more for the Victoria Falls (the largest waterfall in the world) than its tech ecosystem, but still, Adam Molai is one of the few investors looking to change that.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice, and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and, through the Jua Fund, has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove, and many others.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye, he shared one of the best practices startups should adopt in getting funded.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund, this is what I must put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\u201d\n\nSunu Capital: A pan-African fund with a solo general partner\n\nSince Benjamin Schmerler left the United States at the age of 18, he\u2019s lived and worked in nearly every corner of the globe. Interestingly, he stumbled on the name for his firm\u2014SUNU Capital\u2014 while in Senegal.\n\nHe heard the word sunu in a song, and when he found out that it meant \u201cour\u201d, it resonated with him. \u201cI used it as the name of my firm because it\u2019s a simple word and, more importantly, because I believe in collective effort; working together to build more wealth for everyone and leave this planet a better place for our children,\u201d Schmerler said.\n\nOne thing he\u2019s been thinking about recently is how to aggregate African markets.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is how to break the borders between countries so we can get a larger aggregated market that can be efficiently served. I believe if we can do this, we would see exits on a scale beyond anything we have seen to date.\n\n\u201cI talk to entrepreneurs all the time and they show me the total addressable market (TAM) of Africa, a map of 54 countries. They hint at the possibility of expansion, and I\u2019m thinking, how do we unlock Gabon? What does it take to be a part of Cameroon as well? There is so much untapped potential all over the continent that I am absolutely excited by infrastructure that turns the 4 or 5 markets where all the activity is happening into 10, 20, 30 countries over the next handful of years.\u201d\n\nKepple Africa: Creating new industries\n\nA few minutes into our conversation, Satoshi Shinada reminded me that I need to visit more African countries. At the age of 18, he left Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years.\n\nFor Kepple Africa Ventures, the big vision is to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nIn our conversation, Shinada shared some mistakes he\u2019s made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything, and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\n\u201cAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\u201d\n\nLoftyInc: Not playing by the rules of VC investing\n\nIn 2012, Idris Bello and his partners, then in their early 30s, left their lucrative jobs and raided their savings to create the LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund. Over the years, through trials and errors, they\u2019ve seen some level of success. Today, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella.\n\nBello, who believes in sharing a full picture of his investor journey, shared some notable deals missed or mistakes made along the way.\n\n\u201cThose are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process there. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\n\u201cMost of the mistakes we made were as a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 cheque. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\u201d\n\nCapria ventures: Backing local funds and startups\n\nFive years ago, Jack Knellinger, Dave Richards and Will Poole formed Capria ventures, an investment firm that started out investing in local funds (VC firms) across the global south\u2014Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Recently, Capria Ventures has begun investing directly in startups, providing the much needed growth stage capital for them.\n\nToday, Capria Ventures has investment activity in about 50 countries with $650 million worth of current assets under management.\n\nIn my conversation with Jack Knellinger, he enlightened me on how they support VC firms\u2014a subject rarely spoken about.\n\n\u201cObviously, the main thing top of mind is fundraising\u2014helping them close their fundraising. Here, it involves everything from introductions to reviewing pitch materials. We look at how the funds are being positioned as well as the terms and negotiations with limited partners to ensure there\u2019s alignment between the fund managers, general partners, and limited partners.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the fundraising is done, we move to portfolio management. How are they putting in place the right systems and processes to grow, scale, and institutionalise the firm? Here, there\u2019s a wide range of things to be done in that regard, from team development to appropriately conducting due diligence before investing. When the fund managers have built up their portfolio of companies, we move to how they think about exits. What\u2019s the right time to exit? Do they want to look at partial exits?\n\nWhen a firm has mastered these aspects and gone on to raise multiple funds. We look at how they\u2019re telling the story of the firm and the funds you\u2019ve managed.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all for this year! Thank you to all the investors who took their time to talk to me and help others learn more about investing in startups.\n\nWhich investors/firms will you like me to talk to in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Jack Dorsey\u2019s Btrust members\u2019 plan to facilitate financial freedom",
          "text": "Bitcoin technology is powered by software developers or contributors that work on a pro bono basis. So, the Bitcoin infrastructure would be threatened if these highly skilled developers refuse to work or are not skilled enough to maintain the code that sustains the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIn recent times, there have been efforts to prevent this from happening by supporting Bitcoin software developers to make Bitcoin more private, resilient, and decentralised. In May, popular crypto derivatives exchange, BitMEX, partnered with global non-profit, Human Rights Foundation (HRF), to provide a $150,000 grant for Calvin Kim, a Korea-based Bitcoin scaling researcher, and a $50,000 grant for Abubakar Nur Khalil, a Nigeria-based Bitcoin wallet developer.\n\nIn February this year, Twitter co-founder and former CEO, Jack Dorsey, had also taken a similar path when he announced that he was launching a new endowment called \u201c\u20bftrust\u201d, in partnership with rapper Jay-Z, to fund Bitcoin development in India and Africa.\n\nHe promised to donate 500 bitcoins ($23 million) to the endowment fund and give its board complete autonomy to use the funds as they deemed fit. But he has one ask: \u201cMake Bitcoin the Internet\u2019s currency.\u201d\n\nLast week, he unveiled the members of the board\u2014four of them\u2014to the world: Nigeria\u2019s Abubakar Nur Khalil, Obi Nwosu, and Ojoma Ochai; and South Africa\u2019s Carla Kirk-Cohen.\n\nBoard members with a game plan\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account. He became a contributor to Bitcoin Core\u2014there are less than 40 of them in the world\u2014when he was just 19. But the journey began in late 2017 when he heard about Bitcoin\u2019s price and started reading about it. The following year, he got into programming and built a blockchain-based app, before becoming a contributor to Bitcoin Core in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, he co-founded Recursive Capital, a venture capital that provides crypto-focused startups with seed and early-stage investments, with the aim of contributing to the development of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Recursive Capital is on a mission to facilitate online sovereignty\u2014tools, protocols, and ventures that democratise data ownership and promote privacy, encryption, and financial sovereignty\u2014all driven by Bitcoin. Despite being founded before the Web 3.0 buzz, Recursive Capital had decided that it wanted to enhance financial freedom by decentralising the financial monetary system.\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account.\n\nKhalil, who was recently named Recursive Capital\u2019s CEO\u2014after serving as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO)\u2014explained that Recursive Capital realised that Africa\u2019s financial infrastructure is underdeveloped and cannot handle the amount of load being put on it.\n\nHe explained that this is why it is hard to send and receive money across two African countries, and even more difficult across continents. But he believes that Bitcoin will level the playing field since the requirements for participating are low. All you need is a phone and internet access, and a bitcoin address or lightning address\u2014think email address but for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is democratising financial freedom on a global scale. It is also providing a unified monetary network where individuals from any part of the globe can transact instantly and have settlement across the global ecosystem cheaply,\u201d he told TechCabal in a call.\n\nTalking about the barrier to entry for Bitcoin, Khalil believes a misconception lies in the way people approach it. He explained that Bitcoin should be seen as an investment over a long time. This way, investors don\u2019t bother about how high its current price is. He also believes that an easy-to-use interface on mobile and web-based wallets should be created, so that non-technical individuals can use Bitcoin. This would help in lowering the barriers to entry.\n\nEarlier this year, after realising there is a dearth of Bitcoin developers in Nigeria and Africa, Khalil also founded Qala, to begin a revolutionary campaign of expanding the pool of Bitcoin and lightning developers on the continent.\n\nAll selected \u20bftrust board members\n\nOjoma Ochai, one of the newly appointed board members to \u20bftrust, explained that her selection was based on a combination of her experience in Africa\u2019s creative and digital economy and demonstrated interest in writing and talking about emerging technologies on the continent. Ochai has vast experience in non-profit management and governance across Africa and has run creative and digital economy projects across policy and practice in these sectors, on the continent and beyond. She also has board experience, being the board chair of the British Council Nigeria Programmes entity for two years. She was also involved in initiatives like the African Tech and Creative Group, which aims to capture value for African creatives and the tech sector.\n\nOchai also started a company with CcHub, The Creative Economy Practice, to capture more value for the African creative economy through projects that stimulate innovation and technology and enhance value chains and business models.\n\nWhat will Bitcoin do for Africa?\n\nKhalil believes in educating and enlightening individuals about Bitcoin\u2019s long-term benefits: economic freedom for the entire continent. Khalil believes Africa needs Bitcoin more because the currency of most of its countries are volatile, making it pointless for people to save long term in their native currencies.\n\nHe said that the reason many people see Bitcoin as volatile is that they approach it as a short-term asset: \u201dBitcoin is only volatile in a short timescale\u2014 a week, three months. But if you look at the asset across, for example, an entire year, it is quite stable, compared to some national currencies.\u201d\n\nOn fraud claims around Bitcoin, Khalil argues that Bitcoin is one of the most open monetary systems because the majority of fraudulent transactions still pass through the traditional financial system, where it is relatively easy to track parties involved.\n\nOchai believes that bitcoin will eventually become a viable medium for Africans to do business without restrictions. She added that it would also help the creative industries easily monetise content.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for Africans to be more involved in building solutions that work for us so that we move away from the paradigm of things being done to us and for us to a paradigm where we contribute our skills, worldview, and capabilities towards solving our own problems and being part of a global seismic shift,\u201d Ochai said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\u2019s startup scene has seen continued progress year on year. After a slight setback in 2020, courtesy of the coronavirus and the ensuing lockdown, activities have resumed as usual \u2014 well, almost.\n\nAs the year ends, we bring you a few memorable moments across the African tech ecosystem, some good and some bad.\n\nMore African investors throw their hats in the ring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKola Aina, pioneer founder Ventures Platform fund\n\nFor so long, most of the investment into African startups came from foreign investors. Make no mistake, that is still the case. However, more African investors are springing up and providing much-needed funding for African startups.\n\nThis year saw PiggyVest\u2019s Co-founder, Odunayo Eweniyi team up with Eloho Omame to start FirstCheck, an African firm funding startups founded by women. Seasoned investor and early PiggyVest investor, Olumide Soyombo, launched Voltron Capital; LoftyInc Capital launched its third fund of $10 million. Ventures Platform recently announced the first close of its $40 million fund.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany founders also invested in startups themselves or as part of a collective, with Flutterwave\u2019s Founder, Olugbenga Agboola; Paystack\u2019s Co-founders, Shola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi; and Babs Ogundeyi, Founder and CEO of Kuda Bank some of the founders to do so.\n\nAll this points to a better understanding of the dynamics of funding tech startups by local investors and would help support more innovators on the continent. We\u2019re excited to see how this plays out.\n\nNigeria\u2019s crypto ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a broken payment infrastructure, many Nigerians took to cryptocurrencies to navigate global financial systems.\n\nHowever, the Federal Government of Nigeria was having none of it. Through the Central Bank of Nigeria, it issued a circular in February instructing commercial banks and other licensed financial institutions to stop facilitating transactions for cryptocurrency exchanges in the country.\n\nThere was a brief period when it seemed users of cryptocurrencies were going to capitulate, but they were only regrouping with peer to peer transactions increasing as a result.\n\nThe year of the unicorns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Kglavin via Wikipedia Commons\n\nAs the year started, Africa had only one unicorn. As of December, it now boasts five fintech startups as OPay, Flutterwave, Chipper Cash, and talent outsourcing company, Andela, joined Interswitch as the continent\u2019s unicorns.\n\nFlutterwave led the way when it raised $170 million in a Series C round in March, bringing its total funding to $225 million.\n\nOPay was the next with a $400 million raise that took its valuation way past the $1 billion mark and made it the fastest African startup to cross the $1 billion valuation mark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy September, Andela became the latest unicorn after Softbank led a $200 million Series E round in the talent outsourcing startup. Chipper Cash rounded up the list as Africa\u2019s seventh unicorn raising a $150 million extension round. This followed its $100 million Series C raise in May.\n\nTwitter\u2019s first African office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n\nNigeria\u2019s frequent fight with Ghana continued this year, and this time, it was not over who had the better jollof rice but over Twitter\u2019s decision to set up its first African office in Ghana.\n\nThe decision to set up in Ghana was a surprise to many after comments made by Twitter\u2019s then CTO (now CEO), Parag Agrawal, during a 2019 visit to Nigeria.\n\nDuring the visit, Agrawal commented on the availability of technical talents in Nigeria and impactful public conversations.\n\nThe roles it began hiring for also indicate that the plan might have been to set up in Nigeria with the company listing free speech, online freedom, and the open Internet as its reasons for choosing Ghana.\n\nThe Nigerian Startup Bill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Daniel Bone from <a\n\nBuilding a startup in Nigeria means occasionally pulling all-nighters as you try to figure out how to surmount the latest regulatory hurdle. For so long, it has been argued that Nigerian startup founders need to be proactive in their interactions with the government and regulators.\n\nAs a result, some of the country\u2019s most prominent founders and investors came together to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill. The Bill seeks to set a framework of interaction between the Nigerian startup community and the government to enable startups to thrive.\n\nHowever, this is not the first of such initiatives, and few people expressed scepticism about it. However, it seems plans are on track, with TechCabal reporting that Nigeria\u2019s Federal Executive Council has approved the bill.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether things work better this time around, but we hope they do.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Twitter ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, June 2, 2021, microblogging platform, Twitter, deleted tweets made by the Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari. According to Twitter, the decision resulted from the President\u2019s violation of its abusive behaviour policy.\n\nTwo days later, on June 4, 2021, the federal government responded by banning the use of the microblogging platform in Nigeria, forcing Nigerians to access Twitter using VPNs. Over the next few months, the federal government disclosed a willingness to lift the ban, provided Twitter agreed to some conditions.\n\nIn August, the Federal Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, hinted that the ban would be lifted \u201cin a matter of days.\u201d It\u2019s been over four months now, and the ban is still in place.\n\nFrancophone Africa gets its first unicorn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil this year, all of Africa\u2019s tech unicorns had been founded in predominantly English speaking countries. But in September, Wave broke that monopoly, becoming the first francophone Africa unicorn. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, it came from the fintech sector.\n\nThe startup became a unicorn after it raised $200 million in Africa\u2019s largest Series A round to date. Founded by Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk, Wave launched in Senegal in 2017, offering free deposits and withdrawals via its mobile application while charging users a 1% fee for money transfers.\n\nIts low-cost solution has enabled it to take on more established players in Senegal, with Orange, the country\u2019s largest mobile money operator, reportedly going as far as stopping its Senegalese users from purchasing Orange airtime using Wave\u2019s application.\n\nRecord-breaking rounds for Egyptian startups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many ways, 2021 was the year of Egyptian startups. Last year, startups in the country raised $156 million, but by August 2021, they had eclipsed those figures. As of September, startups in the country had raised over $400 million in 2021.\n\nConsequently, it now rivals Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa as the continents top investment destinations.\n\nAlready, the country has one startup valued above $1 billion in Fawry and could have two when Swvl lists publicly. According to Disrupt Africa\u2019s Egyptian Startup Ecosystem Report 2021, this year, Egypt is behind only Nigeria in terms of funding raised by its startups. However, unlike most startup powerhouses on the continent, Egypt\u2019s most prominent startups are in eCommerce instead of fintech.\n\nMainOne\u2019s impending acquisition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunke Opeke. Founder/CEO, MainOne\n\nLast year, telecommunications service provider, MainOne, celebrated its 10th anniversary. This year, reports have emerged that the company is in talks to be acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nIt is fair to say that the news was one few, if any, were expecting as Nigerians made their feelings known on Twitter. A central talking point was the rumoured cost of the transaction, with some of the opinion that the company was underpriced.\n\nHowever, Funke Opeke, the company\u2019s Founder and CEO, quashed such suggestions in an interview with TechCrunch. According to her, while MainOne has raised money since its founding, not all of it has been equity raises, with the company also raising debt rounds.\n\nAt $320 million, this is the highest any Nigerian tech company has acquired. Throw in the fact that this is a female-led company, and you can see how impressive it is.\n\nNigeria\u2019s surprising 5G auction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s road to getting 5G has thrown up some surprises, but none has been more surprising than one of the recently concluded 5G auction winners \u2014 MAFAB Communications.\n\nUntil the bids were announced, very little was known about MAFAB Communications or its operations. However, it surprisingly beat Airtel to become one of two holders of Nigeria\u2019s 5G licence. For context, the company was only incorporated on July 8, 2020, but managed to edge out older and more established players.\n\nAs we step into the new year, we do so with excitement at what is to come, and we hope you had an amazing year.\n\nMerry Christmas, and a happy new year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween January and September 2021, African fintechs raised up to $1.4 billion, signalling an increasing investor appetite for Africa\u2019s growing fintech space, and Nigeria has taken centre stage.\n\nWhen Paystack and Flutterwave launched in 2016, it was a massive game-changer for Nigeria\u2019s financial sector, enabling thousands of other businesses to receive payments for their services.\n\nSince then, each year has presented an interesting trend as people look to plug different perceived gaps in Nigeria\u2019s financial sector.\n\nAccording to data gathered by Intelligence by Techpoint, Nigerian fintech startups raised almost $800 million in 2021. This was 120% higher than what fintechs raised in the last three years combined ($360.7 million).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs usual, it took the lion\u2019s share of funding across sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite this success, our analysis showed that fintechs were merely scratching the surface of financial inclusion in Africa. But, so far, there\u2019ve been massive improvements in the fintech space beyond smartphone apps.\n\nLooking back at 2021, we touch on some notable points, and, once again, we had the honour of discussing the space with Adedeji Olowe, Trustee of Open Banking Nigeria.\n\nIn January 2021, Olowe made some interesting predictions which, in the real sense, are educated guesses based on the trends from past years, and we created a little analysis.\n\nInterestingly, some predictions came to pass, reminding us that no one sees the future. At least, we haven\u2019t met anyone who does, have you?\n\nWhat did not happen?\n\nVisa and Mastercard to acquire Interswitch and eTranzact, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2021, we placed what was perhaps the most daring and exciting prediction front and centre in our analysis of Olowe\u2019s fintech predictions. Visa could acquire Interswitch with Mastercard responding by acquiring eTranzact.\n\nThis obviously did not happen, but several building blocks are in place to make it possible.\n\nRecall that in 2019, Visa invested $200 million in Interswitch, making one of Nigeria\u2019s oldest fintech companies a full-fledged Unicorn. That investment brought several conversations about Visa\u2019s play for the Nigerian market, and that of its biggest competition, Mastercard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth companies have invested in many Nigerian fintechs, most notably Paystack and Flutterwave, and seemingly took their battle for market share to Africa\u2019s shores.\n\n\u201cI made the prediction because I think it made perfect sense for both companies to go through that route, and I think it\u2019s still a possibility in the future,\u201d says Olowe.\n\nMajor banks to implement free transfers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest selling points Digital banks like Kuda have used to take the market by storm is free transfers. Unfortunately, no major bank took up the gauntlet to implement free bank transfers in 2021.\n\nAccording to Olowe, giving free transfers for transactions below a certain amount would greatly aid Nigeria\u2019s drive for a cashless society. This, he says, would bring in several people performing low-value transactions daily.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s something the CBN should push for. Over 20 years ago, a SIM card cost \u20a620,000, but now it\u2019s completely free. Today, some people don\u2019t mind buying \u20a650 recharge cards ten times in a day, but tell them to load \u20a6500 at once,\u201d he states.\n\nOlowe believes that once a cap is set, it would be very helpful and will not be abused.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling people to send their own hard-earned money. Even if it\u2019s free, It won\u2019t be so easy. If the accounts are linked with the BVN, then it would be easier to catch those who might want to abuse the policy,\u201d he argues.\n\nCould we see another game-changing CBN circular soon? Let\u2019s watch out.\n\nMonthly inter-bank transactions to hit $500 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral fintech stalwarts tout Nigeria\u2019s payment sector as one of the fastest globally. This was made possible by the introduction of the NIBSS Instant Payment by the Nigerian Inter-Bank Settlement System. This speed, as well as several other factors like increasing Internet penetration, has increased monthly inter-bank transactions in recent years.\n\nAs of December 2020, the numbers had almost hit $300 million, but so far, in 2021, it hasn\u2019t come close to $500 million.\n\nAccording to data from the NIBSS, the average monthly inter-bank transactions stayed a little over $250 million for the better part of 2021, finally crossing $300 million in October and November.\n\n\u201cTransactions will likely go up during the festive season, but I doubt it will hit $400 million.\u201d\n\nIt stands to reason that free inter-bank transfers could encourage more inter-bank transactions, but it might not always be so straightforward. Let\u2019s watch out for any triggers in 2022.\n\nWhatsApp to make a payment play in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, all it would have taken was a virtual account attached to every WhatsApp number, and that would have been a game-changer, Olowe opined in January 2021. However, WhatsApp payment struggled to lift off during the year.\n\nIts launch in Brazil met with stiff opposition, and regulatory parties all but quelled any traction it plans to gain. However, the team at Meta-owned WhatsApp is not deterred, and it announced a relaunch in Brazil and testing in the United States in December 2021.\n\nOlowe believes they\u2019re not out yet, stating that future developments would most likely tie in with Meta\u2019s recent crypto play.\n\nImagine being able to make transactions from a crypto wallet in your WhatsApp account. That would be something, don\u2019t you think?\n\nSignificant progress\n\nThe growth and relevance of agency banking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgency banking burst onto the scene in 2020 with the reported successes of OPay and TeamApt. In 2021, it grew to unprecedented levels as more players like Kudi and Paga began to show immense growth in Agency banking services.\n\nOlowe predicted that Agency banking locations would surpass one million. Though we tried collating data from different players, this could amount to double-counting as most agents are company agnostic. So we\u2019ll try to lay our hands on official data.\n\nIn January, Olowe argued that if KYC issues were resolved, most agents would be able to perform services such as offering loans, customer KYC verification, e-commerce deliveries, and other non-cash transactions.\n\nThis idea has not been fully realised, but some of the players in the space have made some significant strides.\n\nTeamApt, OPay, and Paga, for example, offer bill payments and other social services, but a little talked about company, Kudi, has struck some interesting initiatives.\n\nIn August 2021, it revealed a partnership with Aella App and Reliance HMO to allow customers access loans and health insurance through their network of agents.\n\nYou see, mobile money providers do not have the licence to provide loans or insurance, but that\u2019s where Aella comes in to provide loans to customers, and Reliance comes in for health insurance.\n\nAccording to Nifemi Akinwamide, Head of Marketing at Kudi, the goal is to bring millions of Nigerians who are offline into the financial market, and such a partnership would help Aella and Reliance reach thousands of people who do not have smartphones.\n\nThis deserves a closer look, and its success might help make this prediction get a more favourable outcome in 2022\n\nWhat happened\n\nMTN finally got its PSB licence\n\nIn January, Olowe stated that MTN would finally get its PSB licence, and he based his prediction on the fact that Karl Toriola, MTN\u2019s CEO, who has a history of execution, would make it happen.\n\nAt the MTN anniversary event, we tried getting some juice from Toriola, but he simply stated that the company had completed all the requirements and was waiting for the CBN\u2019S final decision.\n\nIn November 2021, MTN and Airtel finally received approval in principle (AIP) to operate as a payment service bank in Nigeria. They joined 9mobile and Glo that got the AIP in 2019.\n\nWhile a telco-driven mobile money operation has worked wonders in Kenya and Ghana, it has not hit the mark in Nigeria.\n\nMost mobile money providers use PoS machines that require cards and mainly deal with cash, but a telco-led mobile money could make things completely cashless.\n\n\u201cAn AIP gives many financial institutions the power to operate fully. They\u2019re basically telling you to put actions behind all you\u2019ve been boasting that your company would do. They\u2019ll then come back in a few years to see that everything is functioning well.\n\n\u201cI must admit that MTN would find it really tough to play in the financial space. They would have two regulators, the NCC and the CBN, and would experience what banks and other fintechs have been facing in the space,\u201d Olowe argues.\n\nHowever, he also insists that MTN has a track record of execution, and they would come with the right strategy to take the market.\n\nMTN is the largest telecom company in terms of network coverage, voice subscribers, and Internet subscribers, and the launch of its PSB could bode well for financial inclusion in Nigeria.\n\nVirtual accounts are coming of age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlowe predicted that virtual accounts, led by innovators from TeamApt, Rubies, Zenith, Sterling, Wema, and Sparkle would become increasingly popular.\n\nSo far, most of these fintech companies have led the charge as predicted, but not without a few hiccups.\n\nWhen the CBN banned crypto transactions in March 2021, it placed sanctions on Providus Bank, which enabled virtual accounts for several fintech companies playing in the crypto space.\n\nHowever, the issues have since been resolved, and Olowe states that activities have resurged to the levels attained just before the crypto ban.\n\nLocal investors are stepping up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReports from previous years showed that foreign investments have dominated funding for Nigerian startups, and Olowe predicted that this would change with the FOMO caused by Paystack\u2019s acquisition in 2020.\n\nRecall that Stripe acquired Paystack in 2020 for $200 million, a truly momentous milestone for Africa\u2019s startup scene.\n\nIn 2021, there\u2019s been a massive improvement in the participation of local investors, but differently than expected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that several Nigerian investors don\u2019t really understand the business of startups. They think it\u2019s just, \u2018Put your money and expect constant returns.\u2019 What we\u2019re now seeing is startup founders who truly understand the space funding upcoming founders,\u201d Olowe points out.\n\nRecent funding rounds have featured the likes of GB, Flutterwave CEO; Shola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi, Paystack\u2019s Co-founders; Babs Ogundeyi, Kuda CEO, and other notable names.\n\nOlowe, however, maintains that Nigeria has boasted a good number of local investors in recent years. Most notable are Gbenga Oyebode, Founder of Aluko and Oyebode, one of MTN\u2019s first supporters in Nigeria.\n\nOther names like Idris Ayobello and Olumide Soyombo also warrant significant mention.\n\nAccording to Olowe, the successes of three investors has created FOMO among their peers who are getting more interested in the startup space.\n\nIt was a bright year for fintech companies and a year of Unicorns.

And yet these palace jesters gather in the safety of Benin City, provided by the excellent leadership of Governor Godwin Obaseki and mouth non-existent chaos.\n\nThe APC wants a state of emergency declared in a state that did not only pay salaries and pensions of state government workers by 14th of December, but also released funds to the local governments to ensure that their employees are also paid salaries in time for the yuletide celebrations, while the APC-led Federal Government was struggling to meet their FAAC obligations for the end of year.\n\nDoes the party want a state of emergency in a state where every flight, or bus coming into the state is fully booked with air carriers and road transporters jostling to keep up with the pressure of travellers trooping into the state?\n\nThey want a state of emergency where investments are rolling in large numbers with consortiums setting up tech parks, establishing malls, processing factories, coupled with the expansion of the real estate sector, which are creating job opportunities for youths in the state?\n\nIn Nigeria, it is common knowledge that the level of fidelity and honesty expected from the ilk of politicians that these APC jesters represent is extremely low. It is rather shameful for old men \u2013 grandfathers, for that matter \u2013 to sit comfortably, look into the camera and tell bare-faced lies about the Edo State Judiciary, the state legislature, the newly reconstructed Government Science and Technical College (GSTC), street-lighting project, Edo Tech Park, Edo Innovation Hub, among others.\n\nIt is now apparent that the Edo APC are stuck in the past, refusing to accept the reality that government has evolved and no longer dwell on the anachronistic ideas they are used to when they were in government. Today, the advances in technology deployed in public service administration, basic education reform, youth empowerment, and other areas of technology intervention are too sophisticated for them to comprehend, which is why they have elected to launch these futile attacks.\n\nWe are not surprised by this outburst as it is their stock in trade. Hence, we advise the public to be wary of the antics of the APC, their stale lies and baseless propaganda.\n\nThe PDP-led government in Edo State has and will continue to put the interest of the people over and above the interest of all others. Our programmes, reforms and initiatives are targeted at improving the quality of life and placing them at the centre of our politics. The vituperations of APC and their minions will never in any way derail this sacred mandate given freely by the majority of Edo people in September last year.\n\nAndrew Emwanta JP\n\nCommissioner for Communication and Orientation, Edo State\n\nDecember 30, 2021\n\n...",

          "title": "Nigerian born British undergraduate launches Climate Change NGO, Our Tomorrow",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nConcerned about the threat of climate change to the stability and survival of Africa, Nigerian born British undergraduate, Prince Emeka Obasi junior, on Saturday, formally launched a non governmental organisation, \u2018Our Tomorrow,\u2019 with a view to rallying youths of the continent and other stakeholders to rise up to challenge of confronting threats.\n\nMr. Obasi who unveiled his plans with \u2018Our Tomorrow\u2019 in an open letter to African youths, titled, \u201cWake Up and Help Save Our Tomorrow,\u201d said the organisation has three broad objectives of waking African youths up to the reality of the existential threat climate change poses to their future; sensitising African leaders, both at the government, corporate and non-governmental levels, to heed the clarion call for sustained action against climate change, and mobilizing resources, both material and human, to campaign and create sustained awareness of Africans, especially the youths, on the need to be actively involved in the battle to save the environment for their future and for future generations.\n\nWhile highlighting the enormous threat climate change poses to the continued survival of Africa, Obasi noted, however, that he is confident that the youths of the continent have all it takes to avert the looming climate crisis, hence his decision to take up the responsibility of mobilizing action in this regard.\n\n\u201cAlready, Africa is confronted by the twin challenge of insecurity and poverty, but climate change now threatens the continent\u2019s very existence,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am also optimistic about the future of our continent. I look at the numbers; the millions of young Africans doing exploits globally, and particularly at the fact that a vast majority of the population of Africa are young people, and my heart is gladdened.\n\n\u201cYes, the challenge of climate change is enormous, but I\u2019m confident that we have what it takes as youths of Africa to galvanize action towards averting the climate crisis that now stare us in the face, which is why I am writing to you today.\u201d\n\nDescribing his quest as a calling, Obasi noted that though he spent the first decade and a half of his life in Lagos, Nigeria, a state whose survival is threatened by rising sea levels, before moving the United Kingdom, he finds it strange that throughout his days in the Nigeria\u2019s commercial city, he never became aware of the threat of climate. This, he attributed to lack of sufficient awareness about the issue of climate on the continent.\n\n\u201cLike many of you, I was born at the turn of the 21st Century. Indeed, I was born 21 years ago, at a very auspicious time in the history of mankind. It was a time when an old age had just passed away, giving birth to the new millennium. I was born at exactly 1pm on the first day of the first month of the first year of the new millennium, precisely on January 1st, 2001, at 1pm,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy mother keeps telling me that I\u2019m a special child; that maybe God wanted me to come on such symbolic day in order to make my life story more engaging.\n\n\u201cI spent my early childhood in Lagos, Nigeria, Africa\u2019s biggest city. It\u2019s where I grew up and where I had my early education. I only travelled out during the holidays or during school excursion trips.\n\n\u201cLooking back on those years, I find it remarkable that despite maintaining great interest in current affairs, especially given the fact that my father is a Journalist, I never became conscious of the environmental crisis which had begun to endanger Lagos until I came to England for my college education in 2017. It was while here in England that I became increasingly aware of the problems of the environment and the challenges they pose, particularly to African countries.\n\n\u201cBut I find it inexcusable, and almost unforgivable that despite living my first decade and a half in Lagos; a city so threatened by climate change that scientists have projected that it may become uninhabitable by the end of this century as sea levels rise, I did not become conscious of climate change and indeed the environment. What it underlines is the acute lack of deliberate policies to create awareness among the younger generation of Africans.\u201d\n\nObasi noted that like Lagos, many cities in Africa, and indeed the continent in general, is under serious threat, highlighting already manifesting examples such as draught which is threatening food security and fueling security crisis.\n\n\u201cLagos is a coastal city with a population of 24 million and is predicted to see 90cm of sea level rise by 2100 as a result of global warming. According to certain scientific projections, Lagos could become uninhabitable by the end of this century as sea levels rise,\u201d Obasi said.\n\n\u201cIt is, however, heartwarming that the state is already taking action to ensure that this potential disaster is averted. Not long ago, the the Lagos State government unveiled a five-year Climate Action Plan (CAP) 2020-2025. The goal, as stated by Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of the state, is to achieve an emission-neutral city by 2050.\n\n\u201cBut the case of Lagos state is not unique. It typifies the acute environmental problems facing many parts of Nigeria. There is increasing desertification in the North, which has had very huge impact on security in the country; erosion in the East; oil spillage in the South/South, among others. The scenario is similar in other parts of Africa. Global warming is expected to melt Africa\u2019s remaining glaciers in the next few decades, and the reduction in water essential to agricultural production will create food insecurity, poverty, and population displacement.\n\n\u201cAgriculture, which remains heavily dependent on rainfall, is critical to Africa\u2019s economic growth, thus, climate change could potentially destabilize local markets, increase food insecurity, limit economic growth, escalate insecurity and increase risk for agriculture sector investors. Without doubt, for Africa to survive, sustained action must be taken beginning from today.\n\n\u201cIn this, our generation has a very critical role to play, because as we say in Nigeria, the youths are the leaders of tomorrow. If we analyse that saying well, it makes a lot of sense. Of course, the future belongs to the younger generation \u2013 it is their inheritance \u2013 but as an old African saying has it, the young shall grow.\n\n\u201cThe question I ask is, when the young must have grown, then what happens? The expectation is that when the young grow they will inherit the Earth. My worry is in what shape that Earth will be.\n\n\u201cSo, it is important that young people become involved in the global effort to ensure that the Earth is in fit and proper condition to make a worthwhile inheritance. Therefore, the effort to improve the environment should be championed by the youths because the world of tomorrow belongs to us.\n\n\u201cWhereas it is true that today belongs to our fathers and mothers, tomorrow belongs to the children; to us, and what we do today will surely determine the fate of our tomorrow and the fate of those coming after us. Therefore, I have resolved to contribute my own quota towards the global push to create a more sustainable, safer, cleaner and healthier environment for the future by setting up an NGO, \u2018Our Tomorrow.'\u201d\n\nHe noted that the NGO \u201cwill become an active player in the climate change ecosystem and I am committed to getting the youths of Africa to commit to this noble endeavour.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOur tomorrow has a three point agenda: To wake African youths up to the reality of the existential threat climate change poses to their future;\n\nTo sensitize African leaders, both at the government, corporate and non-governmental levels, to heed the clarion call for sustained action against climate change;\n\nTo mobilize resources, both material and human, to campaign and create sustained awareness of Africans, especially the youths, on the need to be actively involved in the battle to save the environment for their future and for future generations.\u201d\n\nObasi described the struggle against climate change as one of a lifetime, noting that \u201cIt is a call which I feel honoured to answer.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cAs the great Marxian philosopher, Frantz Fanon, once wrote: Every generation must, out of relative obscurity, discover its true mission and either fulfil or betray it. I am proud to state that as an African youth, I have found my mission and by the grace of God, I will not betray it.\n\n\u201cMy target is to mobilise the teeming populace of the youths in Africa to achieve a critical mass of climate change advocates, whose voices will resonate loudly and clearly and catalyse positive action. We will use the awesome power of social media to create this unstoppable army and empower their voices in every country in Africa.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the prospects are exciting, I invite all African youths to this adventure.\u201d",

          "title": "For the Record: Text of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s New Year Speech",
          "text": "PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI\u2019S STATEMENT TO THE NATION ON JANUARY 1, 2022\n\nWe remain grateful to the Almighty God for yet another Year attained as a country, united by a common destiny and resolute in our determination to overcome the several challenges along the path to build the great and prosperous Nation of our dream.\n\n2. I salute the courage and resilience of all Nigerians, which was evident in 2021 as this nation, like other countries of the world, faced significant challenges that occurred as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to restore the global economy and social order.\n\n3. The persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country may have threatened to unravel the incremental gains achieved in the real sectors of the economy and in the administration\u2019s overall objective to position the nation on the irreversible trajectory of sustainable growth and progress, but I assure you that we will remain resolute in our commitments and shall continue to press ahead with our programmes and plans.\n\n4. The path to nationhood is often fraught with unpredictable difficulties and challenges, and most tried and tested nations have often prevailed through dogged determination, resilience, concerted commitment to unity, and the conviction that the whole of the nation, standing together against all odds, is by far greater and would ultimately be more prosperous and viable than the sum of its distinguishable parts.\n\n5. There is no doubt that the issue of Security remains at the front burner of priority areas that this Administration has given utmost attention to. As a follow up to our promise to re-energize and reorganize the security apparatus and personnel of the armed forces and the police, it is on record that this Administration has invested heavily in re-equipping our military in line with upgrading the platforms and firepower required to tackle the current challenges being faced in the country.\n\n6. The net results of these efforts have been the number of insurgents and bandits who have willingly surrendered to our Security Forces and continue to do so through various channels and the Safe Corridor created for that purpose.\n\n7. Government, however, realizes that victory on the battlefield is just one aspect of sustainable victory. We know that to fully win this war, we must also win the peace and real security lies in winning the hearts and minds of the affected citizens. To this end, working with our international partners and neighbouring countries, we would be deploying multi-faceted solutions that will be targeted at addressing human security at the grassroots, before it leads to insecurity.\n\n8. Once again I would like to take a moment to remember and honour the gallant Military, Police Officers, and other security agents who have lost their lives in the cause of protecting the territorial integrity of this Nation against both internal and external aggressors, assuring their families that their sacrifices would not be in vain.\n\n9. We equally remember and commiserate with Nigerians who have lost loved ones as a result of insecurity in different parts of the country. Every life matters and every single death caused by any form of insecurity is a matter of personal concern to me both as a citizen and as the President of this great country.\n\n10. We remain fully committed to upholding the constitutional provisions that protect all Nigerians from any form of internal and external aggression.\n\n11. On the economy, we have shown a high level of resilience to record some significant achievements despite the turbulence that has characterized our economy and indeed the global economy. The lessons we have learned and keep learning from COVID-19 have encouraged us to intensify efforts to mitigate its socio-economic effects on our Nation.\n\n12. The major wins we have recorded can be clearly seen in Nigeria\u2019s most recent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The 4.03% growth recorded in the third quarter of 2021 is indicative of the recovery being recorded in our economy and the confidence that is being shown through the policies that our Administration has put in place after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\n13. We may also recall that this recent growth is closely followed by the 5.1% (year on year) growth in real terms recorded by Nigeria in Quarter 2 of 2021. This growth was one of the best recorded by any nation across Sub-Saharan Africa. The 5.1% growth at that time was and remains the highest growth recorded by the Nigerian economy since 2014.\n\n14. Despite the challenges we have faced as a Nation, the good news is that we have so far recorded four consecutive quarters of growth after the negative growth rates recorded in Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 of 2020 due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n15. On August 16, 2021 I signed the landmark Petroleum Industry Act into law. The signing of this legacy legislation is a watershed moment in the history of our Nation, considering the massive positive impact the new Act would have on the economy. I would like to sincerely commend the 9th Assembly for the grit they demonstrated, succeeding where others have failed, and the cooperation that led to the completion of this process after almost two decades.\n\n16. Just like I stated during the investment trips and fora that I have attended recently, the legislation is expected to serve as a liberalizing force in the energy industry, and we are optimistic that this law will provide the much-needed legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the development of the energy sector, the host communities, and Nigeria as a Nation. Our objective to increase Liquefied Natural Gas exports and expand our domestic market is still very much at the forefront of some of the policies we would be pushing in the new year.\n\n17. In year 2022 and going forward, our Administration would intentionally leverage ICT platforms to create jobs, while ensuring that the diversification of our economy creates more support to other emerging sectors. I am proud to announce that several foreign investors are taking advantage of our ranking as one of the leading start-up ecosystems in Africa to invest in our digital economy.\n\n18. We have given the utmost priority to fighting corruption and other related offenses which have been a bane to the growth and prosperity of our dear Nation. We have made major strides and breakthroughs through the innovative use of technology and forensics in the investigative and prosecutorial procedures with commendable results to show that the anti-corruption drive of our Administration is succeeding.\n\n19. In the meantime, the accomplishments that have been recorded so far can be traced to the dedication of the Nation\u2019s anti-corruption Agencies who have received the necessary support needed to effectively prosecute their duties.\n\n20. Despite our challenges in 2021, it was also a year in which the Administration executed successfully, key projects, programmes, and initiatives to fulfil the promises made under the Security, Economy Anti-corruption (SEA) agenda.\n\n21. As we welcome 2022, let us, with hope, envision a year of continued progress against our combined challenges arising from security and socio-economic issues.\n\n22. As it is said, the past is but a story told, the future will still be written in gold. Let us be united in our fight to keep our Nation united against all odds and with gratitude, celebrate life in this new epoch.\n\n23. I wish you a very happy and prosperous New Year.\n\nMuhammadu Buhari",

          "title": "Fuel price increase: We will shutdown Nigeria, NLC warns FG",
          "text": "Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, has insisted that workers and masses will not accept any further increase in the pump price of fuel in the name of subsidy removal, urging workers and the citizens to prepare for total war against fuel price hike.\n\nPresident of Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, Ayuba Wabba, in a New Year message to workers, also named Zamfara, Taraba, Benue, Kogi, Cross Rivers, Abia and Imo states as seven states yet to implement the N30,000 minimum wage that took effect on April 18, 2019.\n\nIn the message titled YEAR 2022 FELICITATIONS: KEEPING OUR HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS ALIVE IN THE NEW YEAR, NLC directed the affected states to commence indefinite strike to force the respective state governments to implement the new wage.\n\nIn a 9-page statement, NLC among others, said Still, the government is not relenting in its determination to push through further increases in the pump price of petrol and which as usual had been dubbed as \u201cremoval of petrol subsidy\u201d. Well, Organized Labour has made its position clear on this matter. We have told government in very clear terms that Nigerians have suffered enough and will not endure more punishment by way of further petrol and electricity price increases.\n\n\u201cOur position in this regard is predicated on four major grounds. First is our concern on the deceit and duplicity associated with the politics of \u201cpetrol price increase\u201d by successive Nigerian governments. The truth is that the perennial increase by government of the pump price of petrol is actually a transfer of government failure and inability to effectively govern to the poor masses of our country. We are talking of the failure of government to manage Nigeria\u2019s four oil refineries and inability to build new ones more than thirty years after the last petrochemical refinery in Port Harcourt was commissioned; the failure to rein in smuggling; and the failure to determine empirically the quantity of petrol consumed in Nigeria. The shame takes a gory dimension with the fact that Nigeria is the only OPEC country that cannot refine her own crude oil.\n\n\u201cDuring the negotiations that trailed the last increase in petroleum prices, Organized Labour made a cardinal demand on government which is that it must take immediate steps to revamp and rehabilitate Nigeria\u2019s refineries. A Technical Committee was set up to monitor progress in this regard. As we all know, the work of the Technical Committee like our abandoned public refineries has ground to a halt and further negotiations with government adjourned sine die for nearly one year now. As a responsible social partner, we have at different times called on government to show us what they are doing in response to our demands but silence is the response we get.\n\n\u201cAll we hear from government are half-hearted media pronouncements on efforts to allocate funds for the rehabilitation of our public refineries. On ground, there is no commensurate action. Between 2012 and now, about $9.5 billion has been spent on Turn Around Maintenance (TAM), Greenfield Refinery Projects and even public investments in private refineries. The tragedy is that despite these humungous investments of public funds, government continues to present the crisis of mass importation of refined petroleum products into Nigeria and the consequent import-based pricing regime of refined petroleum products as a fait accompli. This neo-colonial narrative in Nigeria petroleum sub-sector is what the Nigerian working-class family has rejected as unfathomable and unacceptable as it is antithetical to the notions of sovereignty and self-actualization and a mockery of the sacrifice of our heroes past.\n\n\u201cEven in the classic example of capitalism, there is something called the theory of comparative advantage where a country deploys its strategic assets to secure the highest possible positive outcomes for its citizens. Unfortunately, successive governments in Nigeria have failed to take strategic advantage of our natural endowment in oil and gas especially our prime position as the highest producer of crude oil in Africa to expand our economy, induce economic growth and engender sustainable national development. Today, instead of referring to crude oil as the blessing that it is, we now commonly describe this gift of God to Nigeria as \u201cResource Curse\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe quagmire of the Dutch Disease or Resource Curse in our country is most exemplified in our downstream petroleum sub-sector. The despair of our unfortunate Catch 22 situation is that government increases the pump price of petroleum products when the price of crude oil increases and falls in the international commodities market. The explanation is that such increases automatically translate to increases in the price of refined petroleum products. When the price of crude oil falls, the excuse is that the enormous pressure on the value of the Nigerian Naira occasioned by drop in forex revenue exacerbates the crisis of Naira devaluation and causes hike in petrol price.\n\n\u201cEven to the blind, the solution is clear \u2013 Nigeria must regain her capacity to locally refine petroleum products. There is no escaping the fact that our public refineries must be made to work. There is no short cut to the reality that we must replace the exploitative and subservient policy of Import-Based Price Regime with Local Production Based Price Regime for refined petroleum products. There is no explaining away through disingenuous Power Point presentations, procured rallies and over-rehashed publicity in the media the simple fact that as a major Oil Producing country in the world and after nearly seventy years of oil exploration in Nigeria, our country cannot deliver on efficient and effective public petroleum refineries. Nothing dents the image of Nigeria and presents us as a country incapable of providing governance as the failed narratives in our downstream petroleum sub-sector.\n\n\u201cSecond, we are concerned about the missed opportunities and hemorrhage of potential revenue to public coffers that government\u2019s continued apathy to reconstructing the current negative narrative in our downstream petroleum sub-sector. The advantages and multiplier effect of local refining of petroleum products in Nigeria are enormous. There is the angle of mass job creation, increase in revenue accruable to government, promotion of environmental integrity in oil bearing communities as the scourge of artisanal refining with its deleterious impact on the environment and the consequent unrests and agitation such oil pollution precipitates would take a nose dive. The truth is that with self sufficiency in oil refining, Nigeria will be able to meet not only demand for local consumption but also will be in a grand position to cater for the refined petroleum needs of the sub region and the African continent as a whole.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the comparative advantage that government fails to see as strategic business opportunity, private investors such as Dangote Group are taking this advantage and are moving mountains and valleys to syndicate finance from institutional lenders to establish one of the largest petrochemical refineries in the world in Lekki \u2013 Lagos State. For us in the labour movement, we do not believe that government is shortsighted to the huge benefits accruable to the commonwealth by the robust development of the downstream petroleum sector especially through investment in the rehabilitation of our four public refineries and building of new refineries.\n\n\u201cGiven the direct relationship between the outrageous amount said to be invested in the payment of the so-called petroleum subsidy and the pressure to get foreign loans from Bretton Wood Institutions to meet perennial shortfall in revenue, we believe that the crisis of the under-development of Nigeria\u2019s downstream petroleum sector, the comatose of our four public refineries and the inability of successive government to right this economic sabotage smacks of an international conspiracy at the behest of local collaborators to keep the Nigerian economy and people perpetually on their knees.\n\n\u201cThe suggestion by government that the remedy to this malady is to stop further payment of the so-called petrol subsidy is akin to cutting one\u2019s nose in order to spite one\u2019s face. What the government is proposing is to abandon the Nigerian workers and people to very cruel market forces whose sole drive is profit maximization. This is why we believe that private investment in building petroleum refineries is not enough. Government must ensure that public refineries also work. This way, there would be true competition and Nigerians would be able to derive the most benefit from a resource that God freely and amply made available to the Nigerian nation.\n\n\u201cWe have also already described the idea of paying transport allowances as robbing ourselves to pay ourselves as the amount being bandied for such transport subsidy clearly outstrips the amount that is currently expended on the so-called petrol subsidy.\n\n\u201cThird, as a pan Nigerian organization, Organized Labour is concerned that the crisis in Nigeria\u2019s downstream petroleum sector is further aggravated by the persisting tumult in the upstream subsector. It was recently reported that almost 200 million barrels of crude oil were lost in 2021. This was as a result of crude oil theft, ageing infrastructure, poor long term investment outlay, poor security of our inland waterway, and challenges arising from conflicts with oil bearing communities and host communities of oil facilities. This is very unfortunate. Even more disturbing is the fact that just like the failed TAMs, no major culprit has been arrested and successfully prosecuted.\n\n\u201cOur fourth ground for rejecting any further increase in the pump price of petrol is based on our agreement with government in September 2020 that any further increase in the price of petrol should be shelved until government and labour undertakes a review of the state of local refineries in Nigeria and until government takes commensurate action to revamp our public petroleum refineries. It is in these lights that we consider the current proposals by government at the clear promoting of Bretton Woods Institutions to increase the pump price of petrol as anti-people, insensitive and a disservice to the welfare of Nigerian people which government is constitutionally mandated to protect.\n\n\u201cAt our organ meetings which took place between December 15 and 17, 2021, the Nigeria Labour Congress took a decision to protest the planned hike in the pump price of petrol by government. The protest has been scheduled to take place in all the 36 states of the federation on the 27th of January 2022. The protest in the state would culminate in the submission of protest letters to the 36 State Governors. Subsequently, on the 1st of February 2022, there would be a national protest to be held in the Federal Capital Territory.

          "text": "Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, has insisted that workers and masses will not accept any further increase in the pump price of fuel in the name of subsidy removal, urging workers and the citizens to prepare for total war against fuel price hike.\n\nPresident of Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, Ayuba Wabba, in a New Year message to workers, also named Zamfara, Taraba, Benue, Kogi, Cross Rivers, Abia and Imo states as seven states yet to implement the N30,000 minimum wage that took effect on April 18, 2019.\n\nIn the message titled YEAR 2022 FELICITATIONS: KEEPING OUR HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS ALIVE IN THE NEW YEAR, NLC directed the affected states to commence indefinite strike to force the respective state governments to implement the new wage.\n\nIn a 9-page statement, NLC among others, said Still, the government is not relenting in its determination to push through further increases in the pump price of petrol and which as usual had been dubbed as \u201cremoval of petrol subsidy\u201d. Well, Organized Labour has made its position clear on this matter. We have told government in very clear terms that Nigerians have suffered enough and will not endure more punishment by way of further petrol and electricity price increases.\n\n\u201cOur position in this regard is predicated on four major grounds. First is our concern on the deceit and duplicity associated with the politics of \u201cpetrol price increase\u201d by successive Nigerian governments. The truth is that the perennial increase by government of the pump price of petrol is actually a transfer of government failure and inability to effectively govern to the poor masses of our country. We are talking of the failure of government to manage Nigeria\u2019s four oil refineries and inability to build new ones more than thirty years after the last petrochemical refinery in Port Harcourt was commissioned; the failure to rein in smuggling; and the failure to determine empirically the quantity of petrol consumed in Nigeria. The shame takes a gory dimension with the fact that Nigeria is the only OPEC country that cannot refine her own crude oil.\n\n\u201cDuring the negotiations that trailed the last increase in petroleum prices, Organized Labour made a cardinal demand on government which is that it must take immediate steps to revamp and rehabilitate Nigeria\u2019s refineries. A Technical Committee was set up to monitor progress in this regard. As we all know, the work of the Technical Committee like our abandoned public refineries has ground to a halt and further negotiations with government adjourned sine die for nearly one year now. As a responsible social partner, we have at different times called on government to show us what they are doing in response to our demands but silence is the response we get.\n\n\u201cAll we hear from government are half-hearted media pronouncements on efforts to allocate funds for the rehabilitation of our public refineries. On ground, there is no commensurate action. Between 2012 and now, about $9.5 billion has been spent on Turn Around Maintenance (TAM), Greenfield Refinery Projects and even public investments in private refineries. The tragedy is that despite these humungous investments of public funds, government continues to present the crisis of mass importation of refined petroleum products into Nigeria and the consequent import-based pricing regime of refined petroleum products as a fait accompli. This neo-colonial narrative in Nigeria petroleum sub-sector is what the Nigerian working-class family has rejected as unfathomable and unacceptable as it is antithetical to the notions of sovereignty and self-actualization and a mockery of the sacrifice of our heroes past.\n\n\u201cEven in the classic example of capitalism, there is something called the theory of comparative advantage where a country deploys its strategic assets to secure the highest possible positive outcomes for its citizens. Unfortunately, successive governments in Nigeria have failed to take strategic advantage of our natural endowment in oil and gas especially our prime position as the highest producer of crude oil in Africa to expand our economy, induce economic growth and engender sustainable national development. Today, instead of referring to crude oil as the blessing that it is, we now commonly describe this gift of God to Nigeria as \u201cResource Curse\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe quagmire of the Dutch Disease or Resource Curse in our country is most exemplified in our downstream petroleum sub-sector. The despair of our unfortunate Catch 22 situation is that government increases the pump price of petroleum products when the price of crude oil increases and falls in the international commodities market. The explanation is that such increases automatically translate to increases in the price of refined petroleum products. When the price of crude oil falls, the excuse is that the enormous pressure on the value of the Nigerian Naira occasioned by drop in forex revenue exacerbates the crisis of Naira devaluation and causes hike in petrol price.\n\n\u201cEven to the blind, the solution is clear \u2013 Nigeria must regain her capacity to locally refine petroleum products. There is no escaping the fact that our public refineries must be made to work. There is no short cut to the reality that we must replace the exploitative and subservient policy of Import-Based Price Regime with Local Production Based Price Regime for refined petroleum products. There is no explaining away through disingenuous Power Point presentations, procured rallies and over-rehashed publicity in the media the simple fact that as a major Oil Producing country in the world and after nearly seventy years of oil exploration in Nigeria, our country cannot deliver on efficient and effective public petroleum refineries. Nothing dents the image of Nigeria and presents us as a country incapable of providing governance as the failed narratives in our downstream petroleum sub-sector.\n\n\u201cSecond, we are concerned about the missed opportunities and hemorrhage of potential revenue to public coffers that government\u2019s continued apathy to reconstructing the current negative narrative in our downstream petroleum sub-sector. The advantages and multiplier effect of local refining of petroleum products in Nigeria are enormous. There is the angle of mass job creation, increase in revenue accruable to government, promotion of environmental integrity in oil bearing communities as the scourge of artisanal refining with its deleterious impact on the environment and the consequent unrests and agitation such oil pollution precipitates would take a nose dive. The truth is that with self sufficiency in oil refining, Nigeria will be able to meet not only demand for local consumption but also will be in a grand position to cater for the refined petroleum needs of the sub region and the African continent as a whole.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the comparative advantage that government fails to see as strategic business opportunity, private investors such as Dangote Group are taking this advantage and are moving mountains and valleys to syndicate finance from institutional lenders to establish one of the largest petrochemical refineries in the world in Lekki \u2013 Lagos State. For us in the labour movement, we do not believe that government is shortsighted to the huge benefits accruable to the commonwealth by the robust development of the downstream petroleum sector especially through investment in the rehabilitation of our four public refineries and building of new refineries.\n\n\u201cGiven the direct relationship between the outrageous amount said to be invested in the payment of the so-called petroleum subsidy and the pressure to get foreign loans from Bretton Wood Institutions to meet perennial shortfall in revenue, we believe that the crisis of the under-development of Nigeria\u2019s downstream petroleum sector, the comatose of our four public refineries and the inability of successive government to right this economic sabotage smacks of an international conspiracy at the behest of local collaborators to keep the Nigerian economy and people perpetually on their knees.\n\n\u201cThe suggestion by government that the remedy to this malady is to stop further payment of the so-called petrol subsidy is akin to cutting one\u2019s nose in order to spite one\u2019s face. What the government is proposing is to abandon the Nigerian workers and people to very cruel market forces whose sole drive is profit maximization. This is why we believe that private investment in building petroleum refineries is not enough. Government must ensure that public refineries also work. This way, there would be true competition and Nigerians would be able to derive the most benefit from a resource that God freely and amply made available to the Nigerian nation.\n\n\u201cWe have also already described the idea of paying transport allowances as robbing ourselves to pay ourselves as the amount being bandied for such transport subsidy clearly outstrips the amount that is currently expended on the so-called petrol subsidy.\n\n\u201cThird, as a pan Nigerian organization, Organized Labour is concerned that the crisis in Nigeria\u2019s downstream petroleum sector is further aggravated by the persisting tumult in the upstream subsector. It was recently reported that almost 200 million barrels of crude oil were lost in 2021. This was as a result of crude oil theft, ageing infrastructure, poor long term investment outlay, poor security of our inland waterway, and challenges arising from conflicts with oil bearing communities and host communities of oil facilities. This is very unfortunate. Even more disturbing is the fact that just like the failed TAMs, no major culprit has been arrested and successfully prosecuted.\n\n\u201cOur fourth ground for rejecting any further increase in the pump price of petrol is based on our agreement with government in September 2020 that any further increase in the price of petrol should be shelved until government and labour undertakes a review of the state of local refineries in Nigeria and until government takes commensurate action to revamp our public petroleum refineries. It is in these lights that we consider the current proposals by government at the clear promoting of Bretton Woods Institutions to increase the pump price of petrol as anti-people, insensitive and a disservice to the welfare of Nigerian people which government is constitutionally mandated to protect.\n\n\u201cAt our organ meetings which took place between December 15 and 17, 2021, the Nigeria Labour Congress took a decision to protest the planned hike in the pump price of petrol by government. The protest has been scheduled to take place in all the 36 states of the federation on the 27th of January 2022. The protest in the state would culminate in the submission of protest letters to the 36 State Governors. Subsequently, on the 1st of February 2022, there would be a national protest to be held in the Federal Capital Territory. We urge Nigerian workers and people to dust their sneakers and fully participate in the peaceful protests and rallies aimed at salvaging our economic future.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the Nigeria Labour Congress has already barred its mind on the recent signing into law of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) by President Muhammadu Buhari. The agitation by different segments of society clearly shows that this very important piece of legislation which Nigerians have kept vigil over for so many years still does not sufficiently address the deficits of governance, oversight, investment, environmental integrity, local beneficiation and the use of petroleum resources to advance the cause of the ordinary Nigerian worker and citizen. We call on the two chambers of the National Assembly to immediately commence the process of reviewing the Petroleum Industry Act to reflect the aspirations of Nigerian workers and people.\u201d Vanguard\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "The General Evangelist, Worldwide of the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC), Prophet Samuel Kayode Abiara on Saturday told Nigerians, especially the people of Lagos State to shun those he described as prophets of doom.\n\nHe gave the charge during the New Year Service held simultaneously by Christian and Muslim faithful in Lagos House, Marina at both the Chapel of Christ the King for Christian faithful and the State House Mosque.\n\nProphet Abiara, at the Christian worship prayed for Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, his family, members of the State Executive Council and Lagos State.\n\nHe urged people not to listen to prophets of doom against Nigeria and her leaders at the national and state levels.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to prophets of doom against Nigeria, our nation and the leaders. Don\u2019t listen to prophets of doom against Lagos State. The future of Nigeria and Lagos State is bright,\u201d Prophet Abiara declared.\n\nThe renowned cleric who commended Sanwo-Olu on his compassion for the downtrodden and the masses implored public office holders to emulate the governor and be passionate about the people they are serving.\n\nIn his sermon, former Vice-Chancellor of the Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo and Bishop of Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Rt. Revd (Prof.) Dapo Asaju, said Sanwo-Olu has shown good leadership in Lagos State.\n\nAsaju, who titled his message, \u201cGod, the rulers and the people,\u201d declared that Governor Sanwo-Olu has done very well and prayed that the governor will finish well and be celebrated like the late first civilian Governor of Lagos State, Alhaji Lateef Jakande.\n\n\u201cThe Bible tells us that when the righteous are in power, the people will rejoice. We are rejoicing in Lagos State because we have a Godly governor. If I can assume the role of the good people of Lagos State, I will like to pass a message across to Governor Sanwo-Olu that we love you, we appreciate you and we are proud to be your subjects. We thank God for what He is doing in your life.\n\n\u201cMr. Governor, you have been running this administration very well. You have done very well but your tenure is going gradually and as another election is coming, there shall be a new song. You will finish well and you will be celebrated. Like Lateef Jakande was celebrated, you will be celebrated and the glory of the future would be greater.\n\n\u201cPeople will decide the kind of Governor that they have. So people of Lagos should better open their eyes and pray for another governor like this and I pray that God Almighty will give you the grace even to continue in the name of Jesus Christ. If it is a political statement, I say it with every sense of confidence that God Almighty will give you the possibility to perfect what you have started in Jesus name.\u201d\n\nSpeaking during the Christian service, Sanwo-Olu in his New Year message said Lagos has a brighter future and urged his cabinet members to work toward achieving the Greater Lagos agenda.\n\nSanwo-Olu, who read the second lesson from Philippians 3:12-16, charged members of the State Executive Council to lead with the fear of God, make good things out of their life and ensure that people remember them for good things.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet us open a new chapter and know that the new chapter is about togetherness. They have said to us that we all have a brighter future.\n\n\u201cOur State has a bright future. But it is really for us to open our eyes very well and see the bright future.

I, therefore, urge every Nigerian to support the government in her quest for socio-economic and political development.\n\n\u201cThe THEMES agenda of Sanwo-Olu administration encompasses every aspect of the life of every Lagos resident. Therefore, we solicit the support of everyone so that our noble objectives may be a reality,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring the Christian and Muslim New Year prayers were attended by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, his deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat; First Lady, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu; Head of Service, Mr. Hakeem Muri-Okunola; Lagos State Command Commissioner of Police, Mr. Hakeem Odumosu; commissioners and special advisers to the governor, among others, clerics prayed for Nigeria, Lagos State and public office holders.",

          "title": "Governors Preach Love, Tolerance In New Year Messages",
          "text": "As Nigerians join the rest of the world to usher in 2022, governors in various states have congratulated the people in their various states on the occasion of the new year celebration.\n\nFrom the North to the South, to the East and West, the chief executives of the states conveyed their goodwill messages in statements while others addressed the residents in state broadcasts.\n\nFollowing another pandemic-ridden year accompanied by rising cases of COVID, insecurity, and economic challenges among others, the governors asked the people not to lose hope in the country.\n\nREAD ALSO: Expect Continued Progress Against Our Challenges In New Year, Buhari Tells Nigerians\n\nSpirit For Survival\n\nIn a statement by his spokesman, Nathaniel Ikyur, Governor Samuel Ortom praised the people of Benue State and Nigerians for their resilience in the face of daunting security and economic challenges in the past year.\n\nHe believed the people have demonstrated their indomitable spirit for survival against unabating security and the harsh economic situation compounded by the raging COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe year 2021 was no doubt challenging,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy our people rose to the occasion. The lessons of the past year will serve as a useful instrument that will guide us to fruition in the years ahead.\u201d\n\nGovernor Ortom thanked the Benue people who stood by him through thick and thin, promising that their interest, welfare, and well-being would remain his firm commitment, mission, and purpose throughout the days of his administration.\n\nHe assured them that his administration would continue to implement policies, programmes, and projects that have a direct and positive impact on them.\n\nThe governor, however, urged the people to be vigilant against terrorists who have continued to wreck communities and displace people from their ancestral lands.\n\nHe encouraged individuals and groups to ensure that they cooperate with the security agencies so as to keep the state free from criminal activities of terrorist gangs, saying, \u201cIn doing so, you must endeavour to give useful information to government through security operatives in order to nip any threat in the bud\u201d.\n\nFor the governor, this is necessary to ensure a smooth and orderly society as the nation approaches the 2023 general elections. He reminded the electorate to make informed and right choices during the elections.\n\nHe promised them that his administration would leave Benue State better than he met it and wished the residents a peaceful and prosperous new year.\n\nKeep Hope Alive\n\nOn his part, Cross River State Governor, Professor Ben Ayade, assured the people of the state of a glorious and eventful 2022, with a promise of a full crystallization of a vision started over six years ago.\n\nHe stated that given the aggressive industrialisation drive of his administration which began barely one year into office, the state was already on an irreversible path to economic prosperity and greatness.\n\nThanking the people for their fidelity and unwavering support for his administration in the past years, the governor urged them to embrace the new year with steadfastness, faith, and hope.\n\nHe maintained that his administration has been able to firmly secure the future of the state through massive industrialisation with the establishment of industries across the state.\n\nGovernor Ayade called on residents to put the state above narrow considerations and not allow self-seeking politicians to manipulate them for their selfish end.\n\nHe also urged them to keep hope alive, wished them a refreshing and fulfilling new year, and asked them not to be complacent in complying with the COVID-19 protocols, especially in the face of the fast-spreading variant \u2013 omicron.\n\nBetter Days\n\nIn Adamawa, Governor Umaru Fintiri called on Nigerians to imbibe the spirit of forgiveness, love, reconciliation, and re-dedication to the service of God and humanity in the year 2022.\n\n\u201cThe end of the year and the beginning of a new one provides us all with an opportunity for reflection and introspection, as well as to plan,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cBut most importantly, it is a time to give thanks to the Almighty God for the gift and for his care and provision to all of us.\u201d\n\nWhile wishing the people of Adamawa a happy, safe and prosperous 2022, the governor noted the plans and efforts of the government.\n\n\u201cWe thank God for bringing us safely to the end of an eventful year. As we celebrate the end of an extraordinary year and look forward with hope to personal, state, and national progress in 2022, I urge you to be more committed to the Adamawa project and support our plans for the economic development of the state, as we intend to do more in terms of infrastructural renewal, human capital development, and welfare of our people,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cLooking back on the achievements and milestones made in the course of 2021, I know that there are those among us who have had a very difficult year, either economically or through personal tragedies such as the loss of loved ones, or those battling illnesses and other troubling situations.\n\n\u201cTo you, it is my hope and prayer that the new year will usher in better days for you and for all of us\u201d.\n\nThe governor specifically praised healthcare givers as the world battles the omicron COVID-19 variant and encouraged people to be vaccinated against the pandemic.\n\n\u2018We Emerged Victorious\u2019\n\n\u201cThe year 2021 was historic for Ndi Imo, partly with the wrong reasons but largely, for the remarkable records, we have achieved in tackling challenges that confronted us as a state,\u201d Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State said in his New Year message.\n\nHe added, \u201cDespite the distorted flow of governance, we sailed through with dedication, commitment and progression. All these were made feasible by the unflinching support and resilience of Ndi Imo, which I do not take for granted. Through thick and thin, we emerged victorious to the glory of God Almighty and his grace shall abound in this new year.\n\n\u201cHaving recorded tremendous results in the restoration of peace and tranquillity in our dear state, it is now time to tackle development head-on. The expectations of Ndi Imo in this regard, shall not be cut short for we have set in motion, mechanisms to actualise these.\n\n\u201cFrom the foregoing, I, therefore, welcome Ndi Imo nile to the year 2022. Having signed into law, the People\u2019s Budget of 2022 as appropriated by the people\u2019s representatives, the implementation shall reflect the developmental and economic expectations of Ndi Imo in this 2022.\n\n\u201cAs we offer thanksgiving to the Lord for His faithfulness and mercies, let us endeavour to be a reflection of His goodness in our society and to our neighbours, for in a harmonious and peaceful cohabitation, development thrives faster.\n\n\u201cI celebrate Ndi Imo nile and welcome you, once again, to the year 2022, with compliments.\u201d\n\nShow Optimism\n\nIn Niger State, Governor Abubakar Bello called on the residents to continue to have hope and trust in the ability of his administration to work for the progress, growth, and development of the state.\n\nThe governor said the state government would work towards the successful actualisation of its programmes and policies as captured in the 2022 budget.\n\nHe urged the people to show optimism and be encouraged by the fact that his administration would not relent in sustaining the ongoing infrastructural revolution aimed at improving the general well-being of the people.\n\nGovernor Bello also spoke about the government\u2019s fight against insecurity and renewed the call for the strict observance of all precautionary measures against the COVID-19 virus.\n\nAccording to him, the security of the state will remain his administration\u2019s major focus in the new year in order to stop banditry and other criminal tendencies towards sustaining the relatively peaceful and harmonious coexistence in the state.\n\nWhile felicitating with the people, the governor praised the gallantry of the military and all security agencies involved in the fight against insecurity and appealed to the people to play their roles to ensure success in the battle against evil.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate the new year, we must put the interest of the state over and above other considerations and work towards attaining our collective aspirations,\u201d he said.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nGovernor Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State, on his part, urged the people of the state to reflect and draw on the lessons learned in the preceding year in all aspects of human endeavours and continue to work for peace and unity, as well as security and development of the state and the country as the new year begins.\n\nHe projected that 2022 will offer the citizenry a new vista and opportunity to renew their faith in God, as he urged them to look to the future with optimism.\n\nThe governor also expressed optimism that the year 2022 would be a bright and prosperous one for both the state and Nigeria.\n\nHe acknowledged the resilience and perseverance of the people of the state in the midst of socio-economic difficulties, insecurity, and the global pandemic of COVID-19 and its consequential effects and asked them to maintain the undying spirit and enter 2022 with hope and renewed faith.\n\nWhile urging the people to continue to live in peace with one another, he assured them of continued support and cooperation with security agencies to combat all forms of criminal activities in the state.\n\nHe congratulated the citizenry for seeing the end of 2021 and stepping into the new year in high spirits and encouraged them to continue to work hard enough and show resilience in order to overcome the challenges and emerge stronger.\n\n\u201cThe year 2022 holds a great promise for all of us through improved security, youths and women empowerment, and greater attention to infrastructure and socio-economic development across all sectors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs we enter the new year, I call on all of us to draw on the lessons learned in 2021 in all aspects of human endeavours and continue to work assiduously for the peace, progress, security, and development of the state.\u201d\n\nSpirit Of Love\n\nIn his New Year message, Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, asked residents to continuously collaborate with security agencies to root out criminals anywhere they are hiding in the state.\n\nHe urged the Presidency and the National Assembly to work together to create an Electoral Act that would make elections in Nigeria transparent and acceptable.\n\nWhile giving security operatives a pat on the back for vehemently fighting crime in the state, the governor urged them to deploy their eagle eyes as political activities take off this year.\n\n\u201cTaraba State has had a very interesting year in 2021 and the good Lord has been able to see us through despite the challenges therein,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, our new year resolution should be to make a solemn pledge to the descent citizens by providing our fair share no matter how small to our beloved state, a better place for everybody which can only be accomplished if we stick to the law and inculcate the spirit of love and togetherness and being our brother\u2019s keeper.\n\n\u201cOur watchword should be security awareness as last year I had the opportunity of donating Toyota Hilux vans to security operatives in order to properly carry out their surveillance of the state. Everybody has a civic duty to cooperate and provide relevant information to security agencies as they have made substantial contributions to the reduction of armed banditry, farmers, herders crisis, tribal feud, kidnapping, and, therefore, needs our cooperation in the run-up to 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nGovernor Ishaku added, \u201cPolitical activities will pick up significantly in 2022, all political parties will hold primaries to select candidates for various political positions and as a result, I employ individuals who intend to run for office to exercise restraint. Let us play the game by the rules so that the will of the people is respected and protected at the end of the day.\n\n\u201cI would also like to appeal to religious leaders, traditional rulers, parents and guardians to keep a tight grip on the youth so that they do not become agents of instability in the hands of misguided individuals seeking power at all cost.\u201d\n\nThe governor also assured residents of the state that his administration would continuously provide democratic dividends and complete all existing projects before the conclusion of his tenure next year.\n\nPromise Of Good Governance\n\nSimilarly, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos also with the people of the state a prosperous new year with a promise of good governance.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs we draw the curtains on 2021, we should be reminded of life\u2019s lessons. Events that shaped our lives, and experiences that will be entrenched in our memories forever.\n\n\u201cWe must however be thankful for God\u2019s infinite goodness and mercies throughout the past year. Despite the raging pandemic which has crippled many economies, we\u2019re still standing strong and trudging along. Our resilience heightened and our faith unshaken, we made it through 2021.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs your Governor, I salute you all and reassure you of my heart of service and spirit of candour. I will continue to be giving of myself, in spite of misconceptions. I will continue to deliver good governance and provide purposeful leadership to everyone in Lagos.\n\n\u201cWe will as a Government, continue to deliver infrastructural developments that will improve the quality of life of residents, such that generations yet unborn will be partakers of the good fortune of Lagos. So, help us God. On behalf of my family and the Government of Lagos State, I wish you all a happy and prosperous new year!\u201d the governor added.\n\nPrayer For Peace\n\nUnlike his counterparts, Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State joined the Christian faithful for a special crossover service at the St. Peters Cathedral Church in Ake, Abeokuta.\n\nIn his message, he promised deliberate and purposeful initiatives for economic recovery through his administration\u2019s economic blueprint.\n\nThe governor said efforts would be intensified in the areas of the independent power projects, mass transportation, education, security, critical infrastructure, and healthcare delivery to bring a new lease of life to residents.\n\nWhile asking residents to continue to live together in peace and harmony, he called for more prayers for his administration, the political leaders, and the country in general for peace and development.\n\nReducing Poverty\n\nIn Kwara, Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq congratulated the people of the state and Nigerians on the new calendar year.\n\nHe assured residents of his administration\u2019s continuous focus on projects and programmes that would boost inclusive growth, reduce poverty, and create a better environment for sustainable job opportunities in the state.\n\nThe governor explained that the administration\u2019s Budget of Sustained Reformation for Inclusive Growth has been designed to double down on the achievements and reforms in the education sector, healthcare, workers\u2019 welfare, water supply, ease of doing business, a safety net for the poor, access roads within the metropolis and across the state, as well as improved investments and partnership with the security agencies, civic community, and the traditional institutions to guarantee the safety of lives and properties.\n\n\u201cAt the dawn of 2022, I call on our people to continue to support the administration\u2019s policies and programmes to place Kwara on the path of sustainable growth,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur major selling point has been peace and tranquillity, and I urge that we should continue to relate with one another as one people bound by a common destiny under God. This year, as always, let us watch over one another and work for a greater Kwara and Nigeria, irrespective of our differences.\u201d\n\nThe governors of Edo and Rivers, Godwin Obaseki and Nyesom Wike, also have a series of messages for the people of their states.\n\nMore Opportunities\n\nAs we usher in 2022, let us thank God Almighty that we are able to witness the beginning of another year. In spite of the challenges and uncertainties experienced in 2021, there is a lot which we should be grateful to God Almighty for. Despite witnessing two waves of COVID-19 in 2021, the mortality rate which we recorded in Edo State was far less than was projected. This persisting COVID pandemic is a clarion call for us to pay more attention to our environment and also strengthen our healthcare system. Consequently, the reform of our healthcare system is now a very high priority in our ongoing transformation of the entire governance structure of Edo State. Confident that Edo citizens will continue to subscribe to the Edo Health Insurance Scheme which will provide the long-term funds to sustain our new healthcare system, we are now revamping 100 additional primary healthcare facilities while building our network of specialist hospitals in the three senatorial districts. Our healthcare reform in Edo will also include encouragement of the private sector to invest in providing quality healthcare. We are encouraged with the progress in our transformation of the public service, and we are confident that with the ongoing recruitments, introduction of technology, and the emphasis on training, our citizens will begin to receive better quality services from their government. The construction and rehabilitation of roads are currently going on across the state. Even though the extended rainy season delayed the commencement of work, we are optimistic that significant portions of work will be completed before the next rainy season. We are also focusing on other infrastructure such as electricity and fibre connection. Our operation Light Up Edo is in full gear with the streetlighting project being rolled out in Benin City, Ekpoma, and Auchi. We are working with a private provider to connect all our 18 local government areas with fibre optic connections to enhance access to the internet and expand the digital economy across the state. The physical and digital infrastructure we are laying across the state, including the proposed Airport in Edo North, will position Edo State as a major commercial hub in Nigeria and West Africa. Investing in our people will continue to be a priority in 2022 as we roll out the EdoBEST framework to all tiers of education in the state. We are building shared production facilities in 6 technical colleges across the state to support the technical training of our youths while promoting technical entrepreneurship in these communities. The successful take-off of the Edo Tech Park with the graduation of the first set of highly trained software engineers and developers has spurred us to commence the construction of the permanent site for the Edo Tech Park. We hope the first phase will be ready for use in 2022, thus ensuring Edo\u2019s position as a tech hub on the African continent. In addition to exposing them to technology, we are supporting our youths in entrepreneurship and innovation to seize the moment and build top-of-the-range capacity to compete with their peers globally. We are expending resources to boost opportunities in the creative industry with the establishment of the Victor Uwaifo Creative Hub and Soundstage. As a government, we will continue to deepen our development strides following the gains made in the last five years. Our emphasis will continue to remain on building capacity, deploying technology, promoting innovation, enhancing the growth of the productive sector, and leveraging our Diaspora population to drive sustainable development. In the new year, we are recommitting ourselves to deepen growth across all sectors of the state and providing more opportunities for our people to realise their full potential. These we will do by leveraging the innate abilities of our people and providing them with the tools and enablement to dominate and conquer the world. Let me appreciate and commend the effort and services of all our security agencies particularly our vigilante network who continue to work and sacrifice to keep us safe. Our relative success in securing Edo particularly in the last few months is the result of the collaborative effort of these agencies. Our support will be extended in the new year to the training of our vigilante network in the Nigeria Police Force training facilities in Ogida Barracks which has been refurbished by the Edo State Government. In the areas of agriculture, tourism, infrastructure, energy, electricity, healthcare, education, and security, we are changing the way government works and delivers services to Edo people. As we fulfill this mandate to you, we urge you all to live up to your own civic responsibility by paying your taxes. We are revamping our tax administration system to make it easy for you to pay your taxes with the use of technology. We urge all Edo people to approach the new year with renewed hope in our political system. Our goal is to make sure that in Edo, democracy has full expression and we only vote for candidates with demonstrated evidence to add value to our society. I reassure the good people of Edo State that I will continue to strive to do only that which is in the best interest of Edo State and Edo people. I wish you all a happy and safe 2022. His Excellency, Godwin Obaseki Governor, Edo State\n\nEffective Environmental Sanitation\n\nA STATE-WIDE BROADCAST BY HIS EXCELLENCY NYESOM EZENWO WIKE TO MARK THE 2022 NEW YEAR My dear people of Rivers State As the clock ticks down and as we look forward to ushering in the New Year 2022, this is the time to give thanks to the Almighty God for his blessings and the opportunity to look into the future with greater hope and optimism. On behalf of my wife and the Government, let me thank all Rivers State citizens in particular, and Nigerians in general, for your continued love and support to our administration throughout the year 2021. Indeed, we cannot thank you enough for the trust, the solidarity, the cooperation, and above all, your prayers for the success of our government and the peace and progress of our State. We also thank the police, the department of state security, the armed forces, and the paramilitary services for working round the clock to make and keep our dear State peaceful, safe, and secure, not only in this festive season but throughout the outgoing year. Indeed, there is no denying the fact that crime and criminality have been at very low rates in Rivers State and citizens felt safer and more secure in 2021 than in the previous years. With the cooperation of the security agencies, we identified and destroyed most of the shanties that hitherto served as safe havens and hideouts for criminals, who have now been dislodged and dislocated from the State, having lost the space and capacity from which they could operate with ease. To consolidate on the gains of the dislodgement and dislocation exercises, and make the State even safer and more secure, we have decided to demolish all shanties and makeshift structures in identified crime hotspots in Port Harcourt Township and the Illabuchi areas of Diobu from the second week of January 2022. Those rebuilding the shanties we had demolished at Eleme or attempting to resume illegal trading activities at the closed Oginigba slaughter have one week to vacate or be arrested and charged to court. Additionally, we have discovered that most vacant plots or uncompleted buildings in the Old and New Government Reservation Areas (GRA) and some other parts of Port Harcourt City and Obio/Akpor Local Government Areas have been hijacked and are now inhabited by criminal elements who are daily constituting a menace to public safety. We have therefore decided to end this danger by taking over all such abandoned plots and uncompleted buildings and re-allocate them to citizens who are ready to develop and put them into effective occupancy. In a similar vein, we have revoked the certificates of occupancy of several undeveloped plots of land in old GRA, Port Harcourt, for breaching the covenants attached thereto, which we would also re-allocate to interested members of the public for immediate development as part of the ongoing efforts to restore the entire old GRA to its pristine state of development, beauty, and serenity. We will also not spare those contributing to the perennial flooding challenge in parts of Port Harcourt City and Obio/Akpor Local Government Area by blocking natural water and drainage channels with illegal landfilling, reclamation of wetlands, or the construction of concrete structures. Consequently, we shall recover and restore all landfilled or reclaimed wetlands and demolish all structures erected on natural water channels spanning from the Eastern bypass areas up to Abana and Eleme streets in Old GRA, Port Harcourt. Only those with genuine government permits and allocation papers will be duly compensated. Again, it is important to appreciate what we have done to successfully transform our capital city, Port Harcourt, to one of the most beautiful cities in Nigeria with well-paved streets, pedestrian walkways, dual carriage roads, and flyovers. However, the beauty of the city is being defaced by illegal and indiscriminate trading on our streets, under flyovers, and other unauthorized open spaces as well as the challenges with the current largely inefficient refuse disposal system.

          "text": "Nigeria has joined the rest of the world in ushering in 2022 after another tumultuous and pandemic-ridden year capped by soaring case numbers, insecurity, economic challenges, and a slight glimmer of hope for better times ahead.\n\nFrom fireworks cracking up in the air to worshippers in church to mark the crossover, many are optimistic that the coming year would provide a softer landing than 2021.\n\nReligious bodies such as the Christian Association of Nigeria had earlier called on citizens to pray for God\u2019s mercy in 2022.\n\nRead Also: World Rings In New Year Under COVID Cloud\n\nIn a New Year message signed on Friday by the CAN President Samson Ayokunle, the group said Nigerians irrespective of their religious affiliations should \u201ccry for the mercy of God\u201d that can preserve the nation and bring an end to all insecurity.\n\nAlso wishing citizens a happy new year, President Muhammadu Buhari urged them to envision a year of continued progress against the nation\u2019s combined challenges arising from security and socio-economic issues.\n\n\u201cThe path to nationhood is often fraught with unpredictable difficulties and challenges, and most tried and tested nations have often prevailed through dogged determination, resilience, concerted commitment to unity, and the conviction that the whole of the nation, standing together against all odds, is by far greater and would ultimately be more prosperous and viable than the sum of its distinguishable parts,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President also called on the people, irrespective of their religious and political affiliation, to come together in the fight to keep the country united against all odds.\n\nHe admitted that the persistent insecurity in parts of the country may have threatened the overall objective of his administration to position the nation on the irreversible trajectory of sustainable growth and progress.\n\nPresident Buhari, however, assured that the government would remain resolute in its commitments and would continue to press ahead with its programmes and plans.\n\nMeanwhile, as the festivities are still ongoing, the Federal Government has declared January 3, 2022, as a public holiday in celebration of the New Year.\n\nElsewhere across the world, 2022 was ushered in with scaled-back celebrations due to new restrictions aimed at slowing soaring Covid cases \u2014 although hope remained for a better new year.\n\nThe past 12 months saw a new US president and a fresh Adele album, the first spectator-free Olympics, and dreams of democracy from Afghanistan to Sudan and Hong Kong crushed by authoritarian regimes.\n\nBut the pandemic \u2014 now entering its third year \u2014 still dominated life around the globe.\n\nMore than 5.4 million people have died since the coronavirus was first reported in central China in December 2019.\n\nCountless more have been sickened or subjected to outbreaks, lockdowns and a slew of virus tests.\n\nThe year 2021 started with hope as life-saving vaccines were rolled out to around 60 per cent of the world\u2019s population, although many of its poor still have limited access and some of its rich falsely believe the jabs are part of some ill-defined plot.\n\nAs the year drew to a close, the emergence of the Omicron variant pushed the number of daily new Covid-19 cases past one million for the first time, according to an AFP tally.\n\nFrance on Friday became the latest country to announce Omicron was now its dominant coronavirus strain.\n\nIn Britain, the United States and even Australia \u2014 long a refuge from the pandemic \u2014 the variant\u2019s prominence is driving record new cases.\n\nTo Party, or Not?\n\nFrom Seoul to San Francisco, celebrations were again cancelled or curtailed in the face of the surge in infections.\n\nAbout 7,000 people in Madrid\u2019s Puerta del Sol \u2014 half the usual capacity due to Covid restrictions \u2014 rang in the new year by eating grapes, one for each time the clock chimed up to 12.\n\nThe glitzy Gulf city state of Dubai went ahead with its celebrations despite the surge in infections, with 36 firework displays at 29 locations.\n\nBut authorities warned they would fine anyone in attendance not wearing a protective mask.\n\nPolice officers patrolled the Champs-Elysees in Paris, lit with glittering red lights and festooned with \u201c2022\u201d balloons, also on the lookout for people without masks.\n\nMost people were simply asked to wear one, but some who argued were fined.\n\n\u201cIt is constraining to put on the mask\u2026 but it\u2019s no problem\u201d to follow the rule, said Antoine Pham, smiling. The 38-year-old and his partner came from Belgium to Paris for the evening.\n\nIn Sydney, which normally bills itself as the \u201cNew Year\u2019s Eve capital of the world\u201d, the vast harbour where people gathered to watch the city\u2019s fireworks was notably uncrowded.\n\nWith tourists still unable to enter the country and many residents fearful of the rapid spread of Omicron, tens of thousands were estimated to have attended, rather than the usual one million-plus.\n\nStill, the city saw New Year\u2019s Eve in with a bang \u2014 igniting six tonnes of technicoloured fireworks that lit up the Opera House and floating barges.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to focus on the positive things that happened this year,\u201d 22-year-old medical student Melinda Howard told AFP ahead of the show.\n\nIn Tunis, authorities cited the \u201crise in cases\u201d of coronavirus for the last-minute cancellation of festivities.\n\nIn contrast, South Africa \u2014 the first country to report Omicron back in November \u2014 lifted a curfew late Thursday to allow festivities to go ahead.\n\nHealth officials said that a dip in infections in the past week indicated the peak of the current wave had passed \u2014 crucially without a significant increase in deaths.\n\n\u2018This is Serious\u2019\n\nIn Rio, celebrations on Copacabana Beach went ahead in a scaled-back format, although crowds of revellers still arrived at the traditional party spot.\n\nAfter last year\u2019s festivities were cancelled due to Covid, it was a comparatively muted return for Rio, as health measures restricted the numbers of revellers to a fraction of the record three million people from two years ago.\n\nA ban on musical performances, traffic and public transport made for a more diluted atmosphere on the city\u2019s iconic beach.\n\n\u201cI was expecting many more people, and stress, but it\u2019s calm, I like it,\u201d saidColombian neuroscientist Alejandra Luna, 28, whose hope for 2022 is to \u201ckiss and cuddle without thinking much about it.\u201d\n\nIn Mexico City, authorities canceled a number of planned mass outdoor events, including a music concert on one of the capital\u2019s main boulevards, following an increase in coronavirus cases.\n\n\u201cHealth comes first and the cancellations are sending a kind of message that this is serious,\u201d Victor Arturo Madrid, a 59-year-old teacher, told AFP.\n\nTrying Times\n\nThe World Health Organization has warned of trying times ahead, saying Omicron could lead to \u201ca tsunami of cases\u201d.\n\nMany Western leaders have been hesitant to reimpose strict controls seen in 2020, for fear of sparking a new economic downturn.\n\nBut on-again-off-again restrictions have still prompted frequent, vocal and occasionally violent anti-lockdown, anti-vaccine and anti-government protests.\n\nUS President Joe Biden urged unity for the new year in a video message, during which he also praised \u201cextraordinary\u201d Americans.\n\n\u201cAs we head into 2022, I want folks to remember: There\u2019s not a single thing America cannot do when we do it together,\u201d he said on Twitter alongside the video.\n\nExperts and non-experts alike hope that 2022 may be remembered as a new, less deadly phase of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cHopefully 2022 is going to be better for everyone,\u201d said 31-year-old reveller Oscar Ramirez in Sydney.\n\n\u201cEveryone in the world needs a big change.\u201d",

That is where he will be buried.\n\nREAD ALSO: Key Dates In Late Bishop Desmond Tutu\u2019s Life As Funeral Holds\n\n\u201cWe thank you for loving our father,\u201d said Tutu\u2019s daughter Mpho.\n\n\u201cBecause we shared him with the world, you share part of the love you held for him with us, so we are thankful.\u201d\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa, who accorded Tutu a funeral usually reserved for presidents, kicked off the eulogy saying had Tutu been alive, \u201che would have said hey, \u2018why are you looking so grim, so unhappy'\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile our beloved (Nelson Mandela) was the father of our democracy, Archbishop Tutu was the spiritual father of our new nation.\u201d\n\n\u2018Life lived completely\u2019\n\n\u201cHis was a life lived honestly and completely. He has left the world a better place. We remember him with a smile,\u201d said Ramaphosa before handing South Africa\u2019s multicoloured flag to the \u201cchief mourner\u201d, Tutu\u2019s widow, Leah.\n\nThe flag \u2014 a reminder of Tutu\u2019s description of the post-apartheid country as the \u201cRainbow Nation\u201d, was the only military rite accorded to him, respecting his request before he died that military protocol be minimal.\n\nThe funeral ended South Africa\u2019s week of mourning, during which people filed past a diminutive rope-handled casket made of pine, adorned by a plain bunch of carnations.\n\nAt the end of the funeral service, the body was immediately removed from the church.\n\nUnder a grey sky and drizzle, among the mourners ushered into the cathedral were ex-Irish President Mary Robinson, and Mandela\u2019s widow Graca Machel. Both read out prayers.\n\nOthers included the widow of the last apartheid leader FW de Klerk, who died in November, and ex-presidents Thabo Mbeki and Kgalema Motlanthe.\n\nConspicuously absent was Tutu\u2019s close friend, Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, who failed to travel due to advanced age and Covid restrictions, according to his representative Ngodup Dorjee.\n\n\u2018Heavens did not collapse\u2019\n\nTutu\u2019s long-time friend, retired bishop Michael Nuttall, who was Anglican Church dean when Tutu was the archbishop of Cape Town, delivered a sombre sermon.\n\n\u201cOur partnership struck a chord perhaps in the hearts and minds of many people: a dynamic black leader and his white deputy in the dying years of apartheid; and hey presto, the heavens did not collapse,\u201d said Nuttall.\n\n\u201cWe were a foretaste\u2026 of what could be in our wayward, divided nation.\u201d\n\nUnder apartheid, the white minority government cemented its grip with a panoply of laws based on the notion of race and racial segregation, and the police ruthlessly hunted down opponents, killing or jailing them.\n\nWith Mandela and other leaders sentenced to decades in prison, Tutu in the 1970s became the emblem of the struggle.\n\nThe purple-gowned figure campaigned relentlessly abroad, administering public lashings to the Western world for failing to slap sanctions on the apartheid regime.\n\nAt home, from his pulpit, he slammed police violence against blacks. Only his robes saved him from prison and were a shield from police brutality for many protesters.\n\nHumour\n\nAfter apartheid was dismantled and South Africa ushered in the first free elections in 1994, Tutu chaired the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which exposed the horrors of the past in grim detail.\n\nHe would later admonish the ruling African National Congress for corruption and leadership incompetence.\n\nTutu\u2019s moral firmness and passion went hand-in-hand with self-deprecatory humour and a famously cackling laugh.\n\nLess than a kilometre away, dozens of people watched the funeral from a big screen.\n\n\u201cHe taught us all what love is. And I loved his humour! Very witty,\u201d said 63-year-old housewife Washilah Isaacs, adding that she also liked Tutu\u2019s support for Palestine.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) chief says he is optimistic that the coronavirus pandemic will be defeated in 2022, provided countries work together to contain its spread.\n\nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu warned against \u201cnarrow nationalism and vaccine hoarding\u201d in a new year statement.\n\nHis comments come two years since the WHO was first notified of cases of an unknown pneumonia strain in China.\n\nGlobal Covid cases now stand at 287m, while nearly 5.5m people have died.\n\nAcross the world people are marking the new year but celebrations are muted, with many countries wanting to discourage crowds gathering.\n\nCoronavirus remains part of daily life: a disease that has shut borders, split families and in some places made it unthinkable to leave the house without carrying a mask.\n\nDespite all this, Dr Tedros sounded a positive note in his speech, noting that there are now many more tools to treat Covid-19.\n\nBut he warned that continuing inequity in vaccine distribution was increasing the risk of the virus evolving.\n\n\u201cNarrow nationalism and vaccine hoarding by some countries have undermined equity and created the ideal conditions for the emergence of the Omicron variant, and the longer inequity continues, the higher the risks of the virus evolving in ways we can\u2019t prevent or predict,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf we end inequity, we end the pandemic,\u201d he added.\n\nIn other developments:\n\nSouth Africa, where Omicron was first reported, has lifted an overnight curfew after announcing the country is likely to have passed the peak of new infections\n\nA German virologist, Christian Drosten, told ZDF television he expects a \u201crelatively normal\u201d winter, pointing to data suggesting that Omicron cases are not as severe\n\nSeveral countries, including the UK, Italy and Greece, reported record cases\n\nThousands more flights have been cancelled, nearly half of them in the US, as airlines struggle with crew sickness\n\nHealth officials in France have said Omicron is now the country\u2019s dominant variant. President Macron said the next few weeks would be difficult, but he was \u201coptimistic for the year to come\u201d\n\nIsrael has become one of the first countries in the world to approve a fourth Covid vaccination.\n\nIn his comments, Dr Tedros also alluded to low vaccination rates.\n\nWhile most of the population in Europe and the Americas have received at least one dose, a WHO target of full vaccination rates in 40% of every country by the end of 2021 has been missed across most of Africa.\n\nDr Tedros has previously criticised wealthier nations for \u201cgobbling up\u201d the global vaccine supply, fully vaccinating much of their populations while others wait for their first doses.\n\nThe WHO has set a new goal for 2022: vaccinate 70% of people in all countries by July to end the pandemic.",
