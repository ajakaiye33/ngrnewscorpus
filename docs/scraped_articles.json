          "title": "PDP crisis deepens, Secondus pursues suit as party plans convention",
          "text": "There is anxiety in the rank of the Peoples Democratic Party as the Court of Appeal in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, is set to hear the appeal filed by the suspended National Chairman of the party, Uche Secondus, today (Tuesday).\n\nOn August 23, 2021, some interested members of the party had instituted a suit marked PHC/2183/CS/2021 at the High Court of Rivers State, Port Harcourt Judicial Division, with Secondus and the PDP as defendants.\n\nOn September 10, 2021, the court delivered its judgment and restrained Secondus from performing the functions of the national chairman of the PDP.\n\nThe suspended chairman subsequently filed an appeal before the Court of Appeal seeking an order of injunction restraining the PDP, its officers and representatives from holding or conducting the national convention scheduled for October 30 and 31, 2021, or any other date pending the hearing and final determination of the appeal.\n\nHowever, the PDP has continued to insist that its convention will hold as scheduled, while also negotiating with Secondus to drop the suit.\n\nSecondus\u2019 lawyer, Mr Tayo Oyetibo (SAN), told The PUNCH on Monday that the appeal would go on as scheduled.\n\nOyetibo said he had not received any instruction from Secondus to withdraw the case, adding that the PDP had also not filed a response to the appeal.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, I have no instruction from Prince Secondus to drop the case. Also, the PDP has not filed any response to our appeal. The appeal will be heard on Tuesday (today),\u201d the senior advocate said.\n\nBut the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the party\u2019s plan to hold its national convention on October 30 and 31 was on course.\n\nHe told reporters in Abuja on Monday that the party was not in receipt of any court process barring it from going ahead with the scheduled activities.\n\nIn response to a question on a pending litigation before a Kaduna High Court seeking to stop the convention, Ologbondiyan said, \u201cAs far as the Peoples Democratic Party is concerned, the party does not work on speculations. There is no court judgment before the party.\n\n\u201cYou cannot be talking about court issues; it is only when there is a judgment from the court that we will begin to talk about court issues as far as the party is concerned. All the plans have been set out for the national convention.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on preparations for the national convention, he stated, \u201cThe preparation for the national convention is in place, and as far as the party is concerned, the dates for the convention remain October 30 and 31.\n\n\u201cI want to bring to the attention of my dear colleagues that the national convention organising committee\u2019s leaders are in town, and these are the Chairman and the governor of Adamawa State, Mr Umaru Fintiri; the Deputy Chairman and governor of Bayelsa State, Diri Duoye; as well as the governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, who is the Secretary of the committee; the three of them are in Abuja to oversee the convention process.\n\n\u201cAll the respective subcommittees are working. I am the secretary of the publicity subcommittee. All the committees are working; we have about 15 subcommittees for the purpose of the convention and they\u2019re all working.\u201d\n\nOlogbondiyan denied reports of a disconnect between members of the committee and its leadership just as he said the National Working Committee of the party, of which he is a member, was doing its bit to ensure the smooth running of the PDP ahead of the convention.\n\nHe also denied that members of the NWC had abandoned their offices, stating, \u201cThat is totally and absolutely incorrect, and some of your colleagues went upstairs into the NWC hall to meet with members of the NWC, who took their respective seats and were deliberating on the success of the forthcoming national convention.\u201d\n\nThe party spokesman said the venue for the convention had been secured and arrangements were in top gear to ensure a successful programme.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "$148m consultants\u2019 pay: Buhari, govs meet, Oct revenue sharing suspended",
          "text": "There were strong indications on Monday that state governors would soon meet with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), over the Federal Government\u2019s decision to debit local government accounts.\n\nThe PUNCH gathered that the governors decided to meet the President after Friday\u2019s Federation Account Allocation Committee meeting ended in a deadlock following the states\u2019 opposition to the commencement of deduction of $418m from the local governments\u2019 accounts to pay private consultants for the Paris Club refund.\n\nIt was learnt that commissioners of finance had briefed the governors and that the states would take up the matter with the President last week.\n\nA top official of the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, who confided in one of our correspondents, said, \u201cThe governors\u2019 meeting with the President is expected to hold this week, because of the urgency of the matter. Without the allocation, the states cannot pay salaries.\u201d\n\nThe states were irked at Friday\u2019s last meeting when they were informed by the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Finance that deductions from local governments\u2019 allocations had started in order to pay the Paris Club consultants.\n\nThe Federal Government had in 2006 paid $12bn to get an $18bn debt write-off by the Paris Club of international creditors.\n\nAfter realising that the payment was made directly from the revenue accruing to the entire federation, states and local governments that did not owe the Paris Club demanded a refund.\n\nSome consultants claimed that a percentage of the refund as payment for services they said they rendered to the states and local government councils.\n\nSome of the contractors also claimed that they executed projects across the country for the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria.\n\nGovernors, who strongly opposed the deductions, insisted that the projects said to have been awarded by ALGON turned out to be mostly non-existent.\n\nThe governors, therefore, insisted on a forensic audit, while the contractors and consultants went to court.\n\nThe Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, negotiated an out-of-court settlement with the contractors and consultants.\n\nThe sum of $418,953,670.59 was agreed on as the judgment debt.\n\nThe Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum subsequently went to court to stop the payment of the controversial sum to the consultants.\n\nIn a letter dated September 3, 2021 and signed by a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, P. H. Ogbole, the governors said the money should not be deducted from the local governments\u2019 accounts.\n\nIt was learnt that there was confusion at the FAAC meeting on Friday when the states were informed that deductions had commenced despite a subsisting court case on the matter.\n\nWhen contacted on Monday, the Chairman of the Forum of Commissioners of Finance and Benue State Commissioner for Finance, David Olofu, told one of our correspondents that the new date for the suspended FAAC meeting had not been announced.\n\nHe also confirmed that state governors would meet with the President over the controversial deductions.\n\nOlofu disclosed that the commencement of deductions forced FAAC to suspend the revenue distribution for the month of October indefinitely.\n\nThe forum chairman recalled that the governors\u2019 forum had objected to the deductions and requested that a forensic audit be carried out to ascertain the true position of things.\n\nOlofu expressed dismay with the commencement of deductions even though the governors objected to such.\n\nAccording to him, the deduction is illegal because the issue is in court.\n\nHe said the deduction should be put on hold until the litigation was discharged.\n\nOlofu stated, \u201cWe went to the FAAC meeting for the month of October and noticed that the Paris Club deductions had commenced.\n\n\u201cThe assignment is in respect of local government councils though I don\u2019t know the nature of the assignment (work done in local government areas), but it is in respect of consultancy on the Paris Club loan refund.\n\n\u201cThe decision was to suspend the distribution of revenue for the month of October pending the resolution of this issue. Recall that the governors\u2019 forum objected to the deductions.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the planned meeting between Buhari and the governors on the issue, Olofu added, \u201cWe expect that the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum will be meeting with the President to find solutions to this. It is not at our level that the issue can be handled; we are only representing the governors at FAAC.\n\n\u201cI understand that there is litigation on the issue; one would have expected that the deductions would be put on hold until the litigation is discharged.\u201d\n\nOlofu listed other deductions by the Federal Government from the states\u2019 allocations to include bailout and budget support facilities.\n\nAsked when the meeting might be reconvened for revenue distribution, the finance commissioner said there was no definite date yet.\n\nAccording to him, states may be invited any moment an agreement is reached on the distribution.\n\n\u201cWe may be called at any moment; if we are called this evening, it means tomorrow morning we will all meet, but as I am talking now (4.23pm on Monday), I don\u2019t have any information,\u201d he stated.\n\nAnother member of FAAC and Delta State Commissioner for Finance, Mr Fidelis Tilije, said in an interview with The PUNCH in Asaba on Monday that the NGF would meet the President on the matter.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe issue hasn\u2019t been resolved and we are hoping that the NGF will have a meeting with Mr President and we will take it from there.\n\n\u201cAs for the allocation for the month of October, Delta State has not received it.\u201d\n\nResponding to the development, the spokesman for the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Yunusa Abdullahi, asked one of our correspondents to refer all inquiries related to the allocation of funds from the Federation Account to the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation.\n\nWhen contacted, the Director, Information, Press and Public Relations, Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation, Henshaw Ogubike, said there was no update on the issue from his end.\n\n\u201cThere is no update; if there is any update on the issue, I will send it,\u201d he simply stated.\n\nWhen asked when the next FAAC meeting would be held, Ogubike said, \u201cDon\u2019t ask me for an update, because normally I send the update if there is any; if there is any press release, I will send it.\u201d\n\nBut a top official of the finance ministry said a new date for the FAAC meeting would be announced today (Tuesday).\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

You can be isolated but you need physical activity even in isolation.\n\n\u201cDuring infection, physiotherapist helps to boost the lung capacity of the patients by introducing exercises that will make the patients physically active.\n\n\u201cWhen there is minimal function in the lungs, the patients will have other complications and when it happens, the patients may present with things like weakness, loss of muscle power, muscle tones etc.\n\n\u201cAnd only physical activities an reduce the impact and prevent patient from having lung COVID or get into lung collapse.\u201d\n\nAlso, speaking, immediate past acting Vice Chancellor of the College of Medicine, University of Lagos, CMUL, Prof Folashade Ogunsola, decried the debilitating impact of lung COVID.\n\nShe noted that the human body was designed to move, and when people do not use their muscles, such muscles grow smaller and weaker, hence, the need for physical activity.\n\nOgunshola said COVID-19 attacks, reduces the lung function and physiotherapists are needed to help patients to get rid of these risks when they recover.\n\nShe said COVID-19 has been a game-changer, disrupter of life that gives a glimpse into the future and has accelerated the world\u2019s movement into digital technology.\n\n\u201cFor the elderly people, in particular, I was concerned about the elderly, many of them were not moving around at all such that by the end of the year, many of them were extremely weak.\n\n\u201cIn addition to that, some had started having dementia; physiotherapists are required for this era where there is a lot of atrophy.\u201d\n\nShe explained that though there has been an increase in Lung COVID in Nigeria it was not a pandemic but a post-viral syndrome, adding that, \u201cbecause it is a new disease, it is affecting people differently.\u201d\n\nShe said they are seeing a lot of lung COVID even in young people but for some, it is debilitating while for some, it is not so bad and shorter than others.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t totally understand the disease or what predisposes us to have lung COVID. It works in progress to fully understand it and how to stop it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking, the Chairman, Scientific Council, Dr Chidozie Mbada, said that COVID-19 was a catastrophe that brought the world to a near halt, adding that the delicate and vulnerable nature of the world became apparent during the pandemic.\n\nMbada who noted that COVID-19 brought in a lot of new and unfamiliar policies said the most significant, for them was the lockdown restrictions which led to economic and health consequences, among other things.\n\nHe said for their profession, there was a shift from skepticism to optimism on the adoption of telerehabilitation (digital therapy) in Nigeria.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

So, the government should take him seriously. But we are engaging and finding political solutions to this issue. We are engaging with IPOB and showing them the importance of this election. The most important thing is that the election is constitutional, and I\u2019m also very much sure that on the day of the election, there will be a peaceful election in Anambra state,\u201d the senator said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the only politician that\u2019s working hard to see the reader of the indigenous people of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, so that I can also have the opportunity of talking to him and get him to talk to his people to look into the issue. Because the election is constitutional, and if really anybody loves our people, they shouldn\u2019t be saying there\u2019ll be no election.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really help our people. If there\u2019s no election, there will be voter apathy, and somebody might come in and then do something that might not augur well.\n\n\u201cIPOB is a very big force because most of them are not even in Nigeria. And they have their way with the media, and people are listening to them. So, that\u2019s why I have dedicated myself to how we can bring in and proffer a political solution.\u201d",

It appears the young men who decide what happens now in PDP want to resist the influence of the Generals,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that the leaders of the party today are pushing for generational shift.\n\nAccording to the source, the governors felt that as the national secretary, he betrayed the party which he dumped for the \u201cN-PDP,\u201d from where he defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) and campaigned for President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015.\n\nThe source added:\u201dThings have changed in the PDP. Oyinlola\u2019s support base now is not big to command recognition. In Osun State, it is evident that the machinery is controlled by the Adeleke camp.\n\n\u201cOyinlola\u2019s attachment to his old military leaders, Obasanjo and IBB is now a disadvantage. The governors wand to reduce their influence and they know that Oyinlola is a link to them.\n\n\u201cAlso, the governors are looking beyond the convention which is expected to produce a temporary chairman who will be compelled to step down once the presidential ticket is zoned to the North as both the chairman and the standard bearer cannot come from the same region.\n\n\u201cThe current PDP leaders are also looking at discipline. They have not forgiven Oyinlola for abandoning the party at a critical time and they are unanimous that if he has come back, he should not eye a big position.\u201d\n\nAlthough Arapaja also defected briefly from the PDP to the APC, the source said the impact of his defection was not felt like that of Oyinlola, who was perceived as one of the top party leaders at state, regional and national levels.",

          "text": "From Uche Usim Abuja and Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nBarely hours after the long-awaited Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) also called eNaira was unveiled by President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential villa, Abuja, 33 banks have been fully integrated on the eNaira platform, just as 2,000 customers have been onboarded and 120 merchants registered on the portal.\n\nThe CBN Governor Mr Godwin Emefiele, who made the disclosure at the launch expressed joy that Nigeria was the first country in Africa and the few in the world to unveil a digital currency.\n\nHe hailed President Buhari and CBN staff for their support to ensure the success of the initiative.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nAccording to him, since the eNaira platform went live, there has been overwhelming interest and encouraging response from Nigerians and other parties across the world with over 2.5 million daily visits to the website.\n\nAlready, N500 million has been successfully minted by the apex bank and N200 million issued to financial institutions.\n\n\u201cToday, customers who download the eNaira Speed Wallet App will be able to perform the following:\n\nOnboard and create their wallet; fund their eNaira wallet from their bank account; transfer eNaira from their wallet to another wallet and make payment for purchases at registered merchant locations.\n\n\u201cWith the launch of the eNaira \u2013 the first in Africa and one of the earliest around the world, there have been continuing debates on the true value of the naira. Rather than worry today about the direction of the exchange rate, let us take a step back and analyze how we got here in the first place. \u201cPlease recall that since the advent of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) led Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) in 1986, and the introduction of the Second Tier Foreign Exchange (SFEM) market, the Naira has been on a one-way free fall from parity to the US Dollar in 1984 to over N410/USD today.\n\n\u201cSome 35 years later, we have not been able to achieve the many promises and objectives of that programme. Instead, what we have seen is widespread import dependency, which have wiped out most of our production and manufacturing bases and exported all our jobs in the process. What has happened to the massive textile factories across our nation such that we import almost all cotton products when we are rich in cotton?\n\n\u201cWhat has happened to our vehicle assembly plants across the nation such that we import most vehicles and have become a massive dumping ground for dying second-hand vehicles? What has happened to our rubber plantations through which we made the best tyres and rubber products in the world? What has happened to our groundnut pyramids? What has happened to our Cocoa farms? What has happened to our palm oil mills?\n\n\u201cUnder your leadership, Mr. President, we must stop this decline for good! We must return to massive homemade production; we must get our people working again. We must create the economic environment for massive domestic production and significant non-oil exports.\n\n\u201cAs custodians of your national reserves, let me first assure you that there is no cause for alarm. Our FX reserves are strong and indeed getting stronger by the day, crossing the 40 billion USD mark, and is one of the highest in Africa \u2013 and growing. But we cannot fritter our reserves away on cheap imports and currency speculators. We must return to an employment-led growth anchored on productivity and rewarding producers of local goods, services, innovation and new technologies. If you consume cheap imports and export our jobs, we will make you pay dearly; but if you produce locally \u2013 with little or no foreign inputs beyond machinery, we will support you, and the markets will reward you abundantly.\n\n\u201cToday, in addition to all policies and actions of the CBN to support the economy especially through the trying times of COVID-19, the apex bank is announcing a new financial instrument titled \u201cThe 100 for 100 PPP \u2013 Policy on Production and Productivity\u201d, which will be anchored in our Development Finance Department under my direct supervision. Under this policy the CBN will advertise, screen, scrutinize and financially support 100 targeted private sector companies in 100 days, beginning from 01 November 2021, and rolling over every 100 days with a new set of 100 companies, whose names will be published in National Dailies for Nigerians to verify and confirm.\n\n\u201cWorking through banks, the financial instrument will be available to their customers in critical areas to boost the production and productivity, and to immediately transform and jumpstart the productive base of the economy. After these 100 projects by companies in the first hundred days from November 1, we will take the next 100 companies/projects for another 100 days beginning February 1, 2022, and then another 100 companies for another 100 days beginning from May 1, 2022.The purpose of this instrument is to take further steps to reverse our over reliance on imports. We believe that if we target and support the right companies and projects, we will see a significant, measurable and verifiable increase in local production and productivity, reduction in certain imports, increase in non-oil exports, and improvements in the FX-generating capacity of the economy. This, in my view, is the best and most sustainable way to address the Naira\u2019s value \u2013 whether in hard currency or digital eNaira \u2013 through production, production and more production\u201d, Emefiele explained.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, President Muhammadu Buhari stated that while the journey to create a digital currency for Nigeria began sometime in 2017, work intensified over the past several months with several brainstorming exercises, deployment of technical partners and advisers, collaboration with the Ministries of Communication and Digital Economy and its sister agencies like the Nigerian Communications Commission, integration of banking softwares across the country and painstaking tests to ensure the robustness, safety and scalability of the CBDC System.\n\nThe President added that a handful of countries including China, Bahamas, and Cambodia have already issued their own Central Bank Digital Currencies (or CBDCs).\n\n\u201cA 2021 survey of Central Banks around the world by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that almost 90 percent are actively researching the potential for CBDCs, 60 percent were experimenting with the technology and 14 percent were deploying pilot projects.\n\n\u201cNeedless to add, close monitoring and close supervision will be necessary in the early stages if implementation to study the effect of eNaira on the economy as a whole.\n\n\u201cIn response to developments in the global economy, an overwhelming majority of Central Banks across the world have started to consider issuing digital currencies in order to cater for businesses and households seeking faster, safer, easier and cheaper means of payments.\n\n\u201cIt is on the basis of this that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sought and received my approval to explore issuing Nigeria\u2019s own Central Bank Digital Currency, named the eNaira.\n\n\u201cThis move was underpinned by the fact that the CBN has been a leading innovator in the form of money they produce, and in the payment services they deploy for efficient transactions. They have invested heavily in creating a Payment System that is ranked in the top ten in the world and certainly the best in Africa. This payment system now provides high\u2010value and time\u2010critical payment services to financial institutions, and ultimately serves as the backbone for every electronic payment in Nigeria, he stated.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nThe Federal Government, yesterday, warned it would no longer tolorate the attacks on custodial facilities across the country saying enough is enough.\n\nThe warning came against the backdrop of last Friday\u2019s attack on the Medium Security Custodial Centre in Abolongo, Oyo State and previous attacks on custodial faciliteis in Owerri, Benin and Kabba in Imo, Edo and Kogi states respectively.\n\nMinister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, who deplored the attacks when he visited the Abolongo custodial centre, yesterday, said they were not just random happenings but premeditated, planned and coordinated crimes designed to make Nigeria unsafe and ridicule the government.\n\n\u201cWe are going after every single inmate that escaped from custody. We shall hunt them to the ends of the earth. All the security agencies in the country are on their trail. We shall not rest nor tire until we bring the last one in, dead or alive. Let me assure Nigerians of the safety of their lives and property. Our custodial facilities are safe and we are putting extra safety measures in place in light of the observed pattern of the external attacks we have seen, to prevent any such occurrence in the future.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\n\u201cI am assuring Nigerians that the Federal Government will pursue not just those who attacked our facility, but those who have escaped lawful custody. The attack was unconscionable. I commend officers of the Nigeria Correctional Service and other members of sister security agencies, who provided perimeter security for our facility for fighting gallantly and holding the fort before the attackers were able to gain access to the awaiting trial section of the facility. However, those who escaped are already being pursued. Some have been rearrested, many more will still be captured,\u201d the minister said.\n\nThe attack on the Oyo facility was launched by gunmen around 10pm last Friday with a total of 837 out of the 907 inmates held in the facility freed by the gunmen. One soldier, one Amotekun operative and one inmate lost their lives during the gun duel, while many sustained varying degrees of injury.\n\nGovernor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State; Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III and 5the state Commissioner of Police, Ngozi Onadeko had also visited the facility.\n\nMakinde who described the attack as shocking said close circuit television cameras (CCTV) would be installed as part of surveillance and security measures on the facility.\n\n\u201cInvestigation is still ongoing. We cannot say precisely whether this is an isolated event, or is the beginning of a wider issue that we have to deal with. But whatever the case is, we have made an assessment here, we have taken some immediate decisions. We have asked that the road to this place be graded immediately. We are going to position cameras here and we will link them to our security situation room, not just here, but all other correctional facilities in the state. We are also making a list of critical state assets that we need to monitor. I have also asked that the entrance and exit points to the state be monitored,\u201d he said.\n\nResponding to question on high profile inmates escaping from the facility, Makinde said: \u201cPeople are very quick to start talking about conspiracy theory. Investigation is still on. Yes, there are high profile inmates that are held in this facility. But they are not the people that they are carrying their rumour. So, I will appeal again that we should be calm. We have challenges around the country. We have insurgency, we have banditry. But we can only deal with those issues when we have the people in alignment to what the leadership is doing. We should believe that the leadership will tell them the exact situation of things at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nAlaafin of Oyo, said attack on the facility was shocking.\n\n\u201cMay God end such. This place is for those who are acting against the law and all what the government is doing to make things good, so that they can be kept away and reformed before coming back into the society as better people. But, the situation where they had to bring guns and explosives here to destroy the place is so shocking to us and painful. All those who died and injured, may God forgive them their sins and heal those in the hospital. The people of the town should be calm and wait for what the government will do. I am sure that the government will react positively and this incident will be a thing of the past. By the grace of God, we will never witness this type of devastation again in this town.\u201d\n\nThe number of inmates that have been recaptured had risen to 378, while 460 are still at large, said Adams Ongaji, officer in charge of the custodial centre. It was gathered that the repair of damaged items at the centre had begun on Sunday.\n\nIt was, however, learnt that only two soldiers and three armed guards were on ground when gunmen with sophisticated weapons attacked the facility. \u201cThe the gunmen did not only overpower the five security personnel, they successfully took away three inmates that were remanded at the centre in connection with bank robbery,\u201d a source said.\n\nDeputy Controller-General, Operations, of NCS, Abuja, Mohammed Tukur, cleared the air on the speculations that the gunmen came to rescue the alleged territorial warlord and kidnapping kingpin on Ibarapa axis of the state, Iskilu Wakili, saying Wakili was not held at the centre. He said the suspected serial killer of Akinyele Local Government Area of the state, Sunday Sodipe was not also held at the facility.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Rescuing Nigeria from abandoned road projects",
          "text": "Although the infrastructure deficit in Nigeria is alarming generally, the state of the roads in the country is particularly shameful. Dilapidated and abandoned, the crater-infested federal roads litter every region of Nigeria. The situation has reached a point where we must find long-lasting solutions to the problem.\n\nThe list of the bad federal roads is long. They are spread across the country. Contracts for the rehabilitation of many of these roads have been awarded, but poor funding has stalled work on them. The contracts for the rehabilitation of Makera-Kontagora-Yauri and Bida-Lapai-Lambatta Roads, for instance, were reportedly awarded in 2013 and 2018 respectively. Until date, they are not yet completed.\n\nPart of the problem is that money appropriated for roads is too paltry. Also, when money is appropriated, it is not fully released. Last year, the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, alluded to this fact when she said: \u201cYou will see a road that costs, maybe, N5 billion, and you will see a provision for N100 million, N200 million or N300 million. Of course, the project will never finish. After two years, the contractor comes back and asks for variation, and the amount keeps growing.\u201d\n\nThis is the case with the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway. According to the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Works, Abubakar Kabir, the contract for the rehabilitation of the road was awarded to the tune of N32 billion. So far, he said, only about N5 billion was certified to date approximating to about 19 per cent completion. The lawmaker lamented that in the 2022 budget, the provision for that road was less than N300 million.\n\nBesides, Kabir said the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing allocated only N280 billion to road infrastructure in the 2022 budget. This is against the reported N640 billion outstanding certificates to contractors. In 2020, the Federal Government allocated N169.88billion for construction and rehabilitation of roads. This is less than the N280.44billion budgeted for the same purpose in 2019. In 2021, the approved sum for the rehabilitation of roads was over N117billion. How can we move forward this way?\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nIt has been observed that money appropriated for roads is usually too small to do any meaningful job. In the 2022 budget, there are provisions for execution of roads, with appropriation of N35 million for one kilometre. With the level of inflation and high cost of construction materials, there is no solid one kilometre of road work that can be done with N35 million. In such situation, what may happen at best is the contractor grading the road and settling officials of the Ministry of Works to look the other way. Such situation is rampant in relation to road rehabilitation and construction. Most times, a road contractor contends with party patronage, bribing ministry officials and settling communities before embarking on road projects. With paltry allocation, this helps to ensure that these road projects are not executed.\n\nEven when they are completed, some of these roads are not strong enough to withstand the volume of traffic on them. Due to the fact that the railway infrastructure is not fully developed yet, overloaded tankers and trucks put great pressure on these roads and often lead to their total damage. The other day, a section of the Onitsha-Owerri Road completely collapsed to the chagrin of many of the road users.\n\nThe state of our roads contributes largely to the rate of accident and insecurity in Nigeria. Recently, the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) said 5,320 road crashes and 2,471 deaths were recorded nationwide between January and June 2021 alone. No fewer than 15,882 people sustained various injuries. The worst is that bandits often lay ambush and waylay their victims on bad portions of these roads. This is not salutary at all.\n\nBad roads also affect prices of commodities. Farmers labour to bring food items to the market. Transporters take cognizance of the wear and tear of their vehicles occasioned by bad roads and increase transport fares. This invariably translates into higher prices for goods and services.\n\nOne way or the other, bad roads also affect investment. It may have contributed to the decline in our Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) because no investor wants to invest in an atmosphere of poor infrastructure. Some of them who dared to invest have had to endure the misfortune of fallen containers, broken down vehicles and associated problems.\n\nCritical problems demand drastic solutions. In saner countries, the state of our roads and other infrastructure would have elicited serious uproar and litigation. Nigerians are so used to poor governance that nothing moves them anymore. Surprisingly, the two chambers of the National Assembly rose in condemnation of these bad roads recently. The House of Representatives lamented that an estimated 6,000 kilometres of roads had been damaged by torrential rainfall across the country. The Senate asked the Federal Government to declare a state of emergency on federal roads and improve the funding for their maintenance. It urged the Federal Ministry of Finance to release adequate funds to the Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA) to enable it to carry out emergency repairs on all the federal roads. It had earlier urged the government to consider emergency intervention fund of N300 billion for critical roads in Niger State linking economic corridors in the North and South. Niger State\u2019s 2,263km of federal roads is the longest of the national federal road network of 36,000km.\n\nWe think that with the interest the National Assembly has shown in state of roads, it could go a step further by taking decisive measures to tackle the problem. At present, the National Assembly is working on the 2022 budget. We suggest that the federal lawmakers should look at appropriation for roads critically. The issue of paltry allocation should be dealt with. Where it is obvious that proposed allocation cannot do the job, the National Assembly could increase the budget sum or merge allocations. The National Assembly should also, in its oversight function, ensure that roads so awarded must not only be executed but also properly done.\n\nNo doubt, good roads ginger development. Hence, the Federal Ministry of Works must be alive to its responsibilities. It is obvious that the ministry cannot fully handle the rehabilitation of all the road networks in Nigeria. The Road Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme, an initiative of the Federal Government, is a noble idea. The scheme allows the private sector to construct roads in exchange for a tax credit. Through this scheme, Dangote Nigeria Plc did a good job on the Oshodi-Apapa Expressway in Lagos.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has promised to begin the rehabilitation of 16 roads in some parts of the country to the tune of N621 billion. This followed the recent suspension of the planned strike by the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG). NUPENG had, earlier this month, threatened that its tanker drivers would go on strike as a result of the deplorable state of the country\u2019s highways. But the management of the NNPC, after a meeting with NUPENG, resolved to rehabilitate some critical roads through the Road Infrastructure Tax Credit scheme. This is in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing and the Federal Inland Revenue Service. More of this partnership should be encouraged.\n\nAbove all, if we must make any appreciable progress in the area of road construction and rehabilitation, there must be a substantial increase in the allocation to the Ministry of Works and Housing. The ministry, on its part, must consider road rehabilitation a priority and allocate appreciable sum of its budget to it. After a road is completed, the Federal Government may consider erecting tollgate on it to generate income for its regular rehabilitation. As the Finance Minister, Ahmed, recently advocated, taking one or two projects at a time and completing it before going to the next one is the best thing to do.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "Wants Nigerians to celebrate gallantry of nation\u2019s troops\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has disclosed that peace has started to return to troubled areas which in the past faced terrorism and banditry attacks across the country.\n\nThis is just as the president emphasised the need for Nigerians to always celebrate with pride the exploits of the military to keep the nation united.\n\nPresident Buhari, who spoke at the State House, Abuja on Monday during the 2022 Armed Forces Remembrance Day emblem appeal launch, said the Nigerian Armed Forces have effectively applied themselves to countering all the attempts by the nation\u2019s enemies to disturb the country\u2019s peace.\n\nHe stressed that places that were hitherto inaccessible and deserted have now been occupied by citizens who have returned to their normal homes.\n\nAccording to him, the renewed onslaught on bandits in the North-west has resulted in the military daily receiving insurgents who are voluntarily laying down their arms.\n\n\u201dWe are not going to be satisfied until peace is finally restored to every inch of our land,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe president lauded the exploits of the Nigerian Armed Forces to maintain peace, unity and stability in the country, urging Nigerians to celebrate them as the pride of the country.\n\nPaying glowing tribute to veterans who devoted most of their active lives to securing the nation and the world, particularly those who paid the supreme sacrifice, President Buhari said: \u201cOur country\u2019s efforts at nationhood since independence have been challenged by civil strife, a civil war and much uprising and violent agitations.\n\n\u201dHowever, in spite of all these, the country has remained united and the resolve of the citizens for unity remains unshaken.\n\n\u201dThe exploits of our Armed Forces to maintain peace as well as their disposition to the unity of Nigeria have contributed in no small measure to our stability.\n\n\u201dWe must therefore celebrate them as the pride of our country. Our faith in our Armed Forces remains unshaken and as a government we will do all within our powers to ensure that our Armed Forces are motivated to perform optimally.\n\n\u201dThey have time and again demonstrated unparalleled patriotism, courage, loyalty and commitment as they grapple with the daunting challenges of defending Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari described the emblem as a sign of the sacrifices and blood shed by officers and men of the Armed Forces for peace and security of Nigeria.\n\n\u201dIt is also a sign of our resolve to remain united as a nation and confront any challenges we may face. It is a sign of our resolve to say no to divisions and embrace one another as a united indivisible country,\u201d he added.\n\nThe president called on all Nigerians to make generous donations to the Nigerian Legion, support the widows and orphans of the fallen heroes, procure the emblems and wear them with pride.\n\n\u201cThe same call goes to all visitors and friends of Nigeria as well as corporate bodies operating in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the Nigerian Legion, the president noted that the need to maintain the comradeship that existed during the service among officers and men of the Armed Forces led to its establishment through an Act of the National Assembly.\n\nHe commended the Nigerian Legion for living up to its mandate of catering for the welfare of ex-servicemen and those that distinguished themselves in the wars Nigeria participated in.\n\nThe president stated that the veterans\u2019 organisation has remained a veritable pool of abundant and diverse human resources.\n\n\u201dI have the pleasure to acknowledge the contributions of retired officers and men of the Nigerian Armed Forces to the ongoing war on insurgency.\n\n\u201dThe government will continue to welcome these vital contributions. I charge the Ministry of Defence to continue to promote the engagement of our retired officers and men in seeking avenues of contributing to our national affairs.\n\n\u201dI am glad to note that the Nigerian veterans have contributed to the socioeconomic development of our country through engagement in productive ventures thereby generating employment opportunities for themselves and other Nigerians.\n\n\u201dThis is a further testimonial to the patriotism of these Nigerians. They have demonstrated abiding faith in Nigeria and its development. We sincerely commend them and all Nigerians who have continued to believe in Nigeria by making it their investment destination,\u201d he said.\n\nSee Images\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says Nigeria first to launch digital currency in Africa\n\n*External reserves stand at over $40bn, says Emefiele\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Monday declared that with the introduction of digital currency by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is projected to rise by $29 billion in the next 10 years.\n\nHe also stressed for emphasis that Nigeria was the first country in Africa and one of the first in the world to introduce digital currency to her citizens.\n\nThis is just as the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, stated that Nigeria\u2019s \u2018strong\u2019 external reserves which is one of the best in Africa stands at over $40 billion.\n\nThe President, who spoke at the State House, Abuja at the official launch of Nigeria\u2019s Digital Currency, the eNaira, emphasised that apart from digital innovations, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) can foster economic growth through better economic activities.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cIndeed, some estimates indicate that the adoption of CBDC and its underlying technology, called blockchain, can increase Nigeria\u2019s GDP by US$29 billion over the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cCBDCs can also help increase remittances, foster cross border trade, improve financial inclusion, make Monetary Policy more effective, and enable the government to send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare programmes\u201d.\n\nWhile expressing delight to launch the Central Bank of Nigeria Digital Currency, called the eNaira, President Buhari added that \u201cwe have become the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world to introduce a Digital Currency to her citizens\u201d.\n\nThe President, who assured Nigerians of the safety and scalability of the CBDC system, said the journey to create a digital currency for Nigeria began sometime in 2017.\n\n\u201dWork intensified over the past several months with several brainstorming exercises, deployment of technical partners and advisers, collaboration with the Ministries of Communication and Digital Economy and its sister agencies like the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), integration of banking software across the country and painstaking tests to ensure the robustness, safety and scalability of the CBDC System, \u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari also explained why he approved the use of the digital currency saying\n\nin recent times, the use of physical cash in conducting business and making payments has been on the decline. This trend has been exacerbated by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resurgence of a new Digital Economy.\n\nAccording to him: \u201dAlongside these developments, businesses, households, and other economic agents have sought for new means of making payments in the new circumstances.\n\n\u201dThe absence of a swift and effective solution to these requirements, as well as fears that Central Banks\u2019 actions sometimes lead to hyperinflation created the space for non-government entities to establish new forms of \u201cprivate currencies\u201d that seemed to have gained popularity and acceptance across the world, including here in Nigeria.\n\n\u201dIn response to these developments, an overwhelming majority of Central Banks across the world have started to consider issuing digital currencies in order to cater for businesses and households seeking faster, safer, easier and cheaper means of payments.\n\n\u201dA handful of countries including China, Bahamas, and Cambodia have already issued their own CBDCs. A 2021 survey of Central Banks around the world by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that almost 90 per cent are actively researching the potential for CBDCs, 60 percent were experimenting with the technology and 14 per cent were deploying pilot projects.\n\n\u201dNeedless to add, close monitoring and close supervision will be necessary in the early stages of implementation to study the effect of eNaira on the economy as a whole.\n\n\u201dIt is on the basis of this that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sought and received my approval to explore issuing Nigeria\u2019s own Central Bank Digital Currency, named the eNaira,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President also attributed his approval of eNaira to the fact that the CBN has been a leading innovator \u2018\u2018in the form of money they produce, and in the payment services they deploy for efficient transactions.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe noted that Nigeria\u2019s apex bank has invested heavily in creating a Payment System that is ranked in the top ten in the world and certainly the best in Africa.\n\n\u201dThis payment system now provides high\u2010value and time\u2010critical payment services to financial institutions, and ultimately serves as the backbone for every electronic payment in Nigeria.\n\n\u201dThey have also supported several private\u2010sector initiatives to improve the existing payments landscape, and in turn, have created some of the world\u2019s leading payment service providers today,\u2019\u2019 President Buhari said.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele explained that eNaira is Nigeria\u2019s CBDC and it is the digital equivalent of the physical Naira.\n\nHis words: \u201dAs the tagline simply encapsulates, the eNaira is the same Naira with far more possibilities. The eNaira \u2013 like the physical Naira \u2013 is a legal tender in Nigeria and a liability of the CBN. The eNaira and Naira will have the same value and will always be exchanged at 1 naira to 1 eNaira\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, the CBN has given careful consideration to the entire payments and financial architecture and has designed the eNaira to complement and strengthen these ecosystems and has implemented secure safeguards and policies to maintain the integrity of the financial system.\n\nHe pledged that there would be strict adherence to the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards in order to preserve the integrity and stability of Nigeria\u2019s payment system.\n\nEmefiele stressed that since the eNaira platform went live, there has been overwhelming interest and encouraging response from Nigerians and other parties across the world with over 2.5 million daily visits to the website.\n\n\u201d33 banks are fully integrated and live on the platform, 500 million has been successfully minted by the Bank, N200 million has been issued to financial institutions, over 2,000 customers have been onboarded and over 120 merchants have successfully registered on the eNaira platform\u201d.\n\nHe also dispelled fears on the nation\u2019s foreign reserves, saying the reserves are strong and getting stronger by the day.\n\nHis words: \u201cAs custodians of your national reserves, let me first assure you that there is no cause for alarm. Our FX reserves are strong and indeed getting stronger by the day, crossing the 40 billion USD mark, and is one of the highest in Africa \u2013 and growing\u201d.\n\nThe CBN Governor further said: \u201dMr. President, as you make ground breaking reforms, there have been continuing debate on the true value of the Naira. Rather than worry today on the direction of the exchange rate, let us take a step back and analyze how we got here in the first place.\n\n\u201dPlease recall that since the advent of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) led Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) in 1986, and the introduction of the Second Tier Foreign Exchange (SFEM) market, the Naira has been on a one-way free fall from parity to the US Dollar in 1984 to over N410/USD today.\n\n\u201dSome 35 years later, we have not been able to achieve the many promises and objectives of that programme.\n\nInstead, what we have seen is widespread import dependency, which has wiped out most of our production and manufacturing bases and exported all our jobs in the process.\n\n\u201dWhat has happened to the massive textile factories across our nation such that we import almost all cotton products when we are rich in cotton?\n\n\u201dWhat has happened to our vehicle assembly plants across the nation such that we import most vehicles and have become a massive dumping ground for dying second-hand vehicles?\n\n\u201dWhat has happened to our rubber plantations through which we made the best tyres and rubber products in the world? What has happened to our groundnut pyramids? What has happened to our Cocoa farms? What has happened to our palm oil mills?\n\n\u201dUnder your leadership, Mr. President, we must stop this decline for good! We must return to massive homemade production; we must get our people working again. We must create the economic environment for massive domestic production and significant non-oil exports.\n\n\u201cBut we cannot fritter our reserves away on cheap imports and currency speculators. We must return to an employment-led growth anchored on productivity and rewarding producers of local goods, services, innovation and new technologies.\n\n\u201dIf you consume cheap imports and export our jobs, we will make you pay dearly; but if you produce locally \u2013 with little or no foreign inputs beyond machinery, we will support you, and the markets will reward you abundantly,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to all policies and actions of the CBN to support the economy especially through the trying times of COVID-19, Emefiele announced a new financial instrument titled \u201cThe 100 for 100 PPP \u2013 Policy on Production and Productivity\u201d, which will be anchored in the Development Finance Department under his direct supervision.\n\nHe explained that under this policy the CBN would advertise, screen, scrutinize and financially support 100 targeted private sector companies in 100 days, beginning from 01 November 2021, and rolling over every 100 days with new set of 100 companies, whose names will be published in National Dailies for Nigerians to verify and confirm.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

However, for business partners to get the 68-year-old billionaire to pay off the company's debts is apparently proving to be an embarrassing issue, with Nigeria\u2019s second richest man once again being haunted over unpaid debts.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, ConOil was pursued by creditors for a debt of over $140.5 million owed to two foreign companies and one local company.\n\n\n\nFresh litigation is now looming over millions of dollars owed by Conpurex.\n\n\n\nDepthwize, a drilling contractor based in Ibadan, the capital of Oyo State, says it is owed more than US$6,248,441.27 dollars ($6.2 million) by Conpurex, making it unable to pay its US partner Megadrill.\n\n\n\nWith the payment now more than 365 days overdue, Megadrill, has now hired New Orleans law firm, Jones Walker, to recover the funds from ConOil, SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\n\n\nA letter by Attorney John Duveilh to Erekata Julius, Chief Financial Officer at ConOil: \u201cIt is not the desire of Megadrill or Depthwize to produce a drawn-out legal battle, but rather simply get paid for work already performed and contractually owed. However, if Conpurex refuses to meet their contractual obligations, and the amount is not paid immediately, Megadrill will be forced to take appropriate actions.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe letter dated August 18, 2021, further stated that the company will notify the Nigerian oil industry regulator, other international firms such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and Glencore, looking to do business with Conpurex that the latter is subject to ongoing legal action.\n\n\n\nIt also mentioned that it will seek court orders to seize assets including corporate and private bank accounts.\n\nIt said lawsuits could be filed in England and Nigeria, adding that it will notify other international firms - among them ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, Vitol, Total Trading and Glencore - looking to do business in that jurisdiction that it is subject to ongoing legal action\n\nIt also said it would seek \u201cadditional USD (US dollars) funds for violation of the contractual terms for the wrongful payment of Naira when USD should have been paid\u201d and \u201cseek all legal basis from securing assets through appropriate bank accounts\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe Lagos headquarters of Depthwize also wrote to Conpurex to warn that the non-payment of its invoices is significantly hampering its operations, leaving it unable to renew the insurance cover on its assets.\n\n\n\nUche Dimiri, Depthwize\u2019s CEO, in the letter dated August 16 said: \u201cAs of today, we have a total of US$6,248,441.27 dollars due and unpaid ageing over 365 days.\n\n\n\n\u201cImportantly, and sadly so, as an organisation, we have been unable to renew the insurance cover on our operating assets because of a liquidity squeeze attributable in large parts to your non-payment of our invoices. We cannot overemphasize the negative impact this situation is having on our ongoing operations.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd in a further embarrassment to Adenuga, Megadrill and Depthwize are not alone in imploring ConOil to honour contracts.\n\n\n\nZukus Industries Limited, an oil and gas services contractor, has written to ConOil three times this year over outstanding invoices due from 2017 and 2018 totalling N317,750,268.09 (about $700, 000).\n\n\n\nChinye Uzor, Zukus\u2019s Managing Director, wrote to Sina Olinade, ConOil\u2019s Commercial Manager, in March, August, and September 2021.\n\nIts first letter of March 3, 2021, signed by Uzor and addressed to the Managing Director, Con Oil Producing Limited, is titled: \u2018Demand For Payment of Outstanding Invoices.\u2019\n\nIt read, \u201cOur letter dated 13th November with reference no: ZIL/WAR/093; 5th August 2019 with reference no: ZIL/WAR/093/19; mail of 30th May 2019; mail of 15th October 2019, letter dated 5th February 2020 with reference no: ZIL/WAR/1033/20 and several phone calls refers (Copies of letters attached as Appendices II-VI).\n\n\u201cWe write to request for payment of our outstanding invoices long overdue for payment from 13/12/2017 to 08/12/2018, totalling Three Hundred and Seventeen Million Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand, Two Hundred and Sixty-Eight Naira Nine Kobo (N317,750,268.09) only.\n\n\u201cWhen needed without failure, we have offered to your company; community settlements were promptly handled for speedy execution of jobs. The delay in prompt payment of these bills has had a tremendous effect on our operations. We are going through intense periods owing to our inability to meet up with creditors\u2019 indebtedness and bank loan repayment.\u201d\n\nZukus Industries Limited\u2019s second letter to ConOil in 2021 also stressed the need for the latter to pay its debt, adding that the \u201coutstanding covers the work done by Zukus Industries Limited for ConOil Producing Limited between 2017 and 2018, as far back as four years ago\u201d.\n\nIt said the job was handled professionally, adding that it is \u201cnow at a loss as to why payments of these monies owed to us are being withheld\u201d.\n\nIn the third and final demand, he told Mr Olinade: \u201cThis will be our third and final demand to ConOil Producing Limited for the full payment of our total outstanding of Three Hundred and Seventeen Million Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand, Two Hundred and Sixty-Eight Naira Nine Kobo (N317, 650, 268.09).\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added that in the event of non-payment: \u201cOur attempts to recover the funds will be broad in scope, which is why we must insist that our warning in this letter is taken with the utmost seriousness.\n\nLitigation Letters Aden Uga by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nWe expect payment to be made promptly.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe situation has become such a concern to Total that its CEO Mike Sangster wrote to Adenuga personally on March 22, 2021, to request a meeting. In it he spoke of discussing \u201chow we can take concrete steps to move our partnership towards success.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI would be happy to meet with you at your private office in person or if you would prefer, a virtual meeting could be arranged,\u201d Sangster had added.\n\nThe looming litigation comes amid a brewing crisis in Adenuga\u2019s business estates.\n\n\n\nIn September, Nigeria\u2019s tax authority FIRs sealed off the offices of ConOil at the Mid Adenuga Towers building over non-payment of taxes.\n\n\n\nThe government\u2019s Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has also reportedly placed a garnishee order on ConOil\u2019s bank accounts to the tune of US$30 million dollars.\n\n\n\nAdenuga\u2019s and ConOil\u2019s poor debt record is also affecting their attempts to expand their operations.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Chevron sold ConOil its 40 per cent stake in Oil Mining Licences (OMLs) 86 and 88, located in the Niger Delta basin. The company reportedly paid a US $250 million deposit for the assets.\n\n\n\nHowever, the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which owns the remaining 60 per cent stake in both blocks exercised its veto over the sale.\n\n\n\nAdenuga\u2019s relationship with the oil regulators and agencies was said to have been blighted by ConOil\u2019s poor performance as an operator in the oil and gas industry.\n\n\n\nSome sources in the industry said this is responsible for NNPC's rejection of ConOil\u2019s US $1.3 billion dollars offer for Shell\u2019s Oil Mining Licence (OML) in the western Niger Delta in 2011, preferring a substantially lower US $850 million offer from Heritage Oil.\n\nSee Also Sports How Otunba Mike Adenuga Impoverished Conoil Pensioners\n\nLittle has happened since then to restore the confidence of the regulators or international partners in ConOil and Adenuga.\n\n\n\nTwo of its assets, OML 150 and OML 153 in Delta State, which it acquired in 2007, have yet to produce a barrel of oil after 14 years ownership.\n\n\n\nThe company's Oil Prospecting 257 Asset (OPL), located 150km offshore in Nigeria, which it co-owns with Total, has failed to meet drilling requirements leading to the expiration of its 20-year licence.\n\n\n\nAlso, ConOil\u2019s OML 136 field off the Nigerian Cost, which Total has a 40 per cent stake in despite being in one of the largest gas fields in Nigeria, with proven reserves of 11 trillion cubic feet of gas, had yet to start production after 25 years of the asset being acquired.",

          "text": "Ayuba Wabba, president of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) says the system of managing assets in Nigeria is \u201crotten\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWabba said this on Monday at public hearing organised by the house of representatives committee on privatisation and commercialisation on the consideration of public assets reform bill, 2021.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Wabba said the NLC does not accept the philosophy that privatisation of government assets will render them more effective.\n\n\u201cWhen this concept of having privatisation as a policy of philosophy to say that it is actually the solution to all our infrastructural and economic problems, I think that is not correct,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf by now we have privatised 234 enterprises in Nigeria and we say it is to create wealth and address the issue of poverty and as we speak we are the poverty capital of the world, I think something is wrong with that policy.\n\n\u201cSo let\u2019s not come here and sugarcoat; let\u2019s call it the way it is and what it is. Let me share an experience. The issue of saying that GSM or telecommunication was privatised \u2014 let\u2019s correct the narrative. There was a GSM revolution around the world and we keyed in by trying to kill NITEL and if you go to Britain now, NITEL is still working. You can still use a landline to call. And in the process, Nigerians were exploited.\n\n\u201cWhen GSM came into Nigeria and you compare with other countries, we were exploited. So, that was not a process of privatisation. It was a process of allowing people to come in and invest in our economy and that was different from privatisation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe issue of ports, let me also make the issue very clearly. Yes, we privatised our ports and what the minister of power stated is correct. Who are the owners? Who privatised it? The same people that were anchoring privatisation. There were the same people that went behind and bought the ports. I can give you evidence if you want.\n\n\u201cIt is like taking our commonwealth, deprive every Nigerian and handing them to a few which is against the provision of the spirit of the constitution, particularly section 16 of the 1999 constitution.\n\n\u201cAs I speak, all privatisation processes have led to job loss. In most cases, their terminal benefits have not been paid. Until now, I can tell you that I have thousands of power sector workers that have not been paid.\u201d\n\nWabba, who said Nigeria should be more interested in businesses that will be managed by the government, added that the country should borrow a leaf from developed nations including the United Kingdom and Canada.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEthiopia is one good example. All the reforms are anchored around government facilities \u2014 the airways and the power sector. They went to the World Bank and IMF to borrow money. They told them \u2018no, you don\u2019t have the capacity\u2019. They (Ethiopia) taxed each Ethiopian and they were able to raise money over what they needed to build the power sector. Now, they have built the power sector, they are selling to neighbouring countries. Each family in Ethiopia has one member of their family employed in Ethiopian [Airlines],\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo, even our system is wrong; it\u2019s rotten. We should say so. Not to say that a public system cannot run effectively. That is the problem of Nigeria; that is the problem we are in. So, when making this law, don\u2019t concentrate our wealth in the hands of a few persons.\u201d",

          "title": "How Koa is helping Kenyans build and manage wealth",
          "text": "Despite being the third-largest economy in sub-Saharan Africa and East Africa\u2019s financial and commercial hub, Kenya has a savings rate of 12%, lowest in East Africa\u2014way below Africa\u2019s average of 17%.\n\nThere are many factors attributed to this low rate: high spending appetite among young Kenyans, high cost of living, especially in urban areas, and black tax. There\u2019s also a problem of cumbersome saving options and lack of proper financial education that exposes people to the importance of savings.\n\nThis is a big problem two pan-African tech operators Delila Kidanu and Alexis Roman are tackling through Koa, the digital saving platform they co-founded.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKoa founding story\n\nThe story of Koa can be traced back to MEST Africa as it\u2019s the first place the two co-founders met and worked. But the idea to start a company together hadn\u2019t been born yet. They were only heavily involved in MEST\u2019s mission, which is to incubate and help scale African entrepreneurs and startups, and were exposed to a lot of people and the process of building solutions for African problems.\n\nKidanu was born in Ethiopia, moved to Kenya as a child and lived there until she went to the UK to study international relations and business. She then moved to Sweden for a master\u2019s degree in innovation management and entrepreneurship. She proceeded to work with an NGO in Belgium to drive policies around global education before she moved back to Kenya to consult for international companies looking to set up shops in East Africa. After doing that for a while, she joined MEST Africa.\n\nRoman, on the other hand, was born in Paris but moved to Togo as a child where he stayed and schooled until he moved to Canada to study economics and finance. He started a business after school but later decided to go work in a traditional financial institution, which he called a mistake that came with lots of needed experience. He moved back to Africa to join MEST Africa in Ghana.\n\nAfter leaving MEST Africa, the duo forayed into different businesses but kept in touch and would always meet up whenever they were in the same city. Early 2020, they became colleagues again and started working as startup scouts for an early-fund venture capital, Microtraction.\n\nKoa co-founders\n\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time in Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya. Both Delila and I saw the popularity of digital saving products in Nigeria, like PiggyVest and Cowrywise, and how they were serving a real need for customers. But when we looked beyond Nigeria, as a market, we felt like there was a significant gap in other countries,\u201d Koa\u2019s CEO Roman told TechCabal.\n\nThey went ahead to speak to thousands of people in Kenya and discovered that 60% of the people relied on inefficient Informal Saving Groups and Cooperatives to save and access financial products. It became more obvious that lack of seamless saving option is another big factor aiding the problem. So they started deliberating about solving the problem the same way PiggyVest and Cowrywise are doing in Nigeria.\n\nIn December 2020, they finally founded Koa with Bubunyo Nyavor, their old colleague from MEST. The platform went into beta in April and was launched to the public in June.\n\nThe platform makes it easy for users to set personal saving goals towards a particular expenses like paying school fee, buying a new phones, cars or even marriage. The app nudge users\u2019 by sending them daily, weekly or monthly reminders to deposit into the goals they set. Koa also makes it easy for users to track their progress so that they won\u2019t slack or help them back on track when they do.\n\nKoa is playing in a tough market and so is investing heavily in educational content that exposes its users to the importance of savings, especially in creating generational wealth. So far, according to Kidanu, the platform has already passed a 12,000 users mark and has received a deposit of 11,105,315.30 KES ($100,000) since its launch.\n\nA few weeks ago, the company pitched at the TechCrunch battlefield as one of the only two African startups that made the cut and was the only African startup that made it to top-five. Both co-founders said it was a great learning curve for them and another validation that their product is essential in solving this real-life problem.\n\nIncentive: make more money while saving\n\nIt\u2019s not only difficult for Kenyans to save; the lack of access to formal financial products also made it hard to invest. So, Koa is killing two birds with one stone by holding its users\u2019 money in a money market through a partnership with Britam, an asset manager in the Kenyan market.\n\nOn Koa, users earn up to 10% interest on their money annually, depending on market conditions. They also earn interest daily, which is good because they see their money grow in real time. This strategy has helped to cement the gospel of building wealth through saving and passive investing.\n\n\u201cOur partner has different types of funds. For us, we needed to be able to tap into a lower risk investment so that we don\u2019t lose our customer base that is a bit more risk-averse. So we opted to work with Britam to invest in their money market fund,\u201d Kidanu said on why they choose such investment and the reality of their promised ROI.\n\nIn fintech, customer trust is key. Once you hack that, scaling becomes a lot less harder. It\u2019s evident in the way savings platforms like PiggyVest transparently communicate with their users and how much loyalty their users have for them. So are Koa users aware that their money is being invested in a money market?\n\n\u201cCustomer trust is very important to us, and we communicate with our customers in terms of where their money is, who our partner is, why we chose them, and how their fund flow works. We only make the investment passive because we want to ensure a seamless experience for our users who are new to this,\u201d Kidanu added.\n\nMaking money for a company whose major mission is to first help people who, before now, wouldn\u2019t even think of saving money and building wealth can be tricky because charging customers directly can end up driving them away. They don\u2019t think of the money they could make but the little that\u2019s being asked of them. So how does Koa make money as a business?\n\n\u201cWe make money when we get a commission from our asset management partner on funds invested. So we didn\u2019t want a situation where we\u2019d have to charge our customers directly for the service. We want them to enjoy the service for free,\u201d Roman said.\n\nThe founders said they\u2019ve raised a pre-seed institutional investment. On the back of the raised funds and their seed round, which closes soon, Kidanu and Roman also plan to scale fast and expand to neighbouring countries like Tanzania and Uganda that have the same saving problem.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "Baxi acquisition deal sees MFS Africa expand footprint into Nigeria",
          "text": "In a deal subject to approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria, MFS Africa has signed an agreement to acquire Capricorn Digital, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest digital solutions and distribution companies with a 90,000-strong agent network across the country, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nAs the largest fintech interoperability hub in Africa, MFS Africa connects banks, telcos, and money transfer operators across over 35 countries via a single integration point. Paga, MTN mobile money, Ecobank, and Safaricom are among the operators integrated on the hub, with an estimated 320 million mobile money customers interacting across various digital wallets without transaction fees associated with switching platforms.\n\nCapricorn, under its SME-focused brand, Baxi, operates an ecosystem of digital payment services. Its solution is built to help Nigerians with everyday payment needs; including utility bill payments, airtime purchases, pay-TV and data subscriptions, withdrawals, and money transfers. The company delivers these services through its retail network of agents and merchants in some of the remotest locations across Nigeria, and via its BaxiBox POS, BaxiPay, Baxi MPoS Device, and BaxiRIMS products.\n\nThe 100% cash acquisition, MFS Africa\u2019s third in five years, sees the pan-African payments giant expand into Africa\u2019s largest economy, where its presence to date has been limited given the country\u2019s small number of mobile wallets. Capricorn will be called MFS Africa but its core product, Baxi, retains its name.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBoth parties declined to disclose the value of the deal but on a call with TechCabal, Capricorn Founder and CEO, Degbola Abudu, said the deal is the second-largest of its kind in Nigeria\u2019s fintech space, behind the $200 million Stripe paid for Paystack last year.\n\nMFS Africa was founded in 2009 by Dare Okoudjou, a Beninese national, while Nigeria-born Abudu started Capricorn in 2014, with Folu Majekodunmi. The acquisition creates a larger, more versatile company that fuses interoperability between money operators and a super-agent network reaching the mass market.\n\nA pan-African march\n\nMFS Africa\u2019s big vision is to have a presence in all 54 African countries, serving 500 million people and millions of small businesses, according to Okoudjou.\n\n\u201cIf you have a phone or POS, it should be enough to transact with the rest of Africa and the world,\u201d he tells TechCabal. \u201cWe\u2019re building the foremost, currency-agnostic, real-time hub for payments on the continent, to enable people transfer money the way they can call each other.\u201d\n\nOften, MFS Africa\u2019s continental expansion plan has involved partnering with money operators and making minority investments in other fintech companies across Africa, as in the case of Julaya, Maviance, and Numida.\n\nHowever, Okoudjou explains that the company opts for full acquisition when both parties consider that more effective for achieving their shared long-term ambitions.\n\nDare Okoudjou, MFS Africa founder and CEO (left) and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Baxi.\n\nWhy an acquisition?\n\nSimilar to Beyonic, a Ugandan fintech startup MFS Africa bought in June 2020 also for an undisclosed amount, acquisition talks with Capricorn evolved from a minority investment to a full buyout.\n\n\u201cThe more we spoke with Dee, the more we realised what we could achieve with a full acquisition instead of being only investors in which case there could be misaligned incentives.\u201d\n\nOkoudjou further explains that the need to \u201cbolster our presence in Nigeria\u201d given its unique market features\u2014the prevalence of offline payment touchpoints over mobile-first transactions\u2014drove MFS Africa\u2019s interest in Capricorn.\n\n\u201cIn other markets, one or two partnerships with mobile money operators could see us reach 60% of digital payment users in the country,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, mobile money isn\u2019t that widely adopted in Nigeria. Instead, agent networks such as Capricorn\u2019s have grown rapidly.\u201d\n\nWhile MFS Africa can service SMEs online through Beyonic, for instance, Baxi enables the company to reach offline merchants in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nFor Abudu, the future of the mobile payments landscape in Africa is a game of few, where consolidation is the way forward, and attempting to scale alone would require more capital expenditure and a longer time to execute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to partner with a company that brings a real pan-African presence and we see synergies across our operations. They offer a wide range of value-added products and services like cross-border payments while we have access to SMEs in Nigeria, one of the biggest markets in Africa,\u201d he says. \u201cWe believe that we\u2019ve barely scratched the market\u2019s potential. The deal brings many things that allow us to grow very quickly.\u201d\n\nFollowing the acquisition\u2019s close, MFS Africa will build Baxi into a key node on its digital payment network, allowing customers to make cross-border payments to and from Nigeria, similar to what it\u2019s done with mobile money operators across Africa. MFS Africa will also expand Baxi\u2019s proposition for offline SMEs to select markets within its footprint.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to build a large business with relatively small capital but now we want to be able to compete, not just in Nigeria but also across Africa,\u201d Abudu says. \u201cThe deal with MFS Africa gives us leverage to take Baxi and the model that\u2019s been so successful in Nigeria to other African countries.\u201d\n\nMFS Africa plans to engage with Nigeria\u2019s central bank and other regulators to seek any other additional licenses needed to operate its full-service offerings\u2014such as remittance, micro-lending, insurance\u2014while also exploring commercial partnerships in the country.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Editi Effiong: father, writer, producer and tech bro",
          "text": "Editi Effiong\u2019s genius is quiet yet obvious at the same time. He\u2019s a multifaceted creator, builder and thinker\u2014unafraid to tackle the impossible without doubt. From setting up Anakle, a Nigeria-based digital marketing agency, 10 years ago to transitioning into film-making a few years later, Editi has established himself as one of the leading entrepreneurs of his generation. When asked how he would define himself, he responded with, \u201cI\u2019m a father, writer, producer, and tech bro.\n\nThe big picture: Editi Effiong is not your average guy\n\nMany people know Editi Effiong as the brains behind Anakle. Some others might know him for the films he made through his production company, Anakle Films or might have stumbled across him after his involvement in the post-#ENDSARS judicial hearing panel in 2020. Editi attended and documented the daily proceedings, sharing videos, photos and commentaries on his Twitter page. His dedication to reporting on how Lagos State investigated the unforgettable event that took place on October 20 last year, garnered him respect, admiration and a flock of new followers and cheerleaders.\n\nAnakle Films\u2019 theatrical releases, Up North and The Setup, were acquired by Netflix in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Up North, which was based on a story written by Editi, is best described as one of Nollywood\u2019s most adventurous films. Up North did two things successfully: It brought some versatility to Nollywood, Nigeria\u2019s behemoth movie industry; and heralded the arrival of a different Editi. He was no longer just the CEO of a well-respected digital agency with a client list that most marketing agencies would love to get their hands on\u2014Wikipedia, Flutterwave, Glo, to name a few\u2014he was now a film producer and writer who took his craft seriously.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi at a filming location in Northern Nigeria\n\nThe Set Up pulled us in a different direction. In this film, there are no adventures or lush, green fields. But there\u2019s suspense and the dirty underworld of crime. Anakle Films distributed The Set Up with legendary film-maker, Niyi Akinmolayan, sitting on the director\u2019s chair.\n\nEditi displayed his writing chops in his most recent short film, Fishbone, released in May 2020. Fishbone, written and directed by Effiong himself, unearths the terrifying business of counterfeit drugs and how it strips our society of its ability to show love and compassion. Fishbone is a deliberately revealing film; it shows us snapshots of Effiong\u2019s mind and showcases his directorial ingenuity.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with TechCabal, Editi opens up about his childhood, the complexity that is his mind, building Anakle, being a father, and his decision to become a full-time film-maker and writer.\n\nAnakle and the race to get businesses online\n\nEven though Editi is eager to hand over the CEO reins to Anakle\u2019s COO, Munachi \u201cMuna\u201d Nwoke-Ekpo, and purposefully step into his role as founder and CEO of Anakle Films, I was compelled to kick off the interview with questions about Anakle\u2019s beginnings.\n\nIn 2011, digital marketing didn\u2019t have as much clout as it does now. It is hard to imagine a world that didn\u2019t exist with numerous digital and social media platforms. Our current economic climate demands that entrepreneurs move their businesses online and acquire a new crop of customers who are obsessed with social media and consumer technology. In conversation, Editi is a masterful storyteller who uses transparency and humour to pull his listeners in. At no point during our chat did he leave me feeling confused or unimpressed.\n\nKoromone Koroye: What inspired you to start Anakle? What did you see and understand about digital marketing that most people didn\u2019t back in 2011?\n\nEditi Effiong: Back in 2011, we had a slide that predicted that internet penetration would deepen in five years. We also predicted that more than five million Nigerians would be on the internet and that that number would eventually rise to 30 million by 2016. Back then, mobile penetration wasn\u2019t that great and Blackberry phones were still a thing. My business partner, Abass, would charge business owners \u20a650,000 to help them run digital marketing campaigns. And that 50K came with a money-back guarantee: if we weren\u2019t able to successfully promote their brands, they got their money back without any hassles. I mean, how on earth does someone believe that the internet can help you sell more? But we saw that there was a market online and we bet big on what we saw.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: According to the Digital 2021 report, there were an estimated 104 million internet users in Nigeria in January this year. Additionally, internet penetration stood at 50% and 33 million Nigerians with active social media accounts, within that same period.\n\nDo you remember Anakle\u2019s first major campaign?\n\nEditi: In 2010, we ran Interswitch\u2019s first digital campaign. We did this whole flash animation video to push Interswitch\u2019s anti-fraud campaign. I designed the flash. In the early stages of Anakle\u2019s business, I was in charge of execution and Abass handled business operations. So, in this flash animated campaign, if someone emails you for your password or PIN, you don\u2019t give them because Interswitch would never ask you for your PIN or personal information. It was a really great campaign at that time. I mean now, we might take a simple campaign like that for granted; but 12 years ago, building and executing a campaign like that was a phenomenal experience for us and the brands we served during that period.\n\nHow did businesses relate with social media back when Anakle started out?\n\nEditi: \u200b\u200bThe first bank to get on social media was GTB (Guaranty Trust Bank) followed by Diamond Bank. We worked on a project with them and they had their brand assets burned onto a CD. Yes, CDs were a thing back then. But, anyway, they opted for the CD route because they didn\u2019t want anyone to distribute their assets to other sources or agencies. So I picked up Diamond Bank\u2019s CD on a Tuesday and started working on it straight till Thursday. And Thursday happened to be my wedding day.\n\nWoah. You did client work on your wedding day?\n\nEditi: Yes! I was out in the foyer of the hotel room working on this project until I got called into the hall to say my vows and, you know, get married. So I put down my laptop, you know, went and got married and came back and continued working even through my honeymoon. And to think that this was only the second bank that we helped build a Facebook app and get them on social media. Diamond Bank was the second bank in Nigeria to go down the digital marketing route.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, there was a huge opportunity to help businesses get online. And one of the things Anakle was trying to do was help smaller businesses improve brand visibility by getting them acquainted with the internet. We didn\u2019t just target the big brands and enterprise businesses, especially in the beginning. Anakle saw the future of digital marketing and built a business out of it. Our mission was to help businesses grow into the online space, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nAt what point did you realise that Anakle had fulfilled its mission, or at least a part of it?\n\nEditi: There have been many moments. In 2017 we did a very successful campaign with Wikipedia. And that campaign was a forerunner to what became Anakle films. That campaign counted as a major milestone for us. There\u2019s also the part we played in hiring and training people who were new to the digital marketing space. For most of them, Anakle was their first job out of school, and now, most of them are running their own successful companies and projects. You know, making money and growing a company are necessary targets, but I\u2019ve always been more excited about mentoring people and helping them grow in the industry and become better versions of themselves even outside of the work they do at Anakle or anywhere else.\n\nIf our business no longer inspired the people who walked through its doors, then we have failed at our mission. So I get really excited when I see consistent growth in the people who walk through our doors; they come in, grow and become more than they thought they could be before they joined the company.\n\nWhat were Anakle\u2019s hiring values in the beginning? And did those values change after the business grew and garnered success?\n\nEditi: We were looking for people who had the \u2018Anakle spirit\u2019, which is a certain level of fearlessness. We wanted people who could work without fear. I didn\u2019t care too much about CVs and cover letters. We were looking for people who could challenge us; people who could look at the universe as it is and ultimately try to bend it. Because when people are able to challenge the status quo and say, \u201cI can take that on\u201d, then they can create a fire campaign for Sterling Bank or any other enterprise client.\n\nEditi Effiong\n\nHow did you delight Anakle\u2019s early employees?\n\nEditi: I\u2019ll be honest: Back then, we couldn\u2019t compete with Nigerian banks and their salary offerings and other benefits. so we ended up designing a workplace that was exciting. We wanted young people to feel excited about working for us and working out of our office. The Anakle office became our recruitment tool and it was so inspiring to hear people say they wanted to work with us, especially after visiting our office.\n\nNew beginnings: Anakle Films and the road to becoming a director, screenwriter, and producer\n\nKoromone: Moving swiftly along from building Anakle to setting up Anakle films\u2014\n\nEditi: Thank God!\n\nWhen did you know you were ready to make the move?\n\nEditi: Money! I had the money to make that leap of faith into Anakle Films.\n\nSo, how did it feel making that transition from running Anakle to leading the charge at Anakle films? Especially knowing that you were going to put a lot of time and effort into building out Anakle Films\u2019 brand?\n\nEditi: I think the biggest factor there is having a team that can do its job\u2014big props to Munachi. If you\u2019ve never heard of Muna, he\u2019s the best COO in the business. He\u2019s quiet but hard-working and has been with me for 11 years. Muna has done an amazing job at running the business at a group level, and having him around has been extremely helpful and instrumental. I recently received and turned down a global leadership position at a global company\u2014a fantastic offer with great pay\u2014but I turned it down because I wanted the freedom to wake up and do what I love doing or to not do something I hate doing. There\u2019s a madness to having that freedom that works for me. And I think I owe a lot of that to Muna. He gave me the courage to step out of Anakle.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi directing a film at a location in Nigeria\n\nTell us about your history and relationship with writing\n\nEditi: This isn\u2019t common knowledge, but I didn\u2019t start writing today. I\u2019ve been writing my entire life. I was also an avid reader when I was younger. My father studied literature and linguistics, so there were a lot of books around the house. I write almost every day and have written almost every day for my entire life. And when I cannot put into words things I want to say, I end up writing them down. I have hardly ever gotten in trouble for writing because I\u2019m able to articulate my thoughts without ambiguity. Wow! I just used a big word.\n\nMy move to Anakle Films is my way of preparing for retirement. I want to retire as a writer. My entire life is run by writing and this is the direction it is headed now. Anakle Films is my excuse to write; it gives me a reason to write, create and build something from the ground up. As you can imagine, there\u2019s a lot of craziness and madness around the work, but I love it.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Ambiguity is a situation or statement that is unclear because it can be understood in more than one way. [Source: Cambridge dictionary]\n\nEditi on documenting justice for #EndSars victims and survivors and finding his voice again\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: A few months after the #ENDSARS massacre, Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu set up a nine-person Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate allegations of police brutality perpetuated by the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Lagos State. This part of my conversation with Editi struck a raw nerve for the both of us, especially for Editi who had to restrain his emotions while he answered my questions. I think it takes a lot of courage to document the truth in the midst of pain and grief.\n\nKoromone: Let\u2019s pivot and talk about 2020. How did you find yourself involved in the #EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry that sat in Lagos? A number of people don\u2019t know this, but you were shooting a film during that period.\n\nEditi: Yes, I was. When I couldn\u2019t attend sessions, I was on set. When I was a kid, I used to stutter. And, you know, I managed it through my teenage years until it went away. After October 2020, my stutter returned. I stutter a lot these days, especially when I\u2019m dealing with difficult situations. So if you pay attention when I speak, you will hear how slow and deliberate I am with my words. I speak slowly to avoid stuttering, and everytime I think about what went down during #EndSars, it messes up my speech.\n\nThe night of the shootings, I could hear the gunshots. And I was going to drive out there because our people were bleeding and needed help, but my wife said, \u201cNo, you cannot go. It is too dangerous.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t go, and that night, I couldn\u2019t speak at all. For hours, I could not say a word. Anytime I tried to say a word, something came up from inside me and blocked off my speech. And since then, I\u2019ve been managing a very bad stutter that comes and goes\u2014but mostly only comes when I\u2019m dealing with difficult subjects. And in the days following October 20, I felt nothing but numbness. Going to those panel sessions was kind of a metaphor for trying to find my voice again.\n\nFor a few weeks following the shootings, I couldn\u2019t speak properly, and writing about the sessions was my way of speaking and reconnecting with the voice I had lost.\n\nShare this article\n\nKoromone Koroye | Author",

          "text": "Like most Nigerian workers, Kola*, at his former job, used to be paid his salary in the country\u2019s official currency: the naira\u2014until he started working at a fintech company registered outside Nigeria. Now he gets paid in USD Coin (USDC), a Stablecoin tethered to the US dollar. With this switch in his salary\u2019s currency, Kola was offered a juicy opportunity to exit a quagmire many young Nigerians find themselves in: they make more money than their parents did but in a currency that has fallen so low their paycheck doesn\u2019t reflect in their purchasing power.\n\nNigeria, like many African countries, grapples with currency risk. Back in 2015, its current president, Muhammadu Buhari, campaigned on a promise to increase the value of the naira. But since the start of his presidency, the country\u2019s currency has plunged badly because demand for the dollar continues to outstrip supply. This plunge in the value of the naira has been majorly fueled by Nigeria importing more goods than it exports. With declining oil prices forcing the Nigerian government to devalue its official currency twice in the past year, and by roughly 35% over the past five years, the resultant inflation has thrown over 7 million people into poverty in 2020 alone, according to the World Bank.\n\nSince saving in naira is a dead plan, more Nigerians now save their earnings in foreign currencies. Data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) revealed that Nigeria had a total domiciliary account balance of \u20a66.566 trillion as of March 2021, and when this figure is converted to dollars at the official rate of \u20a6410 per dollar, it translates to about $16 billion.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nVolatile naira drives Nigerians to digital currencies\n\nNigeria\u2019s weak currency has pushed its citizens into saving their money in foreign currencies, for wealth and value preservation. But even this is in limbo because uncertainties rule the country\u2019s financial regulatory climate. Nigeria\u2019s CBN has a long history of clamping down on individuals, groups and companies it suspects of being responsible for the slump in the value of the naira. Out of nowhere, the CBN banned the sale of foreign currencies to bureau de change operators\u2014also called the parallel or black market\u2014in the country, accusing them of creating an artificial foreign exchange scarcity. It also threatened to go after abokiFX, a website that collates the black market foreign exchange rates daily, asserting that there is only one acceptable exchange rate: the Investors\u2019 and Exporters\u2019 FX Window.\n\nThis has made a lot of people apprehensive, especially those with funds in their domiciliary accounts. Their fears were heightened after Ibrahim Obanikoro, a member of parliament, suggested in a tweet that the CBN close all domiciliary accounts for the next year.\n\nIn addition to saving in foreign currencies, Nigerians have turned to cryptocurrencies\u2014digital currencies that are out of the reach of federal government control.\n\nThis newfound hunger for cryptocurrency has seen Nigeria emerge as the leading country, per capita, for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption in the world, according to a report by Statista\u2014despite government crackdown. In fact, the African continent has been the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency in the world. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 billion worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. For context, sub-Saharan Africa received an estimated $48 billion worth of remittances in 2019, about half of which went to Nigeria, according to a Brookings Institute study. Between July 2019 and June 2020, the volume of cryptocurrencies sent to Africa from outside the continent was the highest of all regions Chainalysis studied. With 96% of the crypto value coming from outside the continent, this suggests that more Africans are receiving remittances via crypto.\n\nDigital money is the future of finance\n\nIn February this year, the CBN placed a ban on cryptocurrency in the country when it directed banks to close the accounts of persons or entities involved in cryptocurrency transactions. At the time, the Nigerian apex bank claimed that cryptocurrencies and digital currencies were largely used in terrorism financing and money laundering, citing the anonymity of their transactions.\n\nBut months after that, the government, seeing it couldn\u2019t quench the fire of cryptocurrency in the country, bet on digital money as the future by launching a central bank digital currency (CBDCs) named eNaira and nicknamed \u201cProject Giant\u201d.\n\nDigital money like cryptocurrencies, CBDCs and Stablecoins will play a significant role in the future of financial services. Cryptocurrency is gaining worldwide acceptance; Stablecoin, a peculiar type of cryptocurrency, has been labelled the \u201cfuture of money\u201d by the Harvard Business Review; and all these are in direct competition with CBDCs.\n\nRest of World reported on how Stablecoins have found a use case in volatile markets like Nigeria, where CBN\u2019s regulations force Nigerians to spend limited amounts of US dollars via their dollar cards each month. In order to bypass this limitation, Nigerians have switched to using Stablecoins to make their payments.\n\nStablecoins, such as the Tether (USDT), Binance USD (BUSD) and USD Coin (USDC) are a form of cryptocurrency pegged to a traditional asset like the US dollar or gold. In sub-Saharan Africa, Stablecoin remittances can be up to 20 times cheaper than traditional money transfers. USDT and USDC transfer fees are often as low as 0\u20131%. Paxful, a leading cryptocurrency trading platform in the country, declares that 1.5 million Nigerian users, representing about 5% of the platform\u2019s trading volume, use USDT, the most popular Stablecoin.\n\nThere is a growing adoption of Stablecoins like $DAI, $USDT, $BUSD and $USDC in Nigeria. Unlike such cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are notorious for their volatility, Stablecoin, like CBDCs, is a non-interest coin. Stablecoins have seen rapid growth this year, with USDC, the second-largest Stablecoin in the world, reaching a market capitalisation of over $30 billion.\n\nSalary alert\u2026but in crypto\n\nJust like Olaf Carlson-Wee, Coinbase\u2019s first employee who was paid entirely in Bitcoin, as far back as 2013, for three years, Nigerians also want to be paid in crypto.\n\nEarlier this year, in July, Timi Ajiboye, CEO and CTO of Helicarrier (formerly Buycoins), announced that the company\u2019s employees would now be paid in USDC. Twitter went agog, with many presenting themselves to Ajiboye for employment at his company.\n\nIn a process Kola describes as \u201cseamless\u201d when he receives his salary in USDC, he converts to naira only the amount he plans to spend for the week. \u201cI don\u2019t withdraw my full salary at once because you never know what the exchange rate will be tomorrow. So, even if waiting would add \u20a6500 to my salary, I\u2019d rather wait than withdraw all at once and have the naira in my account drop in value between when I withdraw it and when I spend it.\u201d\n\nKola says he can convert his crypto, using his company\u2019s product, a cryptocurrency trading app, within two hours. He is unbothered by persistent news around the steady drop of the naira. He isn\u2019t completely insulated from the naira crash, though, as a Nigerian living in Nigeria. But, he notes: \u201cAt least my salary\u2019s value isn\u2019t dropping as fast as it would have if I was earning in naira.\u201d\n\nA colleague of Kola\u2019s, Deji*, who receives his base pay and benefits in USDC as well, reveals that all employees were kept in the loop right from when the company decided that that was the route it would take regarding employee compensation. As a fintech company, there was no need to convince anyone on the team about how Stablecoins would protect them from the steady fall of the naira.\n\nThe problem with crypto-salaries\n\nAt Kola\u2019s company, individual contract staff, who make up a majority of its workers, are responsible for remitting their taxes. To help the employee with this process, an internal document containing information on tax and pension calculations and payments has been circulated around the company. This is the company battling the challenge that comes with paying employees in crypto, as legal barriers in many countries prevent this. Some of the barriers include the non-recognition of cryptocurrency as a legal tender and the challenge of calculating taxes when employees are paid in cryptocurrency.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019s still risky to pay employees in crypto in the US because the currency is recognised by the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) as a property and not a legal tender. A piece of legislation, the Fair Labour Standards Act\u2014a major custodian of employee rights\u2014backs this position. The act states that employees must be paid in \u201ccash or negotiable instrument payable at par\u201d.\n\nWhile legal systems around the world need more time to develop regulations that cater for crypto adoption, US-based Coinbase announced last week that it is launching a new direct deposit service, \u201cGet paid in crypto,\u201d that will let nearly anyone in the US receive all or part of their wages in cryptocurrencies. There are high hopes for the success of this rollout because if even a fraction of Coinbase\u2019s millions of US customers sign up, the service will contribute, in no small way, to making crypto mainstream in the broader American workforce.\n\nSome countries are already making progress with creating laws that define the payment of workers in cryptocurrency. For example, since 2019, New Zealand has made it legal to receive salaries in cryptocurrency and be taxed accordingly.\n\nBut in Nigeria, paying employees in crypto remains illegal. Nigeria\u2019s primary legislation on the relationship between an employer and employees, the Nigerian Labour Act\u2014established in 2004\u2014renders any contract where part or all of a worker\u2019s wages is made payable in another manner apart from legal tender illegal, null and void.\n\nDespite these legal constraints, Nigerian employers in technology startups continue to make smart moves to create value for their employees and the move towards remunerating employees in crypto is one that\u2019s unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\n*Names have been changed.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nSultan Quadri | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter postponing the October 1, 2021 launch of the eNaira \u2014 Africa\u2019s first digital currency \u2014 the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has announced in a press statement that the eNaira will launch today, Monday, October 25, 2021.\n\nAccording to the press statement, signed by Osita Nwanisobi, Director, Corporate Communications CBN, the eNaira will be unveiled formally by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja.\n\nIt adds that the launch marks the first step of the eNaira journey. It will continue with a series of \u201cfurther modifications, capabilities and enhancements to the platforms.\u201d\n\nThe CBN has also released a design paper that reiterates the importance of the eNaira and gives a bit more information about the design, benefits, and how the currency will work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBenefits, risks, and features of the eNaira.\n\nAccording to the design paper, one of the benefits of the eNaira is the possibility of direct welfare disbursement to citizens.\n\nIt says the COVID-19 pandemic has pointed out the lapses in the distribution of welfare incentives, and the eNaira will provide \u201ca clear means for the government to send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare programs.\u201d\n\nIt also highlights cross-border transactions as a benefit, saying the eNaira \u201cgives Nigeria the ability to transact separately, thereby reducing the demand for correspondent banking services and SWIFT international financial messaging and payment systems for the clearing and settlement of trade.\u201d\n\nThe Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, SWIFT, is a payment network that receives and sends electronic payments internationally.\n\nSWIFT transactions are expensive and take between one and four days to complete. The design paper says that the eNaira will speed up cross-border payments but doesn\u2019t state how fast it will be.\n\nThis will be possible because of the eNaira\u2019s interoperability, one of the design elements mentioned in the design paper. This means it can work with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) from other countries, making it useful outside the country and enabling easy cross-border payments.\n\nHowever, only five countries \u2014 The Bahamas, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Lucia, and Grenada \u2014 have fully launched a CBDC according to Atlantic Council\u2019s CBDC tracker.\n\nIn terms of data and privacy protection, the paper says users can determine how their data is used and shared. However, the currency is designed according to Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) guidelines. This means data rights might not apply all the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a recent article, we explored how private or permissioned blockchains, such as the Hyperledger Fabric being used by the CBN, work and the amount of control it gives it. We pointed out that it provides total and direct control over the eNaira.\n\nInterestingly, the CBN highlights the risks associated with using the eNaira, admitting that the complexity of the new system could lead to further financial exclusion.\n\nIn response, the CBN designed the eNaira to work on mobile phones that are not Internet-enabled. It will also put in place sensitisation campaigns to acquaint users with the eNaira.\n\nThe apex bank also admits that the effect this new financial system will have on existing systems is unknown. It will address the risk by putting in place a governance structure that will \u201ccontinuously evaluate the risk and exposures of the eNaira to the current payment system.\u201d\n\nThe CBN expressed cybersecurity concerns about the eNaira, noting that while blockchain technology might be considered somewhat unhackable, there have been cases of hacks.\n\nOne such case was the $150 million hack of crypto exchange KuCoin in September 2020. However, such hacks make the dangers of centralisation in the blockchain space glaring.\n\nAccording to CDOTrends, Dyma Budorin, CEO of Hacken Group, a blockchain cybersecurity firm, suggests that the hack could have been a social engineering attack on employees of the exchange with access to the private keys.\n\nThe eNaira runs on a private blockchain and is, thus, centralised. This means that if vital information were to leak, the entire eNaira architecture could be compromised.\n\nHowever, the CBN says IT security assessment will be conducted regularly to secure the eNaira infrastructure from any vulnerabilities.\n\nMeanwhile, the eNaira website indicates that the speed wallet app that will facilitate eNaira transactions is available for download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

From the somewhat logical to the superstitious, these reasons try to explain why people stutter.\n\nOn the African continent, for instance, some myths include wrong foods eaten by the mother in pregnancy, standing in front of a mirror, dog bites, tickling the baby too much, among others.\n\nAs funny as these myths seem, suggested remedies are even more hilarious, from standing in front of a mirror and speaking to oneself, to eating a fruit pecked by a bird, and maintaining correct posture, to mention a few.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut science blows these myths out of the water\n\nAccording to DoSomething.org, stuttering (or stammering, if you will) is a speech disorder that breaks up a speaker\u2019s flow of speech. A biological and neurological condition, it is caused by one or more of four possible triggers, the first being genetics, and the others, child development, the make-up of the brain, and family dynamics.\n\nBut how has technology helped stutterers?

          "title": "IHS Towers: How a bad bet on GSM became a $7bn company",
          "text": "Issam Darwish, the founder/CEO of IHS Towers, was all smiles following the successful listing of his company on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, October 14, but it was not always that way.\n\nHe could hardly have summoned the same smile in 1999 when his first bet on Nigeria\u2019s telecoms sector fell through.\n\nCelia Motophone Limited, a communications company he was brought from Lebanon to lead as deputy managing director at the time, was among the companies granted licences to provide GSM network services in Nigeria by General Abdulsalam Abubakar, the then Military Head of State who was pushing to deregulate the Nigerian telecoms sector.\n\nOut of the six companies that got the licences, only Motophone and Communications Investment Limited (CIL) were firmly on the ground. Both were however unable to secure the needed interconnection with NITEL, the only national gateway carrier. Motophone also had an image problem: it was connected to the Gilbert Chagouri family that was very close to the late military dictator, General Sani Abacha.\n\nIt was not a surprise then when President Olusegun Obasanjo, who led the democratic dispensation in Nigeria from 1999, described the licensing exercise as fraudulent, revoked the licences, and introduced the telecommunication policy that empowered the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to reorganise, auction, and issue fresh licences to successful companies.\n\nDarwish, 27 years old at the time, and his company Motophone were again shortlisted among the seven contenders for the new licensing regime. The other contenders were United Telesys, Reliance Telecoms, CIL, MTS, NITEL, and MTN. Motophone was eventually disqualified after a series of court orders and allegations by NCC that the company may have manipulated its way to the first licence. The NCC removed the rights of Motophone before the auction. Eventually, five companies were shortlisted for the four GSM licences.\n\nRead Also: IHS bucks trend, opts for sole listing in New York\n\nDown on his luck but undaunted, the young Lebanese entrepreneur decided to place his bet in a different segment of the nascent telecoms industry \u2013 building and operating towers.\n\nThat new bet proved to be genius. By listing on the New York Stock Exchange in chase of a valuation of $7 billion, IHS Towers has not only become the largest tower company in Africa it is also now more valuable than MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa both of which got the GSM licences.\n\nThe making of IHS Towers\n\nPrior to the emergence of IHS Towers, telecoms services in Nigeria under NITEL had suffered due to scarcity of base stations. The national carrier not only monopolised the market, but it also installed and operated the base stations. As of 1995, there were only 3,000 lines and three base stations in Lagos State. Between 1995 and 1999, the total number of connected fixed lines grew rapidly to about 550,000 while cellular lines were 40,000.\n\nDespite international initiatives and worthy objectives, Nigeria, with a population of over 120 million at the time, had in the year 2000 one of the lowest teledensity rates in the world at 0.38 percent.\n\nIt was also a period when the county\u2019s peers in Africa were beginning to take deregulation seriously and getting results for initiating the process.\n\nHence, in the late 1990s some African countries, such as Ghana, Uganda, and Zimbabwe, started issuing new cellular telephony licences. This led to dramatic increases in teledensities.\n\nFor example, the number of cellular subscribers in Zimbabwe increased from 20,000 to 150,000 in the 12 months before August 1999, whereas the number of fixed lines hovered around 250,000 over the same period. In Uganda the number of mobile subscribers overtook the number of fixed lines in July 1999, less than 10 months after MTN Uganda (the largest cellular operator in the country) started competing against MSI-Celtel.\n\nImportantly, the GSM licences went hand-in-hand with base tower increases. One report claimed that Darwish\u2019s company Motophone had installed towers in five Nigerian cities within seven months before having its licence revoked by the government.\n\nIn 2001, the same year MTN and Econet were granted their GSM licences, Issam Darwish together with his brother Mohamad Darwish and a friend William Saad founded IHS. IHS Holding Limited was however incorporated in the Republic of Mauritius under the Mauritian Companies Act 2001 as a private limited liability company. At the time, it was the only privately owned tower company in Nigeria.\n\nRunning IHS Towers\n\nIn the beginning, IHS Towers was building towers from scratch and operating them for telecom operators. While this proved to be a lucrative market for IHS, a lack of cooperation (and an excess of capital) meant many providers like MTN built their own towers without the proper planning to manage them.\n\nHence, despite being the only company providing exclusive tower services, IHS had to compete with the same operators it was seeking to serve.\n\nThe company soon realised there was more to gain from partnering and taking over existing towers than installing new ones.\n\nOperating a cell tower in a power-challenged country like Nigeria is a tug of war. Due to the unreliability of electricity, each cell tower requires two generators to keep it running for 24 hours plus a battery to serve as a backup. The company should also be able to guarantee diesel oil that feeds the generators.\n\nAlthough it was short on cash compared to the GSM providers, IHS had an advantage in that it was able to solve these problems from the beginning. Today, it is constantly seeking new innovation to further improve efficiency.\n\n\u201cThe energy situation in Nigeria hasn\u2019t changed much in 20 years, but we have learned new tactics,\u201d Darwish said in an interview this year.\n\n\u201cWe now use solar energy, smart batteries, and even wind; we are even testing a Tesla battery,\u201d Darwish said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2008 and the financial crisis that Darwish was able to convince the telecom operators in Nigeria of the value of cooperation. Before then, the company had in 2004 launched the Managed Services Operations for MNO-owned Towers with services including maintenance, security, and power supply.\n\nIn 2009, IHS began owning towers and leasing space to mobile network operators (MNOs) in Nigeria and launched its collocation operators through which it leased space to other MNOs. The big moments arrived when it sealed a deal to acquire MTN\u2019s tower assets. In 2014, IHS acquired a total of 10,966 towers out of which 4,154 came from MTN Nigeria and 2,116 towers from 9Mobile. It further acquired 4,696 towers from MTN Nigeria in 2015.\n\nRoad to IPO\n\n\u201cCongrats to longtime IFC client IHS Towers, the biggest operator of mobile phone towers in Africa, on its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange,\u201d tweeted Stephanies von Friedeburg, VP, Operations at the International Finance Corporation (IFC) on the day IHS finally rang the bell and went live on the global exchange at a price $17.65 per share.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge step for IHS in getting more communities across the continent connected. A proud moment for a great African company.\u201d\n\nApart from realising it needed collaboration to break the operational barriers in the telecom sector in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa, IHS also knew it needed unlimited access to liquidity to be able to provide the quality of service it was aiming for and control a sizable share of the market in Nigeria and Africa.\n\nShortly after increasing its tower portfolio in Nigeria, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Cameroon through acquisition, IHS completed a $2 billion equity round from investors such as IFC, Ecobank, Standard Chartered, and Investec. Darwish had said a substantial part of the money would go towards paying for its acquisitions, while the remainder would be spent on boosting its infrastructure in the five countries it operates in.\n\nDarwish had predicted that Africa could need 200,000 to 300,000 mobile towers with Nigeria alone needing 40,000 over a period of 10 years to meet the demand for broadband. This would require IHS raising more debt as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThings keep growing and evolving for us so we may come back to the market very soon,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2018, IHS, together with its shareholders including Goldman Sachs Group, Wendel, and MTN Group approached the New York Stock Exchange seeking to raise $1 billion at a valuation of $10 billion. The plan was postponed with reports citing the proximity of the 2019 general elections in Nigeria and the outcome of the sale of 9Mobile, a customer of IHS.\n\nWhile it waited, in 2019 the company refinanced outstanding debt of its Nigerian operations (approximately $1.8bn), including issuing $1.3 billion of new senior notes, as well as new senior credit facilities, resulting in a more simplified debt capital structure, extended maturities, and lower cost of debt. As of 2019, IHS had raised more than $5.5 billion in funding.\n\nIn terms of assets, IHS accounts for 16,522 towers of the 37,625 towers in Nigeria, representing almost 50 percent of the total in the market as of June 2021. It is also the number one tower provider in five markets where it operates in Africa and ranks fourth in the world.\n\nIHS goes public\n\nThe listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) went live at a share price of $17.65 for 1.6 million shares, or 16.0 percent below the IPO price, to value the company at about $5.8 billion. The stock has traded within a range of $16.83 to $18.48 since then.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased with the successful listing of IHS Towers, the fourth largest tower company globally.\n\n\u2018The listing gives MTN Group a strong liquidity platform that will support the Group\u2019s strategy of accelerating growth in its African markets, Ralph Mupita, MTN Group president/CEO, said\n\nApart from being the biggest customer of IHS, MTN owns a stake of 29 percent in the tower company. Following the listing, MTN now holds 85,176,719 ordinary shares.",

          "title": "IHS Towers: How a bad bet on GSM became a $7bn company",
          "text": "Issam Darwish, the founder/CEO of IHS Towers, was all smiles following the successful listing of his company on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, October 14, but it was not always that way.\n\nHe could hardly have summoned the same smile in 1999 when his first bet on Nigeria\u2019s telecoms sector fell through.\n\nCelia Motophone Limited, a communications company he was brought from Lebanon to lead as deputy managing director at the time, was among the companies granted licences to provide GSM network services in Nigeria by General Abdulsalam Abubakar, the then Military Head of State who was pushing to deregulate the Nigerian telecoms sector.\n\nOut of the six companies that got the licences, only Motophone and Communications Investment Limited (CIL) were firmly on the ground. Both were however unable to secure the needed interconnection with NITEL, the only national gateway carrier. Motophone also had an image problem: it was connected to the Gilbert Chagouri family that was very close to the late military dictator, General Sani Abacha.\n\nIt was not a surprise then when President Olusegun Obasanjo, who led the democratic dispensation in Nigeria from 1999, described the licensing exercise as fraudulent, revoked the licences, and introduced the telecommunication policy that empowered the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to reorganise, auction, and issue fresh licences to successful companies.\n\nDarwish, 27 years old at the time, and his company Motophone were again shortlisted among the seven contenders for the new licensing regime. The other contenders were United Telesys, Reliance Telecoms, CIL, MTS, NITEL, and MTN. Motophone was eventually disqualified after a series of court orders and allegations by NCC that the company may have manipulated its way to the first licence. The NCC removed the rights of Motophone before the auction. Eventually, five companies were shortlisted for the four GSM licences.\n\nRead Also: IHS bucks trend, opts for sole listing in New York\n\nDown on his luck but undaunted, the young Lebanese entrepreneur decided to place his bet in a different segment of the nascent telecoms industry \u2013 building and operating towers.\n\nThat new bet proved to be genius. By listing on the New York Stock Exchange in chase of a valuation of $7 billion, IHS Towers has not only become the largest tower company in Africa it is also now more valuable than MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa both of which got the GSM licences.\n\nThe making of IHS Towers\n\nPrior to the emergence of IHS Towers, telecoms services in Nigeria under NITEL had suffered due to scarcity of base stations. The national carrier not only monopolised the market, but it also installed and operated the base stations. As of 1995, there were only 3,000 lines and three base stations in Lagos State. Between 1995 and 1999, the total number of connected fixed lines grew rapidly to about 550,000 while cellular lines were 40,000.\n\nDespite international initiatives and worthy objectives, Nigeria, with a population of over 120 million at the time, had in the year 2000 one of the lowest teledensity rates in the world at 0.38 percent.\n\nIt was also a period when the county\u2019s peers in Africa were beginning to take deregulation seriously and getting results for initiating the process.\n\nHence, in the late 1990s some African countries, such as Ghana, Uganda, and Zimbabwe, started issuing new cellular telephony licences. This led to dramatic increases in teledensities.\n\nFor example, the number of cellular subscribers in Zimbabwe increased from 20,000 to 150,000 in the 12 months before August 1999, whereas the number of fixed lines hovered around 250,000 over the same period. In Uganda the number of mobile subscribers overtook the number of fixed lines in July 1999, less than 10 months after MTN Uganda (the largest cellular operator in the country) started competing against MSI-Celtel.\n\nImportantly, the GSM licences went hand-in-hand with base tower increases. One report claimed that Darwish\u2019s company Motophone had installed towers in five Nigerian cities within seven months before having its licence revoked by the government.\n\nIn 2001, the same year MTN and Econet were granted their GSM licences, Issam Darwish together with his brother Mohamad Darwish and a friend William Saad founded IHS. IHS Holding Limited was however incorporated in the Republic of Mauritius under the Mauritian Companies Act 2001 as a private limited liability company. At the time, it was the only privately owned tower company in Nigeria.\n\nRunning IHS Towers\n\nIn the beginning, IHS Towers was building towers from scratch and operating them for telecom operators. While this proved to be a lucrative market for IHS, a lack of cooperation (and an excess of capital) meant many providers like MTN built their own towers without the proper planning to manage them.\n\nHence, despite being the only company providing exclusive tower services, IHS had to compete with the same operators it was seeking to serve.\n\nThe company soon realised there was more to gain from partnering and taking over existing towers than installing new ones.\n\nOperating a cell tower in a power-challenged country like Nigeria is a tug of war. Due to the unreliability of electricity, each cell tower requires two generators to keep it running for 24 hours plus a battery to serve as a backup. The company should also be able to guarantee diesel oil that feeds the generators.\n\nAlthough it was short on cash compared to the GSM providers, IHS had an advantage in that it was able to solve these problems from the beginning. Today, it is constantly seeking new innovation to further improve efficiency.\n\n\u201cThe energy situation in Nigeria hasn\u2019t changed much in 20 years, but we have learned new tactics,\u201d Darwish said in an interview this year.\n\n\u201cWe now use solar energy, smart batteries, and even wind; we are even testing a Tesla battery,\u201d Darwish said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2008 and the financial crisis that Darwish was able to convince the telecom operators in Nigeria of the value of cooperation. Before then, the company had in 2004 launched the Managed Services Operations for MNO-owned Towers with services including maintenance, security, and power supply.\n\nIn 2009, IHS began owning towers and leasing space to mobile network operators (MNOs) in Nigeria and launched its collocation operators through which it leased space to other MNOs. The big moments arrived when it sealed a deal to acquire MTN\u2019s tower assets. In 2014, IHS acquired a total of 10,966 towers out of which 4,154 came from MTN Nigeria and 2,116 towers from 9Mobile. It further acquired 4,696 towers from MTN Nigeria in 2015.\n\nRoad to IPO\n\n\u201cCongrats to longtime IFC client IHS Towers, the biggest operator of mobile phone towers in Africa, on its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange,\u201d tweeted Stephanies von Friedeburg, VP, Operations at the International Finance Corporation (IFC) on the day IHS finally rang the bell and went live on the global exchange at a price $17.65 per share.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge step for IHS in getting more communities across the continent connected. A proud moment for a great African company.\u201d\n\nApart from realising it needed collaboration to break the operational barriers in the telecom sector in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa, IHS also knew it needed unlimited access to liquidity to be able to provide the quality of service it was aiming for and control a sizable share of the market in Nigeria and Africa.\n\nShortly after increasing its tower portfolio in Nigeria, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Cameroon through acquisition, IHS completed a $2 billion equity round from investors such as IFC, Ecobank, Standard Chartered, and Investec. Darwish had said a substantial part of the money would go towards paying for its acquisitions, while the remainder would be spent on boosting its infrastructure in the five countries it operates in.\n\nDarwish had predicted that Africa could need 200,000 to 300,000 mobile towers with Nigeria alone needing 40,000 over a period of 10 years to meet the demand for broadband. This would require IHS raising more debt as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThings keep growing and evolving for us so we may come back to the market very soon,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2018, IHS, together with its shareholders including Goldman Sachs Group, Wendel, and MTN Group approached the New York Stock Exchange seeking to raise $1 billion at a valuation of $10 billion. The plan was postponed with reports citing the proximity of the 2019 general elections in Nigeria and the outcome of the sale of 9Mobile, a customer of IHS.\n\nWhile it waited, in 2019 the company refinanced outstanding debt of its Nigerian operations (approximately $1.8bn), including issuing $1.3 billion of new senior notes, as well as new senior credit facilities, resulting in a more simplified debt capital structure, extended maturities, and lower cost of debt. As of 2019, IHS had raised more than $5.5 billion in funding.\n\nIn terms of assets, IHS accounts for 16,522 towers of the 37,625 towers in Nigeria, representing almost 50 percent of the total in the market as of June 2021. It is also the number one tower provider in five markets where it operates in Africa and ranks fourth in the world.\n\nIHS goes public\n\nThe listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) went live at a share price of $17.65 for 1.6 million shares, or 16.0 percent below the IPO price, to value the company at about $5.8 billion. The stock has traded within a range of $16.83 to $18.48 since then.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased with the successful listing of IHS Towers, the fourth largest tower company globally.\n\n\u2018The listing gives MTN Group a strong liquidity platform that will support the Group\u2019s strategy of accelerating growth in its African markets, Ralph Mupita, MTN Group president/CEO, said\n\nApart from being the biggest customer of IHS, MTN owns a stake of 29 percent in the tower company. Following the listing, MTN now holds 85,176,719 ordinary shares.",

          "title": "The business case for telecom towers",
          "text": "The horizons of Nigeria\u2019s towns and villages have transformed dramatically over the past 20 years with the appearance and expansion of telecom towers; 30 to 70-meter-high structures that inundate peaks and heights across the country.\n\nThe record growth of the Nigerian telecom industry cannot be divorced from a robust telecom tower infrastructure which has played a pivotal role in bridging the digital divide and facilitating pervasive mobile connectivity. The tower industry in Nigeria has laid a strong foundation of growth for the telecom sector and has supported the sector in keeping pace with the fast-paced technology advancements.\n\nIHS has been one of the pioneers in infrastructure sharing, helping telecom operators to roll out services in record times, and enhancing national spread of signalling.\n\nThe dynamics of the Nigerian tower operator industry are, for the most part, similar to those of the established U.S. tower industry. Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) typically prefer to outsource their passive network components because it significantly reduces their capital costs and helps manage their operating costs.\n\nShavik Ghosh, writing for the \u2018Mint\u2019 noted, \u201c\u2026telecom towers are a lot like real estate, everything depends on the location. Land must be acquired at the exact coordinates where the tower is needed. After the telco has decided on a location, the coordinates are given to the towerco, which checks to see if there are any other towers in the area that can be used. To cut costs, towercos rent the land for a tower on a long-term lease. That brings the challenge of dealing with landlords, which can be something of an ordeal, according to an executive in charge of operations and management (O&M) for one of the independent tower companies, who did not want to be named\u201d.\n\nRead Also: IHS listing seen as investment magnate for Nigeria\u2019s telecom sector\n\nMNOs in the country have had a long history of outsourcing various telecommunications infrastructure needs to independent telecommunications infrastructure providers, including the building of new towers since 2001. Managed services have been in place since 2006. Shortly thereafter, the MNOs began sharing passive infrastructure and independent tower companies started to provide long-term leased services.\n\nIn 2011, MNOs started entering into bilateral agreements to co-locate on each other\u2019s sites. For MNOs, co-location offers a much more cost-effective and faster alternative to building new towers. Independent tower infrastructure operators have met the increasingly large demands of MNOs as they have aggressively pursued new subscribers.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, IHS, which owns 45 percent of the total towers in Nigeria and is the largest telecommunications infrastructure provider in the market with 68 percent of the independent market towers, acquired tower portfolios from 9 Mobile and MTN Nigeria while Airtel Nigeria sold its towers to American Tower Corporation.\n\n\u201cThe IHS mission is to provide telecommunications infrastructure to mobile network operators in Africa that enables the widest, most efficient and reliable networks, supporting the economic development of the region. We are constantly developing new, efficient and effective technologies and rolling out passive networks to make that happen,\u201d says Sam Darwish, CEO of telecoms company IHS Towers, which has raised more than $5.5 billion in funding.\n\nFounded in Nigeria in 2001, IHS Towers\u2019 business model is relatively straightforward: The company buys mobile towers from telecom companies, or builds them itself, then leases them back to the operators. The company now has operations in Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Rwanda and Zambia.\n\nOpportunities\n\nMany MNOs across Africa are selling off their tower assets. This trend, brought on by a strong imperative to cut network deployment and operating costs, is expected to intensify in the future.\n\nThe infrastructural challenges for MNOs in Africa are two fold; to cost-effectively power their existing network and expand network coverage to the population currently without access to mobile communications infrastructure.\n\nThe opportunities inherent in this for tower companies are immense.\n\nWith IHS in the lead, Nigeria has been one of the forerunners in passive infrastructure sharing, which is now a world-wide phenomenon. The \u201ctowerco\u201d business model opened significant gains; from rapid market expansion and faster time to market, to opex and capex efficiencies, and offloading capex burden from telecom operators.\n\nPlenty of new opportunities, as noted in a 2020 Ernst & Young (EY) are arising for tower companies to shift their attention from a macro tower focused business, towards new business models hinged on fibre, small cells, data centres, Wi-Fi, smart cities and beyond.\n\nAdvancing the capex to opex model, towercos, said the report \u201ccan venture into data centres and edge computing (micro data centres) play. As the economy grows, low hanging revenue opportunities can come from capitalizing the real estate rights with the infrastructure providers \u2013 opening growth avenues in advertisements, electric vehicles infrastructure, security solutions and traffic control among others\u201d.\n\nIn addition, says EY, while there is broad consensus that 5G will drive up the total cost of network ownership, given the massively increased densification of urban areas and the resulting heightened requirements for fibre deployment, infrastructure providers are better positioned to support the industry\u2019s need for fibre rollout and small cell densification.\n\nFurthermore, opportunities are awash for HIS to strengthen its local market and dominate offshore markets especially in the areas of building, operating and maintaining Internet of Things (IoT) network, and serving as a neutral host Wi-Fi provider.\n\nMonetising existing assets is a significant opportunity for towercos in the country. Towercos can expand their service portfolio beyond tower based real estate and include provisioning other services on their tower sites. With distributed, power backed, and increasingly fiberized sites, towercos can explore revenue streams that exploit this dispersed real estate advantage. A potential business stream includes setting up of edge computing on tower sites by deploying micro data centres near the network edge. With steady power supply and ready backhaul, tower sites can support edge data centres closer to the user, reducing the need to send backhaul data traffic to a centralized hub.\n\nThe location advantage of towercos also renders them fit for serving as storage, warehousing and delivery centres for various businesses. With availability of power and air-conditioning, even perishable goods storage can be explored as a business stream. Tower structures can also be monetized for out-of-home advertising, with placement of billboards on towers/monopoles. Another service proposition beyond vertical real estate is the provisioning of primary and backup power. As towercos have significant expertise in managing energy assets, they are well-positioned to provide power-as-a-service. With the advent of electric vehicles, towercos can play an important role in this upcoming opportunity and unlock a new revenue stream. The availability of reliable power and possession of distributed sites makes towercos well-suited to provide EV charging infrastructure\n\nChallenges\n\nNigeria needs towers and lots of them. Perhaps, the biggest local and immediate challenge is in the maintenance of towers and tower sites: the rising cost of fuel and the need to be environmentally responsible, as well as reassuring the public that its structures are not health hazards can be a sticking point for the towercos.\n\nTowers have a significant carbon footprint and this has been a sore point between the Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC) and the National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA).\n\nEase of doing business remains a major concern for all in the country and across large parts of the continent. Dealing with construction permits, poor access to electricity, multiple taxation and enforcement of contracts are key concerns that need to be addressed for faster infrastructure rollouts. To expedite the creation of robust telecom infrastructure and to fulfil, it is important that ease of doing business is treated as a priority.",

          "title": "Why FG abandoned PPP arrangements on Second Niger Bridge, Lagos-Ibadan expressway \u2013 Fashola",
          "text": "The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, has said the current administration abandoned the Public Private Partnership (PPP) on major infrastructure projects, including the Second Niger Bridge, and the Lagos-Ibadan expressway because investors could not secure needed funding from banks.\n\nMr Fashola, a former Lagos State governor, called for the audit of the existing concession agreements between the federal government and investors.\n\nThe minister spoke on Monday at the public hearing by the House of Representatives Committee on Privatisation in Abuja..\n\nThis disclosure by Mr Fashola is coming in the wake of the planned concessioning of major highways in the country.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES had reported that the government plans to concession the National Arts Theatre, Tafawa Balewa Square, and all the River Basin Development Authorities at N836 million while the National Stadium in Lagos, the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja, and two others were pegged for concessioning at N100 million, to fund 2021 budget deficit.\n\nIn the 2022 Appropriation Bill, the federal government is planning to get N90.3 billion from privatisation proceeds.\n\n\u201cWe cannot do and discuss PPPs in isolation of our economy, whether at the national, state, regional or global,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLet us take two highways that we offered for PPP. The second Niger bridge was conceived as a PPP. The Lagos-Ibadan expressway was conceived as a PPP. But if we had asked a very basic question at the time \u2013 N200 billion plus projects \u2014 which bank in Nigeria has ever lent N200 billion to any individual? We asked that question and we knew that it was not the way to go. They might have lent it but inevitably, it was more likely that they would have come back for a sovereign guarantee.\n\n\u201cIf you are guaranteeing something, you might as well do it yourself. So, in the end, what happened? The Lagos-Ibadan expressway in 2006 and the second Niger bridge in 2010, nothing significantly happened on those projects until 2016. So, we lost like 10 years before this administration now started funding directly,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe also raised questions on the concession done so far by the government, noting that there is a need to probe if the efforts have achieved the desired outcomes.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I want to ask is that, of all the assets that we have disposed of and the reasons for disposing them or for commercialising them or for privatising them, have we achieved the objective that we set out to achieve? I think we should ask that question,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd I think apart from making this law, that undertaking would be a profound service to Nigeria, so that all of us will have a very clear understanding of the capacity, ability and what is realistic to expect of the private sector.\n\n\u201cIndeed, in our last (ministerial) retreat, this subject came up and I admitted to it that, \u2018where is the private sector?\u2019 I came from there; the vice-president (Yemi Osinbajo) came from there; the president came from there; many of us came from there. We are all here (in public service) now. So, who are we handing it back to?\n\n\u201cBut I think that it would be helpful to have an audit of all the assets that have been concessioned or privatised in the name of improved efficiency and then to ask, \u2018have we achieved that objective?\u2019 I think if we do that and interrogate very honestly, some of the things that would begin to become obvious to us is that we need to be more circumspect about certain types of assets.\n\n\u201cThere are certain types of assets that the private sector is just unable to deal with. For example, when you look at roads, not many people who claim to want to do it have the capacity or the experience to do it.\n\n\u201cLet us start with the Lekki-Epe expressway which was concessioned. The concession agreement \u2014 members of this committee might want to know \u2014was signed in 2005. I was chief of staff (to Governor Bola Tinubu) then.\n\n\u201cThey did not reach financial close until 2010 \u2014 that was five years. So, between 2007 when I became governor and 2010, the road had to start. So, for an asset we had concessioned, the Lagos State Government had to first go and borrow money to start the work meant to be concessioned.\n\n\u201cIn terms of political arrangement, you never have five years; you have (a tenure of) four years. And within the first three years, if you are not showing results, you are going to meet the electorate. So, these are some of the real challenges when we have these expectations.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari has expressed optimism that the adoption of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and its underlying blockchain technology, can increase Nigeria\u2019s GDP by $29 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nBuhari who officially launched e-Naira at the presidential villa, Abuja on Monday, affirmed that the introduction of the e-Naira would enable the government to send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare programmes as well as foster cross border trade.\n\nThe President, according to a statement from his media aide, Femi Adesina, said that alongside digital innovations, CBDCs can foster economic growth through better economic activities, increase remittances, improve financial inclusion and make monetary policy more effective.\n\n\u201cLet me note that aside from the global trend to create Digital Currencies, we believe that there are Nigeria-specific benefits that cut across different sectors of, and concerns of the economy,\u201d the statement quoted the president as saying.\n\n\u201cThe use of CBDCs can help move many more people and businesses from the informal into the formal sector, thereby increasing the tax base of the country.\u201d\n\nThe President said with the launch of e-Naira, Nigeria has become the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world to introduce a digital currency to her citizens.\n\nHe commended the Governor of the Central Bank, Godwin Emefiele, his deputies and the entire team of staff who worked tirelessly to make the launch of Africa\u2019s first digital currency a reality.\n\nPresident Buhari, who assured Nigerians of the safety and scalability of the CBDC system, said the journey to create a digital currency for Nigeria began sometime in 2017.\n\n\u201cWork intensified over the past several months with several brainstorming exercises, deployment of technical partners and advisers, collaboration with the Ministries of Communication and Digital Economy and its sister agencies like the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), integration of banking software across the country and painstaking tests to ensure the robustness, safety and scalability of the CBDC System, \u201d he said.\n\nWhile explaining how he approved the use of digital currency, President Buhari stated: \u201dIn recent times, the use of physical cash in conducting business and making payments has been on the decline. This trend has been exacerbated by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resurgence of a new Digital Economy.\n\n\u201cAlongside these developments, businesses, households, and other economic agents have sought for new means of making payments in the new circumstances.\n\n\u201cThe absence of a swift and effective solution to these requirements, as well as fears that Central Banks\u2019 actions sometimes lead to hyperinflation created the space for non-government entities to establish new forms of \u201cprivate currencies\u201d that seemed to have gained popularity and acceptance across the world, including here in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn response to these developments, an overwhelming majority of Central Banks across the world have started to consider issuing digital currencies in order to cater for businesses and households seeking faster, safer, easier and cheaper means of payments.\n\n\u201cA handful of countries including China, Bahamas, and Cambodia have already issued their own CBDCs.\n\n\u201cA 2021 survey of Central Banks around the world by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that almost 90 per cent are actively researching the potential for CBDCs, 60 percent were experimenting with the technology and 14 per cent were deploying pilot projects.\n\n\u201cNeedless to add, close monitoring and close supervision will be necessary in the early stages of implementation to study the effect of e-Naira on the economy as a whole.\n\n\u201cIt is on the basis of this that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sought and received my approval to explore issuing Nigeria\u2019s own Central Bank Digital Currency, named the e-Naira,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President was of the view that his approval was also underpinned by the fact that the CBN has been a leading innovator \u2018\u2018in the form of money they produce, and in the payment services they deploy for efficient transactions.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Nigeria\u2019s apex bank has invested heavily in creating a Payment System that is ranked in the top ten in the world and certainly the best in Africa.\n\n\u201cThis payment system now provides high\u2010value and time\u2010critical payment services to financial institutions, and ultimately serves as the backbone for every electronic payment in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey have also supported several private\u2010sector initiatives to improve the existing payments landscape, and in turn, have created some of the world\u2019s leading payment service providers today,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn his remarks, the CBN Governor explained that e-Naira is Nigeria\u2019s CBDC and it is the digital equivalent of the physical Naira.\n\n\u201cAs the tagline simply encapsulates, the e-Naira is the same Naira with far more possibilities. The e-Naira \u2013 like the physical Naira \u2013 is a legal tender in Nigeria and a liability of the CBN. The e-Naira and Naira will have the same value and will always be exchanged at 1 naira to 1 e-Naira,\u201d he said.\n\nEmefiele added that the CBN has given careful consideration to the entire payments and financial architecture and has designed the e-Naira to complement and strengthen these ecosystems and has implemented secure safeguards and policies to maintain the integrity of the financial system.\n\nThe apex bank\u2019s boss pledged that there would be strict adherence to the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards in order to preserve the integrity and stability of Nigeria\u2019s payment system.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, since the eNaira platform went live, there has been overwhelming interest and encouraging response from Nigerians and other parties across the world with over 2.5 million daily visits to the website.\n\nWhile listing the milestones, Emefiele stated: \u201d33 banks are fully integrated and live on the platform, 500 million has been successfully minted by the Bank, N200 million has been issued to financial institutions, over 2,000 customers have been onboarded and over 120 merchants have successfully registered on the e-Naira platform.\u201d\n\nThe CBN governor also used the occasion to commend President Buhari for making history, yet again, with the launch of the e-Naira \u2013 the first in Africa and one of the earliest around the world.\n\nHe also dispelled fears on the nation\u2019s foreign reserves, saying the reserves are strong and getting stronger by the day.\n\nEmefiele added: \u201cMr President, as you make groundbreaking reforms, there has been continuing debate on the true value of the Naira. Rather than worry today on the direction of the exchange rate, let us take a step back and analyze how we got here in the first place.\n\n\u201cPlease recall that since the advent of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) led Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) in 1986, and the introduction of the Second Tier Foreign Exchange (SFEM) market, the Naira has been on a one-way free fall from parity to the US Dollar in 1984 to over N410/USD today.\n\n\u201cSome 35 years later, we have not been able to achieve the many promises and objectives of that programme.\n\n\u201cInstead, what we have seen is widespread import dependency, which has wiped out most of our production and manufacturing bases and exported all our jobs in the process.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened to the massive textile factories across our nation such that we import almost all cotton products when we are rich in cotton?\n\n\u201cWhat has happened to our vehicle assembly plants across the nation such that we import most vehicles and have become a massive dumping ground for dying second-hand vehicles?\n\n\u201cWhat has happened to our rubber plantations through which we made the best tyres and rubber products in the world? What has happened to our groundnut pyramids? What has happened to our Cocoa farms? What has happened to our palm oil mills?\n\n\u201cUnder your leadership, Mr President, we must stop this decline for good! We must return to massive homemade production; we must get our people working again. We must create an economic environment for massive domestic production and significant non-oil exports.\n\n\u201cAs custodians of your national reserves, let me first assure you that there is no cause for alarm. Our FX reserves are strong and indeed getting stronger by the day, crossing the 40 billion USD mark, and is one of the highest in Africa \u2013 and growing.\n\n\u201cBut we cannot fritter our reserves away on cheap imports and currency speculators. We must return to an employment-led growth anchored on productivity and rewarding producers of local goods, services, innovation and new technologies.\n\n\u201cIf you consume cheap imports and export our jobs, we will make you pay dearly; but if you produce locally \u2013 with little or no foreign inputs beyond machinery, we will support you, and the markets will reward you abundantly.\u201d\n\nIn addition to all policies and actions of the CBN to support the economy especially through the trying times of COVID-19, Emefiele announced a new financial instrument titled \u201cThe 100 for 100 PPP \u2013 Policy on Production and Productivity\u201d, which will be anchored in the Development Finance Department under his direct supervision.\n\nHe explained that under this policy the CBN would advertise, screen, scrutinize and financially support 100 targeted private sector companies in 100 days, beginning from 01 November 2021, and rolling over every 100 days with new set of 100 companies, whose names will be published in National Dailies for Nigerians to verify and confirm.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nAs the Anambra State electorate heads to the poll next week, November 6, to elect a new governor \u2013 a successor to the incumbent chief executive, Willie Obiano \u2013 the state\u2019s ruling party, the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), is in a make or break battle, fighting not only to retain a state it has governed for nearly two decades, but more importantly, for its very survival.\n\nThough not etched in the consciousness of many, when Anambra voters step out to vote on Saturday, they will inadvertently be deciding the fate of a political platform that has, over the years, stood as the only outstanding legacy of late Biafra leader, Chief Chukwuemeka Odimegwu Ojukwu; a man widely regarded as the eternal leader of his people.\n\nAPGA, with former Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Prof Charles Soludo, as its candidate, goes into the election as one of the favourites \u2013 in what is largely a three horse race involving the party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), which has Mr. Valentine Ozigbo as candidate and the country\u2019s ruling party, All Progressive Congress (APC), with Senator Andy Uba as candidate \u2013 but more than ever before the APGA faces a hovering possibility of not retaining a state it has had from 2006 when the state\u2019s former governor, Mr. Peter Obi reclaimed his 2003 mandate initially awarded to Chris Ngige of the PDP. And unable to hold another state in the region, losing Anambra would simply mean a slide into oblivion.\n\nIt\u2019s a possibility not lost on the APGA candidate, Soludo himself. Speaking on Tuesday during a campaign at Akpo community in Aguata LGA of the state, he noted that losing the election would simply be the end of the party.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to lose this election, because if we lose, it will be the end of APGA,\u201d Soludo said. \u201cSo, we need to work together and make sure we win this election to survive and carry on the legacy of the party.\n\n\u201cThis is why I have come to you, to appeal to our traditional rulers, community leaders, president-generals, women and youths to vote for APGA.\u201d\n\nThe prognosis, for a party that once embodied the aspiration of the Igbo nation, is foreboding. Last week\u2019s defection to the APC, of Dr. Nkem Okeke, the state\u2019s deputy governor, capped a wave of defections from APGA to the country\u2019s ruling party ahead of the polls.\n\nOkeke\u2019s defection, perhaps more than anything else, spoke to the degeneration of a party that has since lost its essence, and presently exists, many say, in a vacuum. Before him was Sunday Umeoduagu, erstwhile APGA Board of Trustee member who also pitted tent with the ruling party few days ago. Six members of the state assembly, have also left for the APC, as the ruling\u2019s party\u2019s camp continues to expand ahead of the election.\n\nThe APC and its candidate, Uba, are looking poised to cause an upset at APGA\u2019s expense, as a combination of factors, including crisis in APGA, possible voter apathy and likely deployment of federal might are catalysizing in their favour.\n\nUba has continued to mobilise youths of the state for spirited online campaigns. Yet, he is not the only threat. Ozigbo and PDP are very much in the game. Indeed, for many, a free and fair contest will largely be a two-horse race between APGA and the PDP.\n\nBut elections are hardly fair in Nigeria, and Anambra polls, with swelling threats of violence, may be anything but free. And this is where APGA\u2019s main headache will come from.\n\n\u201cIf election holds and people go out to vote, Andy Uba cannot win,\u201d said Chidi Nwafor, political observer and business owner based in Awka. \u201cIf there is an election, APGA or PDP will win. Uba cannot win. APC is not liked here, and Uba is very unpopular, even in his home town, forget social media propaganda.\n\n\u201cBut as it stands, people will not come out to vote, and that will enable him to use federal might to rig the election. They might repeat what they did in Imo State. But unlike Imo, they may not wait to go to court, they may take the state by force and ask you to go to court.\u201d\n\nThe threat of violence is very real. Attacks on politicians, prominent figures and the facilities of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), by gunmen whose stated objective is to ensure that the election doesn\u2019t hold, in line with the position of separatist group, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has put everyone on the edge.\n\n\u201cAPGA has not been able to campaign because of the violence. The party has not been able to campaign in up to three local governments. Everyone is afraid,\u201d Nwafor said. \u201cPeople will not come out to vote, unless IPOB declares that the election should hold. Otherwise, they would be too afraid to go out to vote.\u201d\n\nAPGA\u2019s predicament is in three-fold: The party has, on account of merchantile posture of successive leadership, departed from its original mandate of being a rallying point for Ndigbo, to become like most other political platforms, a place where positions went to highest bidders. The consequent of which is the alienation of many who had invested their emotions to it, including the Southeast street which initially saw it, especially with Ojukwu as a leading figure, as a platform for the rekindling of Biafra spirit.\n\nOjukwu\u2019s death in 2011, was the turning point. The party no longer had a natural leader. Peter Obi, its first governor, could not step into his shoes. His successor, Obiano, has proved to be much worse. His inspiring performance as governor is one of the major cases against APGA going into the polls. But the party\u2019s major headache will come from the boycott campaign being mounted by proponents of Biafra, notably the Mazi Nnamdi Kanu led IPOB.\n\nIt\u2019s an abiding irony that a political platform that rose to relative prominence in 2003, on the back pro Biafra sentiment, inspired by Emeka Ojukwu, now faces real threat of oblivion courtesy of same pro-Biafra sentiment, inspired this time, by Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nUnlike Ojukwu, who after leading the Biafra war, subsequently favoured political participation, Kanu is mounting boycott campaign as a strategy to achieve secession. It\u2019s difficult to see any logic in the strategy, and in any case, with President Muhammadu Buhari determined to ensure that the election takes place despite the enveloping violence \u2013 a commitment he further restated last week when he gave security agencies marching orders to deploy as much force as necessary to ensure that the election holds \u2013 it may indeed hold as scheduled. Regardless, the inevitable outcome will be historic low voter turnout, which could be APGA\u2019s major undoing.\n\nIPOB commands street following in Anambra and elsewhere in the Southeast, and the continued insistence by its foot soldiers on no election is sure to discourage many from participating in the process, but even more so is the ensuing violence, which is certain to scare people away from the polls and create an atmosphere for possible manipulation of the poll.\n\n\u201cThe fewer the voters on election day, the worse for APGA and the PDP, which have no federal might to deploy,\u201d said Chidi Anthony, lawyer and political commentator. \u201cThe violence being perpetrated by these gunmen will scare people away from voting. That is very obvious. What will then likely happen is that APC will use that as an opportunity to manipulate the outcome.\u201d\n\nAPGA has also continued to be it\u2019s own worst enemy, battling unending internal leadership crisis. Last week\u2019s Supreme Court ruling that affirmed Soludo as candidate and Chief Victor Oye as national chairman, has put an end, in the interim, to what has been months bitter squabble between the duo\u2019s camp and that of Jude Okeke, which produced Hon. Chukwuma Umeoji as governorship candidate, but it\u2019s unlikely to be the end.\n\nAs hinted at earlier, APGA\u2019s problem takes root from its derailing from the core fundamental objective that birthed it. Obvious from recent political events is that, perhaps as many political watchers have pointed out, APGA has lost its soul, and the recurrent crisis is only an indication that the party is heading towards an inglorious end.\n\nWhen the party emerged in the political arena ahead of the 2003 general election, it was basically the Igbo response to their perceived marginalisation in the Nigerian polity. The party, with the late Chief Ojukwu as its face, represented, for the average Igbo, a political identity. One could say, APGA drew its strength from the Igbo emotional attachment to it.\n\n\u201cThe strong desire to found a national political party based on Igbo initiative motivated me to rally a few associates on the platform of Igboezue Cultural Association which I founded in 1991 with the Motto: \u201cOnye aghala nwanne ya,\u201d (let\u2019s be our brothers\u2019 keepers) to embark on the mission of forming a political party,\u201d recalled Chief Okorie, the party\u2019s original founder and its first National Chairman.\n\nOkorie perhaps foresaw that the possibility of an Igbo quest for power in a national political party did not exist, a fact further validated by the travails of the late former Vice President, Dr. Alex Ekwueme in the PDP. UPGA, the original name of the party, transmuted to APGA in 2003 with Ojukwu as its founding figure.\n\nWith Ojukwu, APGA, in many people\u2019s reckoning, filled a void in the Igbo political consciousness which the PDP despite being the dominant political party in the Igbo country, could not fill. The generality of the people identified with it. In some ways, it was a response to the Alliance for Democracy in the South west and the All Nigeria Peoples Party in the North.\n\nBut things went down, gradually, after Ojukwu. Chief Obiano, as Anambra governor and leader of the party, not only stood on the party\u2019s platform to back Buhari, perceived by many Igbo to have taken Igbo marginalisation to a whole new level, but also rained verbal abuses on Ohanaeze leadership for endorsing Buhari\u2019s opponent, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar of the PDP, who coincidentally, had Peter Obi, his predecessor as vice presidential candidate ahead of 2019 election.\n\n\u201cAPGA lost its essence the moment the party was hijacked some years ago by people who didn\u2019t share in the vision for which it was founded. It is as a result of that derailment that took place about 16 years ago, in 2004. APGA was founded in 2002 and by December 2004, they had already launched an attack against the founder, myself,\u201d said Chief Okorie.\n\n\u201cWe remained in court for eight years. As a result, the party never grew beyond Anambra State. Any in-road it made into any state, it quickly returned back to Anambra State. It entered Imo, but couldn\u2019t stay there and so on and so forth. So, it was a gradual process that has almost resulted in outright decimation of the party. It\u2019s not a damage that was done just in one day.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget that after I produced Chief Odumegwu Ojukwu as presidential candidate, APGA never produced any other presidential candidate of Igbo extraction from that time till now. And one of the reasons for founding it was to give the Igbo man an opportunity to be involved in the contest for the highest office in the land.\u201d\n\nObiano could well be APGA\u2019s last governor. A possibility that would mark an unfortunate end to party. And for many, it will be to his credit. The governor is indeed linked with possible defection to the APC in the coming months.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame that the party is being destroyed in the face of Obiano. As the leader of the party, the party is completely being destroyed,\u201d Prof Max Nduaguibe, a former chieftain of the party in Abia noted.\n\n\u201cObi left the party after his governorship and went to PDP. He left the party more or less intact for Obiano.\n\n\u201cThe merchants who took over the party with Obiano decided to use it to make money. And they have made sufficient money from Imo people, from Abia people, even from Anambra people. You can see that they once even denied the wife of Ojukwu ticket.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, with Dr. Alex Otti as candidate, APGA came whiskers away from taking Abia State, but again failed, largely on account of lack of commitment by its leadership. Otti has since abandoned the platform for the APC.\n\n\u201cThe essence of APGA is almost getting lost because of avarice,\u201d said Barr Bob Okey Okoroji, a chieftain of the party who aspired to Lagos governorship through its platform told BusinessesHallmark after the last polls.\n\n\u201cThe focus and the desire by some individuals in leadership position both at the national and state levels, is to make money. Therefore, they relegate to the background, those fundamental principles on which the party was founded.\n\n\u201cI do understand too, that their leadership is not going to be forever. They will be there for a while and maybe those who share the vision of the founding fathers will get into leadership and bring the party to where it should be. The party\u2019s performance in Imo is also not very encouraging because of the primary elections.\u201d\n\nDr. Oye, regardless, insisted all is well with the party and they were, \u201cdetermined not to be distracted by miscreants who are being used by opposition politicians to cause disaffection in APGA.\u201d",

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThe board of FBN Holdings Plc (FBNH) may soon witness an adjustment to reflect a major change in the ownership structure of the holding company for First Bank of Nigeria Limited (FBN).\n\nThe Group (FBNH) in a statement issued on the Nigerian Exchange Limited\u2019s portal on Saturday put an end to a raging controversy when it announced that the Chairman of Calvados Global Services Limited, Mr Femi Otedola, had acquired substantial shareholding in the company.\n\nThe statement, signed by the company secretary, Mr Seyi Kosoko said, \u201cWe refer to our communication to the market dated, October 22, 2021 on the above subject wherein we stated that we would inform the public of any substantial acquisition, upon receipt of notification from the shareholder.\n\n\u201cThis morning, October 23, 2021, FBN Holdings Plc received a notification from APT Securities and Funds Limited, that their client, Mr Otedola Olufemi Peter, and his nominee, Calvados Global Services Limited have acquired a total of 1,818,551,625 units of shares from the company\u2019s issued share capital of 35,895,292,791.\n\n\u201cBased on the foregoing, the equity stake of Mr Otedola Olufemi Peter and his nominee in the company is now 5.07 per cent.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, FBNH had denied media reports that Otedola had acquired a significant shareholding in the company. The Group in a statement signed by Kosoko, and filed with the Nigerian Exchange Limited on Friday, said it had not received any notification of such acquisitions.\n\nIt had said, \u201cThe attention of FBN Holdings Plc has been drawn to media reports today (Friday) that a certain individual has acquired significant shareholding interest in FBN Holdings Plc.\n\n\u201cAs a listed company, the shares of FBN Holdings are publicly traded, and sale and acquisition of shares is expected in the normal course of business. We operate in a regulated environment, which requires notification of significant shareholding by shareholders to the company, where shares are held in different vehicles, further to which the company will notify the regulators and the public as appropriate.\n\n\u201cThe company is yet to receive any notification from the individual mentioned in the media report, of such acquisitions.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition of a significant shareholding in the FBN Holdings (FBNH) Plc, by Otedola had sparked controversy among stakeholders, with FBNH denying official knowledge of the transaction.\n\nIt was even more so with the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) describing the development as a speculation since, according to it, neither the bank nor the NGX Reguation has notified the Exchange of such deal.\n\nAggressive mop-up\n\nOtedola in a series of secondary market transactions and negotiated deals was confirmed to have acquired more than five per cent equity stake in FBNH. Nigerian capital market rules set a threshold of five per cent for \u201cmaterial\u201d or significant shareholding, which must be disclosed to the regulatory authorities and the board of the affected company.\n\nFBNH currently has a total outstanding shareholding of 39.5 billion units and a market capitalization of N423.5 billion (over a billion dollars assuming official exchange rate). According to the 2020 FY report of the bank, 40 shareholders owned 31.03% of the bank while no individual shareholder held more than 5% of the bank.\n\nIt is believed that Otedola now owns over 5% of the bank through his proxies and investing vehicles,, thereby setting himself up to be the single largest shareholder of the bank.\n\nSources conversant with happenings and dealers at the stock market confirmed that business mogul might have acquired more than two billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each in FBNH in a series of secondary transactions that heightened with a major cross deal two weeks ago.\n\nFor instance, Otedola was believed to be the proxy buyer in a N7.57 billion cross deal at the NGX on October 07, 2021. A total of 473 million shares of FBNH were crossed at N16 per share, significantly above the market price.\n\nThe transaction was registered as a \u201cnegotiated cross deal\u201d by FBNQuest Securities Limited, implying that the deal was already concluded between the parties and was merely taken to the market to formalise the transaction.\n\nAlao, a Marina, Lagos-based stockbroking firm confirmed to a major daily that it sold several millions of shares to Otedola in multiple secondary market transactions, deals that popped up the firm and FBN Holdings as largest dealer and most active stock in recent days.\n\nSome of the deals included shares held by an estranged long-standing director of the group, who lost a major boardroom squabble recently and under regulatory review.\n\nVanguard quoted some of the shareholders of the bank who pleaded anonymity as saying: \u201cIf it is true that he is now the single majority shareholder it means that Otedola must have taken opportunity of the crisis that rocked the Board of Directors of First Bank of Nigeria Holding, FBNH, Plc.\n\n\u201cOtedola sold his 75 per cent direct and indirect shareholding in Forte Oil in 2019 through a merger of his business Zenon Oil with previous African Petrified Oil and they became all the more curious as to what his next move would be. He didn\u2019t keep them guessing too long as he soon announced that he wanted to explore and maximize business opportunities in refining and petrochemicals.\u201d\n\nThe shareholders further said: \u201cEven though he also had investments in the real estate and financial sector, Otedola singled out First Bank for the single reason that there wasn\u2019t exactly one man calling the shots there, unlike in other new generation banks.\n\n\u201cHe wasted no time in taking advantage of the leadership crisis that rocked First Bank not too long ago leading to the Central Bank of Nigeria sacking both the chairman of the bank, Ibukun Awosika and Obafemi Otudeko, the chairman of FBN Holdings. Otedola made his movements, and today he is a better person as a result of them.\u201d\n\nAnother shareholder of the bank said\u201d Otedola made a decision to be the highest majority shareholder and approach those with bulk shares negotiate and buy from them. May be he also bought from the floor strategically.\u201d\n\nHowever, market pundits said the acquisitions by Otedola would possibly lead to no changes in the FBNH, citing corporate governance structure at the banking group, diverse shareholding and CBN regulations. As against other non-financial institutions, CBN reserves the primary approval right for any appointment unto the board and management of a regulated financial institution.\n\n\u201cThis is not like the case of Forte Oil, he was practically the owner of Forte Oil but he is not holding the majority shares in FBNH, and I don\u2019t think he has the financial muscle to attain a clear single controlling equity stake,\u201d a dealer at the stock market said.\n\nFBNH reported a profit after tax of N38 billion in the first half of 2021 up from N35 billion same period in 2020. Many believe that based on his antecedents from previously acquired entities, majority ownership of FBNH by an Otedola backed entity will probably usher in a transformation in the bank. This is expected to boost investor confidence.\n\nThe investment maestro has a pedigree going for him especially after successfully turning around Forte Oil and then selling it to new owners. He also acquired Geregu Power Plant during the privatization of 2013m which is today touted as one of the most efficient plants in the country.",
          "summary": "BY EMEKA EJEREThe board of FBN Holdings Plc (FBNH) may soon witness an adjustment to reflect a major change in the ownership structure of the holding company for First Bank of Nigeria Limited (FBN).\nIt had said, \u201cThe attention of FBN Holdings Plc has been drawn to media reports today (Friday) that a certain individual has acquired significant shareholding interest in FBN Holdings Plc.\n\u201cAs a listed company, the shares of FBN Holdings are publicly traded, and sale and acquisition of shares is expected in the normal course of business.\nAccording to the 2020 FY report of the bank, 40 shareholders owned 31.03% of the bank while no individual shareholder held more than 5% of the bank.\n\u201cHe wasted no time in taking advantage of the leadership crisis that rocked First Bank not too long ago leading to the Central Bank of Nigeria sacking both the chairman of the bank, Ibukun Awosika and Obafemi Otudeko, the chairman of FBN Holdings.",

We did that in Edo and Ondo states and\n\nthere was no complaint. So with electronic transmission of result and\n\nelectronic collation and parties adopting direct primaries for the\n\nchoice of flag bearers, the issue of violence during campaigns will be\n\neliminated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis will give both men and women equal opportunity to contest for\n\nelective positions and the winners will now be based on merit; not by\n\nrigging nor by manipulation of results,\u201d Madami posited.\n\nFor his part, the JAMB registrar, Prof. Oloyede said: \u201cThe adoption of gender politics by the government\n\nshould encourage more women participation in politics. And it is a\n\ncollective responsibility to allow women to play their on roles in\n\nnation building through politics.\n\nAs the 2023 general elections approach, there is the need to sensitise Nigerians to let women play more active roles.\n\n\u201cThough 49.4 percent Nigerians are said to be women, but they\n\nrepresented 11.36 percent of 2870 women whose names appeared on the\n\n2019 nominated candidates list.\n\nAs a matter, it has been revealed that the 2019 elections were the\n\nworst for Nigerian women in nearly two decades representatively.\n\n\u201cApart of the fact that six female presidential candidates withdrew\n\nfrom the race for various reasons, a state like Lagos where women had\n\nalways been deputy governors has slided into more patriarchy with the\n\nelection of a male deputy governor at the end of 2019 governorship\n\nrace.\n\n\u201cCreating more room for women participation in politics requires\n\nlegal, social and political intervention. From the legal angle, the 35\n\npercent affirmative action may be enacted as law just as it was done\n\nin Senegal and in Kenya too where women got just 30 percent before\n\nthey parity of 50 percent in politics.\n\nSocially, there may be need for men to be more receptive to the idea\n\nof women attending political meetings especially those that hold in\n\nthe day. There is no law that requires political meetings to hold at\n\nnight during which many respectable women would be expected to be at\n\nhome.\u201d",

Besides, democracy and related democratic activities in the build-up to elections are necessarily rowdy and very argumentative, but very much within the limits of freedom of action that the art of democracy permits.\n\n\u2018\u2018As you settle down in the face of these developments, it is my hope that you will also be guided by diplomatic practices, to ensure that your activities remain within the limits of your profession,\u2019\u2019 President Buhari said.\n\nThe President told the newly accredited envoys that he looked forward to a more robust relationship with each of their countries.\n\nHe declared that Nigeria is open to more foreign direct investments in the Education, Health, Transportation and Agricultural sectors, and would welcome improved bilateral relations, especially in wider trading and cultural contacts.\n\nThe President acknowledged that while Nigeria enjoys very cordial bilateral relations with the aforementioned countries, their diplomatic representatives must work harder to enhance this level of relationship in the interest of the peoples of our countries.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is my hope that, as you settle down to your responsibilities of promoting unity, amity, enhanced understanding, better economic opportunities and the pursuit of peace between your respective countries and the Federal Government of Nigeria, you will make it a point of duty to appreciate our country\u2019s diversity as a source of not only pride but advantage as we are definitely stronger together.\n\n\u2018\u2018You will find in us as people, the level of vibrancy that defines us, as uniquely Nigerian, eager to make friends, learn other people\u2019s way of living and imbued with great appetite for adaptation.\n\n\u2018\u2018Excellencies, the world will definitely be a better place and much easier place to live in if all cultivate the culture of patience and tolerance in order to appreciate the values of each of us and the contributions that we all can make, for sustainable peace and development, globally,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn security, President Buhari told the ambassadors that more partnerships were needed to fully overcome daunting challenges in the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018As a Government and as a nation, we continue to make steady progress despite daunting challenges, notably in the area of security.\n\n\u2018\u2018Different factors accounted for this, amongst which are, first, that insecurity linked to terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, cybercrimes, and maritime issues, are transborder acts that go beyond the abilities of any single country to effectively contain.\n\n\u2018\u2018That is why, matters of security have become the business of all the nations of the world to work together to overcome. Second, our borders are very long and porous, and their effective policing has become a daunting challenge.\n\n\u2018\u2018Third, easy circulation of small arms and light weapons, from the Sahel-Libya axis and the Central African region, have made access to these weapons readily available which inevitably compounds our national and regional security.\n\n\u2018\u2018Despite these huge challenges, concerted efforts by Government and our Armed Forces have accounted for the largely degraded capacities of terrorists across the country,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe newly accredited Ambassadors are Matsunaga Kazuyoshi (Japan), Leena Pylvanainen (Finland), Samuela Isopi (European Union), Maria Jeanne Ntakirutimana (Burundi) Monsieur Sune Krogstrup (Denmark), Sile Maguire (Ireland), Belarmino Silva (Cape Verde), Ali Ghanem Ali Alfahed Alhajri (Qatar) and Emmanuella Blatmann (France).\n\nThe High Commissioners are Sydney Dowu Davies (Sierra Leone) and Alhaji Rashid Bawa (Ghana).\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Ambassadors, the Japanese Ambassador pledged that they are willing to strengthen existing bilateral relations with Nigeria, assuring that they would work together and explore ways to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe wished the President good health and prosperity for Nigeria.",
          "summary": "President Muhammadu Buhari has urged foreign envoys in Nigeria to be guided by diplomatic practices to ensure that their activities remain within the limits of their profession in their reaction to political issues in the country as the 2023 general elections draws near.\nFemi Adesina, the spokesperson for the President in a statement quoted Buhari as telling the envoys that they were assuming diplomatic responsibilities in Nigeria at a very interesting political period.\nThe momentum for enhanced political activities is therefore expected to commence soon.\nThe President told the newly accredited envoys that he looked forward to a more robust relationship with each of their countries.\nOn security, President Buhari told the ambassadors that more partnerships were needed to fully overcome daunting challenges in the country.",

          "title": "eNaira Can Increase Nigeria\u2019s GDP By $29bn In 10 Years \u2014 President Buhari",
          "text": "Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) has stated that the Central Bank Digital Currency, eNaira, and its underlying blockchain technology can boost Nigeria\u2019s GDP by $29 billion over the next ten years.\n\nThis is as he said the currency will help move many more people and businesses from the informal into the formal sector, thereby increasing the country\u2019s tax base.\n\nBuhari said this on Monday in Abuja during the official launch of the eNaira.\n\nIn his address, the President said the currency will help increase remittances, foster cross border trade, improve financial inclusion, make Monetary Policy more effective, and enable the government to send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare programmes.\n\n\u201cIn recent times, Your Excellencies, the use of physical cash in conducting business and making payments has been on the decline. This trend has been exacerbated by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resurgence of a new Digital Economy.\n\n\u201cAlongside these developments, businesses, households, and other economic agents have sought for new means of making payments in the new circumstances.\n\n\u201cThe absence of a swift and effective solution to these requirements, as well as fears that Central Banks\u2019 actions sometimes lead to hyperinflation, created the space for non-government entities to establish new forms of \u2018private currencies\u2019 that seemed to have gained popularity and acceptance across the world, including here in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the president, these realities prompted the Central Bank of Nigeria to explore issuing Nigeria\u2019s own Central Bank Digital Currency, named the eNaira.\n\n\u201cWhile the journey to create a digital currency for Nigeria began sometime in 2017, work intensified over the past several months with several brainstorming exercises, deployment of technical partners and advisers, collaboration with the Ministries of Communication and Digital Economy and its sister agencies like the Nigerian Communications Commission, integration of banking software across the country and painstaking tests to ensure the robustness, safety and scalability of the CBDC System.\n\n\u201cAside from the global trend to create Digital Currencies, we believe that there are Nigeria-specific benefits that cut across different sectors of and concerns of the economy. The use of CBDCs can help move many more people and businesses from the informal into the formal sector, thereby increasing the tax base of the country.\n\n\u201cAlongside digital innovations, CBDCs can foster economic growth through better economic activities. Indeed, some estimates indicate that the adoption of CBDC and its underlying technology, called blockchain, can increase Nigeria\u2019s GDP by US$29 billion over the next 10 years,\u201d he asserted.\n\nThe President added that CBDCs will also help increase remittances, foster cross border trade, improve financial inclusion, make Monetary Policy more effective, and enable the government to send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare programmes.\n\n\u201cIt is on these bases that I am delighted to officially launch the Central Bank of Nigeria Digital Currency, called the eNaira, and in so doing, we have become the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world to introduce a Digital Currency to her citizens,\u201d the President said.\n\nBuhari, therefore, commended the Governor of the Central Bank, Godwin Emefiele, his Deputies and the entire team of staff who worked towards the launch of the eNaira.\n\nOn his part, Emefiele said since the eNaira platform went live, there has been overwhelming interest and encouraging response from Nigerians and other parties across the world with over 2.5 million daily visits to the website.\n\nHe said, \u201c33 banks are fully integrated and live on the platform, N500m has been successfully minted by the Bank, N200m has been issued to financial institutions, over 2,000 customers have been onboarded and over 120 merchants have successfully registered on the eNaira platform\u201d.\n\nThe CBN governor also used the occasion to commend the President for \u201cmaking history, yet again,\u201d with the launch of the eNaira\u2013the first in Africa and one of the earliest around the world.\n\n\u201cMr. President, as you make groundbreaking reforms, there has been continuing debate on the true value of the Naira. Rather than worry today about the direction of the exchange rate, let us take a step back and analyze how we got here in the first place.\n\n\u201cPlease recall that since the advent of the International Monetary Fund-led Structural Adjustment Programme in 1986, and the introduction of the Second Tier Foreign Exchange Market, the Naira has been on a one-way free fall from parity to the US Dollar in 1984 to over N410/USD today.\n\n\u201dSome 35 years later, we have not been able to achieve the many promises and objectives of that programme,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also lamented the \u201cwidespread import dependency,\u201d which has wiped out most of Nigeria\u2019s production and manufacturing bases and exported jobs in the process.\n\n\u201cUnder your leadership, Mr. President, we must stop this decline for good! We must return to massive homemade production; we must get our people working again. We must create an economic environment for massive domestic production and significant non-oil exports.\n\n\u201cAs custodians of your national reserves, let me first assure you that there is no cause for alarm. Our FX reserves are strong and indeed getting stronger by the day, crossing the 40 billion USD mark, and is one of the highest in Africa \u2013 and growing,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to the policies and actions of the CBN to support the economy especially through the pandemic, Emefiele announced a new financial instrument titled \u201cThe 100 for 100 PPP \u2013 Policy on Production and Productivity,\u201d which, he said, will be anchored in the Development Finance Department under his direct supervision.\n\nHe explained that under this policy the CBN would advertise, screen, scrutinise and financially support 100 targeted private sector companies in 100 days, beginning from 01 November 2021, and rolling over every 100 days with a new set of 100 companies, whose names will be published in National Dailies for Nigerians to verify and confirm.\n\nAttending the launch were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, Members of the Federal Executive Council, the Governor and Deputy Governors of the Central Bank, and Heads of Relevant Agencies.",

          "title": "Stop Holding Press Conferences, Bring Evidence Against Kanu To Court \u2014IPOB Lawyer Slams Buhari\u2019s Minister, Malami",
          "text": "Aloy Ejimakor, a special counsel for IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu, has stated that the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), has a responsibility to provide justice for Nigerians and foreigners in the country, not to defend President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s dictatorship.\n\nThe IPOB leader\u2019s lawyer also said Malami, being a legal practitioner should bring any evidence he has against Kanu to the court of law, instead of holding press conferences that are biased against the IPOB leader.\n\nEjimakor said this while speaking in an exclusive interview with BBC Pidgin at the weekend.\n\nHe further revealed that there was no Panel of Enquiry inaugurated after the #EndSARS protests that indicted Kanu or IPOB for causing violence, adding that the AGF\u2019s allegations are prejudiced and without evidence.\n\nEjimakor disclosed that Kanu\u2019s legal team was studying the contents of the press conference to decide if to take legal actions against Malami.\n\nHe said, \u201cYou have asked me about the press conference done by the Attorney-General on Friday. It\u2019s quite surprising that a day after this hearing, the Attorney-General saw the occasion to address the conference. The Attorney-General should be reminded that despite his duality of role under the Nigerian constitution, he is the attorney-general of everybody.\n\n\u201cHis job is not regime protection, his job is to uphold the law and see that justice is done to every Nigerian citizen and even foreigners who happen to find themselves in Nigeria. What he appears to be saying on Friday is akin to saying a witch cries at night and the baby dies in the morning, therefore the witch kills the baby.\n\n\u201cThe real arguments of these allegations are without substance and he never presented any evidence. And we have this particular one concerning the EndSARS protest. We had commissions of enquiry across the country, particularly in Lagos, and they had one in Imo State as well that I personally know about. And there was nothing from any of these commissions of enquiry that returned an indictment of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu or IPOB in the aftermath of the EndSARS protest.\n\n\u201cSo, that accusation was made in bad faith and is intended to poison the mind of the public and also to prejudice the minds of the quarters. It is a highly prejudicial interview and we are studying the content to see if there is going to be legal reactions that will come from our side.\n\nIf he has any evidence that our client was caught in any wrongdoing or criminality, he should know better than anybody else that the platform to present such evidence is the court of law. Not calling press conferences.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Government had accused Kanu of being responsible for the murder of Chike Akunyili, the widower of the late Director-General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Dora Akunyili.\n\nDora Akunyili was also the information minister during the tenure of the late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua.\n\nThe claim was made by a committee set up by President Muhammadu Buhari to investigate Kanu, who is standing trial for terrorism-related Offences.\n\nThe committee is headed by Malami, who announced the alleged atrocities at a press conference last Friday.\n\nThe 24 members of the committee were drawn from the Federal Ministry of Justice (MoJ), Federal Ministry of Information (MoI), Nigeria Police Force (NPF), Department of State Services (DSS), National Intelligence Agency (NIA), and Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA).\n\nChike Akunyili, the widower of the late Prof. Dora Akunyili\u2019s was shot dead by unknown gunmen in September 2021.\n\nThe government also accused Kanu of being responsible for the murder of a former Presidential Aide, Ahmad Gulak, and over 177 other cases in the South-East.\n\nThe committee said IPOB and its military wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN), followed Kanu\u2019s directives and carried out massive attacks on democratic institutions, especially facilities of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), intending to hamper the democratic process in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the report, the attacks that were carried out between October 2020 and June 2021 led to the killing of 175 security personnel.\n\nThe report read in part, \u201cActing on the instigating directives of Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB members and #EndSARS protesters attacked and killed many security agents, destroyed several public and private properties, including police stations, public transport buses and other facilities across the country.\n\n\u201cThat on October 21, 2020, Nnamdi Kanu through an online call-in radio programme (Radio Biafra), further instigated IPOB members to burn down all police stations and kill government security forces, which was carried out, and security personnel (especially police officers) were killed and public and private properties destroyed.\n\n\u201cThat 175 security personnel were killed by IPOB/ESN, comprising 128 policemen, 37 military personnel and 10 other security operatives. Killing of prominent Nigerians: Recently there were gruesome killings of traditional leaders: Obi 1 of Okwudor autonomous community, Eze E. AnayochukwuDurueburuo and Eze Sampson Osunwa of Ihebineowerre autonomous community as well as the killings of Dr. Chike Akunyili and eight others as well as the killing of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak on May 30, 2021.\u201d\n\nThe committee alleged that Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s broadcasts led to 19 attacks on INEC facilities that resulted in the destruction of offices as well as burning of 18 INEC logistical vehicles, several election materials, equipment and ICT gadgets in Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Anambra, Cross River, Enugu, Ebonyi and Imo states.\n\nThe Presidential committee stated that 164 police stations and formations, including police Headquarters, Owerri, Imo State were attacked by IPOB/ESN leading to the death of 128 policemen while 144 were injured and 628 vehicles were destroyed.\n\nIt said 396 firearms and 17,738 ammunition were carted away during the IPOB/ESN attacks.",

Thus, the association is interested and is a necessary party to be joined.\n\n\u201cThat it will serve the interest of justice if the honourable court grants the application and joins the applicants as defendants in the suit and that the plaintiffs will not be prejudiced if the application is granted\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Justice Inyang Eden Ekwo has fixed November 1 for a hearing of the suit.\n\nIn the main suit, the Northern Elders prayed the court for the following reliefs:\n\n*A declaration that by the combined effect of the provisions of Section 4 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), and Articles 1, 2, and 20(1) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act 2004, the 4th defendant (the National Assembly) is empowered to set in motion a framework for a referendum to allow the South-eastern region of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to decide on their bid for self-determination.\n\n*An order directing the 2nd, 3rd and 4th defendants to provide a framework that will pave way for the self-determination of the South-eastern states so as to leave the geographical entity called Nigeria before any further step is taken to further amend the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria can be further amended at any time after the question of self-determination must have been resolved by Nigerians.\u201d",

It was between the Senate President, INEC chairman and Buni.\n\n\u201dThese three had earlier met but with Governor (Abubakar) Bagudu of Kebbi State and Jigawa State Governor (Mohammed Abubakar) at the same venue some three months ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cINEC chair, who is supposed to be neutral is now meeting secretly with top members of the ruling party (APC),\u201d another source told SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that some of the high-profile politicians in the South-East region had started spending big to manipulate the forthcoming Anambra State governorship poll.\n\nAccording to the report, among the politicians is a serving South-East governor, \u201ccurrently in the opposition, who reportedly paid $4 million (roughly N1,640,000,000) to manipulate the elections to favour his candidate in the elections.\u201d\n\nOn November 6, Anambra State residents will go to the polls to decide the next governor of the state.\n\nThere have been allegations that the violence going on in some parts of the state is sponsored by some unruly politicians to favour their candidates.\n\nAn investigation shows that a serving South-East Governor in an opposition party, who is hell-bent on ensuring that his candidate wins, doled out $4 million (which had since been disbursed in tranches of $3 million and $1 million) to a commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nThe commissioner who is also from the South-East and has a strong influence on logistics, in turn, allegedly used the funds to \u201csettle\u201d other key officers to ensure that the election goes the way of their preferred candidate.\n\n\u201cYou see, a ranking opposition Governor in the South-East zone of the country has mobilised huge funds to the tune of 4 million US dollars to compromise the governorship election in Anambra State slated for Saturday, November 6, 2021.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nAnambra Election: South-East Governor Doles Out $4million To Electoral Body, INEC Official To Favour Candidate\n\n8 Comments1 Week Ago\n\n\u201cIn fact, an influential INEC National Commissioner is serving as a courier for the said desperate chief executive, who wants his candidate to emerge victorious, by hook or crook. This South-East commissioner even shares some educational history with the Governor\u2019s preferred candidate as they both attended an institution together.\n\n\u201cThe other commissioners and many Electoral Officers have also been compromised,\u201d a source had revealed.\n\nAnother source alleged that the wife of the said state chief executive is said to be mainly coordinating the \u2018local\u2019 aspects of the plan as she has been lobbying and holding \u2018nocturnal\u2019 meetings with some of the electoral officers.\n\nA source was quoted as saying: \u201cWe are aware that a very powerful woman is also playing a fundamental role in this whole equation designed to compromise election at a time stakeholders are all unanimous on the need to sanitise the electoral process.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some security sources disclosed that they were aware and efforts were already in place to block all attempts to compromise the electoral exercise.\n\n\u201cRest assured that we will not allow the November 6 Anambra poll to be compromised.\n\n\u201cAt the appropriate time, we will take in those involved,\u201d a top security official said.",

          "title": "Buhari reveals how eNaira will boost Nigeria\u2019s economy",
          "text": "The adoption of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and its underlying technology, called block chain, can increase Nigeria\u2019s GDP by $29billion over the next 10 years, President Muhammadu Buhari said Monday in Abuja at the official launch of the eNaira.\n\nThe President also declared that the introduction of the eNaira would enable the government to send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare programmes as well as foster cross border trade.\n\nHe said alongside digital innovations, CBDCs can foster economic growth through better economic activities, increase remittances, improve financial inclusion and make monetary policy more effective.\n\n\u201dLet me note that aside from the global trend to create Digital Currencies, we believe that there are Nigeria-specific benefits that cut across different sectors of, and concerns of the economy.\n\n\u201dThe use of CBDCs can help move many more people and businesses from the informal into the formal sector, thereby increasing the tax base of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President said with the launch of eNaira, Nigeria has become the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world to introduce a Digital Currency to her citizens.\n\nHe commended the Governor of the Central Bank, Godwin Emefiele, his deputies and the entire team of staff who worked tirelessly to make the launch of Africa\u2019s first digital currency a reality.\n\nThe President, who assured Nigerians of the safety and scalability of the CBDC system, said the journey to create a digital currency for Nigeria began sometime in 2017.\n\n\u201dWork intensified over the past several months with several brainstorming exercises, deployment of technical partners and advisers, collaboration with the Ministries of Communication and Digital Economy and its sister agencies like the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), integration of banking software across the country and painstaking tests to ensure the robustness, safety and scalability of the CBDC System,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe President also explained to Nigerians why he approved the use of the digital currency.\n\n\u201dIn recent times, the use of physical cash in conducting business and making payments has been on the decline. This trend has been exacerbated by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resurgence of a new Digital Economy.\n\n\n\n\u201dAlongside these developments, businesses, households, and other economic agents have sought for new means of making payments in the new circumstances.\n\n\u201dThe absence of a swift and effective solution to these requirements, as well as fears that Central Banks\u2019 actions sometimes lead to hyperinflation created the space for non-government entities to establish new forms of \u201cprivate currencies\u201d that seemed to have gained popularity and acceptance across the world, including here in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201dIn response to these developments, an overwhelming majority of Central Banks across the world have started to consider issuing digital currencies in order to cater for businesses and households seeking faster, safer, easier and cheaper means of payments.\n\n\u201dA handful of countries including China, Bahamas, and Cambodia have already issued their own CBDCs. A 2021 survey of Central Banks around the world by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that almost 90 per cent are actively researching the potential for CBDCs, 60 percent were experimenting with the technology and 14 per cent were deploying pilot projects.\n\n\u201dNeedless to add, close monitoring and close supervision will be necessary in the early stages of implementation to study the effect of eNaira on the economy as a whole.\n\n\n\n\u201dIt is on the basis of this that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sought and received my approval to explore issuing Nigeria\u2019s own Central Bank Digital Currency, named the eNaira,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President said his approval was also underpinned by the fact that the CBN has been a leading innovator \u2018\u2018in the form of money they produce, and in the payment services they deploy for efficient transactions.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said Nigeria\u2019s apex bank has invested heavily in creating a Payment System that is ranked in the top ten in the world and certainly the best in Africa.\n\n\n\n\u201dThis payment system now provides high\u2010value and time\u2010critical payment services to financial institutions, and ultimately serves as the backbone for every electronic payment in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201dThey have also supported several private\u2010sector initiatives to improve the existing payments landscape, and in turn, have created some of the world\u2019s leading payment service providers today,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Mr Godwin Emefiele explained that eNaira is Nigeria\u2019s CBDC and it is the digital equivalent of the physical Naira.\n\n\u201dAs the tagline simply encapsulates, the eNaira is the same Naira with far more possibilities. The eNaira \u2013 like the physical Naira \u2013 is a legal tender in Nigeria and a liability of the CBN. The eNaira and Naira will have the same value and will always be exchanged at 1 naira to 1 eNaira,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHe said the CBN has given careful consideration to the entire\n\npayments and financial architecture and has designed the eNaira to complement and strengthen these ecosystems and has implemented secure safeguards and policies to maintain the integrity of the financial system.\n\nHe pledged that there would be strict adherence to the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards in order to preserve the integrity and stability of Nigeria\u2019s payment system.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, since the eNaira platform went live, there has been overwhelming interest and encouraging response from Nigerians and other parties across the world with over 2.5 million daily visits to the website.\n\n\n\nHe listed the following milestones: \u201c33 banks are fully integrated and live on the platform, 500 million has been successfully minted by the Bank, N200 million has been issued to financial institutions, over 2,000 customers have been onboarded and over 120 merchants have successfully registered on the eNaira platform.\u201d\n\nThe CBN governor also used the occasion to commend President Buhari for making history, yet again, with the launch of the eNaira \u2013 the first in Africa and one of the earliest around the world.\n\n\n\nHe also dispelled fears on the nation\u2019s foreign reserves, saying the reserves are strong and getting stronger by the day.\n\n\u201dMr. President, as you make ground breaking reforms, there have been continuing debate on the true value of the Naira. Rather than worry today on the direction of the exchange rate, let us take a step back and analyze how we got here in the first place.\n\n\n\n\u201dPlease recall that since the advent of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) led Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) in 1986, and the introduction of the Second Tier Foreign Exchange (SFEM) market, the Naira has been on a one-way free fall from parity to the US Dollar in 1984 to over N410/USD today.\n\n\u201dSome 35 years later, we have not been able to achieve the many promises and objectives of that programme.\n\n\n\n\u201dInstead, what we have seen is widespread import dependency, which has wiped out most of our production and manufacturing bases and exported all our jobs in the process.\n\n\u201dWhat has happened to the massive textile factories across our nation such that we import almost all cotton products when we are rich in cotton?\n\n\u201dWhat has happened to our vehicle assembly plants across the nation such that we import most vehicles and have become a massive dumping ground for dying second-hand vehicles?\n\n\n\n\u201dWhat has happened to our rubber plantations through which we made the best tyres and rubber products in the world? What has happened to our groundnut pyramids? What has happened to our Cocoa farms? What has happened to our palm oil mills?\n\n\u201dUnder your leadership, Mr. President, we must stop this decline for good! We must return to massive homemade production; we must get our people working again. We must create the economic environment for massive domestic production and significant non-oil exports.\n\n\u201dAs custodians of your national reserves, let me first assure you that there is no cause for alarm. Our FX reserves are strong and indeed getting stronger by the day, crossing the 40 billion USD mark, and is one of the highest in Africa \u2013 and growing.\n\n\n\n\u201dBut we cannot fritter our reserves away on cheap imports and currency speculators. We must return to an employment-led growth anchored on productivity and rewarding producers of local goods, services, innovation and new technologies.\n\n\n\n\u201dIf you consume cheap imports and export our jobs, we will make you pay dearly; but if you produce locally \u2013 with little or no foreign inputs beyond machinery, we will support you, and the markets will reward you abundantly,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to all policies and actions of the CBN to support the economy especially through the trying times of COVID-19, Emefiele announced a new financial instrument titled \u201cThe 100 for 100 PPP \u2013 Policy on Production and Productivity,\u201d which will be anchored in the Development Finance Department under his direct supervision.\n\n\n\nHe explained that under this policy the CBN would advertise, screen, scrutinize and financially support 100 targeted private sector companies in 100 days, beginning from 01 November 2021, and rolling over every 100 days with new set of 100 companies, whose names will be published in National Dailies for Nigerians to verify and confirm.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has said Nigeria\u2019s new digital currency, eNaira, will increase the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product by $29 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nThe President said this on Monday at the unveiling of eNaira at the State House.\n\nAccording to the President, the launch of eNaira makes Nigeria the first country in Africa and one of the first few countries globally to introduce a digital currency.\n\nThe new payment system, which took the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) four years to roll out, is expected to drive financial inclusion, serve as a backbone for electronic payment in Nigeria and also enable the movement of more people from the informal to the formal sector, hence scaling up the tax base of the country.\n\nREAD ALSO: Buhari Launches Digital Currency eNaira\n\n\ufeff\n\nPresident Buhari also expects it to enable the government send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare programmes as well as foster cross-border trade, a statement signed by presidential spokesperson Femi Adesina said.\n\n\u201dLet me note that aside from the global trend to create Digital Currencies, we believe that there are Nigeria-specific benefits that cut across different sectors of, and concerns of the economy,\u201d the President noted.\n\n\u201dThe use of CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) can help move many more people and businesses from the informal into the formal sector, thereby increasing the tax base of the country.\u201d\n\nThe President also commended the Governor of the Central Bank, Godwin Emefiele, his deputies and the entire team of staff who worked tirelessly to make the launch of Africa\u2019s first digital currency a reality.\n\n\u201dWork intensified over the past several months with several brainstorming exercises, deployment of technical partners and advisers, collaboration with the Ministries of Communication and Digital Economy and its sister agencies like the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), integration of banking software across the country and painstaking tests to ensure the robustness, safety and scalability of the CBDC System, \u201d he said.\n\nWhy eNaira?\n\nThe President also used the occasion of the unveiling of the eNaira to explain why he approved the use of the digital currency.\n\n\u201cIn recent times, the use of physical cash in conducting business and making payments has been on the decline. This trend has been exacerbated by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resurgence of a new Digital Economy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201dAlongside these developments, businesses, households, and other economic agents have sought for new means of making payments in the new circumstances.\n\n\u201dThe absence of a swift and effective solution to these requirements, as well as fears that Central Banks\u2019 actions sometimes lead to hyperinflation created the space for non-government entities to establish new forms of \u2018private currencies\u2019 that seemed to have gained popularity and acceptance across the world, including here in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn response to these developments, an overwhelming majority of Central Banks across the world have started to consider issuing digital currencies in order to cater for businesses and households seeking faster, safer, easier and cheaper means of payments.\n\n\u201dA handful of countries including China, Bahamas, and Cambodia have already issued their own CBDCs.\n\n\u201dA 2021 survey of Central Banks around the world by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that almost 90 per cent are actively researching the potential for CBDCs, 60 percent were experimenting with the technology and 14 per cent were deploying pilot projects.\n\n\u201dNeedless to add, close monitoring and close supervision will be necessary in the early stages of implementation to study the effect of eNaira on the economy as a whole.\n\n\u201dIt is on the basis of this that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sought and received my approval to explore issuing Nigeria\u2019s own Central Bank Digital Currency, named the eNaira.\u201d",

          "text": "Chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (Retd) has charged officers and men of the Agency\u2019s Strike Force Corps to go all out and root out drug barons and cartels from their hideouts across the country.\n\nThe retired army general gave the charge at the special operations training graduation ceremony for 143 officers of the Strike Force Corps at the Nigerian Army School of Infantry, NASI, Jaji, Kaduna state on Monday\n\nAccording to the NDLEA boss, \u201cthe drug scourge in Nigeria is unacceptable with almost 15 million Nigerians abusing substances, 20 percent of who are addicted, which is three times the global average. We\u2019re conscious of our job to block and prevent availability of narcotic drugs, and that necessitated the formation of the Strike Force to enhance our capability for complex operations. The Strike Force is the tip of our spear in our interdiction efforts and as such we must keep the tip sharpened and always ready to strike because we need to be two steps ahead of drug barons and cartels operating in the country.\n\n\u201cWith the training and graduation of these officers and men today, we serve a notice to the drug barons and cartels who are yet to get the message to quit the criminal trade that these well trained officers and men are coming to smoke them out as a formidable force anywhere in the country. As we equip and arm you well, be ruthless with the criminal gangs and merchants of death. Equally, I will implore you to display professionalism, discipline and respect for human rights in your operations.\u201d He added that another batch of officers and men of NDLEA would be sent to NASI for similar training in the coming weeks.\n\nMr Marwa commended the Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen. Faruk Yahaya, and the Armed Forces for the successes recorded so far in the fight against insecurity in the country. He tasked them not to rest on their oars \u201cbecause fighting insecurity is not like a football match that ends at the end of 90 minutes.\u201d\n\nWhile reminding the new graduands of their position within the Agency, Gen. Marwa said \u201cNote that the special nature of your training will require you to serve as a force multiplier to the conventional NDLEA officers in the field.\n\n\u201cLet me warn you of the hazard along the way. It will come in various forms, ranging from physical assaults to stupendous temptations by traders and traffickers of illicit drugs. When the tempests arise, rise above them. Let your sense of duty remain uncompromised. Let patriotism prevail over pecuniary interest. Let no temptation prevent you from discharging your duties to the best of your ability. In whatever situation you find yourself, remember to not forgo your training about the rules of engagement, especially the respect for human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is also important that you always bear in mind that there is little or no margin of error in the execution of your task as the safety of all NDLEA officers on assignment, including yourself, will, at times, depend on the speed, accuracy and efficiency of the Strike Force team providing cover for the mission. On such occasion, your training will be called to test\u201d, he added.\n\nIn his remarks, Commandant, Nigerian Army School of Infantry, Maj. Gen. Ali, commended Marwa for repositioning NDLEA for efficiency and relevance within the country\u2019s security architecture.\n\nHe said the training, as the first of its kind will enhance the Agency\u2019s capability to handle more complex challenges in its task of tackling drug barons and cartels.\n\nOther top Army Chiefs at the ceremony include the Commander, Nigerian Army Infantry Corps, Major Gen. Victor Ezeugwu and Commandant, Martins Luther Agwai International Leadership and Peace Keeping Centre, Major Gen. A.J. Fagae among others.",

          "title": "US Urges North Korea to Stop Missile Tests and Return to Talks",
          "text": "A senior U.S. diplomat on Sunday urged North Korea to refrain from additional missile tests and resume nuclear diplomacy, days after the North fired off its first underwater-launched ballistic missile in two years.\n\nSung Kim, the U.S. envoy on North Korea, spoke after meeting with South Korean officials to discuss North Korea\u2019s recent missile tests while nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang remain stalled.\n\n\u201cWe call on the DPRK to cease these provocations and other destabilizing activities, and instead, engage in dialogue,\u201d Kim told reporters, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\n\n\u201cWe remain ready to meet with the DPRK without preconditions and we have made clear that the United States harbors no hostile intent towards the DPRK,\u201d he said.\n\nLast Tuesday, North Korea fired a newly developed ballistic missile from a submarine in its fifth round of weapons tests in recent weeks.\n\nSouth Korean officials said the submarine-fired missile appeared to be in an early stage of development. That marked the North\u2019s first underwater-launched test since October 2019, and the most high-profile one since President Joe Biden took office in January.\n\nMissiles fired from submarines are harder to detect in advance and would provide North Korea with a secondary, retaliatory attack capability.\n\nTuesday\u2019s launch violates multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions that ban any activity by North Korea in the area of ballistic missiles. Kim said the test poses a threat to the international community and is \u201cconcerning and counterproductive\u201d to efforts to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nKim\u2019s South Korean counterpart, Noh Kyu-duk, said the two had an \u201cin-depth\u201d discussion on Seoul\u2019s push for a symbolic declaration to end the 1950-53 Korean War as a way to bring peace. Noh said he and Kim also reaffirmed that North Korea\u2019s issues of concern can be discussed once talks are restarted.\n\nThe U.S.-led talks on ending North Korea\u2019s nuclear program have been largely stalled since early 2019, when a summit between then-President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un collapsed due to disputes over U.S.-led sanctions on the North.\n\nThe Biden administration has repeatedly said it\u2019s ready to meet North Korea \u201canywhere and at any time\u201d without preconditions. But North Korea says a return to talks is conditional on the U.S. dropping what it calls hostile policy, an apparent reference to the sanctions and regular military drills between Washington and Seoul.\n\nBefore the submarine missile launch, North Korea had also tested several other new weapons systems over a six-week period, including its longest-range cruise missile and a hypersonic missile currently under development.\n\nThose weapons potentially put U.S. allies South Korea and Japan within striking range. Some experts say North Korea may also in coming weeks test a missile that could reach the American homeland in order to maximize its pressure campaign on the United States.",
