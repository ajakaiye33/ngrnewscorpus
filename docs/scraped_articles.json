          "title": "Stop Buhari from spending N26bn on travels, meals, others, SERAP urges court",
          "text": "Human rights group, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, has filed a lawsuit asking the Federal High Court in Abuja to stop the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), from spending \u201cN26bn in the 2022 presidency budget on local and foreign travels, meals and refreshments, \u2018sitting allowance\u2019, \u2018welfare package\u2019, and office building.\u201d\n\nThis was contained in a suit with number FHC/ABJ/CS/1361/2021 filed last Friday.\n\nIn the suit, SERAP is seeking \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel President Buhari to cut the N26bn presidency budget on local and foreign travels, meals and refreshments, and to send a supplementary appropriation bill to the National Assembly to reflect the reduction.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also seeking \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel President Buhari to publish spending details on the State House Medical Center since May 29, 2015, to date; and to redirect some of the money on travels and meals to improve public healthcare facilities across the country.\u201d\n\nThe rights group is arguing that \u201cthe government would continue to borrow to fund the country\u2019s budget until there is a substantial cut to the cost of governance. It is in the public interest to stop the government from spending so much money on these items. Persistent borrowing is neither sustainable nor fair to the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cThe huge spending by the presidency is neither necessary nor in the public interest, especially in the face of the country\u2019s dire economic position, the scant allocations to education and health, and the growing level of borrowing by the Federal Government to fund the 2022 budget.\u201d\n\nAlso, the group said, \u201cThe Buhari administration has constitutional and fiduciary duties to ensure a responsible budget spending and the well-being and prosperity of Nigerians. Some of the proposed spendings could be better allocated to improve access of poor Nigerians to basic public goods and services.\u201d\n\nIn a further argument, SERAP said, \u201cAny spending of public funds should stay within the limits of constitutional responsibilities, and oath of office by public officers, as well as comply with Chapter 2 of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution [as amended] relating to fundamental objectives and directive principles of state policy.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also arguing that \u201cunless the reliefs sought are granted, the Federal Government will continue to benefit from the breach of the law, and the proposed spending of N26bn would leave the poorest and most vulnerable people without access to essential public goods and services, and burden the next generation.\u201d\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Ms Adelanke Aremo read in part, \u201cCutting waste and apparently, unnecessary spending would go a long way in addressing the budget deficit and debt problems.\n\n\u201cStopping President Buhari from spending the proposed N26bn on travels and meals would ensure that the government is spending the country\u2019s maximum available resources to respect, protect, and promote the rights to basic needs of the poor and marginalized groups.\n\n\u201cThe proposed spending is unsustainable and would take away critical funding to provide access to quality healthcare and education.\n\n\u201cPublic officers are mere custodians of public records. Nigerians are entitled to know how the commonwealth is being utilized, managed and administered in a democratic setting.\n\n\u201cAccording to reports, the proposed N26bn on travels, meals, refreshments and the presidential wing of the State House Clinic is more than the proposed allocations for ongoing and new projects in 14 teaching hospitals combined. N19.17 billion is allocated to the following teaching hospitals: UNILAG Teaching Hospital\u2014N1.69bn; ABU Teaching Hospital\u2014N2.38bn; University College Hospital, Ibadan\u2014N1.49bn; and UNN Teaching Hospital\u2014N1.38bn.\n\n\u201cUNIBEN Teaching Hospital\u2014N1.35bn; OAU Teaching Hospital\u2014N1.35bn; UNILORIN Teaching Hospital\u2014N982m; UNIJOS Teaching Hospital\u2014N908m; University of Port Harcourt\u2014N1.14bn; UNIMAID Teaching Hospital\u2014N986m; Dan Fodio University Teaching Hospital\u2014N987m; Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital\u2014N2.49bn; UNIABUJA Teaching Hospital\u2014N1.90bn; and ATBU Teaching Hospital\u2014N947m.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Mr Mohammed Bello-Koko, Acting Managing Director of Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), has said that the two Lagos seaports located in Lekki and Tin Can Island were operating \u201cfar beyond their installed capacities\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat it simply means is that if they were built to handle 500,000 Twenty Foot Equivalent Units (TEUs), for instance, probably they are now handling about 700, 000 TEUs,\u201d he told newsmen on Sunday in Lagos.\n\nHe said that the situation had led to massive congestion worsened by the fact that the city had caught up with the ports.\n\n\u201cThere is no space to expand the ports. What we need to do is to improve on the activities in the ports, in terms of efficiency.\n\n\u201cIn 2006, when NPA concessioned the terminals, there was a Development Plan between the NPA and the terminal operators and that development plan included both physical development and the deployment of equipment.\n\n\u201cThe terminal operators have met those agreements and everything has evolved, but there is need for bigger and more efficient equipment, better Information Technology IT systems, and so on.\n\n\u201cWe have seen an improvement in terms of efficiency; there is increase in efficiency. But there is room for more. We have observed system downtime in one or two of the terminals, especially the APM Terminals, which is one of the terminals.\n\n\u201cWhenever APM Terminal system is down, it causes a lot of backlog in terms of traffic.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done is to sit down with the terminal operators and tell them that they need to improve on their operations; we have Monitoring and Regulatory Department in the NPA, which has an index that, on a monthly basis, we look at the operations and grade them.\n\n\u201cWe also sit with them at the end of the quarter to discuss their performance; we examine where they have done well and where they are lagging behind.\n\n\u201cWe have also emphasised the need for better synergy between what the terminal operators are doing and the shipping lines, because some of them also have affiliated shipping lines working with them.\n\n\u201cTo improve the operations within the ports, we came up with a policy that established empty container holding bays and we mandated all shipping lines to ensure that they have a holding bay outside the port premises for their empties.\n\n\u201cThis is to ensure that importers, when they take away their cargo from the port to offload at their business premises or warehouse, do not bring the empty container into the port.\n\n\u201cSuch containers should rather be taken into the holding bay.\n\n\u201cSecond, we mandated that for every vessel that comes into Nigeria, when it is sailing out, it must take away at least 80 per cent of the containers it brought in, either as empty or as export cargo, because Nigeria was already being turned into a dumping ground for empty containers.\n\n\u201cTo a large extent, that has worked because those empty containers have been removed. But we are ensuring that such is being monitored and efficiency has increased,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also spoke on the electronic call up system, also called \u2018Eto\u2019, the policy deployed to check congestion at the ports.\n\n\u201cI have paid a visit to the main truck park itself which is located at the Lilly Pond Terminal, Ijora to see what is happening. I went round and I went into the ports. The idea was for me to have first-hand understanding on what the problem is.\n\n\u201cI met with Truck Transit Park (TTP), the firm that deployed \u2018Eto\u2019 system platform on behalf of the NPA, and we analysed what has been happening from February to May.\n\n\u201cWe observed lapses one of which was the non-deployment of the electronic call up system \u2013 the Information Technology IT system \u2013 that should have been in place in some locations in the satellite truck parks.\n\n\u201cWe also looked at the non-deployment of physical infrastructure such as the bollards, the automated gates, and we gave them ultimatum to deploy the infrastructure or lose the contracts.\n\n\u201cThe essence of \u2018Eto\u2019 was actually to streamline the movement of cargo in and out of the ports, reduce human interference, and speed up the process of cargo delivery.\n\n\u201cAs long as there is human interference, there would be delays, there would be extortion and so on. What we need to do is to work on the human interference, stealing of Eto tickets and so on.\n\n\u201cVery often, we have situations where a trucker is along the route and he has his Eto ticket and at the next bus stop, a security agent stops him to say let me see your Eto ticket and the Eto ticket number is 123456.\n\n\u201cThe driver may probably be so many kilometres away; that number could be given to someone who could enter a certain building around Apapa and, probably in 15 to 20 minutes, get a plate number printed which could be used to get access into the port.\n\n\u201cShortly after, the real owner of the number now shows up and his ticket has been used and that is why we have now requested that TTP should change this to QR code; when you have a QR code, we will be able to scan it and you go through,\u201d he said.

          "text": ".\n\nCleen Foundation, an NGO, has lauded the conduct of INEC officials and that of security personnel deployed for Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Anambra.\n\nMrs Ruth Olofin, it\u2019s Executive Director, told newsmen in Awka on Sunday that the NGO monitored the conduct of security operatives at the election in collaboration with the Police Service Commission and a media outfit.\n\nShe said the NGO deployed its mobile application called the Cleen Mobile App which allows accredited observers to report security issues from their respective posts.\n\n\u201cOur 21-man Election Security Support Centre tracked, documented, escalated and followed up on security-related issues across local government areas during the election.\n\n\u201cThere was the adequacy of security personnel at all polling units. The minimum number of security officials seen in polling units was one, while we also recorded up to 16 security officials in polling units in some hotspots.\n\n\u201cWe also observed that 88.2 per cent of the security personnel were wearing easily identifiable nametags and this is commendable. However, we observed that 11.8 per cent were not wearing easily identifiable nametags.\n\n\u201cWe observed that 64.7 per cent of polling units were protected by unarmed security personnel. There were reports, however, of firearm possession by security personnel on patrol.\n\n\u201cThe statistics generated indicated that 47 per cent of security personnel arrived at polling units before 9 a.m., while 53 per cent arrived after 9 a.m.\n\n\u201cThis is below average and we urge security agencies to improve on timeliness in terms of arrival in subsequent elections,\u2019\u2019 Olofin said.\n\n\u201cINEC\u2019s technical teams responded to some of the technical challenges as they arose, which is laudable,\u2019\u2019 she added.\n\nOlofin said that other information related to election security were tracked and verified through credible media sources and social media platforms of credible partners.\n\nShe said that there was a general calm across the state and an improvement in voters\u2019 turnout at the election,\n\nShe said also that there were challenges with logistics and deployment of voting materials in some parts of the state.\n\nOlofin also told newsmen that the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) devices deployed by INEC malfunctioned in some polling units.\n\nShe noted that challenges ranged from internet connectivity, lack of facial recognition and authorisation of fingerprints; some were also linked to errors during voter registration.\n\nThe NGO\u2019s executive director lauded the turnout of women and youths at the election.\n\nOlofin, however, lamented that security personnel deployed, especially by the Nigeria Police Force, were poorly remunerated as a lot of policemen were found without hospitable accommodation.\n\nShe said that it portrayed a wrong impression and brought to the fore, the issue of welfare package for police officers which had been a recurring challenge in previous elections.\n\nShe urged the police hierarchy to improve the welfare package of police officers deployed for election in the future.\n\nAccording to her, the proper and adequate remuneration of security personnel will boost their motivation and ensure that officers discharge their mandate without prejudice or undue influence by political actors.\n\nOlofin also urged INEC to ensure improvement in the distribution of materials to avoid disenfranchisement of citizens and also to improve the response time for addressing the BVAS challenges to increase voters\u2019 trust in the process.\n\n\u201cWe observed that voting did not begin early in some polling units because the BVAS devices malfunctioned.\n\n\u201cFor Instance, in Polling Units 010, 011 and 014 in Ward 3, Dunukofia Local Government Area, there were reports of late accreditation because the BVAS devices malfunctioned.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, at virtually all the polling units at Ward 2, Anambra East LGA, and Polling Unit 4, Ward 4, Abaga, Njikoka LGA, we observed that the malfunctioning of the BVAS and poor logistics by INEC caused a delay in the commencement of voting.\n\n\u201cOfficials were seen working hard to reach their ICT centres to resolve the issues.\n\n\u201cThere was the late arrival of electoral officers at polling unit 7, 8, 9, & 10, Ward 1 Ekwusigo LGA, and also at polling unit 001, Ward 2, Ihiala LGA, where INEC officials and election materials were not present until 1 p.m.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the delay, voters were present at the unit waiting for the officials to arrive.\n\n\u201cINEC should work to improve on the BVAS devices and other technical tools and materials to aid easy, swift, and advanced electoral process in the future,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nShe said the NGO would continue to observe the election and later issue a post-election statement with more details on the overall conduct of the security personnel.\n\nOlofin enjoined INEC, law enforcement and security agencies to maintain the highest level of professionalism during result collation by guarding against any form of compromise that could scuttle the democratic process.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",
          "summary": "Cleen Foundation, an NGO, has lauded the conduct of INEC officials and that of security personnel deployed for Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Anambra.\n\u201cOur 21-man Election Security Support Centre tracked, documented, escalated and followed up on security-related issues across local government areas during the election.\n\u201cThere was the adequacy of security personnel at all polling units.\nThe minimum number of security officials seen in polling units was one, while we also recorded up to 16 security officials in polling units in some hotspots.\nOlofin, however, lamented that security personnel deployed, especially by the Nigeria Police Force, were poorly remunerated as a lot of policemen were found without hospitable accommodation.",

Andy Uba Governorship Campaign Organisation (SAUGCO), Mr Afam Ogene, has urged the ruling All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Anambra to stop heating the polity.\n\nOgene said that the call became necessary based on what he called the false claims by APGA that the All Progressive Congress (APC) had already written results of the gubernatorial poll in 10 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the state before the election commenced.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports on Saturday in Awka that the SAUGCO call is contained in a release Ogene made available to newsmen.\n\nSAUGCO expressed worry on how much the claim emanated from an incumbent government and described the allegation as \u201cridiculous\u201c.\n\n\u201cIf the government was sure that such action happened on the eve of an election in its state, the best is to quit the governorship race and like true compatriots warmly congratulate the presumptive winner of the contest, Sen. Andy Uba,\u201c Ogene said in the statement.\n\nHe said that it was a failure on the part of the Anambra government to release such incomprehensible allegation signed by its Commissioner of Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr C.

          "text": ".\n\nYiaga Africa, an independent election observer group, said the late arrival of electoral officials, materials, accreditation and voting, denied many electorates the right to vote in the Anambra governorship election.\n\nYiaga Africa said this in a situational statement on the 2021 Anambra Gubernatorial Election held on Saturday.\n\nThe group said the challenge of the inability of the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVA) or card readers to verify voters timely also resulted in many voters not casting their votes in good time.\n\nSamson Itodo, Yiaga Africa Executive Director, and Dr Ezenwa Nwagwu, a board member of YIAGA Africa, jointly signed the Statement.\n\nThe group said it based its report on verified reports received from 229 of 248 sampled polling units using the Watching the Vote (WTV) method.\n\nIt said that on average, two polling officials were deployed to those polling units where the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) officials and materials arrived.\n\n\u201cThis is lower than the required number of four polling officials per polling unit, at least one female polling official was present in the polling units.\n\n\u201cYiaga Africa WTV observed the deployment of the BVAS to the polling units. We received reports of the BVAS failure to authenticate voters\u2019 fingerprints and photos even where voter details were confirmed on the voter register.\n\n\u201cYiaga Africa is concerned that the non-opening of these polling stations disenfranchises registered voters in those polling units,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe observer group blamed the poor deployment of man and materials to voting centres on the lack of effective collaboration between INEC and transport companies as well as the lack of contingency plans to take care of any failure.\n\nAccording to Yiaga Africa, reports from the WTV observers revealed that by 9:30 am only 28 per cent of polling units commenced accreditation and voting and by 10:30 am only 50 per cent of the polling units had commenced accreditation and voting.\n\n\u201cYiaga Africa anticipated these challenges based on our pre-election observation, hence the call in our pre-election statement urging INEC to make contingency plans in situations where respective transport unions/companies reneged on their contractual obligation to deploy.\n\n\u201cThese incidents could potentially undermine the integrity of the election if not addressed.\n\n\u201cYiaga Africa commends the people of Anambra for the enthusiasm and resilience demonstrated with the turnout for the elections.\n\n\u201cINEC owes the people of Anambra a duty to take necessary steps to ensure that registered voters are not disenfranchised on the basis of technological failures or logistics challenges.\n\n\u201cYiaga Africa urges INEC to provide periodic updates on the status of elections in polling units where the BVAS consistently malfunctioned or where elections did not hold.\n\n\u201dYiaga Africa lauds the professionalism exhibited by security agencies since the commencement of polls,\u201d they said.\n\nThe group called on security agencies to respect human rights and maintain non-partisan dispositions throughout the results to investigate reports of hijack of election materials and prosecute the culprits.\n\n\u201cYiaga Africa would provide updates as the process progresses,\u201d warning that it would expose irregularities especially when the results don\u2019t tally with observations.\n\n\u201cYiaga Africa commends the good people of Anambra State for their peaceful conduct during the voting process and pleads that them to remain patient and peaceful through the voting and counting process,\u201d it stated.\n\nMeanwhile, INEC has said that voting will continue on Sunday in areas where voting could not hold on Saturday.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Convention: PDP steals a march on APC",
          "text": "Former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chairman, Uche Secondus, expected some reprieve from the courts in his fairly long-drawn squabble with party leaders as they prepared for their convention on October 30. Instead, he was stunned. His suspension as party chairman, masterminded principally by his main backer, Rivers State governor Nyesom Wike, was upheld, and the abridgement of his tenure, which should have ended in December, was also finally cast in stone. Unfazed, Mr Secondus announced that he would be storming the Supreme Court to get the hypothetical justice he thinks he deserves; but it is even more unlikely now that he would find solace there. Days ago, the party held its convention with stage-managed aplomb, and stole a march on its main rival and supplanter, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The PDP had looked the more cantankerous of the two big parties, and the APC the more cerebral and refined; a role reversal has, however, seemed to have taken place. The APC must now play catch-up, with no proof that it will be successful in the bid or exemplary in its methods.\n\nAs widely speculated, party bigwigs simply used the convention to seal their carefully cobbled deals in an atmosphere of deep caress. Iyorchia Ayu, a former senate president, is the new chairman. That he took the crown peacefully and without controversy should strengthen his hand in trying to rebuild a party sundered by pride and internal rifts. He is strong-willed, soft-spoken but firmer than his reticent and unprepossessing predecessor, and he is stoical and farsighted. He has enthused about his chairmanship and the new course he believes his party is set on, and he will expectedly try to rally and reshape the party into a fit and fighting machine for the next general election. But he is a more natural progressive than most of his giddy compatriots convoking in the PDP. His methods may not be alien to them, and indeed he can even be made to fit his methods into theirs, but whether they will not find his ideas, nay ideology, subversive and radical remains to be seen. He has spent many years out of the limelight; and unlike some political leaders like Ebenezer Babatope who pant after past methods and glories, it is not clear whether Dr Ayu spent those years roosting in conservatism or basking in new idealism.\n\nWhat is indisputable is that Dr Ayu and scheming party leaders are euphoric about their peaceful and successful convention. They have provocatively stoked the jealousy of the APC by daring the ruling party leaders to also hold a successful convention in December. Why the PDP thinks the APC will be hard put to organise a successful convention is difficult to fathom. The PDP was saved by the judicial bell hours before their convention. Nigerian courts may be much vilified, slow, ponderous and enamoured of strange judicial principles, but they are never averse to pulling rabbits out of hats. If they pulled one out in order to put the nose of Mr Secondus out of joint, there is no earthly reason they can\u2019t pull an even bigger rabbit out of their hats one more inglorious time. Dr Ayu scoffs at the APC in his victory speech, but the ruling party is not bereft of its own magic, nor of new ropes to fetter its delinquent members. In affirming Dr Ayu as chairman, the wizards of the PDP found a secret formula to spin a tentative stalemate days before the mega show celebrated by Nigerians. The sorcerers of the APC can also be trusted to find both the judicial magic wand and intraparty potion needed to pacify their own rebels.\n\nThankfully, Dr Ayu\u2019s PDP does not pretend to any progressivism; and even their conservatism, as their former leaders and ex-presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan have shown, is suspect. Thus freed from the restraining conscience of ideology, the party has felt both the leisure and pleasure of engaging in all sorts of shenanigans and compromises over the years, in and out of Aso Villa. They knew that the presidential ticket for the 2023 race would tear them apart and rob them of the consensus needed to pull off a successful convention, so they kicked the nuisance down the street and heaved into the chairmanship seat a credible and polemical progressive full of recantation. Mercifully for the APC, they are also not incommoded by ideology or even conscience of any kind. Cruel, bellicose, destitute of all empathy and patriotic sentiments, the ruling party will sacrifice their children and uncles to get a compromise, and if need be, subvert as many institutions as possible, be they judicial, law enforcement, or even religious. Civil liberties mean little to them. Ask their censorious Information minister, the lugubrious Lai Mohammed, who relentlessly shrieks about media bullying. So, Dr Ayu exceeds himself by daring APC leaders to organise their own convention. They will; and they will ape the PDP by kicking the presidential ticket matter down the unpaved road it has been their honour and privilege to hew out of their policy swamp.\n\nThe PDP may have stolen a march on the APC, but Dr Ayu must now begin to contend with the mystifying antics of the PDP, the inscrutable party he had jumped in and out of in the past. They have many eminent men and women in their ranks, cool politicians and thinkers as well as hot heads and fiery rhetoricians. Getting their affirmation when the common enemy was the dour and diminished Mr Secondus is one thing, weaving together cantankerous elders and schemers, and imbuing them with explicit ideology and nobility of purpose is quite another thing. Dr Ayu has secured the easy part of becoming chairman; he will now have to settle down to the hard part of getting the party to speak with one voice to the outside world, and acting with one common purpose within its walls. The new chairman is confident he can do it. Good for him. But it won\u2019t be easy. The propaganda war has not begun, so he should be less taunting of a rival that could still deliver another shellacking.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBy now the PDP should have come to terms with the fact that they do not have the kind of propagandists the APC boasted of before 2015, publicity gurus who could unleash fearsome fusillades of abuse and lies that are difficult to controvert, or are so effective that its victims are stupefied by the grandness and audacity of their untruthful claims. Could they hope to deploy what they do not have for the all-important task of reclaiming the throne in 2023? Dr Ayu has spoken glibly and furiously of the PDP reclaiming Aso Villa and putting paid to the machinations of a \u2018few\u2019 whom he accused of dividing the country. He is right to accuse the ruling party cabal of splintering the country, an unrepentant and cabalistic few so inured to advice and inoculated against common sense that they have become freakish. But having not come to terms with their own 16 years of plunder and misdeeds, it is not certain that Dr Ayu could speak plausibly of any grand rescue plans.\n\nThe PDP chairman is right to mock those who imagined that the opposition party would be unable to organise a successful convention. It is true that the PDP did not split at the convention, and Mr Secondus has for all practical purposes been buried by the judicial debacle that squarely met his obduracy, but there is nothing the party has done, or even seems capable of doing, to mitigate the disruptions and bitterness of years past. They may have a lesser tendency than the APC to fight to the death over policies and nomination tickets, but their history shows that they are not completely immune to the self-immolation the so-called progressives of the APC appear fond of. To make any headway in the next general election, Dr Ayu must get his party to extirpate the reactionary politics past presidents and leaders had inveigled into the PDP\u2019s structure and DNA. He probably has an idea how that can be done, but whether they will let him do it is a different thing. In fact, he must be careful not to be sucked into the vortex of reaction which the party\u2019s present leaders have woven tightly around the PDP. After all, six years after their humongous loss, they are yet to ask themselves why they lost two presidential elections in a row, why voters seemed wary of their errancy, and why they have not carried out the substantial reforms that would portray the party as sensitive, flexible and transformative.\n\nIn his victory speech, Dr Ayu also reminded the country of the atrocious policies and incompetence of the APC, from which he obviously presumed the PDP would deliver Nigeria. He is simply fulminating. Yes, it is a fact that the APC has been grotesque in its leadership style and desensitized to the pains of the public, but voters will need to be sure that the PDP has done enough to repair its own sullied and battered image. There is no indication it has. Yes, the APC has done enough to lose elections over and over again, but the PDP has done and said nothing to deserve victory. Indeed, going by the national balance of forces, the advantage seems to be with the undeserving APC. The ruling party has at least not given the impression it is deaf to the need to rotate the presidency south, especially after President Buhari has done so much to awaken regional feelings in the most bizarre fashion. If the ruling party does not experience an epiphany, but sticks to its informal zoning policy to the very end, they may very well steal the opposition\u2019s thunder where the opposition has only managed to steal a march on the ruling party.\n\nIn Dr Ayu, the APC may have found a worthy adversary. The ruling party must now put its best foot forward as the opposition PDP will no longer be a pushover. They have an eloquent and animated politician and intellectual to speak for and defend the party. The APC had better match the PDP, in fire and resoluteness. Rightly or wrongly, Dr Ayu and the PDP sense victory in the next polls; it would be catastrophic should the APC approach the reinvigorated opposition with the same cavalier and sanctimonious manner it had become accustomed to. It is of course too early to say how the battle will shape out in the months ahead, who has the high ground training their guns on the face of the enemy, and who congregates in the valley staring down into the unforgiving barrels of brand new howitzers. What is undeniable is that voters in the next polls will have unassailable ringside seats.\n\nEthiopia, Sudan, Mali: Lessons for Nigeria\n\nDespite its abundant natural resources and inspiring human capital, Africa is gradually becoming destabilised. In September, the military struck in Sudan, failed, and repeated it in October and succeeded. The coup itself was the consequence of public protests calling for a forceful overthrow of the government. After the coup, there have also been protests condemning the coup. Sudan is still on a knife-edge. Mali has had two coups in one year, and regardless of regional opposition to the military takeover, both the populace and the military insist the change was needed. In the same September, the military also struck in Guinea, consigning democracy to the dunghill. An insidious love for military takeover appears to be germinating on the continent. If not checked quickly and firmly, there is no telling where it might end. Already, Ethiopia is also on a knife-edge, with a rebel coalition marching on the capital, Addis Ababa, where the African Union headquarters is located.\n\nEthiopia, with about 115 million people, is the second-most populous country in Africa, after Nigeria. But a combination of history, ethnicity and power play seems to doom the country to collapse if nothing is done to arrest the march of the Tigrayan rebel coalition on Addis Ababa. The coalition comprises the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) and the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA). Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is Oromo, which has the majority population of about 35 percent. Yet the Oromo have allied with Tigray (a little over 6 percent) rebels, who in the early 1990s inexplicably dominated the armed coalition that unseated the Marxist Derg government. Dispute over federalism, corruption, and human rights abuses have produced a seething mix leading to this latest round of crisis. Though Ethiopia has about 67 percent Christian population, that has not helped in lessening the fierce dispute for power, whether the loss of it in 2018 by the Tigray who dominated the post-Derg government, or the retention of it by the most populous ethnic group. Mr Ahmed is the first Oromo to hold the post.\n\nThe post Omar Al-Bashir government in Sudan was from 2019 supposed to be led by the military for 21 months, and later by civilians for 18 months, until the next election. That arrangement has collapsed, prompted by irreconcilable political differences and threatened financial collapse. Restive Sudan shares boundary with Ethiopia, just like fidgety Eritrea and Humpty Dumpty Somalia. The horn of Africa appears primed to explode, should the world fail to pay attention or help to persuade the continent\u2019s irrational political leaders to toe the path of reason. Overall, what is at play in all these countries is poor leadership anchored on the crisis-prone national boundaries bequeathed by colonial powers. Post-independence African leaders have sadly been unable to rethink and manage their countries\u2019 ethnic and religious pastiche, with Ethiopia\u2019s crisis in particular bearing eerie resemblance to Nigeria\u2019s. If the rebel coalition fighting the Abiy Ahmed government in Addis Ababa succeeds, it will not be the end of the crisis.\n\nLike Ethiopia, Nigeria is also contending with the issue of defective federalism, intransigent and domineering regional elite who have seized national government, and a despairing potpourri of ethnic and religious differences which have so far proved unresponsive to any solution. What is happening in Ethiopia and Sudan makes it double difficult for 2023 to lend itself in Nigeria to the usual conservative deals premised on careless and instigative rhetoric of ethnic or religious dominance. If Nigerian leaders do not read history and quickly learn the relevant lessons, the politics of the 2023 election will probably define what becomes of the country, including determining whether it has any hope of stability and continuity. Nigeria is already on the precipice, torn apart by many fissiparous tendencies. The coming months and the bold initiatives of bright leaders will determine whether the country will step back from the brink.",

Don Adinuba.\n\n\u201cIndeed, if APGA were to believe their own lies, why then are they still pretending to be in the governorship race?\n\n\u201cReal politics, as well as real life situation, dictate that once one is snookered beyond help, the right and appropriate step to take is to throw in the towel of surrender.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has followed the trajectory of APGA\u2019s campaign leading up to Saturday\u2019s poll would have noted that the dominant theme of its electioneering was the flurry with which it manufactured one tale after another, all targeted at the APC.\n\n\u201cFor an issue as delicate as having some results of today\u2019s election already written, how come APGA is the only political party privy to this fact?\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, are we now being confronted with a fait accompli by the outgoing governor, Chief Willy Obiano\u2019s administration, in a classic case of the witch crying in the night and the child dying at dawn,\u201d Ogene said .\n\nSAUGCO expressed the hope that the winner of the Anambra governorship election would only emerge from votes garnered at the various polling units across the state.\n\nOgene said that the attempt to pull wool over people\u2019s eyes, as he alleged APGA was doing, was a ploy taken too far.\n\nHe alleged that Commissioner Adinuba, who doubled as spokesman of the Prof. Charles Soludo campaign, claimed to have \u201creceived credible intelligence reports about moves by a certain political party to use the instrumentality of the state to arrest key officials of the state government anytime on trumped up charges.\u201d\n\n\u201cCuriously, the same official (Adinuba) was to go ahead to state emphatically that \u201cnone of the heads of the national security agencies is aware of this plot.\u201d (NAN)",

          "text": "By Enyeribe Ejiogu, Magnus Eze, Paulinus Aidoghie, David Onwuchekwa, Obinna Odogwu, Aloysius Attah, Jeff Amechi Agbodo\n\nThe Anambra state governorship election held yesterday was marred by a combination of mass failure of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) several polling units across the state. In some areas, electoral materials arrived late even as there was low voter turnout.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\nThough the election was relatively peaceful across the state, the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, said that there were incidents of ballot box snatching in Oba and Onitsha areas.\n\nAccording to the electoral umpire, some of the transport companies hired for the deployment of electoral materials reneged after having been paid upfront just as some ad hoc staff did not show up probably out of fear.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nIn a report, Chairman, Board of Trustees of the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law, Mr Emeka Umeagbalasi, said that the BVAS failed in 326 wards and 5,720 polling centres across the three senatorial centres of the state.\n\nLeader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State and Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige had a personal and unpleasant experience of the BVAS malfunction as he was not able to cast his vote at the Polling Unit 010, Nkwo-Ide, Alor Ward One, in Idemili South Local Government Area of Anambra State due to inability of the BVAS machine could not verify his electoral identity.\n\nThe Minister had stayed about two hours undergoing accreditation but the process failed after about 70 attempts. He expressed his desire to vote but regretted that the system failed. He put the failure rate of accreditation machines in his area at over 30 per cent.\n\nLeaving the polling centre to his country home at about 2:35pm, Ngige asked that he should be alerted if the machine started working. He appealed to INEC to extend the voting period to 5pm to enable teeming voters cast their vote.\n\nThe minister also advised INEC to always test run their equipment at least a week before election to ensure they are functional. Several voters at the polling units there could not be accredited to vote.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bishop Diocese on the Niger, Rt Rev. Owen Nwokolo, expressed happiness over the peaceful and orderly electoral process witnessed in Onitsha.\n\nRt Rev. Nwokolo bared his mind after casting his vote at All Saints Primary School Ward I, Onitsha North Local Government Area, Anambra State.\n\nThe bishop who voted alongside his wife commended the adequate security arrangements put in place to ensure the safety of voters and staff of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC.\n\nHe lauded INEC for introducing a new system of accreditation and voting, and said that the system made for fast voting and did not waste voter\u2019s time at the polling units.\n\nThere was, however, apathy as many eligible voters were still afraid to come out to exercise their franchise because of the high presence of security men who thoroughly searched people walking to the polling boots to cast their votes, including journalists.\n\nAt Christ the Kings College, CKC, Onitsha Ward 1, there were four polling units but out of the four, one of the polling units identified as O19 was not functioning as INEC officials and voting materials were yet to arrive at the time of the report. Voters complained bitterly about the development.\n\nOur correspondent who monitored the election observed that at ward 14, polling units 001, 002, 003, 004 and 011 at general post office, Iboku street, Obanye street Onitsha, INEC officials voters did not turn out to vote at about 11am.\n\nThere was low turnout of voters at most polling units in Onitsha as INEC presiding officers waited for voters to come out for accreditation and voting.\n\nAt polling units in Onitsha ward 1 voting commenced earlier at about 9am as voters were turned out to cast their votes.\n\nAt Inland town ward 5, polling unit 009 Living Christ Church, Owelebo all the voters peacefully voted.\n\nThe Youth Leader, Young Progressive Party (YPP), Anambra North senatorial zone Chubby Egbuche expressed happiness over the large turnout of voters at the polling unit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy over the turn out in polling unit and peaceful conduct of the election. I want to commend INEC for their zeal and seriousness in discharging their duties\u201d he said.\n\nCDD decries vote buying\n\nAlso displeased with the conduct of the Anambra State governorship election, the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD), decried vote buying witnessed during the electoral process.\n\nBriefing journalists in Abuja, CDD Director of Research, Sa\u2019eed Usaini, said despite concerns over the heavy deployment of security agents, very few incidents of intimidation and violence were reported, defying the context of fear and uncertainty that preceded election day.\n\nUsaini also said security agents were frequently absent at the commencement of accreditation in several polling units, which likely heightened uncertainty among voters and officials.\n\n\u201cWe also noted widespread incidents of vote-buying that will likely negatively impact the credibility of the election result. CDD observers reported numerous not-so-discreet cases of \u201csee-and-buy\u201d in polling units across the 21 LGAs of the state. In many reported cases, the police officers were alleged to have looked the other way, likely as a result of having themselves been compromised. This practice, which appears to cut across party lines, has been an increasing feature of Nigerian elections and requires more concerted remedial efforts by INEC and other critical stakeholders,\u201d Usaini said.\n\nSpeaking on the logistics by INEC during the election, Usaini said reports from CDD\u2019s observers indicated widespread delays in the commencement of accreditation and voting as a result of late arrival of poll officials.\n\nOzigbo confident of victory\n\nIn his Amesi hometown, Aguata LGA, Valentine Ozigbo, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) flag-bearer in the Anambra governorship election expressed confidence in his chances of victory in the election.\n\nMr Ozigbo made the submission after casting his vote at Social Centre 010 polling centre in Amesi.\n\nWhile addressing journalists after participating in the voting exercise, Ozigbo said Ndi Anambra were tired of the failure of leadership under the All Progressives Congress (APC) and All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) at the federal and state levels.\n\nOzigbo, who was accompanied by his wife, Ojiugo Ozigbo, raised concerns over the voting process, especially the unavailability of voting materials in several local government areas and the time it took him to vote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful for the peaceful environment but I have mixed feelings for now. On one hand, I\u2019m thankful that I\u2019ve been able to vote, however I\u2019m a bit worried by how long it took us to vote.\n\n\u201cI commend INEC for introducing the machine which will help us reduce election fraud and rigging, but if this is how long it takes for one person to vote, we might need to request for an extension in the voting time to ensure that every eligible voter votes.\n\n\u201cSo, I urge the people of Anambra State to come out without fear to cast their votes and I ask for INEC to give more time for people to vote,\u201d he added.\n\nVoters injured in Nnewi stampede\n\nSome unfortunate voters sustained injuries at Uruagu, ward III, Nnewi, in a stampede caused by political thugs, who stormed the polling stattion. A team of soldiers and the police later arrived the scene. Many broke their legs and arms while trying to run away from danger into a nearby bush.\n\nIt was later gathered that two political parties were in money sharing competition. While one of them, according to a voter, shared out N3,000 per voter, another party gave each voter N2,500, a situation that generated commotion.\n\nMeanwhile, voting started at that polling station by 11:00 like some other polling units in Nnewi.\n\nEarlier in the day, there was apprehension at Uru Umudim Ward II, Nnewi North, the village of the Chairman, Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing Limited, Chief Innocent Chukwuma. As at 8:21 no electoral officer had arrived at the polling unit though a handful of voters were sighted waiting for the commencement of electoral process. Many unarmed police officers were seen at the polling station.\n\nINEC extends voting time\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday bowed to reason by extending the voting to 4.00pm in view of the very slow accreditation of voters, which was attributed to the accreditation device deployed for the election.\n\nThe commission also said that voting would continue today in arrears where the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) failed.\n\nResident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state, Nkwachukwu Orji, who briefed journalists at INEC headquarters, Awka, the state capital, said that the measure became necessary to enable more, if not all, eligible voters to cast their votes.\n\nHe said that the BVAS malfunctioned because of software glitches. The BVAS failed in some parts of the state thereby preventing voters from exercising their franchise.\n\nNkwachukwu said: \u201cThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has extended the period for opening and closing of Poll from 8.30am to 4.00pm.\n\n\u201cThis revised closing time applies to areas where Polling Units opened after the commencement period of 8.30am.\n\n\u201cIn line with existing regulations and guidelines of the Commission, any intending voter who is on the queue by 4.00 pm shall be allowed to vote. All Polling Unit staff must comply with this directive.\n\n\u201cThe extension of time arose out of several field reports that voters have had problems with accreditation. The Commission is currently investigating the reason the accreditation devices, Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), have worked perfectly in some Polling Units, but not in others.\n\n\u201cIn some of the cases, it would seem that this resulted from software glitches. Our technicians have already built an update to the devise software to prevent further challenges. The update is currently being installed in the concerned BVAS and we request voters, candidates and agents to be patient and allow our technical staff to solve the problem.\n\n\u201cThe Commission wishes to reiterate that in cases of sustained malfunction of the BVAS, the Presiding Officer must inform the voters and polling agents that accreditation and voting for the affected Polling Unit shall continue tomorrow or at another time determined by the Commission.\n\n\u201cWith this extension of time and the recommencement of accreditation where the BVAS consistently malfunctions, the Commission assures that no voter will be disenfranchised.\n\n\u201cOur deployment has also been adversely affected by transportation challenges in some locations. It must be noted that on account of security concerns, some of the transporters that were mobilized and collected 50% of their sign on fee backed out at the last moment, leaving some of our ad-hoc staff stranded.\n\n\u201cAlso, some of the trained ad-hoc staff backed out at the last moment. The Commission is on top of these challenges and extant regulations and guidelines will be applied on case-by-case basis.\n\nIn Alor, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, could not vote after trying for about 1 hour to be accredited. The BVAS failed to capture him. It, however, captured some of the voters at the Polling Unit, 010, in Ward 1.\n\nIn Isuofia, the BVAS at the Polling Unit of the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, failed, preventing him from voting.\n\nIt was gathered that 30 eligible voters were able to cast their votes at the Polling Unit but Soludo himself could not vote. However, another BVAS was later made available by INEC so that eligible voters could cast their votes.\n\nIn Obosi, Idemili North Local Government Area, there was impressive voter turnout. At Obosi town hall and Obosi Central School, many turned out in their numbers to vote but there were reported cases of malfunctioning machines leaving some of the prospective voters stranded.\n\nGroup calls for sack of INEC ICT head\n\nIn response to the accreditation challenges observed during the election, the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law has called for the cancellation of Anambra governorship election and the immediate sack of Mr. Chidi Nwafor, INEC\u2019s National Director of ICT for allegedly colluding with principal national network providers to engage in high tech rigging of the Anambra election.\n\nIn a statement released in Onitsha yesterday, the group said the rigging was perfected through \u201cperpetration of mass failure and mal-functioning of Bi-modal Voter Accreditation System machines in many, if not most of the polling centres across the state.\n\nSigned by Mr Emeka Umeagbalasi, Board of Trustees chairman, the group noted that the BVAS\u2019s mass failure or malfunctioning of same has rigged out over 70 per cent of the courageous voters that had come out to be electronically captured to vote.\n\n\u201cWe have gathered from many, if not most of the polling booths in the state and across the state\u2019s three senatorial districts, 326 wards and 5,720 polling centres that failure of the BVAS machines is widespread and has forced over 70% of the voters not to be captured.\n\nThe group said the development had rubbished the credibility of the entire exercise.\n\n\u201cIt also credibly appears that the rigging is a high tech one spearheaded by the INEC\u2019s ICT done in conspiracy with some principal national network providers.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the group called \u201con INEC to sack its ICT National Director and cancel and repeat the poll so as to give same the credibility and popularity it deserves.\n\nThugs attack INEC staff in Obosi\n\nFormer Aviation Minister and Corps Marshal, Chief Osita Chidoka and his younger brother, Obinna Chidoke voted peacefully at Central School Obosi at 1:15 pm.\n\nOsita who was accompanied to the polling unit by some aides and friends had a smooth accreditation and seamless voting at polling Unit 014 while his brother and Member representing Idemili North/South Federal Constituency in the National Assembly, Obinna voted after him.\n\nSpeaking after exercising his franchise, Osita said that he had noticed some technical challenges from the INEC but expressed confidence that the voice of the people would be respected in the election.\n\n\u201cThere are few challenges here and there but so far so good, people have turned out and Anambra people\u2019s voices must be heard. Our voice must be heard in the country and we must elect a leadership that represents our hopes and dreams. I\u2019m happy the process is going on and once it is free and fair, whoever is the winner, the state will accept it\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, there were reported incidents of shooting in parts of Ugwuagba Obosi while thugs swooped on election workers at Anambra State School of Health Technology, Obosi, beat up the INEC staff, tore the election materials to shreds, broke some phones and made away with few others forcing everyone to run for safety.\n\nCondemning the incident, Obinna said people should be allowed to exercise their franchise without any hindrance or molestation and called on the security agencies to rise up to the situation.\n\nAlso logistics issues hindered electoral process at Obosi Town hall as most presiding officers could not mobilize to their polling units owing to lack of adequate vehicles while some INEC staff who were supposed to mobilize the adhoc staff where nowhere to be found.\n\nThere was large presence of security officials stationed in the town hall loitering while many other polling units lacked security personnel. An APGA chieftain and Special Assistant to Governor Obiano, Chief Tony One week Muonagor, said that some of the security agents returned to their base at the town hall because some thugs chased them back at St. Philips Primary School.\n\nA stranded INEC presiding officer identified as Lucky lamented that he was drafted to the open field at Wisdom Landlords Association security office, Odume Obosi but he was forced to return to the town hall because they could not find the exact location of the polling unit.\n\nElection stalled in Ihiala, other LGAs\n\nElectoral process was stalled in Ihiala. Sunday Sun gathered that INEC officials had no manpower and no vehicles to convey electoral materials to the various Wards from Ihiala council headquarters till about 2:30 pm.\n\nProspective voters at Ihiala complained that INEC officials were nowhere to be found in the Polling Units.\n\nOur source said those who were determined to vote trooped to the council headquarters out of frustration. He said it was at that time that he went back home.\n\nHowever, it was further gathered that election materials eventually went to some wards in Okija when many voters had left the Polling Units out of frustration.\n\nAccording to a voter, a few voters came out and stood in the sun till 2:30pm without the arrival of any electoral officer let alone accreditation leading to disenfrachisement of many voters.\n\nHowever, governorship candidate of African Democratic Congress (ADC), Akachukwu Nwankpo voted at his Umapani Polling Unit 004, Okija Ward 001 at about 2:45pm.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

So, later in life, I decided to start acting and that\u2019s how I found myself in the movie industry.\n\nCan you recall some of the movies you acted as a kid?\n\nOh no, I cannot remember because I was very small then.\n\nHow was the transition from being a kid actor and grown up actor?\n\nEverything about me was about acting then. As a matter of fact, I loved entertainment such as singing, dancing and acting. So, the transition was so easy for me.\n\nDid you have any formal training in acting?\n\nNo! I started reading novels and watching foreign films. And I featured in magazines too. So, one day in Asaba, some people looking at my pictures in a magazine began to motivate me. They asked if I would love to give acting a trial. This gave me a lot of encouragements to fully go into the movies.\n\nWhat was the first movie you acted in as an adult?\n\nIt was \u2018My Worst Enemy\u2019 where I played alongside Ini Edo, Ngozi Ezeonu and other stars. It wasn\u2019t just a \u2018waka-pass\u2019 kind of role, but a real role for a first timer.\n\nWhich of the movies would you say announced you?\n\nI have done quite a lot and I cannot say this is a particular movie that announced me, because people would always commend my roles in movies. My current film is \u2018Boy Make Money\u2019 and people are already going crazy about it.\n\nGoing into the movie industry, did you have the support of your family?\n\nOf course, they all supported me except my dad who said he thought I wanted to be a footballer. Like I told you earlier, I am highly talented in almost everything entertaining. So, he thought I was going to be a footballer. But then, I had nobody to train me or sponsor my soccer kits, so I had to withdraw from football to pursue my acting career.\n\nDid you encounter any challenges when you first came into the industry?\n\nOf course, nothing was easy. That was why when I started, at a point, I felt I wanted to stop. I just had to pull back and complete my studies. So, when people tell me that they would like to be an actress, I always tell them to cool down and finish school first.\n\nWhat would you say is the biggest sacrifice you\u2019ve ever made for your career?\n\nI slept in a car overnight when I came from Enugu to Asaba for a movie role, only to discover that the shooting was going to start the next day, and I didn\u2019t have anywhere to stay. I remember someone said I should come and sleep in his room, and I said \u2018no, I\u2019d rather sleep in the car till the next day\u2019.\n\nTell us your sex-for-role experience?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that bad, because as a fine girl, men were always asking me out. They would tell me: \u2018if you do this, I will make you a star\u2019. And me, I have always been a stubborn person because I know I\u2019ve got the acting talent, and that was the reason I didn\u2019t fall into the sex-for-role trap.\n\nWhat\u2019s the project you are currently working on?\n\nI just finished the one I did with Sly Mmadu. It is an action film where the characters are bad, killing people and all that. Later on, they got converted, but due to their past evil deeds, some ended up with deadly diseases as a consequence of their sins.\n\nAside what we see on screen, who exactly is Shasha Donald?\n\nI am an easy-going person; a selfless being and people always want to be around me because they like my vibes. I do not bear grudges; I do not compete with anybody but myself, I just want positive people around me.\n\nIs Shasha single and searching?\n\nYes, I am single. I am not in any relationship at the moment.\n\nWhat are the qualities you would want in your man?\n\nHe should be trusting, good-looking and financially stable. He should also be lovable and be able to take good care of me because I like to be loved. I am the last born in my family, so I like to be pet and cared for. I always show love but I never get love in return.\n\nDoes that mean you\u2019ve had a fair share of heartbreaks?\n\nYes.\n\nCan you share the experience?\n\nIt is one of those things you experience in a relationship. Something that cannot break you will make you.\n\nIf the man comes back begging, would you accept him?\n\nNo, not at all.\n\nDo you have ladies trying to toast you?\n\nYes, sometimes. They always say \u2018I love everything about you, can I be your friend?\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nIn September, 2021, Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore decorated Temitope Ajayi as its brand ambassador.\n\nIn this interview, she explained her roles and how she was treated badly by people for taking up the responsibility. Excerpt:\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\nWhat informed your decision to take up the task of Miyetti Allah brand ambassador?\n\nI was just obeying God\u2019s commandment. That was the only thing that could make me leave my comfort zone in the Silicon Valley in the United States, to return to Nigeria. God specifically directed that I return home (Nigeria) for this task of bringing solution to the issue of farmers/herders crisis that have led to destruction of communities, farmlands and death of thousands of people. When there\u2019s such instruction, who am I to reject it or question the voice or directive from God.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nAs brand ambassador, what are your responsibilities?\n\nMy major responsibility is image making, rebranding and making people realize that these Fulani people are peace loving, friendly and accomodating people. They have lived with us peacefully for decades, and suddenly, people are beginning to see them as enemies of the people. People now see them as enemies of the community and also reject them whole-heartedly irrespective of their huge contribution to the society and the economy.\n\nWere your family members informed before you took the responsibility?\n\nNo! none of my family members were informed. I couldn\u2019t even tell my children and other family members about this task because they would have discouraged me and insisted that I reject the offer. But I saw the task as a divine responsibility that I need to accomplish as quickly as possible. All I did was to asked God for His support and humility for service, and I was glad that it was granted. I heard God clearly instructed that I specifically go back to my root, Nigeria, to find a solution to this unending herders/farmers crisis that had consumed lives, and that was what I had done.\n\nWhat was their reaction when they heard you took the responsibility?\n\nThey were so bitter, disappointed and called me a betrayer. Some of them thought I had collected money from these herdsmen to sold out our people, amidst the tension and suspicion between these herdsmen, farmers and local communities. They threw invisible stone at me and called me several unprintable names. But I am glad that they have begun to realize that they were wrong in their thoughts and judgments. Remember, I left my comfort zone in the United States to be here. My saving grace was that I already had and still have a perfect record of my achievements and personality over the years. If not, my life and reputation would have been rubbished and littered on social media. I have a name and reputation to protect, and that I will continue to do through hardwork and sincerity.\n\nWhat do you think gave birth to this \u2018endless\u2019 herders/farmers crisis?\n\nPoverty, injustice and deprivation are at the base of it. The fact is that a hungry man is an angry man. It\u2019s also a known fact that an idle hand is the devil\u2019s workshop. The injustice, poverty and deprivation have been going on for several years ago and what we are seeing today is the effect of that. It\u2019s part of the consequences of the prolonged neglect. These young adults are bitter and angry, and they are unleashing it on innocent people in the society. We need to do something fast to salvage the situation or it will consume us all in no distant time. But I strongly believe that this cattle/herders problem would be a blessing to Nigeria if well managed. Expectedly, it will trigger serious discussion that would herald the needed changes along the value chain. Many lives have been lost due to clashes between farmers and herders. These souls of the dead are calling for justice. I am a mother and I could feel the pain of these people, some of whom have been displaced, lost their parents and other sources of livelihood. I developed a blueprint that would end these crisis seven years ago. I developed it while I was a participant in 2014 Confab. When I was done with the document, the Almighty God told me clearly to go and present it to Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore for possible action.\n\nI heard you were afraid to visit them because you could be kidnapped or harmed. Was that true?\n\nMy brother, It was true. I was deeply afraid. At this point, I was forced to ask God questions which he answered me clearly. But before I began the visit, I properly and carefully documented my movement and dropped it where my family members could see it in case I did not return or anything unexpected happened to me. The journey was a suicidal mission to me. But my confidence was that God who sent me would protect me. He was simply and clearly speaking to me and I was obeying. One day, after I had informed the relevant close people about my mission and gathered the needed confidence, I took off. I was so nervous and visibly afraid when I reached the headquarters of the group somewhere in Nasarawa State. I even asked that they take my pictures, share it alongside my location so that people would know where I last visited. To my greatest surprise, the first thing I saw when I arrived there was a public school beside the headquarters of the group. I was told that the school was built by the president of the association for the use of the community. I was wondering why the school children were not kidnapped by these people since they are literarily tagged kidnappers. While I was visibly shivering and displaying my fear, I didn\u2019t know the president was watching me through the CCTV monitor in his office. He asked that I be brought into his office. In the cause of our interaction, I explained my mission to him and he bought into it. To my greatest surprise, he addressed me as \u2018Mama\u2019. That was when I knew that God was at work. He explained to me that they have serious challenges, but just that they don\u2019t have good access to the media, and his people don\u2019t have formal education that would enable them speak and fight for their right. He said lots of other things that pushed me to tears.\n\nWhat progress has been made since you were crowned Miyetti Allah brand ambassador?\n\nLots of achievements have been made. This is two months that I was crowned Miyetti Allah brand ambassador, and since then, there has been divine interventions as being witnessed across Nigeria. God has visited this country in a mysterious way through me. Aside other efforts that are about to be materialized, I have begun a serious campaign for certain amount of money to be released for compensation and rehabilitation of those that lost farmlands, cattle and other valuable property in the cause of this years of crisis. That would go a long way in helping the people back to their feet. There should be data that would help the government achieve that. We intend to organize a national peace summit and launching of N200 billion intervention fund for building cattle ranches/farm settlements in some communities who have already made land available for such project. Establishment of cattle ranches has been widely accepted as alternative to open grazing and practical solution to Fulani herdsmen/farmers clashes even though it\u2019s very expensive, capital intensive and above the means of poor/average Fulani pastoralist. The pastoralists need help and I have understanding of the National President, Alhaji Bello Bodejo, and his executive team that ranching is the ultimate solutions.\n\nWhat is the content of the blueprint you developed and presented to the Miyetti Allah group and how realistic is the implementation?\n\nFor instance, I live in Silicon Valley, US, and in all the civilized country that I have been to, there\u2019s always a co-existence between cattle and human being. What it means is that there are ranches for cattle and comfortable place of habitation for human beings. California, a state in US export more than $13 billion worth of cattle and other by-products annually. In California, a pint of fresh milk is more costly than a barrel of crude oil. There are some other by-products of the cattle that are used to generate electricity and other useful items. Brazil, Venezuela, Holland and several other countries grew their economy through cattle and other dairy products. These countries recognized that cattle business is a big business, and therefore dividend it into three areas, namely, animal husbandry, dairy, abbatoir and grazing. This is a new found \u2018crude oil\u2019 that everybody must partake in, so we could collectively grow our economy and create massive job opportunities. For instance, the South, West and East have fertile ground that can grow the grass for feeding these cattles. These grasses can even be processed, turned to pellet, packaged and send to cattle ranches in the North. We can even export these processed feeds to Arab countries where they don\u2019t have such fertile ground to grow these grasses. Other opportunities can be created along the value chain.\n\nDid the group accept the blueprint and other suggestions you presented to them?\n\nYes! that was the reason for my official crowning as the brand ambassador of Miyetti Allah which was done last two months. They saw the potentials in me and what I presented during the meeting, and they gave me that huge responsibility, not minding the fact that I am a Yoruba woman. I exposed Miyetti Allah President, Bello Bodejo and other officials to the gains therein if the blueprint and other suggestions are adequately implemented, and he accepted it wholeheartedly. I can tell you that I am the happiest woman in Nigeria today, because our suggestions are beginning to yield result. Within two weeks of my decoration as brand ambassador, the Senate approved the ranching we suggested. There was also a media report that the president has also earmarked over N600 billion for the take-off of ranching project and the disbursement has started, with states reportedly getting up to N9 billion each. We have appealed to the Transport Minister, Rotimi Amaechi, to procure a wagon train that would be useful in conveying cattle from one part of the country to the other. This will end the era of road movement of cattle which often result in hungry cattle feasting on farm produce, thus leading to crisis with farmers.\n\nBut many of these people don\u2019t have the required capacity for ranching. How do you intend to change that?\n\nWe are working with the state governments to provide an empowerment platform for these people to get the needed skills and knowledge to be relevant in today\u2019s world. On my side, I have concluded plans to take some of these herders to the US, Brazil and other countries to expose them to modern way of rearing cattle as well as several things that could be achieved along the value chain. When they return after the capacity building, they would be expected to train others with the superior knowledge and skills they might have acquired in the US and other locations visited. Plans are on the way for them to participate in the forthcoming 2022 Houston livestock conference and road show. We also planned to organize workshop for the Fulani nomads to change their mindset and reorientate them towards accepting the planned modernization and transformation programmes. There must be a change of attitude and behaviours to conform with the international best practices in cattle breeding. We shall work with various state governments. Some of my friends and Nigerians in the Diaspora have promised to support us in training the pastoralists.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

He voted at 5:10.p.m at Isuofia ward 13 unit 002, Aguata LGA He came to the venue of his polling unit located at Afiyi Square at about 11:30 a.m. and was not able to vote because the Bimodal Verification Accreditation System (BVAS) could not capture him. The New Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that at about 10:a m, there was delay during accreditation of voters as the BVAS started malfunctioning. At about 2.p.m, only 18 persons of over 700 voters had been accredited and were able to vote. A new BVAS was brought to the polling unit at 4.05 p.m, which was when proper accreditation and voting started. After voting, Soludo commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for making efforts to ensure a peaceful and smooth electoral process. \u201cI told you I\u2019m an optimist which is why I waited for over five hours forty minutes, because, I believe INEC will come through. \u201cYou can also see that in spite of the delay, our people waited patiently and are so determined to cast their votes no matter the time. \u201cThat is to show you that APGA is Anambra and Anambra is APGA. I believe the will of God will prevail no matter the delay. APGA will win. \u201cI look forward to the credibility and legitimacy of the process. I also believe we have the popular mandate of the people and I believe the system will deliver at the end of the day,\u201d he said. Soludo commended the people and his supporters for maintaining calm and peace inspite of the logistics challenges. Meanwhile, counting of votes has commenced at PU 002\n\nWard 01, Ekwulu Village Hall Umuona and PUs 004, 005, 006 and 007 in Primary school Umuona, Aguata LGA. Also at PU 014 and 013\n\nWard 001 in Community High school, Nanka in Orumba North\n\nVoting is still on as at 5pm. NAN however, reports that voting was extended to Sunday due to the failure of the BVAS that prevented many of the people from casting their votes. (NAN)\n\n7:03PM\n\nAnambra Election: Counting of Votes Under way Counting of votes has started in some polling units in Awka township after Saturday governorship election in Anambra. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that though voting began late in some polling units in Awka, the exercise was concluded about 3.30pm. Mr Ugochukwu Nwosu, a voter at the Agu ward 2 polling unit 009, said that the election was peaceful in the area.\n\n\u201cI am the last person who voted at the polling unit 009, I think that the whole thing was generally peaceful,\u201d he said\n\nAt Amawbia Ward II PU 008, counting of votes has also started, the situation was also the same at Oko wards one and two in Orumba North Local Government Area of the state.\n\nMeanwhile, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC ) has announced that the exercise will continue in some polling units where voters recorded hiccups in the accreditation process.\n\nDr Nkwachukwu Orji, the state INEC Resident Electoral Commission who briefed journalists in Awka said the commission received complaints of the malfunctioning of the machine in some locations.\n\nHe said that the commission had therefore resolved to extend the election period in such areas to give opportunity for voters to vote.(NAN).\n\n3:50PM\n\nINEC Extends Voting Time over BVAS Glitches Chuks Okocha in Awka In view of the malfunctioning of BVAS voting system, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has extended the period for opening and closing of Poll from 8.30am to 4.00pm. The Resident Electoral Commissioner. Nkwachukwu Orji said that this revised closing time applies to areas where Polling Units opened after the commencement period of 8.30am. In line with existing regulations and guidelines of the Commission, adding that any intending voter who is on the queue by 4.00 pm shall be allowed to vote. He said all Polling Unit staff must comply with this directive. According to him, \u201cThe extension of time arose out of several field reports that voters have had problems with accreditation. The Commission is currently investigating the reason the accreditation devices, Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), have worked perfectly in some Polling Units, but not in others. In some of the cases, it would seem that this resulted from software glitches. Our technicians have already built an update to the device software to prevent further challenges. The update is currently being installed in the concerned BVAS and we request voters, candidates and agents to be patient and allow our technical staff to solve the problem. \u201cThe Commission wishes to reiterate that in cases of sustained malfunction of the BVAS, the Presiding Officer must inform the voters and polling agents that accreditation and voting for the affected Polling Unit shall continue tomorrow or at another time determined by the Commission. With this extension of time and the recommencement of accreditation where the BVAS consistently malfunctions, the Commission assures that no voter will be disenfranchised. \u201cOur deployment has also been adversely affected by transportation challenges in some locations. It must be noted that on account of security concerns, some of the transporters that were mobilized and collected 50% of their sign on fee backed out at the last moment, leaving some of our ad-hoc staff stranded. Also, some of the trained ad-hoc staff backed out at the last moment. \u201cThe Commission is on top of these challenges and extant regulations and guidelines will be applied on a case by case bases. Consequently, we are harvesting areas where voting will realistically no longer take place today, including places where substantial disruption has occurred, to enable a possible recommencement of voting at another time, in line with extant laws and the regulations and guidelines of the Commission. \u201cWe appeal to all voters, candidates, stakeholders communities and political parties to remain calm and law abiding. We assure you that the Commission is determined to make all votes count.\u201d, he stated.\n\n3:43PM\n\nAnambra Guber: INEC Extends Voting by One Hour Voting continues Sunday David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has extended voting in the Anambra governorship election.

Deputy Commissioner of Police in Anambra State, DCP Aderemi Adeoye, said: \u201cThe alleged video of police officers protesting for non \u2013 payment is not true as been portrayed in the clip. \u201cA careful study of the video shows a group personnel in high spirit awaiting deployment for the election, chanting victory songs. \u201cThe Police Command remains focused and committed in protecting the sanity of the electoral process in Anambra state.\u201d Meanwhile, leader of police operations in Anambra, DIG Zaki Ahmed has told journalists in a press conference that it is the first time police men were paid their full allowances for election duty before commencement of operations.

          "text": "*22 upstream gas projects valued at $23.7bn ongoing nationwide\n\n*Corporation hasn\u2019t remitted funds to FAAC for four months, says Fayemi\n\n*US may counter OPEC\u2019s refusal to increase oil supply\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nOut of the budgeted $4.8 billion for Joint Venture (JV) cost recovery and government priority projects between January and September 2021, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) was able to spend $2.645 billion during the period under review, latest data from the corporation has shown.\n\nThe data also showed that 22 gas projects currently valued at $23.7 billion are ongoing nationwide.\n\nEkiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi has however lamented that the corporation had not remitted funds into the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) in the last four months.\n\nHowever, while the total pr\n\nojected expenses for the JV projects and other priority projects in the whole year is pegged at $6.4 billion, broken down into $536 million monthly, the data obtained from the NNPC indicated that actual funding has dropped since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe development is coming as the NNPC has in a bid to rev up its funding for important projects and payments to its partners, devised a means to deduct subsidy financing from source before remitting monies to the federation account.\n\nIt also comes despite a substantial improvement in oil prices compared to last year when prices of some oil benchmarks hit the negative territory, following the price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia as well as the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe oil price now hovers between $83 and $86.\n\nAgainst the $536 million monthly budget for the federally funded upstream projects, the NNPC paid out $276.4 million in January, $252.9 million in February, $307 million in March, and $239.2 million in April.\n\nIn addition, in May, the corporation funded its JV cost recovery obligations and priority projects to the tune of $392.2 million, then $202.2 million in June and $240.6 million, $352.5 million, and 381.1 million in July, August, and September respectively.\n\nIn all, the corporation recorded a deficit funding of $259.6 million in January, $283.1 million in February, $228.3 million in March, and $296.7 million in April.\n\nFurthermore, it recorded a shortfall of $143.8 million in May, $333.7 million in June, $295.3 million in July, $183.5 million in August, and $154.9 million in September this year. Between January and September, a total deficit of $2.1 billion was recorded by the national oil company, according to the record of activities obtained by THISDAY.\n\nIt also showed that about 22 projects, mostly in the upstream gas segment, were being developed at different stages, with some of them already nearing completion.\n\nThese include the Excravos-Lagos Pipeline Expansion Phase 1 in Edo and Delta, valued at $263.92 million which has now been closed out, with $221.42 million payments due contractors paid based on works carried out.\n\nIt\u2019s the same with the Excravos-Lagos Expansion Phase 2, straddling Edo, Delta, Ondo, Ogun, and Lagos states which have so far gulped $597.2 million.\n\nFor the 40\u00d730km Odidi-Warri expansion pipeline/ Warri-Oghara pipelines, in Delta, from inception till date, the NNPC said that the project valued at $130 million had consumed N24.07 million.\n\nAlso listed are the TNGP/Obigbo node compressor station, TNGP phase 1, Umuahia-Ajaokuta pipeline, and Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) project which have collectively gulped $117 million, covering revalidation of feed, Right of Way (RoW) acquisition, and outstanding survey payments.\n\nIn addition, $8.3 million has been paid for security and storage of line pipes and $11.4 million to relocate pipelines, coastal marine and logistics, water solutions, and soil investigation studies for gas supply to NIPP Egbema as well as Ogidigben/Delta gas city and industrial park.\n\nSeveral other ongoing projects include the Obiafu/Obrikom-Oben (OB3), which has reached completion, Trans-Sahara gas pipeline, Ibadan-Ilorin-Jebba line, and Asa North processing plant.\n\nFurthermore, the corporation noted that the construction of the West Niger Delta hub, Egbin gas project, upgrade of Sapele metering station, upgrade of Oben metering station as well as the Ajaokuta station and Delta IV, were other ongoing projects.\n\nAlso in the pipelines are the facilities to provide fuel supply to Gbaramatu and Excravos as well as the Gbaramatu/Excravos power plant which have already passed through the Engineering, Procurement Construction (EPC) stage.\n\nAn analysis of the 22 mostly gas projects showed that in all, they are currently valued at $23.7 billion, with a chunk of the money already expended at different stages of the projects.\n\nIn a related development, the Ekiti State Governor, Fayemi at the weekend lamented that the NNPC had not remitted funds into the FAAC in the last four months.\n\nFayemi added that the failure of the NNPC to remit funds into the Federation Accounts was responsible for the decision of his administration to slash the subvention of Ekiti State University (EKSU).\n\nHe made this clarification at a session with the Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of EKSU Governing Council, Prof. Bamitale Omole and other members of the council in Ado-Ekiti on Friday.\n\nAt the session, Fayemi explained that the decision of the state government to reduce the monthly subvention to EKSU was a temporary measure occasioned by the nationwide financial challenges.\n\nIn specific terms, the governor advised the university \u201cto look inward using their various initiatives and innovation to support the subvention coming from the State Government.\n\n\u201cWe have not reduced the subvention of the university. The subvention had been caught in a nation-wide challenge, as I am sure you all know that NNPC has not remitted money to the federation account in the last three to four months.\n\n\u201cSo, what we had already planned at the beginning of the 2021 fiscal year has been caught in that web. As much as we tried to increase the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) at the state level, we have not been able to meet our obligation.\n\n\u201cThis is responsible for emergency reduction in the subvention of the Ekiti State University. However, it is not a permanent reduction. It will be reviewed as the state\u2019s finances improve.\u201d\n\nUS May Counter OPEC\u2019s Refusal to Raise Oil Supply\n\nMeanwhile, the United States Government yesterday said that it had \u201ctools\u201d to deal with high oil prices after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies rebuffed the country\u2019s pleas for the producers to pump more crude.\n\nAsked by a reporter at the White House whether he would authorise a sale from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), President Joe Biden said that his administration would respond at the appropriate time if the prevailing situation continues.\n\n\u201cThere are other tools in the arsenal that we have to deal with other countries at an appropriate time,\u201d Biden said.\n\nOPEC+, a group of producers including Saudi Arabia, Russia and other countries, on Thursday snubbed US pleas to go beyond a previous plan to raise oil output by 400,000 barrels per day from December.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not anticipating that OPEC w\n\nould respond, that Russia and/or Saudi Arabia would respond. They are going to pump some more oil. Whether they pump enough oil is a different thing,\u201d Biden added.\n\nIn defiance of the US request, OPEC agreed to stick with plans to raise oil output by just 400,000bpd as agreed earlier from December, effectively shunning repeated calls from the world\u2019s biggest oil producer for extra production to tame rising prices.\n\nBiden said his administration will discuss the issue, adding: \u201cWe can get more energy in the pipeline figuratively and literally speaking.\u201d\n\nUS Energy Secretary, Jennifer Granholm, in the same vein, said that the Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts petrol prices slipping to $3.05 a gallon in December, saying that that the strategic reserve may come into play.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Whether it\u2019s politics, economy, or the EU-Nigeria partnership, we need youth participation. That is why this Nigerian National Youth Conference is so important. Youth is a top priority in the EU\u2019s partnership with Africa,\u201d she observed.\n\nUnderscoring the importance of building partnerships between young people of the two continents, Urpilainen said: \u201cThat is why we created the African Union-European Union Youth Cooperation Hub.\u201d\n\nI hope you will join it because is only by working together we can tackle the shared global challenges. I wish you a wonderful conference.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking during a presentation, a National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member and a member of the recently inaugurated European Union Youth Sounding Board (YSB) in Nigeria, Precious Uchechi Eze, said the NYSC is proposing to set up a Trust Fund for corps members, that will serve as a support system for the corps members facing various challenges during their service period.\n\nShe said the Trust Fund would be designed to provide accommodation, safer and seamless transportation of corps members from their respective states to their states of posting as well as encompass entrepreneurship and innovation hub; (post-camp) Skills Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Department (SAED), that will avail corps members the opportunity to continue learning various skills and equip them to launch businesses.\n\nEze said the intent of creating the Trust Fund is justified given the achievements NYSC has accumulated over the years, especially in the area of rural development in the health and education sector.\n\nShe said the NYSC is proposing to raise funds for the Trust Fund through legislative-backed donor contributions from spirited individuals, private organisations, corporate organisations, and the government.\n\nEze said that steps are being taken by the NYSC to ensure that the proposal is translated into reality.\n\nShe added that the NYSC management has made giant efforts to push the proposal to relevant quarters to seek approval, support, and backing.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "Urpilainen said she had mandated EU Delegations across Africa to establish a Youth Sounding Board to ensure youths are mainstreamed into their decision-making processes to reflect diversity and inclusivity.\nThe EU Youth Sounding Board in Nigeria was launched in Abuja in September 2021.\nThe board, she noted, helps Nigerian youths to share their voices and participate in shaping EU policies and programmes.\nAccording to the EU Commissioner, Nigerian youths play a central role in ensuring peace, resolving conflicts, and shaping policies in education, health, climate change, security, and job creation for the overall development of the country.\nShe said the NYSC is proposing to raise funds for the Trust Fund through legislative-backed donor contributions from spirited individuals, private organisations, corporate organisations, and the government.",

He was so happy to reunite with me. He told me how God had blessed him mightily and had made him veer into real estate in London. Femi was a genius who made stupendous gains from regenerating ghetto neighbourhoods in East London. He regaled me with tales of his exploits in the property business.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Vice President Osinbajo Linked To Lagos Collapsed Building With Current Death Toll Of 36 Persons\n\n\u201cHe promised to build the classiest residential apartments in Africa. He said he was out to prove there was nothing the multinational construction companies were doing that his company can\u2019t do. I have never seen such a level of audacity, determination and tenacity. Fourscore was a visionary and a missionary when it came to seeking to excel and do as well as his international counterparts at home and abroad. He had competed in their space, in their countries before, with moderate successes and did not see any reason why he could not replicate the same and attain loftier heights in his home country.\n\n\u201cIf he made any mistakes, it was probably that he overstretched himself, but he was such an ambitious man, full of faith. And certainly not the greedy avaricious person that his traducers now suggest he is. In our country, mistakes are never excused, forgiven or forgotten. When you fail, you\u2019re a villain and outcast. When you succeed, you\u2019re a hero, genius and superstar.\"\n\nMomodu said the inquest and investigation ordered into the incident should be done diligently\n\n\u201cIt must be painstaking and thorough. Such investigations cannot last thirty days as being directed by the government; I foresee that any credible inquiry must take months of arduous diligent work. Various possibilities including negligence, sabotage and even natural or human causes such as the over-dredging occurring in that vicinity must be considered. Dead men tell no tales. They cannot defend themselves, but records and logic abound,\u201d he added.\n\nSee Also News Vice President Osinbajo Threatens Lawsuit Over Report Linking Him With Collapsed Ikoyi Building, Claims Without Evidence SaharaReporters Was Paid To Publish Report\n\n\u201cThose making claims and allegations which are easily rumpled will soon be exposed. I\u2019d known that In February 2020 the third block was at the beginning of the foundation stage and the other two blocks were merely a few storeys gone. It is interesting that nobody who had any misgivings reported such to the Regulators. I say no more, other than that it is always convenient to cast aspersions when it seems there is no potential for the reply.\n\n\u201cWhat I know is Fourscore was a self-made man who depended on no godfather. Despite being a cousin of the vice-president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, he was too proud and self-reliant to approach the vice-president or anybody else for favours of that kind. He never sought for or got any government contracts. He relied on his own ability, marketing skills and funds.\u201d",

Hours after the announcement, the stock rose around 8% to \u20a6191.\n\nA Bit of History\n\nThe planned sell-off is part of a broader intention, announced by MTN Group earlier, to sell down 14% of its current shareholding in the Nigerian unit. That will see its holdings in MTNN reduce from 76% to 62%.\n\nWhile MTN Nigeria is the group\u2019s largest and most profitable subsidiary, the telecom giant has had to deal with a number of billion-dollar disputes with the Nigerian government as well as faced significant macroeconomic challenges.\n\nLast year, the Johannesburg-based group was unable to repatriate its $280 million dividend from its Nigerian subsidiary due to the challenges of securing foreign currency, amid the country\u2019s forex liquidity crisis.\n\nThe share sale thus raises questions about the group\u2019s intentions as it appears to be a gradual exit from the Nigerian market due to a lack of confidence.\n\nAlthough the divestment helps the South African giant slightly reduce its exposure to headwinds in the Nigerian economy, the sell-down does not signal an exit from Nigeria, according to Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer.\n\n\u201cSince its 2019 listing by introduction, the group has planned to sell part of its stake but held on due to market conditions,\u201d Omole told TechCabal. \u201cThe sale is part of its asset realisation programme (ARP) meant to simplify its portfolio, focus on its pan-Africa strategy, and free up capital for improved allocation.\u201d\n\nBetween January and September 2021, MTN Group saw its revenue grow to $8.2 billion, driven by success in some of its main markets, including Nigeria.\n\nDespite the domestic challenges, MTN Nigeria has shown resilience. Within the same period, the local unit grew its profit after tax by 53% to \u20a6220 billion ($385 million).\n\n\u201cMTN Nigeria remains an important part of the Group and its fundamentals remain solid,\u201d Omole said, adding that the share sale \u201cgives local retail and institutional investors an opportunity to tap into MTN Nigeria\u2019s growth.\u201d\n\nAs part of its ARP, MTN Group is in the process of finalising a sale-and-leaseback of its South African telecom mast portfolio as well as list shares in the Uganda operation in Kampala.\n\nThe company recently raked in some proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) of telecom infrastructure company, IHS Towers, in New York last month.\n\nShare this article",

Their intention appears to be the targeting of small industries and traders seeking cross-border opportunities in new African markets.\n\nKenyan based Asante Financial Services Group, focused on supporting the growth of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME\u2019s), has raised 7.5 million US dollars in series A funding to scale business credit offering to small businesses in Kenya and Uganda access to new markets across Africa.\n\n\u201cThe investment enables Asante to scale its credit offerings to the underserved segment of MSMEs in Kenya and Uganda, and expand to Nigeria and Rwanda,\u201d the start-up said in a statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTala, with African Operations in Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania has begun a \u2018Rebuild Fund Business Program\u2019 targeting Kenya\u2019s hard-hit micro, small and medium-sized enterprises it say will help them build back better post-COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe program comes barely a month after Tala raised 145 million dollars in equity, hinting that part of the growth funds would go toward supporting its geographical expansion.\n\nThe World Bank puts the annual SME credit gap in Sub Saharan Africa at about 330 million US dollars, with traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d lenders turning a blind eye to small traders on account of lack of \u2013 among others \u2013 collateral, high costs of due diligence, customer acquisition, distribution and servicing.\n\n\u201cMSMEs\u2014particularly those in the informal sector\u2014are being held back by a lack of responsible lending from traditional financial services providers who are unable to run accurate credit checks and offer profitable loans to this segment of the market,\u201d said Bitta Wycliffe, Senior Investment Associate at Goodwell Investments.\n\nPan-Africa fintech firm, MFS Africa is also making inroads in Nigeria through the acquisition of Baxi, a Nigerian start-up with a 90,000-agent network. The October move gives Nigerian SME\u2019s listed on Baxi access to MFS Africa\u2019s multiple mobile money payment wallets, currently serving up to 320 million customers in more than 35 African countries.\n\nAnother Pan-African fintech venture, Yabx, with a presence in 12 African countries recently tapped a telecoms industry expert with over 15 years in experience as a new director for its business.\n\nEunice R. Gatama, who has worked for, among others, Kenya\u2019s Safaricom, in its mobile money (M-Pesa) division, as well as NCBA bank, has been tasked with pushing the growth of Yabx digital lending services in new African markets.\n\nUntil recently, a lack of local knowledge and access to trade and market information has been linked to low trade volumes and value. With more money pouring into the hiring of top regional talent, that scenario, too, is likely to change.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "There\u2019s a new exciting trend in the African tech ecosystem: African founders backing fellow founders especially in pre-seed and seed funding, which is an indication that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Payhippo, a fintech startup providing capital for small businesses in Nigeria, was another example of the existence of this trend when it announced that it has closed $3 million in seed funding led by a number of African tech founders.\n\nThe round was led by Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, co-founders Chipper Cash; Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola, founder Flutterwave; Bolaji Balogun, CEO Chapel Hill Denham; and Hakeem Belo-Osagie, founder Metis Capital Partners.\n\nAngel investors from Paystack, Brex and Tala also participated in the round. TEN13, VentureSouq, and Prodigio Capital were the only institutional ventures that wrote a check for this round.\n\nThis investment comes barely 5 months after the startup raised a $1 million institutional pre-seed. Besides the earlier undisclosed capital raised from friends and family, the company\u2019s total fundraised is now at $4 million.\n\nCapital is a lifeline of business\n\nThere are over 40 million small and medium businesses (SMEs) in Nigeria. These businesses account for 96% of its total companies, 84% of employment, and 48% of the national GDP. But only a few of these businesses have access to capital, mostly due to heavy collateral requirements and long time of loan processing.\n\nPayhippo is at the forefront of solving this problem. Founded by Zach Bijesse, CEO, Chioma Okotcha, COO, and Uche Nnadi, CTO, Payhippo provides small businesses with short-term working capital with average loan amounts of $1300. The company also allows SMEs to build their credit score based on their track record of repaying their loans on time. SMEs even become eligible for higher amounts of capital as their credit score goes up.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIf capital is a lifeline of a business, then it\u2019s safe to say Payhippo is guarding the lifeline of Nigerian SMEs.\n\n\u201cThis funding will allow us to invest in hiring more engineers and data scientists. We aim to improve our technology and enhance our lending offerings as we continue to address the persistent financing gap for small businesses in Nigeria,\u201d Okotcha, COO at Payhippo, said. \u201cAt Payhippo, our vision is to provide millions of small businesses with sufficient and available capital to run and grow their businesses.\u201d\n\nThe company said it has disbursed 5000 loans to SMEs since it launched in January 2020. In September 2021, the Payhippo reportedly earned $64,000 in revenue from $900,000 disbursed, experiencing 25% monthly growth with a 97% repayment rate on loans.\n\nCommenting on his investment in Payhippo, Bolaji Balogun, founder/CEO at Chapel Hill Denham said: \u201cWe\u2019re excited at how Payhippo is using technology to provide SMEs in Africa with access to finance required to run their business needs. By lending to small businesses, Payhippo is allowing business owners access to much-needed working capital to grow their businesses and create jobs in the economy.\u201d\n\nFor Serunjogi and Moujaled, the two co-founders of Chipper Cash, the African fintech which attained a unicorn status on Tuesday, they are bullish on supporting new financial technologies being developed and implemented to change the competitive landscape in the financial sector in Africa.\n\n\u201cAccess to credit is a critical necessity for small businesses to manage their daily challenges. Payhippo helps address this need through its innovative approach that provides loans to small businesses in less than three hours, enabling them to access sufficient working capital to grow.\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nPayhippo plans to use the new funding to improve its technology capabilities and expand its talent pool.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Chipper Cash valued at $2 billion after investment from world\u2019s most valuable crypto exchange",
          "text": "When Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payment company, raised $100 million Series C funding in May this year, the CEO, Ham Serunjogi, without declaring the startup\u2019s current valuation said the company is the most valuable startup in Africa. That sparked a lot of mixed reactions in the ecosystem.\n\nFive months later, it looks like Serunjogi\u2019s claim might not have been far from the truth as today, Chipper Cash announced the extension of its series C and raised $150 million at a valuation little over $2 billion. The investment was led by FTX, the most valuable crypto derivatives exchange company owned by the youngest billionaire in the world, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nWith a valuation of over $2 billion, Chipper Cash has now attained a unicorn status. It joins the ranks of Nigeria\u2019s Interswitch, Flutterwave and Opay, Egypt\u2019s Fawry, Pan-African Andela, and Senegal\u2019s Wave, as the seventh African unicorn.\n\nFounded by Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled in 2018 to offer free cross-border payment service in Africa via a mobile app, Chipper Cash operates in seven African countries \u2014 Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa and Kenya. In May, after the initial $100 million series C round, the company expanded into the UK to power UK to Africa peer-to-peer remittance.\n\nLast month, the startup also entered the competitive U.S market and it\u2019s reported to have started the U.S to Africa remittance in Nigeria and Uganda, with more countries to be added soon. The company also plans to start Africa to U.S remittance in South Africa, Uganda and Ghana next year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarlier this year, Chipper Cash forayed into social payments by partnering with Twitter to offer payment for the social media platform\u2019s Tip Jar feature for African users. The Tip Jar feature was launched early this year to allow Twitter users receive money \u201ctip\u201d directly on the platform.\n\nChipper Cash is FTX\u2019s first investment in Africa. A move that hints that FTX is impressed by how Chipper Cash has been able to scale in the space of three years and its interest in the crypto space. Chipper Cash boasts of having over 4 million users across the world.\n\nThe investment will see FTX partner with Chipper Cash to make money transfer as simple as a text message and accelerate the adoption of crypto within Africa and beyond.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent growth in Africa, moving money across the continent is still slow and expensive. Unsurprisingly it is the fastest growing market with grassroots crypto adoption,\u201d Bankman-Fried, FTX CEO, told TechCrunch.\n\nAs a result of this partnership, FTX will increase its footprint in Africa and Chipper Cash will be integrated into the FTX product so that African users can fund their crypto wallet through Chipper Cash.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a compelling use case for both of our companies as we keep scaling and as FTX keeps scaling their geographical coverage. They do some of the most innovative work in the crypto space, so working with them is going to be quite exciting,\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "If there is anybody to speak on how Nigerian universities are no longer scared, it is Aliyu Shugaba, a professor and vice-chancellor, University of Maiduguri, Borno State, which is the flashpoint of Boko Haram insurgent attacks and epicenter of insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nPainting a picture of the sad developments that have made the Ivory Tower less glamorous for ambitious lecturers, insecure for budding students and less fun for families on campus, Professor Shugaba says, the fact that some of the university facilities were destroyed by bombings and gunshots was devastating.\n\n\u201cSometimes, when the bombs went off, the blasts affected the psychology of our students, making them live in fear. Some of the bombings took place late in the night or early in the morning and this affected the optimal output of the staff and students,\u201d he says.\n\nDespite the bombings and kidnappings of students and lecturers, especially along the Maiduguri-Damaturu highway, the vice chancellor says, \u201cAt some point we made a resolve that we would live with it and continue to discharge our responsibility of teaching, research and community service.\u201d\n\nSo also, other universities across the country resolved to keep on despite the growing insecurity, considering the fact that the government has done little or nothing to curb the attacks on universities, on education and on the future of the country.\n\nToday, university campuses are no longer safe as kidnappers and gunmen have brazen up and are now invading campus to take hostage of lecturers and students unlike the former method of waiting for them outside the campus or on the highways close to the campuses.\n\nThe cases are rising on a daily basis and regrettably unabated. This year alone, over 50 lecturers and university students have been kidnapped by gunmen with at least three deaths across the country.\n\nIn May this year, the Taraba state police command confirmed the kidnapping of Umar Buba, a lecturer and head of the Department of Forestry and Wildlife Management, Faculty of Agriculture in Taraba State University by some armed men. In the same May, there were a series of attacks on University of Jos that warranted the management to close all its students\u2019 hostels over security threats to the school.\n\nRead Also: METKA delivers off-grid hybrid power project to second Nigerian university\n\nNigerian University\n\nIn June this year, one Dan Ella, a lecturer in the Department of Theatre Art, University of Jos, was abducted amid a ransom of N10 million for his release.\n\nIn August, two lecturers at Abia State University, Uturu and others were robbed and kidnapped by gunmen suspected to be herdsmen along ABSU-Isuikwuato Road, though they were later released and one of the lecturers was said to have died from the beatings received from the kidnappers.\n\nThere was also a report of the kidnap of Professor John Alabi, dean of the Faculty of Management Sciences at Kogi State University, Ayingba, by unknown gunmen when the lecturer was about to enter his apartment.\n\nMost recently, gunmen invaded University of Abuja staff quarters in Gwagwalada and abducted six persons including four professors. Reports have it that they have been rescued by security agents.\n\nAlthough in many of the cases, most of the abducted lecturers, their family members and students have regained freedom, probably after ransom is paid, the spate of the attacks on Nigerian campuses is alarming.\n\nSpeaking on the issue, Anele Oguezi, an associate professor at Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ebonyi State, decried that no place is safe if gunmen can attack the Nigerian Defense Academy in Kaduna unchallenged.\n\n\u201cGovernment keeps saying Boko Haram is technically defeated, that bandits are being taken care of, yet these felons keep taking more hostages every day, making money from it and denying many the opportunity to go to school,\u201d he decried.\n\nSpeaking further, the aggrieved lecturer, who has lost five students to foreign universities due to the growing insecurity in Ebonyi State, lamented that the government\u2019s weakness in addressing the situation is giving the culprits energy to do more.\n\nBut Onyedi Ifeatu, a senior lecturer at Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka, thinks that the university community should secure itself as kidnapping has become a lucrative business jointly perpetrated by hoodlums and some unscrupulous security operatives.\n\n\u201cI will not be surprised that some students will be considering going into kidnapping after graduation because there is no job anywhere; kidnapping is paying good money and kidnappers seem to enjoy protection from some unscrupulous security agents,\u201d Ifeatu said.\n\nSpeaking further, he said, \u201cImagine making N5 million from ransom in a month, then kidnapping more people and doubling that amount in two months, what business or job will pay you such an amount? Kidnapping is now lucrative and that is why it is thriving, with even security agents joining.\u201d\n\nAli Nuhu, a father of a University of Jos student who was kidnapped and later released, decried that the government has failed in its security responsibility as families are left to bear the burden of paying ransom for the release of their kidnapped loved ones or bear the loss alone, in the case of death or declared missing for a long time.\n\nNuhu, a pharmacist, said the government can curb the security challenge if it wants to, but shying away because of certain interests, which is killing the country today. Our security is bigger than any person, religion or tribe. Deal with bandits, kidnapper and Boko Haram with full federal might and they will disappear. Government can, but it will not until we all die because their children are all overseas. It is a shame,\u201d he said.\n\nThe pharmacist, who studied on scholarship, decried that already the number of out-of-schools is growing in Nigeria and the attacks on campuses would compound the situation, forcing more students, whose parents cannot send abroad, to be at home instead of being kidnapped or killed on campus by gunmen.\n\nApart from Boko Haram insurgency, increased attacks on local farmers, killings and kidnapping by suspected Fulani herdsmen marauding as bandits have become the order of the day.\n\nThese herdsmen have terrorised Nigerians, destroyed properties and communities, maimed, kidnapped for ransom, while leaving tails of anguish on the lips of many Nigerians.\n\nA recent report by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and European Union (EU) said no fewer than 2,295 teachers have lost their lives, while 1,400 schools have been destroyed in North-East Nigeria since 2009 as a result of insurgency.\n\nPolitical leaders have blamed armed groups for carrying out the series of kidnapping for ransom and raids on schools and universities in Northern Nigeria in recent times.\n\nObservers say that such an attack on a university in Abuja, the seat of power, was a glaring sign that Nigeria is unsafe for the masses and that the situation had worsened with no hope in sight.\n\nPublic affairs analyst, Kayode Kehinde, however, blamed government at all levels for not doing enough to address the situation, stressing that the unemployment rates, corruption among the leaders in the armed forces had contributed.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI mean more emphasis has been put on the Northern regions of Nigeria, inter-state travels, and rising levels of insecurity in some other parts. But right again, abduction at the central capital territory and even in the University environment diminishes all hopes that some parts of the country are still safe.\n\n\u201cWe cannot overemphasise how the insecurity issues in Nigeria keep deteriorating as the day goes by. And if you ask why; to get a better answer, we must also consider the major root causes of increasing crimes in societies.\n\n\u201cWhen governments do not fulfil their promises to the people, when we have increasing unemployment, corruption in the military, and including other forces who are supposed to be the protectors of the lives and property of people, but are now terrors, when we have groups of selfish leaders who know the right things to do but for their personal gains abandon them, etc, the result would always be an insecure society.\u201d\n\nKehinde further advised the Federal Government to redouble its effort to check the spate of insecurity across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBefore the issue further degenerates, it is high time the government sat tight to its responsibilities. As I often say, the best definition of a failed state is one that fails to protect the lives and property of its people.\n\n\u201cWe must act right to get positive results, and the government should stop solving problems from its surface lining but from its actual root,\u201d Kehinde added.\n\nA father of four who spoke with our correspondent on condition of anonymity, said the incident at UNIABUJA had devastated him, making him to almost lose hope in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn July this year, I was discussing with a group of people that Abuja remained the only place where students can now study peacefully. I had said that it would be difficult for the bandits terrorising Niger, Kaduna, Zamfara, and some other states, to venture into Abuja. In fact, I also said that parents should start encouraging their children to apply for admission in the private and public universities in Abuja for security reasons; but I have been proven wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nThe retired federal director-general advised the government to do everything within its power to restore confidence in the citizens, saying \u201cThe primary role of every government is protection of lives and property. If bandits should take over the Federal Capital Territory, it signifies the failure of any government.\u201d",

          "text": "Against all permutations that the off-season Anambra gubernatorial election was going to be violence-ridden and that it would also record massive voter apathy, the exercise has been described as peaceful, but complaints abound over glitches caused by card reader malfunctioning in many locations across the state.\n\nBefore Saturday, November 6, the sing song was that if the election would hold at all, it would witness bloodshed and that many voters would not bother to step out to exercise their franchise.\n\nThe apprehension followed the threat by members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to attack whosoever that would dare to step out to vote or defy its sit-at-home order, which was expected to begin the previous day, November 5.\n\nOur correspondent had reported that in compliance with the sit-at-home order, the streets of Awka, the capital city of Anambra State, was deserted Friday. And that many parts of the state wore a sombre look also.\n\nIt had been days and weeks of uncertainty and apprehension despite assurances by government and stakeholders that security would be guaranteed before, during and after the election.\n\nBut the secessionist group said it called off the order after consultations with elders, traditional and religious leaders from the region.\n\nEmma Powerful, the group\u2019s director of Media and Publicity, in a statement, said: \u201cFollowing the genuine intervention of our elders, esteemed traditional institutions/rulers and religious leaders, and after due consideration of the positive impacts of their engagement, and sequel to the fact that our elders have spoken in our terms, the leadership of IPOB, ably led by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, hereby and immediately call off the one-week sit-at-home earlier declared to commence November 5 to November 10.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe have equally considered several appeals by our mothers who earn their living based on their daily economic activities, which will obviously be affected if Biafraland is locked down for one whole week. It\u2019s never our intention to add to the pains of our people, hence our decision to suspend the sit-at-home.\n\n\u201cIPOB leadership is only interested in our referendum and peaceful agitation for self-determination, and cannot by under any guise be seen to be interfering with any electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe people of Anambra should go out en-masse and peacefully exercise their franchise on Saturday and accordingly, chose a leader of their choice. They should not be intimidated by anybody, group of persons or security agents.\u201d\n\nPowerful further said: \u201cAnambrarians should vote and standby to protect their votes. No rigging of any kind will be tolerated. It must be transparent, free and fair to all.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, urge all Biafrans and residents of Biafra to go about their lawful businesses without fear of any molestation. All agents of darkness recruited by our enemies to inflict pain on our people under the guise of enforcing the sit-at-home are hereby warned to steer clear or brace up for the consequences of their evil action.\u201d\n\nObservers say that the dramatic volte-face by the outlawed IPOB, giving a go-ahead order, asking people to go participate in the election, must have boosted the enthusiasm of indigenes to perform their civic responsibility.\n\nRead Also: Anambra election: People\u2019s lives must be valued above the ballot\n\nAnambra election\n\n\u201cI must commend IPOB for the maturity and their realisation that it is foolhardy for one to bring war into one\u2019s own home. If you are unhappy about a situation, you should not burn down your own house to show you are angry. I am happy that reasons prevailed. I also thank our elders- traditional rulers and religious leaders for prevailing on them to make that reasonable decision. The peaceful conduct of the exercise is in all our interest,\u201d a chieftain of one of the parties, who craved anonymity.\n\nThe chieftain further advised the INEC and security agencies to ensure that the exercise ends as a credible one.\n\n\u201cIt would be too bad to begin to hear that the election was rigged at the end of the day. That would encourage the IPOB and others to make the state ungovernable for whosever is believed to have compromised the process. That would not be in the interest of Ndi Anambra,\u201d he further said.\n\nEighteen political parties and candidates contested to succeed the incumbent Governor Willie Obiano.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had said ahead of the election that there were 2.5 million registered voters and 5,720 polling units in the state but that there would be no voting in 86 of them because there are no registered voters there.\n\nFairly huge voter turnout\n\nAlthough it may be difficult to determine as yet the total number of voters that turned out to exercise their franchise, our correspondent can report that it was way ahead of expectation, as according to him, \u201cNobody expected that people would leave their homes to the polling booth with all the uncertainties.\u201d\n\nAn 89-year-old voter, Abigale Enu, who voted in the exercise, urged the INEC and security agencies to ensure that her vote counts.\n\nShe spoke after casting her vote at Ward 1, polling unit 003 and 0015, Enuagu village, Enugwu-Ukwu, in Njikoka Local Government Area of the state.\n\nSoludo, others lament glitches\n\nChukwuma Soludo, governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), says the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) deployed by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the election has failed.\n\nSpeaking with journalists after the device failed to accredit a number of voters at his ward in Aguata LGA on Saturday, Soludo lamented that many people have not voted despite arriving at the polling unit early.\n\nThe former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) said the device being deployed in Anambra for the governorship election is the reason why many people have not voted.\n\n\u201cFundamentally is that technology collapsed; BVAS technology of a thing is a complete failure,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf it is going to be rectified it is going to be in minutes or hours to come. Almost 12:30pm in the day, voting is yet to start in most of the polling units in the state.\n\n\u201cFor the few places that they are doing (voting), technology that ought to take seconds to accredit someone takes 20 minutes, 30 minutes, and so on. With the crowd you can find hundreds of people\u2026 if the machine starts working you are not going to finish this crowd within the hour.\n\nSpeaking further, Soludo said the situation raises fundamental questions about the technology, adding that the situation was the same across the state.\n\n\u201cBecause I have been getting calls from virtually all LGAs in the state about the glitches. Places where you have 900 people, you have five or six that have voted so far.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental problem is the technology that is being tried here in Anambra. It just hasn\u2019t worked up to this minute. Maybe, we will still keep being optimistic. The technician who is supposed to be the expert has been fiddling with it (BVAS).\u201d\n\nAgnes Okoli, a septuagenarian, said that she got to the polling point as early as 7:30 a.m and had to wait till officials arrived, expressing her happiness at the peaceful conduct of the people as well as hope that it would end that way.\n\nShe said she was anxious to vote because it was her civic duty and that it was an opportunity for Amaesi to give Anambra their son as governor because one of the major candidates was from the Community.\n\nAssurance of security major reason for impressive turnout \u2013 Deputy Governor\n\nNkem Okeke, deputy governor of Anambra State, has attributed the large turnout of voters to the presence of security agencies in the state.\n\nOkeke, who spoke on the huge turn-out, said the decision of the Federal Government to deploy massive security in the state was the magic.\n\n\u201cThe people are very relaxed as you can see. There is no apprehension at all. People have no reason not to come out, because they are confident of the security,\u201d he said.\n\nOkeke had a few weeks ago dumped his party, the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) for the All Progressive Congress (APC).\n\nINEC extends voting in Anambra governorship election to Sunday\n\nFollowing the failure of the Biomodal Voter Accreditation System, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has extended voting in the ongoing gubernatorial election in Anambra State till Sunday, November 7.\n\nMaking the announcement at a press briefing at the Commission\u2019s headquarters in Awka, the state capital, was the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Dr. Nkwachukwu Orji.\n\n\u201cIn line with existing regulations and guidelines of the commission, any intending voter who is on the queue by 4.00 pm shall be allowed to vote. All Polling Unit staff must comply with this directive.\n\n\u201cThe extension of time arose out of several field reports that voters have had problems with accreditation. The Commission is currently investigating the reason the accreditation devices, Bimodal Voter Accreditation System, have worked perfectly in some polling units, but not in others. In some of the cases, it would seem that this resulted from software glitches,\u201d Orji said.\n\nAccording to Orji, \u201cOur technicians have already built an update to the devise software to prevent further challenges. The update is currently being installed in the concerned BVAS and we request voters, candidates and agents to be patient and allow our technical staff to solve the problem.\n\n\u201cThe Commission wishes to reiterate that in cases of sustained malfunction of the BVAS, the Presiding Officer must inform the voters and polling agents that accreditation and voting for the affected Polling Unit shall continue tomorrow or at another time determined by the Commission.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWith this extension of time and the recommencement of accreditation where the BVAS consistently malfunctions, the Commission assures that no voter will be disenfranchised.\n\n\u201cOur deployment has also been adversely affected by transportation challenges in some locations. It must be noted that on account of security concerns, some of the transporters that were mobilized and collected 50% of their sign on fee backed out at the last moment, leaving some of our ad-hoc staff stranded.\n\n\u201cAlso, some of the trained ad-hoc staff backed out at the last moment. The Commission is on top of these challenges and extant regulations and guidelines will be applied on a case-by-case bases.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we are harvesting areas where voting will realistically no longer take place today, including places where substantial disruption has occurred, to enable a possible recommencement of voting at another time, in line with extant laws and the regulations and guidelines of the Commission.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to all voters, candidates, stakeholders communities and political parties to remain calm and law abiding. We assure you that the Commission is determined to a make all votes count.\u201d",

          "title": "Why The Fertility Industry Needs Legal Regulation \u2013 Dr. Abayomi",
          "text": "In vitro fertilization is said to be the most common and effective type of assisted reproductive technology that helps women become pregnant. Can you estimate the number of babies conceived in your centre through IVF?\n\nAt the last count, we had over 3,500 babies but I don\u2019t count babies anymore. What I do is to see that; we maintain set standards. Secondly, we look out for new ideas to be introduced. So I don\u2019t wake up thinking about how many babies we have anymore because every day, somebody gets pregnant.\n\nThe question of how and when to regulate the industry has undeniably become mired in politics and privilege, with surprising twists. Do u agree that the market is the wrong model for the fertility industry?\n\nTalking about regulation, IVF is not the only medical section in Nigeria. So I don\u2019t understand why people are particular about IVF. There are some cases within MBS, like for five years of malpractice, and the doctors are still practicing. What I\u2019m saying is that if we want to start looking at IVF alone we might be missing the point.\n\nYou cannot regulate without the practitioners coming together to tell you what even obtains. It is a long process because we have been trying also to do it. What I am saying is that if we want to start looking at just IVF, we might be missing the point\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEvery good practitioner wants regulation to come in. But I also tell people, be careful what you pray for because there was an attempt a few years ago to bring some regulations from East Africa, to just copy and paste in Nigeria, because we sometimes don\u2019t do our homework thoroughly. While we want regulation to take place, everybody who is involved with it is interested in the regulation. Lagos state now has something like regulation for IVF. I think it is a good starting point for us to look at how we, Nigeria, can at least agree that we should regulate it. But you cannot do regulation without policing, it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nChildless couples are being exploited in fertility clinics. What\u2019s the cost implication of IVF in your centre?\n\nYou see, if you want to do IVF properly, then what goes into it is expensive up to the water that we use in the laboratory with import. So if you want you must get the quality right. We live in a country where you don\u2019t manufacture anything. You live in a country where one run ten generators. In fact ,you know what, I tell people that it was more profitable five years ago than what it is now. If you want to do it properly, I\u2019m sorry , the cost cannot go down if you don\u2019t manufacture anything. So, nobody says a kidney transplant is not going down. Why are we not looking at the whole thing holistically? What about kidney transplant? What about even if you want to have an ordinary childbirth now in a good hospital? Because you have to mark it up with the dollar so we are all victims. I\u2019m sorry because our currencies first lost value and we are not manufacturing.\n\nAgain, more than 60 per cent of people offering IVF service in the country do not have the facilities but due to the perceived financial benefits and patronage, doctors and health workers who know little or nothing about IVF have continued to take advantage of couples in need by offering services.\n\nCan you reel out the benefits of HIFU technology?\n\nHigh-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU), which is a non-invasive way of treating uterine fibroids that eliminates the need for surgery and with short recovery time. Before we talk about the benefit, its important to state here that the regulation must be done the proper way with the involvement of practitioners and with effective policing\n\nThis procedure is very well suited for people who want to have children. But what we try to tell people that HIFU is not for infertility, some people will say I have fibroids, when the sperm count is low. It is for fibroids. Now, there is some explanation for and that is why I said we must get the right patient.\u201d\n\nNow, if you have the kind of fibroid that is in the endometrium, and occupies all the unlimited, we might not want to do it. What we trY to do is that that was always to ensure that there is about 15 millimetre space between the fibroid and the endometrium, so that we do not destroy the endometrium while destroying the fibroid as well. So, patient selection, and then preparation is the most important thing for HIFU, once you get all that right. It is like a piece of cake.",

          "title": "#AnambraDecides: Yiaga\u2019s Election Monitoring Group Identifies 66 Election Inadequacies",
          "text": "Yiaga Africa, a non-governmental organization, claims to have received 66 significant incident reports from the Anambra State election, which, if left handled, could jeopardize the election\u2019s integrity.\n\nThe organization\u2019s judgment was based on reports from 500 election observers and 27 mobile observers who were deployed to 229 out of 248 voting locations across the state\u2019s 21 LGAs.\n\nIt stated that its preliminary findings from the 66 cases showed that there were delayed opening of the polling units; delay in the accreditation and voting processes and under-deployment of officials to polling units.\n\nFurther cases at polling units included the malfunctioning of the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS).\n\nYiaga called on the Independent National Electoral Commission to find a lasting solution to the problems encountered and ensure registered voters do not get disenfranchised due to technology or logistics-related problems.\n\nThe group said, \u201cThe WTV election day situational report provides information and data on the commencement of polls, availability of election materials and critical incidents that may impact the quality of the election.\n\n\u201cThis report is based on verified reports received from sampled polling units as of 4pm on election day. In addition, sixty-six critical incident reports were received and processed as of 4pm. These incidents could potentially undermine the integrity of the election if unaddressed.\n\n\u201cDelayed opening of polling units: Yiaga Africa WTV observed the late arrival of polling officials and materials at polling units across the State. By 7:30 am, polling officials were present in only 17% of polling units.\n\nThe delays were occasioned by poor logistics management. Yiaga Africa anticipated these challenges based on our pre-election observation, hence the call in our pre-election statement urging INEC to make contingency plans in situations where respective transport unions /companies reneged on their contractual obligation to deploy.\n\n\u201cLate start of Polls: As expected, the late arrival of polling officials delayed the commencement of accreditation and voting across several polling units. Reports from the WTV observers revealed that by 9:30 am only 28% of polling units commenced accreditation and voting. By 10:30 am, 50% of the polling units had commenced accreditation and voting.\n\n\u201cThis, however, increased by noon as accreditation and voting were reported in 81% of the polling units. The geographical distribution indicates that 64.3% of polling units in Anambra Central Senatorial district commenced accreditation and voting by 10:30 am, 60.3% of polling units in Anambra North while in Anambra South senatorial district, only 28.9% of polling units commended accreditation and voting by 10:30am.\n\n\u201cDeployment of Polling Officials: Yiaga Africa WTV observed that an average of 2 polling officials were deployed in those polling units where INEC officials and materials arrived.\n\n\u201cThis is lower than the required number of four polling officials per polling unit. At least one female polling official was present in the polling units.\n\n\u201cDeployment and non-functionality of Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS): Yiaga Africa WTV observed the deployment of the BVAS to the polling units. However, Yiaga Africa received reports of the BVAS failure to authenticate voters\u2019 fingerprints and photos even where voter details were confirmed on the voter register.\n\n\u201cCritical Incidents: Non-opening of Polling Units by 12 noon: Based on verified reports from Yiaga Africa observers, 19% of polling units failed to open by 12noon. In other words, INEC officials didn\u2019t deploy to those polling units. These incidents are mostly concentrated in Anambra South Senatorial District (23.5%), Anambra Central (17%), and Anambra North Senatorial districts (13%).\u201d",

          "text": "Yoruba socio- political group, Afenifere, has tackled the Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, for saying those criticising the President were doing so because he is Fulani.\n\nIts Secretary-General, Chief Sola Ebiseni, in a statement in Akure, Ondo State capital, kicked against such ethnic allusion.\n\nAdesina had lambasted clerics whose habit, he said, was to criticise the performance of the President and compared them to Pastor Kumuyi of the Deeper Life Ministry.\n\nEbiseni\u2019s statement was entitled, \u2018Buhari\u2019s Performance And Femi Adesina\u2019s Attack on the Clergy\u2019.\n\n\u201cFemi played some odious ethnic music when he alluded that many who were criticising the lacklustre performance of his boss were only doing so because they didn\u2019t like being ruled by a Fulani man\u201d, the Afenifere leader stated.\n\n\u201d There is no need reminding him that northern Nigeria which is now rendered asunder in ethnic relationships, as a result of Buhari\u2019s government\u2019s clueless or permissive treatment of security matters, was once ruled as One North, by Sir Ahmadu Bello, Sardauna of Sokoto and scion of the Fulani Uthman Dan Fodio caliphate.\n\n\u201cBuhari is not more Fulani than Shehu Shagari, the mantra of whose government, as President of Nigeria, was One Nation, One Destiny. Umaru Yar Adua, as Fulani and President of Nigeria, did not spend two years to solve the problems of agitation amongst the youths of the Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cHis Government toured the creeks, dialogued and sought understanding. He did not hold the whole of the people of the South-South responsible for the agitation for which he would have called the territory \u2018water logged\u2019 and the people to be treated in the language they would understand, neither did he unleash state terrorism on the residence of any agitator as Buhari Government would want Sunday Igboho killed\u201d.\n\nGoing biblical, Ebiseni said \u201cFrom the days of Prophet Samuel to Saul; Nathan to David when he killed Uriah and took his wife Bathsheba; Elijah who told Saul that he and his household were the troublers of Israel, up to modern days Martin Luther king, Desmond Tutu, Archbishop Okogie, Bishop Gbonigi, Matthew Kukah, Tunde Bakare and all, the commission of God to His prophets does not exclude speaking truth to earthly rulers.\n\n\u2018Of course, while these true men of God speak truth to power, there are legions of men, like the 400 prophets of Ahab against Micaiah and of Baals who lurk around power to massage the egos of rulers and cause them to sin the more.\n\n\u201cSuch advisers abound in this Government who make the President believe he has power over land use and some who would advise the people to choose between their lives and land and deceive the President that peaceful agitators like Sunday Igboho have capacity for territorial secession or that killing Nnamdi Kanu would stop Biafran agitation. Only God can safe rulers from such counsels as He did of Ahitopheli\u201d.\n\nThe group noted that Adesina\u2019s desperation for excuses appears not to spare any institution no matter how sacred.\n\n\u201cThis time around, Femi has chosen to hide behind a patronising statement on Pastor Kumuyi of the Deeper Life Ministry to latch at the clergy for speaking truth to power.\n\n\u201clt is absolutely within his right, for Femi to choose not to go to any church as long as he serves the Buhari\u2019s government, but he cannot deliberately misrepresent Pastor Kumuyi to set him up as examples of prominent personalities who would see no evil or say nothing about evil in order that they may not be seen as denigrating government and men in power.\n\n\u201cHe was particularly unkind to the Pastor of his own church which church he exited particularly because he chose not to stop criticising President Buhari after most of the abducted Dapchi schoolgirls were released.\n\n\u201cPower must have done some incalculable damage to the psyche of Femi Adesina that he would not remember that five of the girls were brutally murdered and that in the release negotiated by the Federal Government, Leah Sharibu was singlehandedly and permanently denied her freedom for refusal to renounce her Christian faith.\n\n\u201cYet, Femi expected his own Pastor, as a leader in the same faith, to applaud Buhari for doing nothing extraordinary to bring Leah to freedom, if only to demonstrate that he is the father of all faiths despite his records of being a sharia agitator\u201d.",

Hon. Ayuba Abok.\n\nThe coalition which is an umbrella body of about 74 civil society organisations, expressed concern at the turn of events in the aftermath of impeachment of the former Speaker, which it said was unhealthy for the much-needed peaceful atmosphere in the state.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Abuja yesterday, the Convener of the coalition, Comrade James Dauda who was flanked by other members maintained that attempt to whip up sentiment through spurious allegation that Governor Lalong was behind the impeachment of the former Speaker was not only condemnable but unacceptable in a democratic setting.\n\nThe group noted that the governor, who is the chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, NGF , was the first to grant judicial and legislative autonomy in Nigeria which the former Speaker enjoyed the privilege.\n\nIt wondered how members of the State House of Assembly, which is independent of the executive arm of government in the state, turned out to impeach its Speaker for reasons best known to them, yet the governor is being accused of \u2018behind the scene\u2019 role.\n\n\u201cGentlemen of the press, we are aware that Plateau State House of Assembly was the first out of 36 States of the Federation to enjoy legislative and judicial autonomy, even when Hon. Ayuba Abok held sway as Speaker.\n\n\u201cThe lawmakers decided to impeach their leader based on reasons best known to them and elected Hon. Yakubu Sanda as new Speaker, which we consider as democracy in action, hence, peace should be allowed to reign at all cost,\u201d the convener stressed.\n\nA\u00e7cording to him, \u201cthe embattled Speaker had once refused confirmation of nominees as commissioners when he has opportunity to do so for the state to move forward, yet the governor who was an ex-lawmaker played along given that in democracy, each arms were at liberty to take decision on their own.\u201d\n\nThe group further bemoaned the ex-Speaker\u2019s recalcitrance in cooperating with the All Progressives Congress, APC structure in Plateau which has degenerated to factionalization during the recent state congress.\n\nIt, however, commended Governor Lalong for his maturity and leadership that has ensured peace and tranquility as well as socio-economic and infrastructural development of the state, while calling on the citizens, particularly the youths not to allow themselves to be used.",

Akpabio noted that the preparation of the ministry\u2019s budget was conceived in line with the Federal Government\u2018s2022 Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability premised on repositioning the economy on the path of growth and resilience.\n\nWhile presenting a total budgetary proposal of the sum of N28,131,295,396 allocated to the Ministry comprising, personal (N1,692,591,184) overhead (N877,089,120) and capital (N25,561,615,092), the minister noted that, \u201cthe Ministry ensured that core projects were consistent with the Administrations Agenda Policies/strategies contained in the Medium Term National Development Plan (MTNDP), 2021-2025, according priority to on-going projects\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe 2022 Budgetary Allocation is meagre and significantly inadequate in the face of the mandate and goals of the Ministry to meet the yearnings and aspirations of the people. The volume of the outstanding liabilities with underfunding has affected ongoing projects/programmes of the Ministry across the region and this is gradually contributing to the resurgence of problems in some areas of the region,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking earlier, during the budget presentation the Chairman House of Representative Committee on Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs Hon. Essien Ekpeyong, assured that the Legislature is committed to the security of lives and investment in the Niger Delta region and for economic and social activities to strive. Therefore, he said, the budget proposal of N25.56 billion would be given due attention in line with the 2021 budgetary review.\n\nHe explained that there was need for the Executive and Legislature to work together to ensure that thousands of uncompleted projects scattered across the region are completed for the betterment of the life of the people.\n\nHe also noted that the House would also consider if there were challenges that would require legislative intervention, particularly in the area of funding in respect of the East-West Road by setting up committee to work with the ministry in this regard.",

They were taken to the Police Hospital in Falomo for treatment and some of them have been discharged.\n\n\u201cWe have taken the full records of survivors in the incident. This gives a total of 15 people rescued alive. We have a total of 42 bodies that have been recovered,\u201d the governor explained.\n\nHe identified the latest survivors to include a 38-year-old woman, Glory Samsom, Ndajor Ahmed, Yunusa Abubaka, Ajiboye Habib, Jeremiah Samson, and one man identified as Emem.\n\nWhile most of them sustained varying degrees of injury, according to the governor, Samson, 20, is said to be in a coma.\n\nSanwo-Olu, also, said 49 families had filled the missing persons\u2019 register as at Saturday morning, saying the register had helped the state government to reconcile the details of victims rescued alive and also medically account for bodies recovered.\n\nThe governor said identification of bodies by relatives had commenced, adding that DNA examination was being undertaken on some of the bodies difficult to be identified by their families.\n\nSanwo-Olu said: \u201cThere is a sum of money that has been reserved by the state government for succour and to give for befitting burial for those who died in the incident.\n\n\u201cFamilies that wish to accept it are being supported for the burial arrangement. Also, survivors in hospitals have been given the financial support to help them settle and cope with challenges of feeding in the aftermath of the incident.\u201d\n\nTinubu, on Saturday, visited the site of the collapsed building in the company of Sanwo-Olu and his Nasarawa counterpart, Sule, among others.\n\nTinubu and Sule sympathised with families who lost their relatives and state government over the unfortunate tragedy.\n\nThe building collapsed on Monday with many artisans and others trapped in the rubble. Currently, 42 bodies have been recovered, 49 families filled the missing persons\u2019 registers while 15 rescued alive.\n\nThe state government had said families of the victims would go to the Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba to identify the corpses recovered from the rubble.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Osinbajo has again warned media houses and online publishers against publications linking him with the 21-storey building that collapsed last week in Ikoyi, Lagos State.\n\nA statement entitled: \u2018Libelous Publications of and Concerning His Excellency, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, on Collapsed Ikoyi Building\u2019, issued by his lawyer, Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN), stated that the warning became necessary to explain the legal consequences of fabricating falsehood and unsubstantiated negative reports concerning the vice president.\n\nThe statement warned that in law, \u201cliability for libellous publications is not limited to the original author or publisher thereof, but it also extends to and includes all those who, out of sheer ignorance, mischief or malice, or all, cause any libellous publication to be repeated, reposted or re-published, either personally or through any platform for which they have control\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cWe are solicitors to His Excellency, the Vice-President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo (SAN), on whose instruction we write, in respect of the above subject matter.\n\n\u201cWe have the mandate of our client to draw your esteemed attention to certain publications of and concerning him, in respect of the 21-storey building that recently collapsed in Ikoyi, Lagos State.\n\n\u201cThese publications believed to have been sponsored by faceless individuals and entities to tarnish the good name and reputation of our client, claim most spuriously, that our client is connected with the said building, one way or the other, without any scintilla of proof. For the records, our client is not involved in, associated, or connected with the ownership or development of the collapsed building, in any manner whatsoever.\n\n\u201cThis notice has thus become necessary, partly to explain the legal consequences of fabricating falsehood and unsubstantiated negative reports, of and concerning our client. In law, liability for libellous publications is not limited to the original author or publisher thereof, but it also extends to and includes all those who, out of sheer ignorance, mischief or malice, or all, cause any libellous publication to be repeated, reposted or re-published, either personally or through any platform for which they have control.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we have the instructions of our client to compile and preserve the particulars of anyone found to have published, re-published or endorsed or consented to the publication, distribution or circulation of any libellous material, of and concerning him, to commence civil actions in court, in any jurisdiction where such publication occurs\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, implore you not to yield your noble platforms for the dissemination of any libellous publication of and concerning our client, henceforth.\u201d\n\nSegun James and Wale Igbintade",

          "text": "The Federal Capital Territory Police Command (FCT) Saturday announced the arrest of eight kidnappers involved in the abduction of six members of staff of the University of Abuja after a fire-fight with security forces at Shenegwu Forest in Gwagwalada Area Council.\n\nThe arrest is coming as the command launched an investigation into Friday night\u2019s kerosene tank explosion at Kubwa Village Market that killed five people and injured 10 others.\n\nThe Niger State Government also on Friday night demolished the home of a suspected notorious kidnapper.\n\nAn update on the University of Abuja kidnap incident issued by the FCT Police Command stated that the police in a joint operation with the military and other security agencies rescued the six kidnap victims on Friday.\n\nThe daring Tuesday morning kidnap, which alarmed security agencies, had triggered a massive security cordon around the nation\u2019s capital, leading to the deployment of troops and mounting of road blocks at the entry points to the territory by the Brigade of Guards.\n\nThe Brigade of Guards of the Nigerian Army is assigned to protect the President, his family and the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThe update signed by the FCT Police Public Relations Officer, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), Josephine Adeh, said a joint operation by security agencies arrested the culprits after a fierce gun duel.\n\n\u201cFollowing investigations and manhunt for the criminal elements involved in the abduction of staff of the University of Abuja at the University Staff Quarters, Giri, on November 2, 2021, operatives of the Nigeria Police Force in collaboration with the military, the DSS and other security agencies, in a joint operation, in the early hours of Friday, November 5, 2021, successfully identified the hideout of the criminals located at Shenegwu Forest in the Gwagwalada area of the FCT and rescued all the abducted victims unhurt,\u201d it said.\n\nThe command said: \u201cThe criminal elements on sighting the security team, engaged them in a fierce gun duel. However, the superior firepower of the security operatives led to the arrest of eight members of the notorious gang while some other members of the gang fled into the forest and nearby communities.\u201d\n\nIt said the FCT Police Commissioner, Mr. Babaji Sunday, enjoined residents particularly those around the Gwagwalada area of the FCT to be vigilant and provide the police with useful information that could assist in apprehending the gang members still at large while efforts were being intensified to arrest fleeing members of the gang.\n\nIt said all the suspects would be charged to court on conclusion of the investigations.\n\nThe CP disclosed that investigation was being accentuated while a dragnet was extended to arrest all the criminals.\n\nHe further implored residents to report all suspicious movements.\n\nMeanwhile, the FCT Police Command said it had launched an investigation into the kerosene tank explosion that killed five persons in Kubwa Village Market.\n\nThe inferno triggered by the explosion burnt many shops in the area.\n\nA statement by FCT Police Command said it had commenced investigations into the unfortunate fire incident.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command has commenced investigations into the unfortunate fire incident that occurred at the Kubwa Village Market of the FCT in the evening of November 5, 2021.\n\n\u201cPreliminary investigations, however, revealed that two shops in the market were affected in the fire incident following a kerosene surface tank explosion.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the remains of five persons already burnt beyond recognition were evacuated from the scene by the rescue team and taken to the hospital where they were confirmed dead while 10 others, who were seriously injured, were immediately taken to the hospital and presently receiving medical attention\u201d, it said.\n\nThe FCT Police Commissioner, who described the incident as unfortunate, ordered a discrete investigation into the incident.\n\nHe noted that operatives from the forensic section of the command\u2019s criminal investigations\u2019 department, were deployed to the scene for forensic analysis to unravel the cause of the incident and more importantly, provide recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence of such incident.\n\nBabaji commiserated with the families of the victims.\n\nHe affirmed that the inferno was under control and commended the people, who were at the scene at the time for supporting in the rescue operation and general control of the fire.\n\nNiger Demolishes Suspected Kidnapper\u2019s Home\n\nIn another development, the Niger State Government on Friday night demolished the home of a suspected notorious kidnapper.\n\nThe demolition exercise took place in the Nikangbe area of Bosso Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe state government\u2019s bulldozers carried out the exercise under the watchful eyes of the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Mr. Emmanuel Umar, in the presence of heavily armed security operatives.\n\nThe identity of the owner (suspected kidnapper) of the buildings was not disclosed.\n\nThe suspect was said to have started constructing the buildings about two months ago and completed one wing within one month.\n\n\u201cHe does not live in the building,\u201d one of the neighbours told THISDAY.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the neighbours became suspicious of the source of money for the construction because of the speed of construction work, leading to the information being leaked to the authorities.\n\nDiscreet investigation was said to have been carried out by security agents, which confirmed that the houses were being constructed from proceeds (ransom) of crime.\n\nIt was learnt that the suspect was subsequently arrested and taken to Abuja for further investigation.\n\n\u201cThis is a landmark achievement, I salute our law enforcement agencies for this great feat,\u201d Umar said, during the demolition exercise pointing out that: \u201cIt is a realisation of the state government\u2019s determination to go the extra mile to ensure restoration of peace in this state.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a building owned by a kidnapper that has been arrested. It is from a proceed of crime and it is in our policy not to allow any criminality to reign in this state. We can establish this and that henceforth, we will not allow any criminal to have a place in our land. It is part of the determination of the governor to ensure Niger State is safe for us all\n\n\u201cThis action will serve as a deterrent and warning to other criminals that the state government would give no place to criminals to live in the state,\u201d the commissioner explained.\n\nThe commissioner however refused to give details of how the suspect was apprehended but said it was established that he (suspect) used part of the proceeds of the crime to construct the building\u201d.\n\nUmar said: \u201cIt is part of the policy of government not to allow any criminal to have a place in the state,\u201d adding that \u201cif they did not leave peacefully, the law will catch up with them and they will leave by force\u201d.\n\nHe disclosed that government has met with stakeholders in the state, including the landlord associations, estate owners, and hoteliers and has told them to report any suspicious movement or strangers moving into the society. \u201cI hope we get more information to act on and make the state safe,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Ward Head of Kpakungun who oversees Nkangbe, Alhaji Tanko Ibrahim commended the action of the state government saying \u201cif followed judiciously, it will help to keep the state safe.\n\nIn June this year, the State House of Assembly passed a bill imposing capital punishment on kidnappers, bandits, and their informants.\n\nThe bill also provides that anyone found guilty of kidnapping, banditry, and of being their informants will face a death sentence.\n\nThe bill assented to by Governor Abubakar Bello, which necessitated the demolition exercise, was designed to check the increasing wave of kidnapping and banditry in the state and strengthen the fight against criminalities by the state government.\n\nThe bill also states that anyone found guilty of the offence of banditry, kidnapping, or giving out information that results in kidnapping and banditry will be sentenced to death by hanging in public.\n\nAbout seven local governments areas in Niger State have in the last one year been under the siege of bandits, kidnappers and cattle rustlers leading to over 3,500 people being displaced and about 400 killed in the affected local government areas.\n\nThe LGAs under the siege of bandits are: Munya, Shiroro, Rafi, Wushishi, Mariga, Mashegu and Magama.\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Laleye Dipo in Minna",
