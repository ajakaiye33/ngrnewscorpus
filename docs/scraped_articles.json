          "title": "Groups differ over Osun finances, Aregbesola\u2019s probe",
          "text": "A group, The Osun Masterminds, has asked for a probe into the finances of Osun State during the tenure of Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, as the governor of the state.\n\nThe group also called on the state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, to speak about the state of the government that he inherited, saying the people deserve to know.\n\nSpeaking against the backdrop of a sharp drop in the monthly allocation accruable to the state, TOM\u2019s Executive Director, Dr. Wasiu Alli-Oyeniyi, in a statement in Osogbo on Tuesday, expressed concern over deficit of N375 million that the state got from the Federation Account in February 2022.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn the month ended February 2022, Osun State Government received a negative allocation of N-375million from the FAAC, out of a possible N1.45bn. The implication of this is that the state will be paying back an extra sum of N375million from next month\u2019s allocation, plus the deductions already waiting in that month.\n\n\u201cThe governor, Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola, must as a matter of importance and the very near future, speak about the state of the government he inherited. The state\u2019s people deserve to know why their state is in the state of affliction that it presently is. When the people can rightly appropriate blame, working together to get out of the quagmire becomes easier.\n\n\u201cThe state government needs to, as a matter of urgency, conduct a financial sustainability exercise that will look into the core areas of finances of the state, the capacity it has for survival and the steps it needs to take to correct past errors.\n\n\u201cSuch exercise may necessarily include a probe of the past administration\u2019s financial actions, with a view to issuing necessary white papers where necessary, to reprimand persons found guilty of poor actions.\u201d\n\nBut reacting, another group, Progressives Minded Forum, in a statement signed by its Coordinator, Sunday Oriowo, accused the state government of sponsoring The Osun Masterminds to discredit Aregbesola.\n\nThe PMF, however, supported the call asking Oyetola to tell the people of the state the actual debt profile when he took over power in 2018, the repayment method and projects that the loans were expended on.\n\nThe group also challenged Oyetola to disclose deductions which made the state to receive negative allocation from FAAC and the actual amount being generated as Internally Generated Revenue.\n\n\u201cMr Governor sir, members of the public would like to know \u2018other deductions\u2019 which put the state into negative in the February allocation. The people will also like to know how you have been funding the little projects you have embarked upon since all your claim is \u2018there is no money in the state.\u2019\n\n\u201cBesides, it is pathetic that a supposed objective group would close its eyes to the non-disclosure of N11.9bn refund to the Osun State government on Federal Government projects executed by Aregbesola, but rather continue to blame the former governor for the debt,\u201d Oriowo said.\n\nReacting, the state Commissioner for Information, Funke Egbemode, said Oyetola\u2019s government did not sponsor any group to attack or demand Aregbesola\u2019s probe.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe Osun Masterminds is not an agency of government in Osun. We didn\u2019t sponsor anybody.\n\n\u201cIf people are saying the truth, say they are saying the truth. If they lie against you, defend yourself. Don\u2019t leave the message and the messenger and be chasing shadows.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Oke Ako, a community in the Ajoni Local Council Development Area of Ekiti State, erupted in joy on Tuesday as a cleric, Michael Adeyeye of Christ Apostolic Church in the community escaped unhurt from the four gunmen who abducted him on Saturday.\n\nResidents of the community could not believe their ears when news filtered in on Tuesday morning that the cleric had escaped and was at Eruku in Kwara State awaiting vehicle to convey him back to Oke Ako.\n\nIt was carnival like as the cleric arrived the community in the afternoon to the waiting arms of youths and the elderly who sang and danced round the town.\n\nAdeyeye, while recalling his experience, said he, alongside the four gunmen who initially demanded N50million ransom before reducing it to N15million, walked in the forest throughout Saturday night and Sunday.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe were in church for a vigil on Saturday. At about 10.20pm, four armed men arrived the church, saying \u2018where is pastor?\u2019 On locating me, they tied my hands and ordered me to follow them. We went into the bush.\n\n\u201cThe following day, Sunday, they asked me to call my family to get N50million ransom across to them for me to regain my freedom. We were using my phone which they had already seized for the calls. Later, they reduced the ransom to N15million.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately for the gunmen, on Monday morning, at about 5am, the God of covenant demonstrated his awesomeness. I saw the CAC Founder, Apostle Ayo Babalola, in a vision. That was what woke me up to discover that my abductors were fast asleep.\n\n\u201cSo, I rose and stealthily moved away from the location into the bush. I kept walking in the bush until Tuesday morning when I got to Eruku, a town in Kwara State. On getting to the town, I called one of my brothers whose phone number I know offhand.\u201d\n\nAdeyeye, who said that his abductors were Fulani Bororos going by their language and physical appearance, added, \u201cTheir guns looked like AK-47, the guns appeared fabricated. I am happy for my escape. I am happy to be reunited with my people and church members. I can see love from the community.\u201d\n\nThe cleric, who lauded security agencies for their efforts since he was abducted on Saturday, said, \u201cThe report I had on my return is that operatives of the police, Amotekun, Nigerian Army, vigilante and local hunters did their best on the matter. Our people said the security agencies went into the bush on rescue mission to ensure my release and apprehension of the criminals.\u201d\n\nThe PUNCH reports that Oke Ako residents have been complaining that the community is under the siege of herdsmen who they complained were committing all sorts of atrocities including attacks in the farms, kidnappings and making lives unbearable for them.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Bashir Bello, KANO\n\nThe Kano State Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps, FRSC said the Kano-Zaria-Kaduna highways remains a challenging road crash spot for the command as motorists engage in reckless driving on the road which is currently undergoing rehabilitation.\n\nThe FRSC Sector Commander, Zubairu Mato stated this while speaking with newsmen in Kano.\n\nMato decried that motorists plying the road took advantage of the road rehabilitation which has some part already completed to engage in dangerous overtaking, overspeeding and in most cases resulted in head-on-collision.\n\nThe Sector Commander said it has deployed its personnel and equipment to the axis to ensure the safety of lives and properties on the road.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cCurrently, the only challenging road that we are having and battling with is the Kano-Zaria-Kaduna highway. And we are on top of the situation.\n\n\u201cThe road used to be bad before and people complain that because it is bad that was why there are lots of crashes on the road. Now, the road is good but we still record crashes. It is because people when they are on the good roads, most commercial drivers, always have that urge to hurried to drop the passengers for another turn. They engage in excessive overspeeding and dangerous overtake.\n\n\u201cWe have put measures in place to arrest the situation. We have special patrols of three teams from Tudun Wada, Chiromawa and Kano units to assist in the axis to arrest the situation. We have increased our quick response time to about five minutes. We have two ambulances stationed there. We have a clinic where victims are treated before being transferred to the hospital among others.\n\n\u201cWe have also embarked on massive campaigns as we extended our sensitization to worshippers in the mosques and churches to talk to the drivers when they are overspeeding. We go to the motor park to talk to the passengers and drivers. The passengers should caution the driver when they are driving recklessly. And the drivers should always obey the traffic rules and regulations,\u201d Mato said.\n\nThe Sector Commander further said that the command has succeeded in recording zero road crashes along Kano-Bauchi, Kano-Azare roads among others.\n\n\u201cThe command was able to mitigate the issues of crashes on effectively and efficiently along Kano \u2013 Bauchi roads, Kano \u2013 Jigawa roads which used to be black spot area of road traffic crashes. We were also able to mitigate a lot of crashes in between Kano \u2013 Hadeja road at the other axis. The road crashes have reduced virtually to zero fatality. We are also on top of the game along Kano \u2013 Katsina and Kano \u2013 Gwarzo roads.\u201d\n\nHe enjoined all motorists to install speed limit devices in the vehicles to avert over speeding noting that \u201cIf all will install the device it will reduce 52 per cent road crashes in the country which is as a result of over speeding.\u201d\n\nMato maintained that the command has over the years embarked on the evacuation of break down of heavy-duty trucks or vehicles from roads across the state to ensure hitch-free traffic flow in the state.\n\n\u201cKano State as an industrial city, there is a lot of heavy-duty truck. You have issues with broken-down trucks. So we use the heavy-duty truck to tow them to our office to ensure no obstruction that could lead to a ghastly accident. That is why in Kano, we never witness a crash which involves a tanker or heavy-duty truck in the state,\u201d the Sector Commander, Mato however stated.",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Bashir Bello, KANO\n\nA Presidential aspirant under the Social Democratic Party, SDP, Adewole Adebayo on Tuesday said that injustice is the missing link and bane to the growth and development of the country.\n\nThis was as he said injustice is responsible for the too many woes of the country ranging from insecurity, clamour for secession and corruption among others.\n\nAdebayo stated this when he paid homage on the Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero to seek his royal blessing towards his ambition to contest for the presidential seat.\n\nThe Presidential aspirant vowed that if given the mandate in 2023 he will ensure that justice prevail and rule over the land.\n\nIn his words: \u201cThe problem of Nigeria can be reduced to one thing and that is injustice. No country is too poor to be just. You cannot say you want to borrow money from World Bank or IMF to do justice. You can do justice wherever you are. And if you do justice, you will see abundance. Because a just person will not be corrupt, cheat or take advantage of the office to loot the resources to himself and his friends.\n\n\u201cWhen Nigeria use to have less, we were happier. That is when we had no oil, we were happier. For thousands of years, Nigeria has been under natural leadership. And all the leaders had always known that Justice is what you give to the people.\n\n\u201cAnd I have been recommending to all my fellow politicians not to go around promising people bridges, water and things you are not going to do. But promise what you can do which is justice. And in this land, we will do justice.\n\n\u201cSo justice is the beginning and end of my mission in politics. And when there is justice, there will be no religious, ethnic, economic, ideological, political or cultural differences because justice is an attribute of God.\n\n\u201cThe insecurity in Nigeria also arises from injustice. I believe when we come into power, the bandits will go back to where they came from because justice will rule over the land.\n\n\u201cI am a 100 per cent follower of late Aminu Kano. I would not have been in politics today if there was no Aminu Kano. And I know he was in politics because of the late Alhaji Zungu. The way I refer to Aminu Kano as my leader is the way he referred to Zungu as his leader. So my complete political education is around the principles of the late Aminu Kano. And he stood for justice.\n\n\u201cI am in Kano because it is a photography of the nation where you have every ethnicity presented in the state. So if you want to speak Nigeria, just come to Kano,\u201d Adebayo stated.\n\nIn his remarks, the Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero enjoined the politicians to eschew politics of bitterness ahead of the 2023 general elections just as he commended the entourage for having representation of women and youths.\n\nThe Presidential aspirant\u2019s train during the visit to the Emir included former Minister of Sport, Solomon Dalung and former lawmaker, Senator Mohammed Alkali (Sardaunan Gumel) among others.",

Olasoji Adagunodo (Supra) flies in the face of the known doctrine of stare decisis.\n\nThis doctrine also called judicial precedent is well-rooted in Nigerian jurisprudence. It is a well-settled principle of judicial policy which must be strictly adhered to by all trial Courts.

          "title": "CSOs trade words over call for Aregbesola\u2019s probe",
          "text": ".\n\nShina Abubakar, Osogbo\n\nA group of civil societies organisations known as The Osun Masterminds has called for an immediate probe of the former governor of Osun state and Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, for alleged mismanagement of the state\u2019s resources when he was the helmsman.\n\nThe group specifically challenged Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, to speak out on the financial status of the state and begin probing of former administrations\u2019 financial accounts.\n\nBut, another group, the Progressives Minded Forum, has countered the call, describing it as an attempt to discredit the former governor.\n\nThe Osun Masterminds in an address at a press conference by its Executive Director, Dr. Wasiu Oyedokun-Alli, expressed worry over the debt profile of the state, saying the negative allocation received by the state from Federal Allocation Account Committee (FAAC) in February is a bad signal.\n\n\u201cIn the month ended February 2022, Osun State Government received a negative allocation of -375million from the FAAC, out of a possible 1.45billion. The implication of this is that the State will be paying back an extra sum of 375million from next month\u2019s allocations, plus the deductions already waiting in that month.\n\n\u201cWhile we understand that increasing figures of fuel subsidy has beaten down monthly allocations to various arms of government, the more worrisome implications of this to Osun State is the fact that as the Federation\u2019s finances worsen, Osun will become more incapable of meeting its debt obligations, let alone have any money left to run the State.\n\n\u201cThere is an even more disturbing possibility. Now that we have the sum of 375million to repay from March allocation, as to make up for the shortage in the deduction for February, it is clear that shortages in deduction of this nature may continue to accumulate if the Federation\u2019s finances do not improve. This means that monthly, Osun will continue to get allocation deficits that are higher in figure than the last. The worst, therefore, may not yet be seen.\n\n\u201cIf the State proceeds in this manner, it will steadily progress into insolvency and eventually, total bankruptcy. This is not a point we hope to be in.\n\n\u201cThe State Government needs to as a matter of urgency conduct a financial sustainability exercise that will look into the core areas of finances of the State, the capacity it has for survival and the steps it needs to take to correct past errors. Such exercise may necessarily include a probe of the past administration\u2019s financial actions, with a view to issuing necessary white papers where necessary, to reprimand persons found guilty of poor actions.\u201d\n\nHowever, PMF, in a press release by its Coordinator, Sunday Oriowo, on Tuesday, alleged that the Osun Masterminds were sponsored by some group in the government who had earlier planned to sponsor some pensioners to stage a protest when the minister was in the state on Monday to commission the 72-unit housing on behalf of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cThe first malicious action sponsored by the government against the minister was the mobilization of some people who were to disguise as pensioners in the state to protest against the minister during the commissioning of the 72-unit Federal Mortgage Housing Estate in Abere.\n\n\u201cHaving failed in the first plan, the government activated its second plan by engaging \u2018The Masterminds\u2019, a group known for its hypocrisy, money-driven opinion and financially induced press conferences, to launch attack on the Minister, in a desperate bid to discredit his official assignment in Osogbo.\n\n\u201cBesides, it is pathetic that a supposed objective group would close its eye to the nondisclosure of N11.9bn refund to the Osun State government on federal government project executed by Aregbesola, but rather continue to blame the former governor for the debt,\u201d PMF added.",

          "title": "Incessant grid collapse: Evidence of moribund power sector",
          "text": "Incessant collapse of the national grid and the recent blame game between electricity Generation Companies (GenCos) and other arms of the value chain are a testimony to the wobbling state of the Nigerian electricity supply industry, reports JOHN OFIKHENUA.\n\nAmid rising costs of diesel, the national electricity grid collapsed again and again \u2013 almost 24 hours after warning from electricity Generation Companies (GenCos). Already badly enmeshed in imbroglio, the Nigerian electricity supply industry raised a lot of dust last Sunday as GenCos brought their side of the sector\u2019s sordid story to the fore. Not later than 24 hours after they battled to tell their tales of neglect and abandonment, the electricity market recorded another grid collapse, worsening the nationwide near darkness.\n\nBesides, the latest grid collapse confirmed the GenCos\u2019 position that the Nigerian System Operator (SO), the technical wing of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), had been prevailing on the energy generating firms to switch-off and on their plants on a daily basis. Technically, the machines should not be turned off and on for more than 20 times in a year. But owing to the weakness of the grid, which cannot endure over 4,000mw, the generating plants have been switched off and on up to 365 times in a year. This practice, said the Association of Power Generation Companies (GenCos), Executive Secretary, Dr. Joy Ogaji, has worn out the generating plants.\n\nIn that condition, she said, the GenCos are now in dire need of funds to maintain the ailing plants. In addition, over N1.6 trillion debt overhang for unused capacity over the years by the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company Electricity (NBET) Plc has weighed them down from optimal operation.\n\nSpeaking during a press conference she organized in Abuja, she noted that the GenCos, which she represented, were out to counter the claims of the TCN that blamed load-shedding on the low energy generation.\n\nHer speech was mostly directed at the press statement of the TCN, Public Affairs General Manager, Mrs. Ndidi Mbah. On the other hand, it was a veiled rejoinder to the Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, who, on March 3rd, informed State House correspondents in Abuja that the current load-shedding was due to low water level in the hydroelectric dams. \u201cBefore I conclude, I would like to discuss the increased load-shedding you may have observed in Abuja and other areas in the country. With the reduction in hydro capacity during the dry season, additional load needs to be taken up by our gas plants,\u201d Aliyu was quoted to have said.\n\nThe depth of the crisis\n\nIt was pertinent for the Minister of Power to speak to the issue as the hue and cry of the manufacturers, residential customers and event dependent consumers were rife in both mainstream and social media to the embarrassment of the government. Regrettably, as the electricity market recorded less than 3,000mw last week, the TCN mouthpiece issued a press statement to reveal how the GenCos had plunged the country into outage. She said the TCN only depends on the energy it receives from the GenCos and allocates power to Distribution Companies (DisCos) based on approved percentage (formula approved by National Electricity Regulatory Commission), of the total generation available per hour or on day-ahead nomination.\n\n\u201cPresently, the cumulative generation nationwide is low and generation companies have attributed this to several factors, including poor gas supply, fault in generating units of generating companies, scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, all of which have caused most power generating companies to limit their generation, and sometimes not generate at all,\u201d Mbah said.\n\nContinuing, the TCN General Manager revealed that a summary of the power generating profiles in the last two months, for instance, clearly showed that 14 gas powered generating stations were either not generating at all or had limited generation at various times within the period, further depleting the quantum of power generation available for transmission into the grid on a daily basis. \u201cPower generating stations in this category include: Omotosho units 5 & 6, Olorunsogo units 3, 4 & 6, Omoku units 3 & 6, Omotosho NIPP units 3 & 4, Delta units 15, 17 & 18, Afam VI units 11 & 12, Olorunsogo NIPP unit 3, Ihovbor NIPP unit 2, Sapele Steam unit 3, Sapele NIPP unit 1, Odukpani NIPP units 1 & 3, and Okpai units 11, 12 & 18.\u201d\n\nAlso, within the same period, Jebba Hydro and Shiroro Power Generating Stations were either out or had limited generation, causing additional loss of 232MW from the grid; while other power generating plants such as Omotosho units 3 & 4, Olorunsogo units 1, Delta units 10 &20, Afam VI unit 13, Ihovbor NIPP units 4, Geregu NIPP units 22&23 and Odukpani NIPP units 2, 4 & 5, have also been out either on fault or for scheduled maintenance, causing a further loss of about 3,180MW from the grid. A combination of the above scenarios has persisted and the total effect on the grid is persistent low generation, which TCN operators have had to strive to dispatch in a way that will not jeopardise the stability of the grid.\n\nMore recently, from the 1st to 4th of March, 2022, there was generation shortfall due to water management in Shiroro and Jebba hydro with the loss of 307MW and 125MW respectively from both stations. Within the same period, there were fault and technical problems in Egbin, causing 514MW shortfall and in Geregu causing 230MW shortfall, while reported fault at Alaoji NIPP reduced generation from the substation by 263MW.\n\nGas constraints alone in Olorunsogo gas generating plant had reduced generation from the station by 104MW. In the same vein, Omotosho gas lost 102MW and Sapele NIPP lost 263MW. In Omotosho NIPP, there was generation shortfall of 233MW and in Omoku a shortfall of 112MW. Two units in Okpai have limited generation due to technical problems, causing a 204MW drop in generation and in Afam VI 511MW drop in generation. Gas constraint and fault in Olorunsogo NIPP reduced generation by 240MW, Geregu NIPP by 435MW, and Ihovbor by 142MW. Also, due to gas pipeline pigging, Odukpani NIPP was shut down, which caused a reduction of generation by 575MW.\n\n\u201cTCN further reiterates that a combination of issues ranging from gas constraints, fault, and technical problems within generating plants caused persistent low generation and consequently low load allocation to Distribution Companies nationwide. This is based on the fact that TCN can only transmit what is being generated by GenCos and presently they are all generating below capacity.\u201d\n\nApparently, this revelation infuriated the GenCos to tell their side of the story to energy reporters on Sunday. Speaking through Ogaji, they said, \u201cIlliquidity, caused by the huge sums owed GenCos by the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET), has more than ever before continued to frustrate the GenCos and kept them incapable of meeting their obligations, which are extremely necessary to keep their power plants running and make capacities available, while observing required Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) standards.\u201d\n\nSuch obligations, according to her, include GenCos operations and maintenance (O&M) as and when due, procurement of critical capital, spare parts and accessories, payment, and servicing of existing loans from lenders and financiers, employee-obligations, etc. Ogaji recalled that recently the GenCos cried out to the authorities and \u201care still looking forward to a favourable consideration of their pleas for foreign exchange (FX) support to enable them to procure critical spares for their across the country,\u201d adding that there is \u201cno corresponding investment and improvement was made on this anomaly over these years, compelled GenCos to begin to question the optimal generation.\n\nIssues of gas volume, gas quality, gas pressure and gas recovered or added by GenCos through huge investments done by them to generating capacity depend on expected returns and costs.\u201d\n\nMbah opened up that \u201cone of the reasons that the power plants are down was due to inefficient management of the grid.\u201d The spokesman recalled that while the power sector was technically managed by an expert Marcel Martin, it was better off. She urged the government to swallow its pride and recall him to continue managing the plants. \u201cRecently, you must have heard that Egbin lost several units. I pity the National Control Center (NCC), Osogbo staff. They need to be empowered. Some of you who were here when Marcel Martin was in Nigeria, both the generation companies and distribution companies, he developed tools that were used to manage the grid. The grid was not as bad as this. Let\u2019s look for Marcel to develop more tools. Let\u2019s stop claiming that we know it. Let\u2019s ask for help,\u201d Mbah said.\n\nThe TCN always prides itself with using in-house manpower to solve technical challenges in the grid. But it was obvious from her veiled assertion that that self-help has not been good enough. Although she convened the briefing, she was ambivalent about how to make public some classified figures. As the session was degenerating to \u201cI don\u2019t have the figures\u201d kind of briefing, the reporters asked why she invited them with half facts against opponents that had already nailed the GenCos with naked facts and figures. Consequently, the eloquent lawyer returned to her seat, and at best, rolled out the age-long concealed facts about the handlings of the sector.\n\n\u201cThe reason I don\u2019t want to give you figure is also the lack of transparency in the market. So, if I give you this as the exact figure, it is the figure that the NBET can say no, this is not the figure.\u201d At that point, reporters still pressed her to open up. Ogaji said: \u201cI am going to give you some figures since you are still insisting on having some figures.\u201d\n\nFollowing the Power Purchase Agreement in the sector, the NBET pays the GenCos for unused power, which is referred to as capacity. Thus, she rolled out the figures from 2015 to January 2022. According to her, it totalled N1.644 trillion. Her words: \u201cCurrently today, on capacity we are owed by NBET is N1.644 trillion.\u201d Similarly, Ogaji, who could not state the shortfall in the power sector, attributed it to the opaqueness of the NBET management. She said: \u201cIn terms of the current shortfall in the market, I am afraid, I cannot give you the figure. Unlike me, I would have been able to give you that figure, but you can see, there has not been transparency in the market recently. I owe due respect to the former MD of NBET (Marylyne Amobi); every month we could go to the website of NBET, we can see what is our invoice and what has been paid. Since she left, we have not had access to that data. We have requested for it severally through NBET and it is not forthcoming.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, speaking to The Nation on phone, the NBET\u2019s Head of Corporate Communications, Ms Henrietta Ighomrore, insisted that the GenCos must open their plants for NBET to test their acclaimed capacity. She also noted that the power sector is an integral part of the national and global economy and has been disbursing funds to the GenCos proportionally to remittance from available funds. She revealed that, recently, the NBET disbursed N32 billion to the GenCos for the month of December 2021. \u201cThere is no money in anybody\u2019s account that has not been remitted to them. As an entity, the GenCos also have their financial records where they put what they sell and what they received. Asking you want to see the books of another person is out of place and it borders on mischief because there is a regulator in the sector.\n\n\u201cWhat the sector requires is transparency and collaboration. So the GenCos should be able to meet NBET at the point NBET is able to provide services to them. So, we were doing capacity test toward activation of contracts you should allow us come to your plants as scheduled and check your capacity. We have to ensure that our payments are done properly. We cannot be funding inefficiencies in the sector. So, if you say you have capacity, we have to test it. So when payments are made, they are made to fund efficiencies,\u201d Ighomrore said.\n\nThe next day, providence was at work. This time, it was the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) that notified its customers that national grid collapsed at 10:40am. The terse notification reads: \u201cDear esteemed customer, we experienced general outage across AEDC network at 10:40 am today due to a system collapse, which occurred on the national grid. Appropriate measures are now being taken to restore normal supply as quickly as possible. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience.\u201d\n\nBusinesses groan as operating costs skyrocket\n\nAs Nigeria\u2019s electricity grid collapsed for the umpteenth time, it has compounded the woes of many businesses by foisting higher energy costs on businesses that are already battling skyrocketing costs of diesel. With limited electricity supply from the grid, many businesses said they are forced to embrace alternative energy that has become extremely expensive as a result of rising global prices of crude oil.\n\nMany business owners complained the situation is compounding the woes of the country and many Nigerians, with implications for higher production costs and living expenses. The crisis has forced the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) to plead with government for palliative as diesel price and aviation fuel now increase almost on daily basis, with stakeholders afraid that the ugly development may cripple businesses and worsen existing unfriendly living conditions in the country.\n\nWhile Small and Medium Scales Enterprises that survive mainly on the premium motor spirit are struggling with the scarcity of petrol subsidies, bigger organisations that depend on diesel generators now have to buy the product at prohibitive prices. The price of diesel has soared by almost 170 percent in one year to N620-650 (or more depending on the location) per litre from N220-N240 in March last year. The surge in the price of diesel, which has been deregulated, is a response to global oil prices \u2013 a crisis worsened by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Brent, the global oil benchmark, is currently selling for over $100 per barrel in the global market.\n\nConsequently, as businesses groan over rising operating costs, many individuals are feeling despondent as a result of rising food prices. Thus, surging prices of diesel in Nigeria have brought about a fresh spike in food prices, dashing hopes of returning to a more stable market condition. This is because food producers and retailers are now facing intense pressure from rising energy costs as they have to spend more on diesel to power their factories and on logistics.\n\nThe way forward\n\nSince the national grid is within the purview of the TCN and it cannot stand more than 4,000mw, the agency has to open up on how much help it needs. However, it is now evident that the power sector condition is like that of a tattered rag whose redemption is beyond quick fix. Although the sector has been enmeshed in a blame game, the fact is that the GenCos lack the capacity to produce more than 4,000mw. The TCN, too, lacks the capacity to wheel more than the energy already produced. On the other hand, the DisCos are reluctant to absolve more load in order to control their remittance. Admittedly, the NBET has no capital to sustain payment for unutilised power. Thus, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) must wade into the situation with a holistic solution.",

So, it has to start from the first zone, which is Enugu East.\n\n\u201cIt is not as though if it is thrown open, somebody like Ekweremadu will take it from us. Mark my word. But what we are saying is that we will have to test the provision of the constitution if the ticket is thrown open. We will have to answer the question of where do we start after the position has gone round the three zones.\u201d\n\nNnaji described Ekweremadu\u2019s remarks about zoning as misinformation that should not be allowed to stand.\n\nSaid he: \u201cThe first section of the latest PDP Constitution (2017) makes it clear that everybody is subject to the provisions of the constitution, subject to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. That same Section One says the provision of the constitution is binding on everybody.\n\n\u201cSection 7(3c) states that rotation of public offices is compulsory. It says adhering to the policy of rotation and zoning of party and public elective offices in pursuance of the principles of equity, justice and fairness.\n\n\u201cEkweremadu is aware of this provision because he cannot pretend not to be aware. If not for any other thing, he\u2019s a lawyer.\n\n\u201cThe party put this in the constitution to give room for fairness and equity.\n\n\u201cHe also said if anybody is challenging him to the fact that zoning was discussed anywhere in the state, the person should speak up. I want to tell him that it is not true that zoning was never discussed anywhere in the state.\n\n\u201cIt has been a convention that governorship position rotates among the three senatorial districts. It has come to stay, taking effect from 1999.\n\n\u201cThe reference he was making about Jim Nwobodo, C. C. Onoh and Okwesilieze Nwodo having been governor of Enugu State. That was the period zoning and rotation were never in existence.\n\n\u201cThe issue of zoning started in 1999. Although, Chimaraoke Nnamani is not a product of zoning, he started the issue of rotation. I knew quite well that at that time, he had the capacity to retain the governorship position in Nkanu (Enugu East) where he comes from in 2007. But for the issue of equity, justice and fairness, he decided that power should shift to another zone. The question then was between Enugu West and Enugu North, which would take governorship first.\n\n\u201cMyself, I had several discussions about that to the effect that I concluded that Enugu West should take it. And one day when I visited him, he told me that he had taken a decision that Enugu West should take the position. That was why power was shifted to the West and Sullivan Chime incidentally took the position.\n\n\u201cI was also meant to understand that there was a meeting Chimaraoke Nnamani called where the decision to shift the position to Enugu West was taken. Senator Collins Ndu, Ekweremadu and some others were at that meeting. It is not an issue that everybody must be at that meeting to take a decision.\n\n\u201cNow that it has gone round, the question is, are we going to allow it to be open or maintain the existing rotation? This thing is like a clock that must be allowed to continue to go clockwise.\n\n\u201cEnugu East that started the zoning has been out of power for 16 years and should take their turn immediately. Obviously after Enugu East, it will be the turn of Enugu West where Ekweremadu comes from.\u201d\n\nNnaji added: \u201cEkweremadu\u2019s argument on no zoning is because he believes that after eight years, he will not be politically relevant to contest the position anymore. This is why he wants to rock the boat by saying there\u2019s no zoning principle.\n\n\u201cI will have to tell you that even if there is zoning, when the party comes out to announce where the position is going based on our constitution, it\u2019s not going to foreclose other people who have interest. You can go and buy the form, enter the race. If you succeed, fine and good.\n\n\u201cI want to remind you that even when Sullivan was picked from the West, Chimaraoke\u2019s deputy, Okechukwu Itanyi from the North, also contested but lost.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re not saying Ekweremadu has no right to contest. But his chances of success will be reduced to the barest minimum if the party takes a position on where the ticket is going.\u201d\n\nHe said Enugu East people are law-abiding and are interested in listening to the party and wanting it to take a position on the matter.",

          "text": "Adedayo Akinwale\n\nAfter days of leadership tussle that plagued the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Yobe state Governor, Mai Mala Buni and the National Secretary of the party, Sen. John Akpanudoedehe appeared to have crawled their way back to power as the Chairman and Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party.\n\nBuni had travelled out of the country to Dubai for medical reasons when a faction of APC governors moved against him.\n\nThe Governor of Niger state, Abubakar Bello assumed the leadership of the party in acting capacity while Buni was away.\n\nWhile the crisis raged, there was confusion over the fate of Akpanudoedehe. While reports claimed he had resigned, though he insisted that he remained the secretary of the party until President Muhammadu Buhari said otherwise.\n\n\u201cI have read in social media that I have resigned as Secretary of the APC. I want to state that it is not true that I did resign. If I had resigned, you would have seen my letter of resignation written by me. Someone cannot just say somebody is dead when he is alive.\n\n\u201cSomeone cannot say what the president said. I have not received any letter from anywhere. As I said, nobody is bigger than the party. The issue is that, have I resigned, the answer is no. I am the National Secretary of the party,\u201d Akpanudoedehe had said.\n\nHowever, in a dramatic twist, Buni bounced back Tuesday when his Personal Assistant, Mr. Muritala Yakubu was given access to the national secretariat of the party for the first time in more than a week.\n\nThough Buni is not back in the country yet, the meeting some governors held in London with President Muhammadu Buhari appeared to have resolved the lingering leadership crisis in the party.\n\nAfter Buni\u2019s aides gained access to their offices, Akpanudoedehe also arrived at the national Secretariat of the party around 12:08 pm.\n\nWhile addressing journalists briefly at the national Secretariat of the party in Abuja, Akpanudoedehe said the ruling party was now crisis free despite the events of the last few days.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) under the Chairmanship of His Excellency, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, makes this Press Release to clarify the events of last week and reassure the membership and stakeholders of the Party, as well as the Nigerian people in general, that the Governing Party is crisis-free, strong and remains united in giving the country the transformative leadership and good governance which she promised them.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe said the CECPC had always done its best to steer the affairs of the APC in line with the mandate invested in her at inauguration by the National Executive Council (NEC) of APC.\n\nHe added that on February 28, Buni took a long-delayed trip abroad on health grounds, leaving behind written authorisation for other members of the CECPC to continue work in his absence, particularly the day to day management of the APC.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said: \u201cThat in his absence, sundry activities earlier scheduled for action appeared to develop fresh urgency in order to satisfy the timetable for the 2023 general election released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), thus galvanising some within the CECPC to act in their best understanding of both the situation and the leadership dynamics in the Committee/Party.\n\n\u201cThat all such actions were clearly identified at all times as happening in an acting or proxy capacity, and under the auspices of the substantive Chairman, His Excellency, Governor Mai Mala Buni, contrary to widespread speculations that the Chairman, Secretary or some other officials of the CECPC have been removed from Office or otherwise replaced.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe said the caretaker Committee was intact and functional as originally constituted.\n\nThe secretary assured that the delivery of a seamless National Convention of APC slated for March 26 was top on the priority of the Caretaker committee.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe shall continue to execute such assignments as are legal pending the return of the Chairman who is on his way back to the country and shall resume Office on arrival with the full support of all members and other stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to INEC for her firm guidance in the entire circumstances.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe revealed that the party had engaged a team of senior lawyers to address a purported court order halting the planned APC National Convention.\n\nThe ruling party called on the Judiciary to give the matter the needed and expedient attention in a bid to vacate the purported Court order and allow for the conduct of a transparent and rancour-free National Convention.\n\nAkpanudoedehe restated the absolute loyalty of the CECPC to the APC and the leadership of the party led by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe also reassured members and citizens that the ruling party was stronger than ever before and poised to extend her winning streak to 2023 and beyond.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Trans-Amadi (Gas) lost 92MW, Alaoji NIPP (Gas) lost 75MW, while Ihovbor NIPP (Gas) lost 101MW.\n\nAs of yesterday, the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), which manages the power grid, had yet to comment on the immediate cause of the collapse, although, it was the first in the year.\n\nThe blackout had worsened throughout the country around 10:40am, after the national grid collapsed, with the Eko Electricity Distribution Company, confirming the incident in a text message to its customers.\n\nThe text message read, \u201cDear esteemed customers, a system collapse occurred on the national grid at 10:40am today, leading to outages across our network. We are working on the situation with our TCN partners and will keep you updated.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely apologise for the inconvenience this may have caused.\u201d\n\nAbuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) also pleaded for the understanding of its customers, noting that it is taking appropriate steps to ameliorate the effect.\n\nThe Disco stated, \u201cDear esteemed customer, we experienced general outage across AEDC network at 10:40am today due to a system collapse which occurred on the national grid.\n\n\u201cAppropriate measures are now being taken to restore normal supply as quickly as possible. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience.\u201d\n\nWhile confirming the system collapse yesterday, Kaduna Electricity assured its customers that power would soon be restored.\n\nIt stated, \u201cWe regret to inform you that the power outage being experienced in our franchise states is due to system collapse of the national grid which occurred about 10:40am.\n\n\u201cPower supply shall be restored as soon as the National Grid is powered back. Our sincere apologies for any inconvenience.\u201d\n\nIn its notice to customers, Enugu Electricity Distribution Plc said the system collapse affected supply in Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, and Imo states.\n\nThe notice signed by EEDC Head, Corporate Communications, Emeka Ezeh, read, \u201cThe Enugu Electricity Distribution PLC (EEDC) wishes to inform her esteemed customers in the South East of a general system collapse which occurred this morning, Monday, 14th March 2022 at 10:40 am.\n\n\u201cThis is the reason for the loss of supply currently being experienced across the network.\n\n\u201cConsequently, all our outgoing feeders are out and supply to our customers in Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, and Imo states is affected by this development.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the power minister yesterday held an emergency meeting with all stakeholders in the power sector to address the current low power generation. He warned that stakeholders must work together to make electricity more stable.\n\nThe meeting held at the conference hall of the ministry had in attendance delegations from the Gencos, TCN, Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading (NBET), Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), Nigerian National Petroleum Company ( NNPC), Shell, and other stakeholders in the power value chain.\n\nA source at the meeting quoted Aliyu as saying, \u201cThis meeting was summoned to address the current electricity situation in the country, which we are not happy about. We must find a solution so that Nigerians will have electricity. I want us to have the patience to talk to each other, not blame each other.\u201d\n\nAliyu maintained that the Nigerian government would not relent in its effort to ensure that improvements in the power sector were sustained and built upon, adding that current challenges must be addressed.\n\nThe meeting, according to the minister, would find solutions that would ensure prompt resolution of all the problems affecting power generation currently besetting Nigeria.\n\nIn Lagos, the Egbin Power Plc also recorded a collapse in its power generating system for the second time in 2022. The Egbin Power system collapse, which occurred about 10:40am, was witnessed by journalists who were at the venue to cover the 2022 edition of Egbin Graduate Engineers Programme (GEP).\n\nThe incident happened in the presence of the top management team of Egbin, including Group Managing Director of Sahara Power Group and Chairman of Ikeja Electric, Mr. Kola Adesina, among others.\n\nThe Minister of Power had penultimate week blamed the low water level at the dams for the worsening power supply in the country.\n\nTCN also had last week attributed the worsening power situation to low power generation from generation companies (Gencos).\n\nThe Gencos in turn fired back on Sunday, as their Executive Secretary, Dr Joy Ogaji, blamed the worsening state of power supply in the country on the N1.6 trillion owed them by the federal government since 2013.\n\nThe Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET), on its part, disputed the Gencos\u2019 debt claim, saying only companies with active gas supply and transportation contracts were paid for unutilised capacity.\n\nThe Sahara Power GMD expressed sadness over the poor state of the country\u2019s power sector and the endless blame game among players in the sector.\n\nAdesina, \u201cI hate what is going on. As a Nigerian, I\u2019m displeased, I\u2019m not happy and I will tell you why. All that Nigerians want today is power. Isn\u2019t it? No blame game now, no story.\n\n\u201cJust give power to the people, end of discussion. When generation says it\u2019s gas, story. When gas says because people are not paying them, story. When TCN says Discos are not taking power, story. So, it\u2019s just stories. We don\u2019t want stories. I\u2019m tired of the contradictory stories and I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nAdesina said the blame game in the sector could only be solved in a sincere dialogue by all the market participants.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOnce that is done, the problem will be solved, and I know that the Minister of Power is already planning to bring all the sector participants together to have a conversation to resolve this problem.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the Board of Directors of Eko Electricity Distribution Company approved the appointment of Dr. Tinuade Sanda as Deputy Managing Director of the company. Prior to her appointment, Sanda was Chief Accounting Officer, a position she had occupied since 2013.\n\nThis announcement was made by EKEDC General Manager, Corporate Communications, Godwin Idemudia.\n\nIdemudia said in the statement, \u201cWe are pleased to announce that the Board of Eko DisCo has approved the appointment of Dr. Tinuade Sanda as the new Deputy CEO, which is in line with the company\u2019s strategies and procedures.\n\n\u201cThe Board and Management are confident in Sanda\u2019s proficiency and capacity to assist in leading the company towards its vision of becoming the leading and customer-centric electricity distribution company in Africa.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the appointment, Board Chairman, EKEDC, Mr. Oritsedere Otubu, said, \u201cWe are proud to announce Tinuade Sanda our first female Deputy CEO. Her appointment has proven the resilience of our succession planning mechanisms and the value we place on our corporate governance practices, which underpin our philosophy of building and recognising home-grown talents.\u201d\n\nAviation Fuel Scarcity: We Have Three Days to Shut Down Operations, Airlines Warn\n\nAirline Operators in Nigeria yesterday warned that they have only three days left to shut down operations over lingering scarcity of aviation fuel.\n\nIn their presentation, Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) threatened that they had only three days to shut down operations over lack of aviation fuel.\n\nRepresented by the Chief Executive Officer of Airpeace, Mr. Allen Onyema, expressed concern over the high cost of aviation fuel.\n\nThis was as the stakeholders in the aviation sector agreed to peg the price of the aviation fuel at N500 per litre.\n\nThe Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), Mr. Mele Kyari announced the decision at the meeting of the stakeholders with the special committee of the House of Representatives investigating the circumstances surrounding the recent hike in the price of aviation fuel chaired by the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase.\n\nThe resolution to peg the price at N500 per litre would be experimented for only three days from today and within the period the Association of Airline Operators and the major oil marketers are to engage themselves and work out modalities that would lead to the permanent reduction of the price of aviation fuel in the country.\n\nKyari, however disclosed that at the moment there were 19 oil companies with 88 million litres of aviation fuel in the country.\n\nThe NNPC boss explained: \u201cWe know this is a very difficult situation. We know that once aviation fuel increases, prices of flight ticket will certainly increase and this can surely cost pain for Nigerians. That is why we are working with you to ensure that those pains are minimised to the barest minimum and one of the elements is the pricing of aviation fuel.\n\n\u201cSo, what we have engaged with MOMAN, DAPMAN and the airline operators is that in three days\u2019 time, their representatives will sit down and agree on a transparent base for pricing.\n\n\u201cThat means that they ought to have a referenced benchmark that is quoted transparently in the market. They will have a referenced exchange rate for the naira so that anyone can compete.\n\n\u201cThey will also agree on a premium which currently differs from customer-to-customer, depending on the volume you buy and the credit level.\u201d\n\nKyari added: \u201cThese are the things they can negotiate in three days and close, so that going forward, there is a transparent decision on pricing. This will no doubt throw up the actual value of the product in the market.\n\n\u201cYou will no longer see these discrepancies we have seen where some people are selling at N445 and some are selling at N630. This will completely bring close such that you will not see these differences.\n\n\u201cWe also agreed that in the interim, between now and three days they have to close negotiations, the lowest price we have seen this morning was N445 and the highest was N605.\n\n\u201cThere is a trader that is selling at N630 and we don\u2019t think this is normal and so, we discounted it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the NNPC GMD said it was, \u201cagreed that we sell at N500 in the next three days and after that, they will switch to the new price that everyone can assess.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, as requested by the Airline Operators Association of Nigeria, \u201cthey would be granted license by the authority to import petroleum products, particularly ATK so that they can have a way of benchmarking the sales of other customers and can also bring in cheaper products whenever it is possible.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the operators through Onyema requested for licencing of its members for the importation of Aviation Fuel to end the perennial hike in the price and scarcity of ATK.\n\nThey maintained that they have the competence to import the required ATK for their operations without any hitches.\n\nAccording to them, \u201cWe can afford to import this fuel, let NNPC give us the licence and we will no longer complain. I have the mandate of every airline in this country to announce to you that if they can\u2019t come down from their rooftops, we have only three more days to be able to fly. \u201cWe are not threatening this country. We have been subsiding what we have been doing. The rate as at today is N630, N640 and N605. We have an aircraft going to Kano, it has about 7000 liters of fuel in it, multiple it, sir by N630. The unit cost per seat is about N70000 per seat. You have not talked about insurance that is very static. Nigerians pay heavy insurance premium because this country is stigmatised.\n\n\u201cYou have to insure abroad. It is a must because all the insurance companies in Nigeria put together cannot even pay for one aircraft. So, you have to go abroad to insure. \u201cYet the fuel cost which is supposed to be about 30 to 40 per cent in every clime, in Nigeria it about 70 per cent even before time. So, you can now see the mortality rate of airlines in this country.\n\n\u201cFrom what is happening, if it continues this way, the least ticket will be about N120 for economy and we don\u2019t want to do that. We want to inform the house that we are demanding that we should be given licence to import this fuel. If we can buy jets that cost hundreds of billions of dollars, we can afford to import this fuel.\u201d\n\nResponding to the resolutions read by the NNPC GMD, Onyeama said the implication of the N500 per litre benchmark for three days was that the ticket for airfare would be N85,000 per seat on economy.\n\nThey however expressed gratitude to the House of Representatives and the NNPC for standing by the operators.\n\nThe Chairman of the Committee and Deputy Speaker, Wase faulted the presentation made by the Chief Executive, Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority, Ahmed Farouk, who was represented by an Executive Director, Ogbogu Ukoha who insisted that prices had been discounted.\n\nWase had asked the regulatory body the current price of the product and why it was so exorbitant but was referred to the marketers who however sidestepped the questions and could not give specific answers.\n\nHe thereafter warned NMDPRA against blackmailing the government.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Tinubu at loggerheads with Osinbajo, Fayemi over choice of Omisore as national secretary\n\n\u2022Omo-Agege wants national publicity secretary in Delta State\n\n\u2022We are not aware of ruling party\u2019s leadership change, INEC insists\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren and Chuks Okocha in Abuja\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crisis in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) over the zoning of national offices, ahead of the party\u2019s national convention scheduled for March 26, has shifted to the zones. State governors are clashing with other party leaders over who gets what in the proposed arrangement.\n\nMultiple sources told THISDAY yesterday that the leadership of APC was sharply divided over the micro-zoning of the party offices.\n\nAn insider said many of the APC governors in the North-central, for instance, want the position of National Chairman thrown open, against the purported endorsement of Senator Abdullahi Adamu by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nOne of chairmanship aspirants told THISDAY, \u201cSince the party has allocated the position to the North-central, the zone should be allowed to decide who becomes its choice, rather than by imposition, as being speculated in the media.\u201d\n\nOther aspirants in the race for National Chairman in the zone include Senator Tanko Al-Makura and Saliu Mustapha.\n\nIn the South-west, where the post of National Secretary had been zoned, national leader of APC and former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, was said to be at odds with the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, as well as Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State and Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun over the choice of Senator Iyiola Omisore from Osun State for the position.\n\nAPC governors in the zone were said to have settled for Omisore for National Secretary, \u201cfor political strategy,\u201d but Tinubu and former National Chairman of the party, Chief Bisi Akande, were said to be opposed to the choice.\n\nSimilarly, in the South-south, the micro-zoning of National Publicity Secretary to Delta State, which was believed to have been influenced by Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege, THISDAY learnt, was generating conflict among party leaders in the zone.\n\nThe Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of APC officially approved the recommendations of its committee on zoning arrangement recently. In the zoning agreement, the posts of National Chairman and Deputies of National Secretary, National Legal Adviser, National Publicity Secretary, and others were allocated to the North-central.\n\nThe positions of National Publicity Secretary, National Women Leader, Deputy National Treasurer, and Deputy National Welfare Secretary were zoned to South-south.\n\nThe positions of National Secretary, National Youth Leader, and Deputy National Auditor were expected to be shared by members in South-west states, comprising Ekiti, Lagos, Ogun, Ondo, Osun, and Oyo.\n\nThe South-east got the positions of Deputy National Chairman (South), National Treasurer, National Welfare Secretary, and Deputy National Organising Secretary, among others.\n\nNorth-east was to produce Deputy National Chairman (North), National Auditor, National Vice Chairman (North-east), Deputy National Financial Secretary, and Deputy National Women Leader.\n\nThe North-west zone would produce the National Vice Chairman (North-west), National Legal Adviser, National Organising Secretary, National Financial Secretary, and Deputy National Youth Leader.\n\nMeanwhile, there appeared to be no deal yet between the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the ruling party over the latter\u2019s planned March 17 emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting. The electoral umpire insisted it was not aware of any leadership change in APC.\n\nINEC insisted it would not monitor the NEC meeting because the letter inviting it to observe the exercise, as required by law, was not signed by persons vested with such power by the CECPC headed by Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, and Senator John Akpanudoedehe, as Chairman and Secretary, respectively. The commission\u2019s position on the planned NEC meeting was made clear yesterday by INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Mr. Festus Okoye, while speaking on a national television.\n\nOkoye said INEC would follow the Electoral Act in dealing with the political parties. He stressed that the commission was only advising APC to follow the rules of the game.\n\nThe INEC commissioner stated, \u201cINEC is only telling the APC that it recognises only letters signed by the CECPC Chairman and Secretary of APC and not letters signed by other party chieftains who are not recognised by the commission.\n\n\u201cAside this, the Electoral Act states that INEC must be given a 21 days\u2019 notice of any planned meeting of political parties for it to get ready to monitor such meetings of political parties.\u201d\n\nHowever, Okoye explained that APC could go ahead and hold the NEC meeting, pointing out, though, that if the meeting would lead to a change of leadership, the commission would not accept or recognise such outcome.\n\nHe explained, \u201cThe APC has been reminded of the provision in Section 82(1) of the Electoral Act 2022, which requires \u2018at least 21 days\u2019 Notice of any Convention, Congress, Conference, or Meeting convened for the purpose of \u2018merger\u2019 and electing members of its Executive Committees, other governing bodies or nominating candidates for any elective offices.\u2019\n\n\u201cAlso, Section 77 of the Electoral Act 2022 says political parties must provide the authentic Register of Members during Convention, Congress, Conference, or Meetings which INEC will monitor. These are the crux of the matter.\u201d\n\nINEC had on Friday stated, in response to a letter by APC inviting the commission to an emergency NEC meeting of the party convened by Niger State Governor Abubakar Bello, on behalf of the CECPC, that it did not recognise Bello as the APC chairman.\n\nThe commission\u2019s position attracted criticism from some APC chieftains, who openly dared INEC to stand in the way of the NEC meeting on Thursday and the proposed national convention on March 26.\n\nSpokesman of CECPC, Ismaila Ahmed, who is also APC Youth Leader, was very critical of INEC\u2019s stand on being served a \u201cthe 21 days\u2019 notice of any meeting by political parties\u201d, as recommended by the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nTHISDAY reported yesterday that leaders of the ruling party might have agreed to keep Buni as Interim Chairman of CECPC, while Bello functioned as de facto chairman, though in acting capacity. Buni had travelled for medical reasons and transmitted power to Bello in writing to act as CECPC chairman. It was gathered that the party maintained that the letter of transition remained in force, even though Buni remained interim caretaker chairman.\n\nIt was also reported that the fate of the CECPC secretary was uncertain in all the permutations and intrigues playing out. A faction of the APC governors was alleged to have complained bitterly to the president that Buni was not inclined to holding the convention as rescheduled, because there were no preparations on the ground to indicate he was keen on holding the meeting. Apparently miffed by what he was told, the president was said to have directed that Buni be removed and replaced. Buni is currently in Dubai for medical reasons and was not around to defend himself.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), now NNPC Limited, failed to account for about 107,239,436 barrels of crude oil lifted for domestic consumption in 2019, records from the office of the Auditor-General for the Federation (AuGF) have shown.\n\nThis was contained in the \"Federal Government of Nigeria consolidated financial statements\" for the year ended December 31, 2019, submitted to the clerk to the National Assembly via a letter dated August 18, 2021, and signed by the Auditor General, Adolphus Aghughu.\n\nNNPC\n\nIn a similar vein, performance report of two depots shows that about 22,929.84 litres of PMS valued at N7.06 billion pumped to the two depots (Ibadan-Ilorin and Aba-Enugu) between June and July 2019 were not received by the depots.\n\nAccording to the report, there were discrepancies between the amounts reported by the NNPC as transfer to the federations account and what was reported by the AuGF.\n\nWhile the NNPC records showed that N1,272,606,864,000.00 was transferred by the corporation, the amount recorded by the Accountant General for the federation was N608,710,292,773.44, showing a discrepancy of N663,896,567,227.58.\n\nThe AuGF said the Group Managing Director of the NNPC should be asked to explain the discrepancy between the two figures and remit the balance of N663,896,567,227.58 to the federation account or face sanctions.\n\nAlso, the sum of N519,922,433,918.46 was transferred to the federation account by the NNPC based on transfer mandates, while demanding that the company provide \u201creconciliation statement for the difference of N88, 787, 862, 853.96 between SGF\u2019s figure of N608, 710, 296, 772.42 and NNPC\u2019s figure per transfer mandate of N519, 922, 433, 918.46.\u201d\n\nIt said: \u201cAudit observed that 107,239,436.00 barrels of crude oil were lifted as domestic crude, while the allocation of crude oil to refineries for a billing date on January 9, to May 29, 2019, was 2,764,267.00 barrels valued at N55,891,009,960.63.\u201d\n\nIt further noted that \u201cInformation on the sale of un-utilised crude oil by refineries for 2019 was not provided, and information on crude oil allocations from May 30, to December 31, 2019, was not provided for scrutiny.\u201d\n\nThe report alleged possible diversion of domestic crude, diversion of sale of un-utilised crude as well as possible loss of federation account revenue, stating that the management of the NNPC failed to respond to the audit query.\n\nThe AuGF said the Group Managing Director of NNPC should justify non-adherence to the transfer of all federation revenue to the federation account as provided by the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and ensure that all revenue is paid into the federation account going forward.\n\nThe report also said that \u201cthe audit examination on \u2018schedule of inflow of revenue\u2019 by NNPC to federation account obtained from the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation revealed that the domestic gas receipts of N4.572 billion was transferred to Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) Petroleum Profit Tax (PPT)-gas in the month of January 2019, and was not made in the subsequent months of the year.\n\n\u201cThis transfer reduced the amount due to Federation Account for the month of January 2019 to the tune of N4.572 billion\u201d leading to possible \u201creduction of distributable revenue in the Federation account, misapplication of fund and diversion of revenue.\u201d\n\nIt said that about 22,929.84 litres of PMS valued at N7,056,137,180.00 pumped to two depots in the country in 2019 were not received by the depots while no reason was advanced by the agency for the non-receipt of the product, demanding that the value of the products be remitted to the federation account.\n\nIt further said that a total of 239,800 barrels of crude oil valued at N5.498 billion was received in Warri and Kaduna refineries respectively between January and December 2019 with the source of the crude not validated due to the absence of source documents, while money was allegedly classified as crude oil losses without duly completed form 146 to be processed for further investigation.",

          "text": "Femi Falana, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), says votes cast in any election in the country belong to the political parties, not candidates.\n\nOn March 8, Inyang Ekwo, the presiding judge at a federal high court in Abuja, sacked David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi, and Eric Igwe, his deputy, over their defection from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe judge held that the votes polled by Umahi in the March 2019 governorship election belonged to the PDP and cannot be transferred to the APC.\n\nConsequently, Ekwo ordered the PDP to present another candidate or, in the alternative, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) should conduct a fresh poll within 90 days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe issue has generated concerns on a possible constitutional crisis in Ebonyi since a court has also sacked the speaker of the state house of assembly and 15 other lawmakers for defecting from the PDP.\n\nSpeaking on the development in a legal opinion article released on Tuesday, Falana said critics of Ekwo\u2019s verdict failed to state that the majority of votes in the Ebonyi 2019 governorship poll were in favour of PDP that presented Umahi as flagbearer.\n\n\u201cThose who have placed uncritical reliance on Atiku\u2019s case have failed to appreciate that the validity of the votes scored by the PDP in the presidential election did not arise for determination,\u201d the article reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo that extent, the case cannot be a justification for the subversion of the democratic rights of voters by political defectors.\n\n\u201cWhereas in the 2019 governorship election in Ebonyi State, the PDP garnered 393,343 votes across the 13 local governments areas of the state, its closest challenger, the APC, got 81,703 votes.\n\n\u201cAfter the PDP had emerged the winner of the election, the certificate of return was issued in the name of its flagbearer by the INEC Chairman, Professor Yakubu Mahmood, who stated that \u2018I hereby certify that Nweze David Umahi of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has been elected to the office of Governor of Ebonyi State\u2026\u2019\n\n\u201cEven though Governor Umahi has decamped from the PDP to APC, neither the INEC nor the high court of Ebonyi state has amended the certificate of return to read \u2018Nweze David Umahi of the All Progressives Congress.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is interesting to note that some lawyers have maintained that Governor Umahi has exercised his freedom of association by decamping from PDP to APC.\n\n\u201cWhile the governor\u2019s freedom of association is constitutionally protected, he cannot be permitted to infringe on the democratic rights of the 393,343 citizens who voted for him as the governorship candidate of the PDP.\n\n\u201cOr are we to believe that the votes scored by the PDP have been merged with those of the APC since the PDP candidate decamped to APC?\n\n\u201cCuriously, in making a mockery of the democratic rights of the people of Ebonyi State, the critics of the judgment of Justice Egwu have failed to advert their minds to the undeniable fact that the majority of the voters actually exercised their franchise in favour of the PDP. After all, the names of the candidate David Umahi and his deputy were not on the ballot papers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFalana also cited a reference to the case of Zamfara in which the votes of the All Progressives Congress (APC) were nullified in 2019 by the supreme court over issues arising from the party\u2019s failure to conduct a valid primary.\n\n\u201cIn the leading judgment of the Supreme Court in All Progressives Congress v. Marafa, LOR (24/05/2019) SC, Justice Paul Adamu Galinji declared that all the votes cast for the APC were \u2018wasted votes\u2019 on the grounds that the party failed to conduct a proper primary,\u201d Falana said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe court added that all political parties with the second highest votes in the elections and the required spread, are elected to the various elections.\n\n\u201cIn the instant case, the votes credited to the PDP in the 2019 governorship election in Ebonyi State cannot be said to have been wasted based on the decision of Governor Umahi to decamp to the ruling party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSince the said votes are not wasted, it is inconceivable that they have been legally transferred from the PDP to the APC. Under no law in Nigeria can the exercise of the right of Governor Umahi to defect from the PDP to APC extinguish the 4-year mandate freely given to him on the platform of the PDP during the 2019 general election.\n\n\u201cWe wish to submit, without any fear of contradiction, that elections are won by political parties and not by candidates.\n\n\u201cIn Amaechi v. INEC & Ors (2008) LCN/3642 (SC), the Supreme Court held that \u2018The above provision (i.e. section 221) effectually removes the possibility of independent candidacy in our elections; and places emphasis and responsibility in elections on political parties. Without a political party a candidate cannot contest\u2019.\u201d",

          "title": "This online art marketplace is African artists\u2019 road to Hollywood and beyond",
          "text": "After months of struggling to sell his artworks, Okedoyin Oluwatosin, a Nigerian artist who displays his pieces at Jakande, a popular market in Lagos, wanted to quit making art. But then, ArtDey, an African online art marketplace, offered to help him sell them, for prices ranging from \u20a650,000 to \u20a6150,000. Okedoyin evolved his art while working with ArtDey, and today, some of his pieces are on display on the international online marketplace, Artsy, selling for as high as $3,000.\n\nArtDey\u2014co-founded in 2020 by Chioma Onyenwe, a 33-year-old filmmaker, and her siblings: Emeka Onyenwe and Adaobi Onyenwe\u2014is an online marketplace that connects contemporary African artists to a global audience. Onyenwe studied economics at the University of Lagos, before going on to the Imperial College in London for a master\u2019s in management. Before going into film full-time in 2013, she had worked in investment banking and consulting for firms such as Chapel Hills and Accenture, for a few years\n\nIn 2013, she got her first job in the film industry as a programme coordinator at the Africa International Film Festival (AFRIFF); she left the organisation last year after some time as its artistic director. In 2014, she benefited from Project Act Nollywood, a programme created by Nigeria\u2019s federal government to fund filmmakers for production and distribution and capacity building. With help from the programme, she produced her first short film 8 Bars and a Clef through her production company, Raconteur Productions, back in 2015. Since then, she has worked across different mediums\u2014theatre, podcasting, and documentary filmmaking.\n\nOnyenwe, who has been collecting African art since 2015, went to collect art in an art market in Kenya in March 2020 but found she could afford only 1 of the 2 paintings she liked. She decided she would return to the art market later for the second painting, but, during that weekend, Kenya recorded its first COVID cases and was set to close its airports. Onyenwe had to take the first flight on Monday back to Lagos. She never went back to the art market, and never got the piece, mostly because there wasn\u2019t a way to move the artworks across countries.\n\nFast forward to June, Onyenwe visited the art markets in places such as Jakande and Muri Okunola in Lagos, but they were empty, and the shops that opened did so on specific days. These markets were tourist attractions, but air travel restrictions, because of COVID, had shrunk their sale of art pieces.\n\nOnyenwe created ArtDey\u2019s website in June 2020 to supply art to collectors outside Nigeria. At the end of June that same year, the website went up. Apart from trying to help relieve the struggles of these artists, Onyenwe revealed that, at the time, she, too, was struggling as the pandemic had destroyed her plans for the year, and she needed to get something to work.\n\nArtDey set out to provide a platform for local and emerging African artists who are not digitally savvy enough to use the internet to connect to a global audience themselves.\n\nArtDey wants to supply art to people who want to buy art simply because they like the work\u2019s colours, or it fits their house curtains; they don\u2019t need to read deep meaning into these pieces. \u201cEverybody can own a piece of African original art.\u201d\n\nArtDey organises physical pop-ups\u2014and has done 8 of them\u2014to introduce art to people who wouldn\u2019t normally go into galleries, by going to public spaces, such as bars, and selling art pieces for prices ranging from \u20a630,000 to \u20a6200,000. This pricing, Onyenwe noted, was to help buyers make a decision on the go. The pop-ups have taken place in Abuja, Lagos, and Copenhagen.\n\nOnyenwe noted that the pop-ups and exhibitions were prompted by Nigerians\u2019 consumer behaviour which makes it difficult to sell art pieces that were sometimes above the country\u2019s minimum wage without a physical presence. Nigerians, she noticed, are not used to standard-sized measurements which are important to selecting art pieces\u2019 sizes. \u201cIf I tell a customer an art piece is 42 inches by 42 inches, for example, they wouldn\u2019t know what that looks like. They tend to ask to see if it can fit the space in their house.\u201d This is because their buyers are not your traditional collectors who probably have bigger houses and have experience in interacting with African art. So, the people we sell to tend to buy for functionality.\u201d\n\nInitially, ArtDey found it difficult to convince local artists that they weren\u2019t a swindler trying to rip them off by taking pictures of their art and replicating it. But the artists got convinced as soon as their pieces sold. ArtDey only picks up the art it displays from the artist online when it sells it. This gives the artists the opportunity to sell on their own. Today, these artists are leaving their pieces with ArtDey and even creating collections for ArtDey.\n\nOnyenwe noted that they have higher margins from the sales that come from the website compared to the pop-ups, even though they have sold more pieces from the pop-ups, exhibitions, and open houses.\n\nArtDey in Bel-Air\n\nFela by Chukwuemeka Image hanging in the background of a scene in the ongoing series, Bel-Air.\n\nIn the last quarter of 2020, ArtDey tried to target Nigerians and Africans in the diaspora, whom it suspected most likely felt an affinity to African art. It started cold emailing set designers and cinematographers, but despite interest, no production house took up their offer; lockdowns had not been completely lifted, so production had not properly opened up.\n\nNormally, filmmakers acquire a licence from artists to use a replica of their works on set, but Onyenwe wanted to get the original works to these filmmakers at a lower cost.\n\nMorgan Cooper, Bel-Air\u2019s director, expressed interest in ArtDey\u2019s artworks. So, Bel-Air, a re-imagination of the award-winning 1990s sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, bought over 10 art pieces belonging to artists on the streets of Lagos: such as Bright Osodalor, Abiola Daniel, and Bertha Onyekachi, from ArtDey.\n\nWhen ArtDey launched, it had 3 artists on board and sold 5 pieces in its first week. Today, it has been in operation for 20 months and has sold about 300 pieces.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "The untold story of how ThriveAgric survived a turbulent 2020",
          "text": "In September 2020, a few days after Muhammed Akinyemi didn\u2019t receive payment for a 6-month poultry cycle investment made in ThriveAgric, he informed his lawyer about this but didn\u2019t take legal action.\n\nHe was expecting the sum of \u20a6581,000 ($1,200) for the \u20a6510,000 he\u2019d invested in March. Akinyemi had also invested \u20a6200,000 in April, which was due (\u20a6224,000) in October.\n\n\u201cAt first, I just felt it\u2019s money, and it\u2019s with them. Whatever the problems are, within a week or two, they should resolve it,\u201d Akinyemi said. \u201cBut I found out that they hadn\u2019t addressed the issue to all their subscribers; rather they were explaining to individuals. And there was no specificity as to when it would be resolved.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, a few weeks later, Akinyemi\u2019s car broke down and he urgently needed money to fix it. ThriveAgric hadn\u2019t yet paid him and he was running out of patience. He was one out of hundreds of ThriveAgric\u2019s retail investors who hadn\u2019t received the payments.\n\nHis lawyer sent a warning notification to ThriveAgric, threatening to sue if the issue wasn\u2019t resolved. Akinyemi also put out a tweet calling out the company to fix the problem. He tried to rally around other retail investors who hadn\u2019t been paid, but a number of them didn\u2019t want any media attention.\n\n\u201cWe fought it from the legal and social aspect,\u201d said Akinyemi.\n\nOver 500km away, in Southwestern Nigeria Osun State, Esther*, a poultry farmer who partnered with ThriveAgric, had lost over 1,000 birds because there was little to no movement.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult period losing my birds in the middle of the pandemic,\u201d Esther said. She was one out of many farmers within ThriveAgric\u2019s network who suffered massive losses.\n\nWhile the losses incurred varied among the farmers, depending on the capacity of their pens, ThriveAgric shared that there were over 400,000 mature birds that had no buyers. Despite efforts made by ThriveAgric to rent more cold rooms for storage of processed chickens, the lack of buyers and difficulty in moving the birds during the pandemic meant that over 90% of the birds were lost. The losses started happening as early as April 2020, until the end of the year.\n\nWith hundreds of unpaid, angry retail investors dragging ThriveAgric online, asking for their money, and farmers recording millions of naira in losses, this was ThriveAgric\u2019s darkest hour.\n\nFounded by Uka Eje (CEO) and Ayodeji Arikawe (CTO) in 2017, ThriveAgric started as an agricultural technology startup that provided access to finance, premium markets, and data-driven advisory for smallholder farmers. It financed agriculture projects through crowdfunding. In the space of 3 years, ThriveAgric had grown to become a notable African Agritech startup, with backing from Y Combinator\u2014one of the world\u2019s most successful startup accelerators\u2014in 2019.\n\nHow did it get into this mess?\n\n\u201cIt was a mix of different events. The pandemic meant that offtakers couldn\u2019t pay for the goods we\u2019ve already supplied,\u201d Eje said. \u201cFarmers were also suffering losses in the farm, and we lost over 100 million naira worth of produce in transit because they were held up on the road. No movement during the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe dilemma for ThriveAgric was that its owing offtakers\u2014FMCGs and restaurant chains\u2014made repeated failed promises on when they\u2019d repay.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d promise to pay next week and, banking on their words because they hadn\u2019t defaulted before, we\u2019d in turn promise our retail investors that they\u2019ll be paid next week, only for the offtakers to go quiet,\u201d Eje said.\n\nThe offtakers too were anticipating that the pandemic would wind down and business activities would return, but it took longer than expected. This affected ThriveAgric\u2019s communication with its retail investors as it repeatedly failed to fulfil the promises it made to its retail investors. The fact that its large network of farmers were also experiencing losses also exacerbated the situation as ThriveAgric had invested in them by providing seeds and chicks, expecting to receive returns when they were sold. Many of those farmers haven\u2019t recovered from those losses till today.\n\nA popular question that came up during this period was whether ThriveAgric\u2019s claims to be covered by insurance were true. The company explained that the insurance covered the farming activities and not the retail investors\u2019 investment\u2014the logic being, if the farming process went well, the returns on the investment by the retail investors were guaranteed. Also, in this situation, the fact that farmers were unable to sell and the offtakers were owing weren\u2019t valid bases for requesting for insurance claims.\n\nAmerican serial entrepreneur Elon Musk once described the experience of running a startup as being similar to the act of chewing glass and staring into the abyss. \u201cAfter a while, you stop staring, but the glass chewing never ends,\u201d Musk said. ThriveAgric\u2019s experience validates this description.\n\nAll through this turbulent phase, the company maintains it didn\u2019t take its retail investors for granted.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we realised was that this money we were owing was important for these people; for some it was house rent or school fees,\u201d Eje said. \u201cIt was money that meant a lot to them. Regardless of how people reacted, it was their money, and they needed it back.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSalvaging the situation\n\nAs the situation escalated, different parties showed up to help out.\n\n\u201cWe stepped in as quickly as we got wind of the situation and did the best that we could at the time by guiding the team on the right approach to take, as well as by providing the practical support they needed in what was a very time-sensitive situation,\u201d said Kola Aina, General Partner, Ventures Platform, one of ThriveAgric\u2019s investors.\n\nVentures platform helped with recruiting an interim CEO, Adia Sowho, who was then VP of Growth and Managing Director, Nigeria, for credit platform Migo. It also restructured the finance and communications team.\n\nWhen ThriveAgric came knocking, the first question Sowho had to answer was \u201cDid she care enough?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big question for me was, do I care enough about ThriveAgric and what it\u2019s doing? And am I willing, because I wasn\u2019t bored,\u201c Sowho said.\n\nWith the answer to that question being yes, in October Sowho agreed to step in, with Eje stepping down to the role of chief operating officer (COO).\n\n\u201cFood security is an important part of our economy. It doesn\u2019t get enough love and support as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cIf every Nigerian were a farmer, we\u2019d be feeding ourselves and the continent, which is literally ThriveAgric\u2019s vision.\u201d\n\nSolving for Y\n\nTasked to initiate a turnaround in a new company and entirely different sector, the guiding principle Sowho turned to was first-principles thinking, a reverse engineering technique that has its origins from the teachings of Aristotle and has been made recently popular by leaders in Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cFor me, I tend to work with first principles. At the end of the day, whatever problem you\u2019re trying to solve, whether it\u2019s a startup, enterprise, or even conglomerate turnaround,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cThey all involve the two or more parties exchanging value. With ThriveAgric there was an equation and it was broken.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was this hazy chain of unfulfilled agreement that just ended up in a crisis. And, of course, when it hits the public sphere, it makes the news.\u201d\n\nTo fix the broken equation, Sowho deployed three things: structure, governance, and documentation, concepts she claims startups tend to be wary of. The different teams and processes were restructured in order for the company to solve existing problems and be \u201c10 steps ahead of any risk before it materialises\u201d.\n\n\u201cA lot of the things I did were an outcome of the experience that I have working in building organisations,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cThese things don\u2019t happen by accident. The success of any enterprise has to be by design.\u201d\n\nSowho and Eje worked on structuring the financing plan for the repayment of the retail investors and hiring for key roles. Alongside Sowho, a new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and a head of risk were hired. As the new hires got to work, stabilising the ship, co-founder and CTO Arikawe couldn\u2019t help but wonder why they joined the company at such a time.\n\n\u201cThese people joined us during the crisis. I was thinking, didn\u2019t you look up ThriveAgric online, a company that people are bashing, before joining,\u201d Arikawe said.\n\nThe typical response from the new hires was that they believed in what the company was doing and were willing to put their names on the line.\n\n\u201cOur CFO joined us and 2 days later he\u2019s on a call where investors were insulting him,\u201d Arikawe said. \u201cA similar incident happened with Sowho, who joined and 1 week later had 300 angry people on a Zoom call with her.\u201d\n\nIn a few months, the presence of additional hands, fresh ideas, and the \u201cbridge\u201d capital (temporary financing) provided by Ventures Platform helped stabilise ThriveAgric.\n\nTransparency\u2014the currency of trust\n\nDuring this period, members of the support team and other departments had to work overnight for many days.\n\n\u201cEveryone was stretched but we had a lot of empathy for the people and also a sense of responsibility to ensure that things don\u2019t go wrong again,\u201d Arikawe said.\n\nOn one of those nights, the engineering team in collaboration with the support team, decided to enhance transparency around the repayment schedule by creating a new payout dashboard\u2014Payout.thriveagric.com\u2014that reflected each retail investor\u2019s exact repayment date.\n\nThis was done to fix an issue with the initial payment dashboard which automatically indicated that the retail investors had been paid, as soon as it was due date. This feature caused retailer investors to be confused and angry, because they hadn\u2019t been paid.\n\n\u201cWhen we initially built the payout dashboard we didn\u2019t foresee a period like this where we wouldn\u2019t have been able to pay. People always got paid on or before payout day,\u201d Arikawe said.\n\nWith the new payout dashboard, the retail investors could also see how many other people have been paid. A feature which the engineering team hoped would provide extra comfort and ease tension.\n\nUtilising the bridge loan secured, over the span of 9 months ThriveAgric was able to pay back the hundreds of customers it was owing. Akinyemi was paid in November and December 2020. ThriveAgric also repaid the bridge loan in 2021.\n\nUnexpected support and lessons\n\nDuring the turbulent period, there was a lot of pushback from retail investors but also surprisingly a lot of support from investors, financiers, and friends.\n\n\u201cI remember people calling and asking, what\u2019s the challenge, what do you need?\u201d Arikawe said. \u201cFor example, one of the people we sold birds to but hadn\u2019t paid called to apologise that he\u2019s trying his best. He was owing us because someone else was owing him.\u201d\n\nAfter 6 months at the helm of ThriveAgric, Sowho left to join telecom giant MTN Nigeria as its first-ever female Chief Marketing Officer while Eje returned to the position of CEO. During his time as COO, Eje worked on ensuring that repayment and communications with different stakeholders happened seamlessly.\n\n\u201cEssentially, I ensured that the core business operations ran smoothly and built a system to ensure that the defaulting offtakers paid,\u201d Eje said. \u201cI also identified other funding opportunities outside crowdfunding.\u201d\n\nReminiscing on her experience, she said, \u201cYou often wonder whether you can hack it with a turnaround, and I did, so that\u2019s one thing I learned. Now people are calling me the queen of turnaround after one event.\u201d\n\nAnother valuable lesson for Sowho was how she was able to manage her productivity considering that she joined ThriveAgric during the pandemic and managed things virtually.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realise how focused I could be, because I\u2019m one of those people that like to do everything all the time, all at once,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cBut I think in this situation, the urgency required that I stay very focused.\u201d\n\nThere were ThriveAgric team members she didn\u2019t meet until about 2\u20133 months into the job, because she was very focused on talking to the people nearest to this issue.\n\nFor the team at ThriveAgric, the incident was a learning moment for them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning to scale with structure. Right now as we explore different opportunities, we look at the risks and how to scale sustainably,\u201d Eje said. \u201cFor us, we\u2019re still certain about what we want to do. It\u2019s still day one.\u201d\n\nKola Aina believes the incident was a reminder as an investor that \u201csupporting companies through difficult times is one of the truest forms of portfolio support.\u201d\n\nOpportunities ahead\n\nThriveAgric has since paused crowdfunding from retail investors to focus on institutional investors. Since the pivot, ThriveAgric has sealed investment partnerships with several commercial banks, the CBN, World Food Program, and USAID. Its landmark partnership came recently in the form of a one-year project in partnership with USAID-backed West Africa Trade & Investment Hub (Trade Hub).\n\nThe partnership, which aims to empower at least 50,000 farmers across Nigeria, will be supported with a $1.75 million co-investment grant from Trade Hub. The startup is also focusing on building out its farmer-centred technology solutions which currently serves over 200,000 farmers. The company\u2019s focus is to build the largest network of profitable farmers across Africa.\n\n\u201cAgritech is not just about having a website and asking people for money,\u201d Eje said. \u201cIt\u2019s about building the infrastructure that supports the food production value chain.\u201d\n\nSultan Quadri contributed to this story.\n\n*Name changed to protect source\u2019s identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nTime was when funding announcements in Africa hovered around the $1 million mark. These days, a typical week has at least one startup announcing over $100 million.\n\nSpeaking of startups, last Friday, we hosted a few people at the first edition of Pitch Friday this year, and it was amazing. Two startups were pitched, and the founders were grilled on various aspects of their business.\n\nFortunately or unfortunately \u2014 depending on how you look at it \u2014 it is held once a month, so you can\u2019t attend this week, but you can participate next month. Watch this space as we\u2019ll inform you when the time is near.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust before we get into the business of the day, could you please take a minute to share this newsletter with three people you know? We write these insightful beauties every weekday and would love more people to read the gospel of tech.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get into today\u2019s stories.\n\nWe\u2019re discussing financial services for supply chain SMEs, vehicle financing by Moove, and salary-on-demand.\n\nA neobank for Africa\u2019s supply chain SMEs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few weeks ago, I was speaking with a female startup founder when I asked what she felt could be done to increase the number of African startup founders who are women. Her response was simple: employ more women. Looking at Pivo, a startup founded by an all-female team, I would say she was right.\n\nPivo was founded by Nkiru Amadi-Emina and Ijeoma Akwiwu. The two co-founders, who have been friends for over eight years, have about a decade of experience in IT roles and law. Amadi-Emina previously founded Jalo, a logistics startup acquired by Kobo360, while Akwiwu has held legal positions in tech companies and has a Master\u2019s degree in software engineering.\n\nWhat does Pivo do? In simple terms, provide financial services for small and medium businesses operating in Africa\u2019s supply chain sector. These services include loans which it has started with its flagship offering \u2014 Pivo Capital \u2014 asset financing, inventory financing, and corporate account services.\n\nThe startup, founded in 2021, has recorded impressive growth, disbursing over $1 million in less than a year to approximately 200 customers while catching the eye of investors who have invested an undisclosed amount into the startup. The investors include Microtraction, ODX accelerator, Mercy Corps Ventures, Ventures Platform, FirstCheck Africa, and Bold Angel Fund.\n\nCurrently operating in Nigeria, the startup has plans to dominate African trade. There\u2019s more to this story, and you can read it here: How Pivo is providing fast and reliable financial services for Africa\u2019s supply chain businesses\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoove\u2019s plan for vehicle financing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoove\u2019s founders, Jide Odunsi and Ladi Delano\n\nIn Lagos, Nigeria, commuting using public transportation can be an unpleasant experience for anyone. A combination of the sturdy wooden benches in danfos, uncouth drivers, poor road conditions, and traffic congestion that often defies logic is enough to set commuters on edge. It\u2019s no wonder residents of the city can be easily provoked into starting a fight.\n\nFortunately for a select group of people, ride-hailing companies like Uber and Bolt provide an alternative, albeit more expensive. These companies onboard drivers who use their vehicles or lease vehicles from others to transport passengers.\n\nWith approximately 15 million inhabitants, there is potentially a huge market for mobility entrepreneurs, aka taxi drivers, in the city. However, with soaring car costs, only a few can afford to buy vehicles for this purpose.\n\nThis is the problem that mobility fintech startup, Moove, plans to solve. The startup, founded in 2019 by Ladi Delano and Jide Odunsi, co-CEOs and Co-founders, provides drivers with a financing option, enabling them to own their cars rather than borrow cars from vehicle owners.\n\nYesterday, Monday, March 14, 2022, the startup announced that it had raised $105 million in a Series A2 round that brings the total funding raised by the company to $174.5 million. The round had a mix of new and existing investors, including Left Lane Capital, Speedinvest, thelatest.ventures, AfricInvest, MUFG Innovation Partners, Kreos Capital, and Latitude Investment Management.\n\nThe startup plans to use the funds to drive its expansion across Asia, Europe, and the MENA region. Also, it intends to provide financing for a broader range of vehicles, including trucks, bikes, three-wheelers, and buses.\n\nIn a statement, Julius Tichelaar, Partner at AfricInvest, said, \u201cAt AfricInvest, we are focused on supporting, and growing companies that we believe will go beyond their own borders and become regional champions.\n\n\u201cLadi and Jide have proven that Moove has the potential to transform the lives of millions of people across the continent, and we\u2019re delighted to be supporting them as they expand Moove in Africa and beyond into more emerging markets. Through the AfricInvest FIVE Fund, we\u2019re incredibly proud to be joining Ladi, Jide and all the Moovers on their exciting journey of disrupting financial services.\u201d\n\nSalary-on-demand with Cadana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCadana team\n\nThere\u2019s some sort of hope and renewed vigour you can feel among many working-class Nigerians from the 20th day of any month. The reason for this is quite simple: it is less than a week before payday.\n\nIn Nigeria and most parts of Africa, salaries are paid once, in the last week of the month. But employees often need money before payday. A school of thought advises that you cut your coat according to your size, but sometimes, you don\u2019t even have enough materials to do that.\n\nThe usual solution is loans with high-interest rates for many people, but Albert Owusu-Asare and Ameer Shujjah believe their new startup, Cadana can solve this problem. In addition to other services, Canada provides salary-on-demand for employees. They do this by partnering with employers to set a cap for how much employees can access before the month runs out.\n\nAs exciting as the business sounds, it throws up some questions. What happens when an employer does not pay salaries at the right time? What happens if an employee withdraws part of their salary then bolts without performing tasks that justify the amount taken?\n\nBolu Abiodun does an excellent job of providing answers to these questions in this article: Inside Cadana\u2019s plan to provide salary-on-demand without payback or interest\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nOpportunities\n\nHave a great day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the World Bank, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) account for 90% of businesses and 50% of employment globally. In addition, SMEs create 7 out of 10 jobs in emerging economies. Consequently, ensuring that SMEs have a good environment to thrive in is crucial for job creation and economic growth.\n\nHowever, an inability to access finance for their business operations means many SMEs have to close shop. In Nigeria, for example, banks are more likely to give loans to large businesses. Over the past five years, startups like FairMoney and Brass have stepped up, providing individuals and businesses with an alternative to existing financial institutions.\n\nLast year, Nigeria\u2019s fintech space saw a new entrant \u2013 Pivo. The startup was founded by Nkiru Amadi-Emina (CEO) and Ijeoma Akwiwu (COO) as a result of an observation the two women had. Before Pivo, Amadi-Emina had founded Jalo, a logistics startup that served businesses in Northern Nigeria until its acquisition by Kobo360.\n\nThe deal, an acqui-hire, saw Amadi-Emina join Kobo360, where she held various positions, including Port Operations Lead. Akwiwu, on her part, had spent most of her career working as a lawyer and building her private practice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer jobs saw her working with various tech companies, and she was soon curious about other services a lawyer could offer startups. Seeing this interest, a friend offered her the opportunity to work on a project to curb corruption in Nigeria\u2019s judicial sector. While the project never saw the light of day, it gave her more insight into opportunities in the tech space and led her to get a master\u2019s in software engineering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNkiru Amadi-Emina (CEO) and Ijeoma Akwiwu (COO) of Pivo Africa. Source: Supplied\n\nThe duo also ran businesses together, and their experience showed them that many small businesses in the supply chain industry struggled with financing. Trying to solve that problem led them to start Pivo.\n\n\u201cHaving worked at Kobo360 and then also built a source procurement product together, we found that a lot of the small players in both scenarios have issues with financing or completing transactions that they get.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a case of they don\u2019t have any business or orders; nobody is giving them cargo to load or orders to fulfil. They had it but didn\u2019t have the financial capital to fulfil it. Having noticed that problem, we decided to build Pivo to provide them with adequate financial support,\u201d Amadi-Emina told Techpoint Africa.\n\nFinancial services for supply chain SMEs\n\nPivo is a financial services provider targeted at SMEs in Africa\u2019s supply chain sector. The decision to focus on businesses in the supply chain sector comes from the founders\u2019 expertise working in the industry and an understanding that there\u2019s a supply chain segment to most sectors of the African economy.\n\n\u201cWe have experience in the supply chain industry. We also understand that a supply chain is a function that cuts across multiple sectors, whether you\u2019re in manufacturing, agriculture, or oil and gas. More importantly, in any supply chain, the actors remain the same,\u201d Amadi-Emina said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of Pivo\u2019s website\n\nWhile other startups provide businesses with working capital, what sets Pivo apart is its focus on a set of businesses. The startup has rolled out its first offering \u2013 Pivo Capital \u2013 a loan service for supply chain businesses, but it is not stopping at that. It plans to offer every financial service that a supply chain business needs, including inventory financing, corporate account services, asset financing, etc.\n\nSince its private beta launched in October 2021, the startup has gotten over 250 clients (200 of which are active), received loan requests of over $2 million, and disbursed over $1 million to date.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInitially bootstrapped by the co-founders, the startup has raised an undisclosed pre-seed round from investors including Mercy Corps Ventures, Microtraction, Ventures Platform, FirstCheck Africa, and Bold Angel Fund. Pivo has also gotten into the ODX accelerator programme, where it will receive $125,000 for 7% equity.\n\nThe startup has three core products \u2013 Pivo Capital, Pivo Finance, and Pivo Plus. For Pivo Capital, the startup charges an interest rate and management fee on all loans disbursed. The interest rates are not fixed and vary depending on the loan amount and the company involved. However, Akwiwu disclosed that the minimum interest rate is 3%.\n\nFor Pivo Finance, the startup\u2019s corporate banking service, the startup plans to provide businesses with account numbers, wallets, and the ability to conduct transactions using their Pivo accounts. Although not all the offerings are currently available, the startup plans to charge transaction fees on any transaction done using Pivo.\n\nGrowth and challenges\n\nCurrently operating in Lagos, the startup has its eyes on Nigeria\u2019s other commercial cities, including Port Harcourt, Abuja, and Kano, before expanding to other African countries, starting with Ghana in Q4 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Pivo staff educating a customer on Pivo\u2019s services\n\nLike any business, the startup has faced its fair share of challenges, including keeping up with the growth of its loan portfolio and hiring the right talent. On keeping up with its loan portfolio, Akwiwu said the company has had to work closely with its financial partners.\n\n\u201cI think the major problem we\u2019ve had is primarily around keeping up with the growth that we are seeing. An example is that your loan portfolio is growing, but do you have enough capital to support that growth? One of the ways we\u2019re mitigating it is quickly activating credit lines with financial partners at the same pace of our portfolio growth.\u201d\n\nOn the talent front, Akwiwu revealed that the startup still has most of its founding team, while Amadi-Emina shared that they have been intentional about their hires.\n\n\u201cOne thing we try to do is to be deliberate and intentional about hiring because what you find is, if you make the right hire, they\u2019re able to compensate for other gaps in your structure,\u201d Akwiwu added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s headline inflation rate witnessed a significant uptick as it increased by 15.70 percent in the month of February.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), in its Consumer Price Index report released on Tuesday, attributed the marginal increase to a surge in energy prices which emanated as a result of the scarcity of petrol and the ongoing crisis between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nHeadline inflation increased by about 0.1 percent higher than the 15.60 percent witnessed in January inflation report.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, headline index increased to 1.63 percent in February 2022, this is 0.16 percent rate higher than the rate recorded in January 2022 which stood at 1.47 percent.\n\nFood inflation increased to 19.69% in February as against 20.09% the previous month.\n\nThe rise in food index was caused by increases in prices of bread and cereals, food products n.e.c., potatoes, yam and other tubers, oils and fats and fruit.\n\nCore inflation, which excludes the prices of volatile agricultural produce stood at 14.01 percent month-on-month, up 0.53 percent compared to 13.33 percent in January 2021.\n\nRead also: Nigeria facing unprecedented budget deficit, surging inflation says EIU\n\nThe highest increases under the core sub section were recorded in prices of gas, liquefied fuel, tobacco, spirit, narcotics, solid fuel, cleaning repair and hire of clothing, garments, shoes and other foot wear.\n\nOther services in respect of personal transport equipment, clothing materials, other articles of clothing and clothing accessories and other services also contributed to the rise witnessed in core inflation.\n\nUrban inflation rate increased to 16.25 percent year-on-year in February 2022 from 17.92 percent recorded in February 2021; while Rural inflation rate increased to 15.18 percent in February 2022 compared to the 16.77 percent in February 2021.",

          "text": "Nigerian households and businesses have been hard hit by a double whammy of a lingering fuel crisis and worsening power outage, with economic activities being crippled across vital sectors.\n\nIn Abuja, private and public offices, including the Federal Secretariat, which houses most of the Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs), had resorted to spending huge funds on alternative power sources, especially generators, amid high petrol and diesel prices.\n\nBusinessDay reliably gathered on Monday that the nation\u2019s seat of power \u2013 Aso Rock Presidential Villa \u2013 was not spared from blackout as it ran on power generators for most of the day.\n\nThis comes at a time President Muhammadu Buhari is vacating in London for a medical check-up.\n\nA Presidency source told BusinessDay that the State House Conference Centre had been running on diesel-powered generators in recent times.\n\n\u201cPeople are complaining about power supply. The Presidential Villa is not different; the place runs on generators daily,\u201d the source said.\n\nAccording to the source, the power system is run by Julius Berger staff, which also supplies diesel fuel for the generator.\n\nWhen contacted, Garba Shehu, senior special assistant to the President on media and publicity, referred one of our reporters to the recent media briefing addressed by Abubakar Aliyu, minister of power.\n\n\u201cThe minister just briefed you last week. I have nothing new to tell you for now; no, nothing,\u201d he said.\n\nBusinessDay observed that several ministries at the Federal Secretariat, Abuja were in partial or total blackout.\n\nCivil servants, who were seen idle in their offices, said they could not execute their tasks due to the power outage, and that activities had generally slowed down.\n\nBusinessDay gathered that the blackout at these ministries could last for up to 20 hours a day.\n\nAt the office of the head of civil service, it was gathered that there was a severe power outage throughout last week. A staff member, who, at about 1pm, had already closed for the day and was on her way home, said she had not been able to do anything since resuming work Monday morning. \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything. We can\u2019t make payments, make orders or any transaction,\u201d she lamented.\n\nAnother staff member said, \u201cThe light situation is a complete mess. No light at home, no light at work. Last week, there was no light from Monday to Friday at the service; currently there is no light. Whenever they decide to bring the light, it\u2019s usually very late, when workers have already closed.\u201d\n\nRead also: Power cuts exposes Nigeria\u2019s diesel-dependent economy\n\nAt the Ministry of Health, including the office of the minister, there was a complete blackout. A staff member at one of the departments said the light situation had been unreliable. \u201cThe situation even crippled a meeting at the minister\u2019s conference room and nothing happened,\u201d he said.\n\nAn official at the SERVICOM department in the ministry said, \u201cThis light situation is worse now. They brought the light very briefly this morning, and we won\u2019t see this light till tomorrow. It\u2019s affecting our work seriously. The offices are not conducive to work due to the heat and that\u2019s why you see us standing here. I work with the Servicom office; just look at the entire building, there is no light.\u201d\n\nThe situation is no different at the Ministry of Education. \u201cWork has stopped because the light situation has been very very bad, and the generator can only power the first to third floor. From the fourth floor upward has no light,\u201d a staff member told BusinessDay.\n\nAt phase one of the Federal Secretariat, workers lamented the same issue. An administrative officer at the Office of the Secretary of the Government of the Federation, who identified himself as Mr Friday, said, \u201cThe situation has persisted for close to two months and is causing a lot of problems and confusion. The worst part is that they take it during work hours and bring it mostly at night when it\u2019s basically useless.\u201d\n\nBusinessDay also learnt that the National Assembly had been running mostly on a generator in recent weeks due to poor power supply.\n\nRecently, a panel of the House of Representatives investigating \u201calleged cases of indiscriminate and unlawful administrative charges on contracts and percentage charges on projects implementation by MDAs\u201d had its activities stalled by blackout.\n\nThe power outage, which lasted for more than 45 minutes, led to an abrupt halt of the proceedings at the Committee Room 414 of the House wing, forcing the lawmakers to vacate the venue angrily.\n\nBut as the situation persists, authorities continue to trade blame on who and what is responsible for the worsening power outage across the country which has seen businesses crumbling and Nigerians suffer terrible heat waves.\n\nOn March 3, 2022, Aliyu, power minister, blamed the situation on low hydro capacity during dry season and maintenance work at gas plants.\n\n\u201cI would like to discuss the increased load shedding you may have observed in Abuja and other areas in the country. With the reduction in hydro capacity during the dry season, additional load needs to be taken up by our gas plants,\u201d he had said.\n\nLast week, Aliyu blamed the situation on a myriad of issues, including poor gas delivery, poor access to forex insufficient/weak transmission infrastructure to adequately evacuate/wheel power, and issues of Right of Way, among others.\n\nHe also accused the MDAs of non-payment of electricity bills as contributing to the huge debt profile of the power distribution companies (DisCos).\n\nTransmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), in its reaction, said the nation-wide load shedding was as a result of very low power generation by the generation companies (GenCos) for it to wheel through the transmission grid to the DisCos nationwide.\n\nBut in a reaction to TCN\u2019s claims, the Gencos said the N1.644 trillion owed them by the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET) was crippling their operations.\n\nJoy Ogaji, executive secretary of Association of Power Generation Companies, who addressed a press conference, said the amount was as a result of accumulated unused capacity, which spread through 2015 to 2022.\n\nAt the time of filing this report, the power minister was convening an emergency meeting with all power sector stakeholders to find solutions to the problem.\n\nWhile the blame game continues, experts warn of the negative economic consequences of this development for inflation and output growth, especially coupled with the impact of shortage of supply of petroleum products.\n\nThey noted that businesses \u2013 mostly the small ones \u2013 had continued to suffer escalating costs, and some of them would hardly survive the next week if the situation persisted.\n\nLast week, BusinessDay witnessed how Jane and her husband, Thomas, who jointly run a hair and nail salon around the very popular Wuse market, ran a generator to service their customers all through last week Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe light situation has been horrible for the most of three weeks now,\u201d Jane said.\n\nAlso, Elizabeth Chirkpi, a resident of APO Area of Abuja and CEO of Cacia Concept, lamented that it had been unbearable for her to run her home and business as a result of the power outage.\n\nChirkpi told BusinessDay that she had to buy fuel from black marketers to power her home and shop to avoid wastage of foodstuff and to keep her business moving, saying her expenses had tripled.\n\n\u201cI must say that it has not been funny. At home, one can hardly sleep and you know what that means to someone that is working.\u201d\n\nJohn Umar, an Abuja-based financial analyst, said, \u201cThe concern really is of a possible higher inflationary pressures in the next couple of months as households and businesses dependency on petrol and diesel have increased significantly in the last month.\n\n\u201cThis significant rise in fuel costs, in addition to the lingering fuel scarcity, will cause a significant rise in utility costs. Given that the utility sub-basket constitutes 32.6 percent of the core inflation, core inflation may likely continue to rise in the short term.\u201d\n\nHe said the increase in commodity prices as a result of the current poor power situation and high fuel costs would have a negative pass-through effect on food prices from higher transport costs.\n\nFood inflation has been one major driver of headline inflation in the last five years. The last couple of months witnessed a decline in food Inflation and by extension headline inflation.\n\nUmar said, \u201cHowever, should this current mix of power epilepsy and high petrol cost persist, we could see food inflation rising as high as 19-20 percent, with headline inflation settling at 17-18 percent in the medium term as a result.\n\n\u201cBusinesses would be hit the hardest as initial budgets might have to be restructured as the current price increase of commodities would leave them at the mercy of either shutting down or transferring the cost to the general economy via their customer base.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with BusinessDay, Odutayo Oluseyi, assistant director of press for the power ministry, said efforts were ongoing to resolve the electricity issues across the country.\n\n\u201cJust as the government has said before, we are having issues with power generation, but it will soon be over because necessary actions are being taken by all relevant agencies,\u201d he added.",
          "summary": "Nigerian households and businesses have been hard hit by a double whammy of a lingering fuel crisis and worsening power outage, with economic activities being crippled across vital sectors.\nCivil servants, who were seen idle in their offices, said they could not execute their tasks due to the power outage, and that activities had generally slowed down.\nAt the office of the head of civil service, it was gathered that there was a severe power outage throughout last week.\nAn official at the SERVICOM department in the ministry said, \u201cThis light situation is worse now.\nAt the time of filing this report, the power minister was convening an emergency meeting with all power sector stakeholders to find solutions to the problem.",

It\u2019s that risk we try to mitigate by encouraging them not to migrate through the Sahara Desert.\n\n\u201cWe accepted the problem facing us and set up a taskforce to deal with the problem. We took up the responsibility of resettling returnees, tackling the root cause of the problem, dealing with perpetrators and understanding migration in the context of development.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that what is happening in the country today and the very difficult economic situation that is emerging will put pressure on young people to want to travel again. I don\u2019t believe that our response should be the same as we did in Migration 1.0 as we may not be able to prevent irregular migration,\u201d Obaseki added.\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cOur strategy for Migration 2.0 is to work with destination countries and the federal government to look for pathways for regular migration. Post-COVID-19, a lot of the destination countries require labour and we have no excuse not to prepare our people properly to migrate safely.\n\n\u201cWe will discuss with the Italian Ambassador as we strategize on how to prepare and structure proper labour contracts, train and prepare our people to travel and do their job regularly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Migration 2.0, we would expect you to work closely with us to look at the data we have and support some other intervention programmes that we have. Migration 2.0 for us, is that every player in the spectrum needs to sit across the table with us to enable us to know what you are doing and how to optimise resources together to strengthen our partnership, reducing waste and achieving more,\u201d Obaseki noted\n\nReassuring that his government will create more opportunities to support women and build structures that will allow them to achieve their fullest potentials, Obaseki further stated, \u201cIn Edo State, we will encourage our women to come up and be part of the political process to ensure we have equal female representation in the legislature.\n\n\u201cWe are happy with the representation in the executive and judiciary. Our task is to make sure that in Edo State, our women have due representation in the legislature.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Dankabo commended Obaseki commended Obaseki for his affirmative action for women in his cabinet and the government\u2019s commitment to the fight against human trafficking and illegal migration.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor has described the personal attacks by his Rivers State counterpart, Hon. Nyesom Wike against his Deputy, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu as \u201cmost unfortunate and totally uncalled for.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the governor called on the leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to call to order, noting that the issues raised by his deputy were germane and needed to be resolved in the interest of the party.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe recent personal attacks by His Excellency, the Governor of Rivers State, Rt. Hon. Nyesom Wike, against my Deputy Governor, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu is, to say the least, most unfortunate and totally uncalled for.\n\n\u201cIf Governor Wike was one who is wont to show respect and courtesy to his colleague-governors, he would have ordinarily reached out to me to express his concerns about the views made by my deputy governor, rather than embarking on this unwarranted public onslaught.\n\n\u201cMy deputy governor was a former National President of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) and his comment is representative of the essence of the nation\u2019s youth population, who are inclined to openly speak up and question the status quo. If Governor Wike cannot understand and adequately respond to the style and character of the Nigerian youth, how can he aspire to lead them?\n\n\u201cHis Excellency, Governor Wike should have taken a cue from the manner in which the National Chairman of our party, Sen. Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, responded to my deputy\u2019s remarks, as a conscientious leader who is able to show empathy and consideration.\n\n\u201cThe concerns expressed by my deputy governor bordered on pertinent issues affecting the PDP in Edo State which since the September 19th 2020 elections, has been able to register over 500,000 members; and till date, these new members have not been properly integrated into our party after two years.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cAlso, the leaders, executives and members who came with me into the party have still not been accepted, integrated or harmonized into the party.\n\n\u201cMore worrisome is the fact that old members of Edo PDP, who are open to inclusion and supportive of building a large party are being vilified and ostracized by a cabal purportedly led by Chief Dan Orbih, who is your perpetual guest in Port Harcourt and is remotely used to orchestrate the destabilization of the party in Edo State.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to recall at this point that a political solution gave rise to the emergence of Chief Dan Orbih first as Acting and then as Substantive National Vice Chairman, South South, of our party, when Chief Emma Odidi resigned that position to allow Chief Orbih to ascend.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore curious why this type of political solution is no longer tenable to resolve the political impasse in Edo State PDP.\n\n\u201cWe can categorically state that in the comments of the deputy governor, he at no point threatened the party as Governor Wike has alleged. Rather, it is Governor Wike, who has at different times, threatened the PDP. Some of these instances include:\n\n1. On September 16, 2018, Governor Wike threatened the party that there would be grave consequences if it moved the National Convention from Port Harcourt in the run up to the 2019 presidential election.\n\n2. On September 12, 2019, Governor Wike also threatened to cause trouble for the party over the emergence of Hon. Ndudi Elumelu as the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nNoting that Governor Wike has contributed to the advancement of the party, just like others, since 1999, he stressed: \u201cNo one is against his desire to run for president, however, his ambition should not be embarked on in such a way that it would cause disruption at different levels, such as the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum as well as different chapters of the party across the country.\n\n\u201cIt clearly amounts to delusion of grandeur, for any one man to nurse the idea that he owns or has more stake in the PDP and everyone should pander to him.\n\n\u201cWe are all equal stakeholders in the party and an aggregate of the ideas, opinions and contributions of all leaders and members should form the position of the party and not the view of one individual or a select few.\n\n\u201cWhile Governor Wike is free to use his resources as he deems fit in pursuit of his ambition, he should not attempt to cow, intimidate, cajole and threaten others into doing his bidding. Edo State cannot and will not be procured for anyone\u2019s personal ambition.\n\n\u201cWhat Nigeria needs now are strong democratic institutions and not strong men; that is why we will join the great leaders of our party across the country to build PDP into a strong, large and indomitable party that will win next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\n\u201cGovernor Wike and his collaborators headed by Chief Dan Orbih in Edo State will not succeed in destabilizing the PDP in Edo State as they did other states like Cross River just to secure delegates to actualize his alleged personal ambition to run for presidency in 2023.\u201d\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cIn Edo, we don\u2019t accept political bullies and overlords and historically, we have demonstrated our capacity to unshackle ourselves and dethrone bullies and highhanded leaders.\n\n\u201cI appeal to all well-meaning leaders of our great party to call Governor Wike to order to desist from his current unguarded and disruptive tendencies. From all indications today, PDP is set to take over the leadership of Nigeria provided we can rein in the self interest of a few leaders to put the task of rescuing Nigeria above their personal ambitions.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "Concerns Over Police Brutality In Equatorial Guinea",
          "text": "Police brutality unfortunately ranks high in the list of things Equatorial Guinea is known for. A disturbing event took place on February 21 and 22 in the town of Baney. A brawl occurred between a resident of this town, Jos\u00e9 Boba Bopa, and police officer Pedro Mba Mesie, who, with the collaboration of the town police Commissioner left Jos\u00e9 Boba Bopa with multiple cranial trauma, whose further consequences are still unforeseeable.\n\nJos\u00e9 Boba Bopa was brutally tortured by the police with iron bars and police knives, causing serious injuries, and leaving him unconscious for a long time.\n\nIt all started as a verbal fight between Jos\u00e9 Boba Bopa and policeman Pedro Mba Mesie, where the Commissioner eventually intervened on policeman\u2019s side. The two carried out an arbitrary arrest against Jos\u00e9 Boba Bopa around 04:00 on the 22nd. Once transferred to the Police Station, they started brutally torturing him. The victim\u2019s screams woke up the neighbours.\n\nThe current law prohibits all kinds of torture and inhumane treatment in Equatorial Guinea. The police committed several crimes.\n\nAs of today, Jos\u00e9 Boba Bopa is still hospitalised at the Lorei Comb\u00e1 Clinic. He cannot afford the health expenses that his treatment requires.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBaney Youth Organisarion makes efforts to raise funds to cover his treatment. It is asked that justice be done, that he be provided with a life pension since after being discharged as a fisherman, he can survive on his own only for so long. His injuries can leave serious lasting consequences.\n\nThis type of acts of torture becomes common in Baney by the uniformed men who serve in this district. There are recent arbitrary acts carried out by these same policemen, and they are known aggressors.\n\nIf delved deeper in the past of this type of practice, one may find the case of the young Eleuterio Boko Be\u00f1a, alias Temb\u00ed, brutally tortured by the police in November 1995, and later admitted to the Malabo General Hospital, where he died on December 10, 1995. Days before, in November, his case was dealt with by the United Nations special rapporteur for Equatorial Guinea, Alejandro Artucio, who brought this case to the attention of President Obiang. On those dates, Obiang, during his sudden visit to the General Hospital, stopped at the bed where Temb\u00ed lay, to wish him luck in his future life. Eleuterio Boko Be\u00f1a died as a result of the torture he received at the Baney Police Station. He left his son an orphan.\n\nMany of these cases go unpunished, and the torturers continue with their lives as if nothing happened. They treat the defenseless population the only way they know how, that is torturing for pleasure. Asking the competent authorities for their aid is useless, simply because they are complying with instructions from superiors.\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

          "text": "Despite President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s intervention, there are indications that the festering leadership crisis bedevilling the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee(CECPC) of the All Progressives Party may be far from over.\n\nIndication to this emerged Monday when a major stakeholder in the party and lawmaker representing Borno South in the National Assembly, Senator Ali Ndume said the position of the 19 governors on the CECPC would prevail at the end of the day.\n\nAt the height of the botched leadership change which heralded in Niger state Governor Abubakar Sani-Bello as acting chair of the CECPC, Kaduna state Governor Nasir el-Rufai declared 19 governors were in support of Sani-Bello.\n\nHe also said the choice of Sani-Bello had Buhari\u2019s blessing, indicating that the deal had been sealed.\n\nEl-Rufai said Governor Mai Mala Buni\u2019s actions were hindrances to plan to hold its convention on March 26.\n\nAccording to him, 19 of the 23 governors elected on the ticket of the party were on same page on the mission to prevent the party from collapsing.\n\nBut he was silent on the four governors that were not with them.\n\nThe London meeting\n\nBut at a meeting with some select ministers and other stakeholders, led by Attorney General of the Federation Abubakar Malami (SAN) in London Saturday, President Buhari scolded the el-Rufai group and directed that the Yobe state governor be returned as the caretaker committee chair.\n\nAt the said meeting, the president was also reported to have said he was not backing any candidate for the position of the national chairman of the party.\n\nNdume speaks\n\nBut weighing in Monday while featuring on Arise TV monitored by Ripples Nigeria, Senator Ndume said the position of the anti-Buni governors would ultimately prevail.\n\nThe lawmaker said the actions of the governors, allegedly in support of the emergence of Sani-Bello as the CECPC head, would be ratified for the betterment of the party.\n\nSpeaking during the interview, Ndume said: \u201cWhen we have 19 people on one side, the voice of the majority will prevail and have its way. The President is the leader of our party and as I said, the 19 Governors seem not to prefer Buni and we cannot afford to go into the elections with a divided house. This issue will be resolved eventually with the inclusion of the other four Governors.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker, however, expressed worry over the internal wrangling within the ruling party and praised President Buhari for his intervention.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening in the APC is worrisome but this is not unusual due to political interests \u2014 the problem is that the interest of some individuals overrode the party but the President intervened.\n\n\u201cThe statement made by President Buhari will get everyone into line for the betterment of the party. The President expects everyone to do the right thing but he stood up before the issues degenerate.\n\n\u201cVarious persons have shown interest in the party leadership, and the party will vote by consensus, direct or indirect. The interested candidate depends on where the chairmanship is zoned to, but I am not sure whether it has been zoned to North Central. My best candidate is to have someone that cannot be manipulated, who is a leader and father to all in order to take decisions on what is better for the party,\u201d Ndume said.0y\u0165\n\nOn the issue of zoning, the lawmaker said: \u201cIn fairness, the South must present the next President and it is left to those zones to produce.\u201d\n\nEx-PGF boss Lukman\n\nIn a related development, the immediate past Director General of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) and a chieftain of the ruling APC, Salihu Moh Lukman, has called for a painstaking background checks on all the aspirants contesting at the forthcoming national convention of the party.\n\nLukman said the quality of party leaders would substantially determine the quality of candidates the party would present for elections in 2023.\n\nIn a statement Lukman released Monday in Abuja, he said starting with the March 26, 2022 APC National Convention, APC leaders, especially governors should demonstrate stronger commitment towards recruiting tested and trustworthy leaders.\n\n\u201cWe must appeal to all APC leaders, especially Governors, to recognise that the weight of political responsibility of producing new leaders for the APC is in fact a very strong test of whether the party can continue to justifiably earn the confidence of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWill leaders, especially Governors, undertake the crucial task of performing background checks for aspiring candidates and dispassionately, even if painfully, select both party leaders and party candidates for elections, beyond issues of loyalty? The crucial task before APC leaders is to ensure that leadership selection process produce trustworthy leaders both as party leaders and as candidates for elections.\n\n\u201cOnce party leaders make the mistake of producing Bureau De Change managers as APC leaders during the March 26, 2022 National Convention, the probability will be very high that there will be many bad eggs emerging as standard bearers of the party for the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cAlready PDP leaders have dug their political grave when for instance they elected people who shared $2.1 billion meant for arms procurement to fight insecurity as National leaders of the PDP,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Lukman, \u201copposition PDP leaders continue to arrogantly and contemptuously ignore this foundational reality of public trust in politics. This is among many other factors why the PDP is still very unpopular among Nigerians. APC must fundamentally take every step necessary to produce new orientation for political leadership recruitment in the country as we approach the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cAs much as possible, situations whereby good leaders only emerge \u2018accidentally\u2019 must begin to be reversed in Nigeria based on carefully planned initiatives under the APC. As part of the process of planning for the emergence of trustworthy leaders, issues of getting current leaders to account for their actions or inactions will be nec\u201dAPC, as a party, needs to also take a special interest in what is going on in Kogi State. It is embarrassing that a government produced by the party will demonstrate that level of rascality. If PDP can tolerate such public rascality as was the case under for instance the inglorious era of Ayodele Fayose in Ekiti and many other PDP state governments across the country, APC must decisively disown what is coming out of Kogi State under Governor Yahaya Bello.\n\n\u201cIf necessary, APC should declare opposition to what is emerging as the governance credentials of Governor Yahaya Bello, including taking every necessary step to save the people of Kogi State from the influence of Yahaya Bello in determining who succeeds him.\n\n\u201cEvery step must be taken to ensure that APC emerges as a distinctively different party from PDP and other parties especially on the question of leadership recruitment. While in the case of PDP and other parties, issues of leadership recruitment are considered as given based on the received wisdoms of political leaders, in APC these issues are being debated and contested, which explains all the dynamics around the March 26, 2022 APC National Convention.\n\n\u201cIf anything, the contest for the emergence of trustworthy political leaders in APC is a contest for the unfettered development of Nigerian democracy. Nigerian democracy cannot develop unless the right conditions within parties are created for the emergence of trustworthy leaders both as party leaders and candidates for election.\u201d",

          "text": "The National Secretary of the All Progressives Congress Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, James Akpanudoedehe, on Tuesday returned to the National Secretariat of the party, accompanied by allies and armed security personnel.\n\nHis return to the secretariat comes days after Niger State Governor Abubakar Bello stormed the Secretariat with some APC governors and announced that he was the acting National Chairman of the CECPC of the party, a move believed to mean the ousting of Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State as the Chairman of the Committee.\n\nAfter resuming at the secretariat, Akpanudoedehe issued a statement insisting the party remains united and strong and that Governor Buni remains in charge with the committee working to ensure the party\u2019s National Convention holds on March 26.\n\nLast Monday, reports emerged that Buni had been sacked, while Akpanudoedehe was no longer the CECPC secretary.\n\nHowever, a statement issued on Saturday in Abuja, by the APC Director of Publicity, Salisu Dambatta, stressed that Akpanudoedehe never sent a resignation letter to the party, neither was Buni sacked.\n\n\u201cAll those are utterly false,\u201d he said in the statement to clarify the controversy on the office of the party\u2019s CECPC secretary.\n\nFollowing the reports that Governor Buni had been sacked as chairman of the CECPC, Governor Bello subsequently took over as the party\u2019s acting chairman.\n\nRead Akpanudoedehe\u2019s full statement below:\n\nPRESS RELEASE BY THE CARETAKER/ EXTRAORDINARY CONVENTION PLANNING COMMITTEE (CECPC) OF THE ALL PROGRESSIVES CONGRESS (APC) ON RECENT EVENTS AND THE STATE OF LEADERSHIP IN THE PARTY\n\nGentlemen and Ladies of the Press,\n\nThe Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) under the Chairmanship of His Excellency, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, makes this Press Release to clarify the events of last week and reassure the membership and stakeholders of the Party, as well as the Nigerian people in general, that the Governing Party is crisis-free, strong and remains united in giving the country the transformative leadership and good governance which she promised them.\n\nThe CECPC, therefore, informs the Press and the General Public as follows:\n\n1. That the CECPC was appointed, and has always done her best, to steer the affairs of the APC in line with the mandate invested in her at inauguration by the National Executive Council (NEC) of the All Progressives Congress.\n\n2. That on the 28th day of February, 2022, the CECPC Chairman took a long-delayed trip abroad on health grounds, leaving behind written authorisation for other members of the CECPC to continue work in his absence, particularly the day to day management of the APC.\n\n3. That in his absence, sundry activities earlier scheduled for action appeared to develop fresh urgency in order to satisfy the Timetable for the 2023 General Elections released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), thus galvanizing some within the CECPC to act in their best understanding of both the situation and the leadership dynamics in the Committee/Party.\n\n4. That all such actions were clearly identified at all times as happening in an acting or proxy capacity, and under the auspices of the substantive Chairman, His Excellency, Governor Mai Mala Buni, contrary to widespread speculations that the Chairman, Secretary or some other officials of the CECPC have been removed from Office or otherwise replaced.\n\n5. That the CECPC is intact and functional as originally constituted.\n\n6. That delivering a seamlessly successful National Convention for the APC on March 26, 2022 is top on priority for the CECPC and we shall continue to execute such assignments as are legal pending the return of the Chairman who is on his way back to the country and shall resume Office on arrival with the full support of all members and other stakeholders.\n\nWe are grateful to INEC for her firm guidance in the entire circumstances.\n\nMeanwhile, the party has engaged a team of senior lawyers to address a purported court order halting the planned APC National Convention. We hereby call on the Judiciary to give the matter the needed and expedient attention in our bid to vacate the purported Court order and allow for the conduct of a transparent and rancour-free National Convention deserving of our great party, APC.\n\nThe Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) hereby restates absolute loyalty to the APC, thanks the National Organs and leadership of our Party led by His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR and reassures our members and citizens that the Party is stronger than ever before and poised to extend her winning streak since 2015 into 2023 and beyond.\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the 4th Estate of the Realm, we thank you.\n\nSIGNED:\n\nSen.

          "text": "Kogi state government has berated a former Director-General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, Salihu Moh. Lukman, over his outbursts against the state governor and the Governor Mai Mala Buni APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\nMr Lukman had accused the party leadership of extorting aspirants ahead of the March 26 National Convention and also asked that Bello be prevented from getting the presidential ticket of the party.\n\nThe former PGF DG also alleged that Bello had yet to commence payment of N30,000 minimum wage as announced and that workers were earning 25 per cent of their salaries.\n\nBut reacting in a statement issued on Tuesday and signed by the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Kingsley Fanwo, the state government said Lukman\u2019s allegations were baseless, adding that he should not \u201callow the frustration of his unceremonious and embarrassing exit as the Director-General of PGF take possession of his reasoning to the extent of disparaging party leaders.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress in Kogi State, Comrade Onu Edoka, has confirmed that the state government has embarked on the payment of N30,000 minimum wage to workers in the state, saying the Governor Yahaya Bello administration has not been owing salaries or paying 25 per cent of salaries, contrary to Lukman and other naysayers\u2019 claims.\n\nRead full statement below:\n\nBello: Your unceremonious exit as PGF DG has affected your reasoning, Kogi lambasts Lukman\n\n\u2026 as NLC debunks ousted PGF DG\u2019s claims\n\nKOGI State Government has tongue-lashed a former Director-General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, Salihu Moh. Lukman, over his outbursts against the state governor and the Governor Mai Mala Buni APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\nLukman had accused the party leadership of extorting aspirants ahead of the March 26 National Convention and also asked that Bello be prevented from getting the presidential ticket of the party.

Lukman concerning the popular presidential ambition of Governor Yahaya Bello.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that Lukman could allow the frustration of his unceremonious and embarrassing exit as the Director-General of PGF take possession of his reasoning to the extent of accusing His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni\u2019s APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of extorting aspirants ahead of the March 26 National Convention.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more saddening that Lukman decided to expose his main fear when he unwittingly revealed that the candidate to beat in the 2023 APC primary was my principal, His Excellency, Alhaji Yahaya Bello. To the amateur politician, the unfounded allegations against the administration of Governor Yahaya Bello should sway the minds of Nigerians or party leaders.\n\n\u201cBut asking the party to prevent Yahaya Bello, a leading presidential hopeful, from getting the party\u2019s ticket, already stamps the fact that all eyes are on him to take the party to victory in the 2023 General elections, which everyone knows will be keenly contested.\n\n\u201cFor the records, Lukman\u2019s anti-party escapades while at the secretariat of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum did not only cost him his job, but also cast more ridicule on his already battered image.\n\n\u201cWe are, therefore, not surprised at his recent disgraceful outburst against key party leaders. He has proved himself to be a mole in APC with a mission to undermine it and ultimately hand advantage to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe, however, want to assure him that no one has the monopoly of caustic statements. Governor Yahaya Bello has only refrained from dignifying detractors with response, venom for venom, because of his sound upbringing. But if Lukman should allow frustration to take a total grip of his senses, then, he should be ready to face the consequences of his actions as we will not leave any stone unturned to seek redress legally. We will not watch him continue to rubbish the image of our dear party in the manner he has been doing.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Governor Yahaya Bello remains a key figure holding the party together and he has the support and endorsement of overwhelming majority of party faithful to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. Lukman should wake up to the fact that his campaign of calumny will not wane the love APC and Nigerians have for Governor Bello.\n\n\u201cWe find it needful to inform the public that the historic and audacious staff verification exercise undertaken by the Yahaya Bello Administration at inception did not only paint the payroll in the colours of integrity and transparency, but also ensured efficiency in the service.\n\n\u201cMany unintended beneficiaries were removed and the State immediately ensured that 100% salaries were paid to the civil servants.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to note that the staff verification exercise was carried out with the full cooperation and deep involvement of labour unions who have always cooperated with the state government in its bid to reposition and strengthen the service.\n\n\u201cNigerians are adequately informed of the meagre allocation shared during the last FAAC meeting. Many states have yet to pay their February salary.\n\n\u201cInternally generated revenue wasn\u2019t at the standard our administration had set as a result of economic downturn, owing to the energy crisis that hit the nation in February.\n\nBut as an administration that is committed to the welfare of the civil servants, the Kogi State Government sat with labour leaders and agreed to pay 75%.\n\n\u201cIt has since been paid with the full implementation of the minimum wage. This is against the lies peddled by Lukman that Kogi workers received 25 percentage of their old salaries.\n\n\u201cOnly civil servants on grade level 7 and above received 75%. Civil servants on Grade Level 1 to 6 received 100% salary with the 30,000 minimum wage. The Governor and all political office holders also received 75% in solidarity with our workforce. To us, this is responsible and responsive leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to reiterate the commitment of the administration of Governor Yahaya Bello\u2019s administration towards the welfare of the workforce and that no amount of lies sponsored by Lukman will prevent Governor Bello from answering the popular call by the Nigerian masses to serve the nation in the presidential capacity,\u201d he added.",
