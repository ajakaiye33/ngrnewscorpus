          "text": "Amarachi Okeh\n\nA medical expert has urged older men to take better care of their prostate health to prevent other health complications.\n\nThe expert, a Professor of Surgery, Kehinde Tijani, noted that the poor state of prostate health is a major reason for the increasing incidence of urinary tract infections among older men.\n\nRecall that it was recently reported that 75-year-old former president of the US, Bill Clinton was hospitalised at the University of California, Irvine Medical Centre, due to a urinary tract infection.\n\nAccording to reports, an aide to the former president confirmed that he had a urological infection that spread to his bloodstream but was on the mend.\n\nRecall also that after a few days at the hospital, Clinton was discharged and, in a video, said, he was on the road to recovery.\n\nThough UTIs are more common in women, Tijani, who is also a consultant urologist, said men also suffer from this infection.\n\nAccording to the consultant urologist, while cases of UTI are rare among young men, it is quite prevalent in men from 50 years of age. This, he said, is due to the state of the prostate.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, Professor Tijani said, \u201cUTI is more common in women than men because the urethra is closer to the anus in women than in men. So, because most UTIs usually come from the anus, that is the major thing. But, yes, men have it but it is not common.\n\n\u201cIt becomes more common in men as they become elderly from the 50s and 60s because of the prostate but generally young men rarely have it unless there is an underlying cause.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the reason why older men are prone to UTIs is because of the inability of urine to flow freely through the prostate.\n\nUsing an analogy, the professor said, \u201cIf you have a gutter that is flowing very well, things will not grow in it but if the gutter is stationary and something blocks it, things will start growing in that gutter. That is the same thing with the urinary tract in men.\n\n\u201cSo, when they have a prostate enlargement that is slowing down the urine or there\u2019s any problem that is slowing down the urine, this may lead to urinary tract infection.\n\n\u201cThat is the reason why, as men get older, their prostate starts getting enlarged and the release of the urine becomes slower, then they are more prone to UTIs.\u201d\n\nHe noted that UTI can be easily treated with an antibiotic, stressing however that it is very important to find and treat the cause of the infection first.\n\nSpeaking on the symptoms that may indicate the presence of UTI in a man, Tijani said the commonest ones are feverish feeling, burning sensation, and frequency in urination.\n\nHe added that some people may see pus, while others may also see blood.\n\nHe however warned that once a man sees blood in his urine, it is a sign of a more serious issue, noting that such a person must urgently seek medical attention.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Oyo jailbreak: We\u2019ll recapture all escapee inmates, Aregbesola vows",
          "text": "\u2026warns residents on assisting escapee inmates\n\n\u2026says 392 inmates still at large\n\n\u2026as Wakili, Shodipe\u2019s whereabouts unknown\n\nBy Adeola Badru\n\nThe Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, Sunday, vowed to pursue and recapture all inmates who escaped from the Abolongo Custodial Centre of the Nigeria Correctional Service, NCoS, on Friday night during a vicious attack on the facility by yet to be identified gunmen.\n\nThe minister gave the assurance, while making an inspection visit to the facility in Oyo, Oyo State.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe spate of attacks on our custodial facilities, the last of which occurred here on Friday night calls for serious concern, first in our society and secondly on your professionalism. This is unacceptable and we are saying enough is enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m assuring Nigerians that the Federal Government will pursue not just those who attacked our facility, but those who have escaped lawful custody.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe attack was unconscionable, I commend officers of the Nigeria Correctional Service and other members of sister security agencies who provided perimeter security for our facility for fighting gallantly and holding the fort before the attackers were able to gain access to the awaiting trial section of the facility, however, those who escaped are already being pursued. Some have been rearrested, many more will still be captured,\u201d the minister stated.\n\nGiving more details about those who escaped, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola noted that, 446 out of 907 escapees have been recaptured, whilst 69 never left the facility.\n\n\u201cAs at the last count, 446 of the escapees have been recaptured leaving 392 still at large. We want to assure Nigerians that the service have an updated database of the escapees which includes their biometrics.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are sharing the database with all security agencies in the country including the interpol, so those who escape our recapture efforts can be nabbed.\n\n\u201cTo those on the run, be assured you have nowhere to hide. You can run, but you can\u2019t hide. We\u2019ll fish you out! We are publishing details of those we escaped in the mass media so the public can assist in that effort.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis matter is being investigated and we shall leave no stone unturned to get to the root of the matter \u2013 the remote and immediate causes and the vulnerability of our system and personnel, if any.\u2019\n\n\u201cThere shall not be a repeat of our guards being overwhelmed again. This is an anomaly that should never repeat itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Federal Republic of Nigeria cannot be overwhelmed. Our guards will give whatever it takes, never to be overwhelmed again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going after every single inmate that escaped from custody. We shall hunt them to the ends of the earth. All the security agencies in the country are on their trail. We shall not rest or tire until we bring the last one in, dead or alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will need to add that it is a criminal offence, punishable by a jail term, to offer any assistance whatsoever, not even giving a cup of water, to any inmate that escaped from lawful custody. You cannot help them in any way, absolutely, by way of cash, food, clothing, medical care, employment, road direction and any form of help, other than to encourage them to turn themselves in, and report their sighting to law enforcement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government, however, out of magnanimity, is giving them a small window to voluntarily turn themselves in, for which they will be pardoned for escaping from custody, but not for the offence the have committed,\u201d the minister reiterated.\n\nOn the effort to rebuild the damaged part of the facility, the minister noted that he has directed the NCoS, to immediately begin remediation work.\n\n\u201cI have instructed the CG of NCoS to immediately begin the reconstruction of the damaged parts of the building. We hope to make the facility better secured and more habitable for the inmates.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Governor \u2018Seyi Makinde, also paid an inspection to the attacked centre, where he ordered immediate installation of security cameras in the facility and link same with the security situation room in the state and also granted the main road leading to the facility be immediately graded.\n\nSpeaking against the speculation that the arrested Fulani warlord, Iskilu Wakili and the suspected Akinyele serial killer, Sunday Shodipe were among the escapee inmates, Makinde said: \u201cAbout the high-profile suspects here, people are very quick to start talking about conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I can say is that investigation is still on. Yes, there were high profile criminals that were held in this facility, but they are not the people they were carrying the rumour about.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, I will appeal that our people should be calm. We have challenges around the country \u2013 banditry, insurgency and terrorism. And we can only deal with those issues when we have the people in alignment with what the leadership is trying to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, they should please believe that their leaders will tell them the exact situation of things at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nCorroborating the stance of Makinde, the Deputy Controller-General, Operations of the Nigeria Correctional Service, NCoS, Tukur Muhammad Hamad, said: \u201cI have been here since Saturday, when this happened and we are investigating. Very soon, the report of the investigation handed over to my Controller-General.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I want to say this clearly that here, in the custodial centre, we don\u2019t have any high-profile inmate, but the only person we have here is that person who has a case with EFCC and for your information, he is still with us here. He did not go to anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the situation on ground now. So, Iskilu Wakili and Sunday Shodipe are not here,\u201d he said.",

I am a product of his intensive investment over the years. We all know him as that reverend being in Vanguard newspaper and also a teacher of journalist which, for me, is the highest form of duty and beyond just writing history in hurry. It\u2019s a pleasure for me to be here and I am also here on behalf of other governors who told me to represent them at this occasion. Adefaye is a good friend and I am happy as he celebrates his 60th birthday. It is important and I am glad it is a floor that is full of experience and success.\n\n\u201cI thank God for all that he has accomplished and more that he is going to accomplish.

He has accomplished so much in the industry and I wish him more accomplishments.\n\n\u201cHe has a depth of compassion and insight for the profession, I have worked with him for the past 25 years and watched him under pressure. He maintains his confidence and when you are in difficulties, and you need a word of advice, he has a kind word to say to you.\n\nHe has devoted his life and everything to the service of the profession and we are very grateful.\n\n\u201cWe thank his wife, for understanding and on behalf of his colleague I will like to thank Mrs Adefaye for the work she has done over the years and the entire family.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s man of honour and integrity \u2013 Akande\n\nAlso paying glowing tributes, former Minister of Investment, Mrs Akande commended Adefaye for taking Vanguard to a high level.\n\nShe said: \u201cHe is a hardworking man, a man that has taken Vanguard to a very high level, I have known him for many years, he is a man of honour and integrity.\u201d\n\nSam Amuka remains my role model \u2013 Gbenga Adefaye\n\nIn an emotional remark, the celebrant, Mr. Adefaye commended his wife, Vanguard Publisher and organisers for giving him a benefiting birthday.\n\nHe said: \u201cI celebrate birthdays for my kids from ages 1-7 but subsequent birthdays, I drove them to the nearest bookshop and bought books for them. It is sad that we are in an era where people no longer read. So, I make it a point of duty for them to read.\n\n\u201cAs regards birthday celebrations, I have a role model in Mr. Sam Amuka, the chairman and Publisher of Vanguard newspaper. At every of his birthday, he disappears, he cares less about birthday celebration. \u201cThis birthday is a coup against me and they were able to do because of coronavirus that prevented me from travelling abroad. Ordinarily, I travel abroad during my birthdays but because of coronavirus, I decided to stay back.\n\n\u201cThe Editor of Vanguard newspapers, Mr. Eze Anaba and my wife, planned the birthday. I am grateful to Vanguard Media Limited, my family, friends and well-wishers.\n\n\u201cAgain, I am grateful to my chairman, Uncle Sam. Vanguard has always been my family since 1986 and since then, I have been grateful. It is not about money but the satisfaction. I will remember today for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Nwafor Sunday\n\nBarely forty-eight hours, a London Magazine \u2018The Economist\u2019, slammed the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, and the Nigerian Army, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, Sunday night reacted to the papers postulation.\n\nThe paper had in it editorial titled: \u2018The crime scene at the heart of Africa\u2019, criticised Buhari\u2019s anti-corruption fight, noting that his administration has failed to address corruption in the country.\n\n\u201cEconomic troubles are compounded by a government that is inept and heavy-handed. Mr Buhari, who was elected in 2015, turned an oil shock into a recession by propping up the naira and barring many imports in the hope this would spur domestic production.\n\n\u201cInstead he sent annual food inflation soaring above 20%. He has failed to curb corruption, which breeds resentment. Many Nigerians are furious that they see so little benefit from the country\u2019s billions of petrodollars, much of which their rulers have squandered or stolen. Many politicians blame rival ethnic or religious groups, claiming they have taken more than their fair share. This wins votes, but makes Nigeria a tinderbox\u201d, the magazine said.\n\nThe Economist equally, blasted the Army, saying that: \u201cNigeria\u2019s army is mighty on paper. But many of its soldiers are \u201cghosts\u201d who exist only on the payroll, and much of its equipment is stolen and sold to insurgents. The army is also stretched thin, having been deployed to all of Nigeria\u2019s states. The police are understaffed, demoralised and poorly trained. Many supplement their low pay by robbing the public they have sworn to protect.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, Mr Shehu agreed with The Economist that Nigeria faces four key threats to the stability and prosperity of the nation \u2013 namely: ISWAP/Boko Haram terrorism in the North-East; kidnapping and crime in the North-West; herder-farmer disputes in the central belt; and the delusions of IPOB terrorists in the South-East.\n\nHowever, talking about the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mallam Garba opined that the arrest and trial of mazi Nnamdi Kanu, who happens to be the leader of the group, would lead to the end of the group.\n\n\u201cIn the South-East, IPOB \u2013 which the Economist rightly describes as \u201cdelusional\u201d \u2013 the arrest and present trial of the terrorist leader of the group is the beginning of its demise.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s administration is redoubling efforts to have IPOB rightfully designated as a terrorist group by our allies outside of Nigeria \u2013 an act which will collapse their ability to transact gains from crime and extortion in foreign currencies.\n\n\u201cIt is important to remind the Economist and the global media that this group\u2019s aggression and widespread presence on social media does not reflect their public support, for which they have none: all elected governors, all elected politicians and all elected state assemblies in the South-East \u2013 which IPOB claim to be part of their fantasy kingdom \u2013 reject them completely.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

This place is extremely dirty. You are only concerned about cleaning your houses, while the waste is deposited outside, littering the environment; causing diseases and sickness to others.\n\n\u201cIt is about time you stop giving excuses and do the right thing. I want to let you know that enforcement is going to be beefed up in the next three weeks, we will apprehend any environmental defaulter engaging in indiscriminate dumping and cart pushing business\u201d.\n\nThe LAWMA boss added: \u201cYou need to mobilize your youths and empower them to police the black spots within the community. Invite the youths and have a bye-law to back their operation. LAWMA will support you by training them. Get them uniform for identification and let them arrest outlawed cart pushers. It is high time we do the right thing by taking responsibility for our waste. Patronize PSPs and pay for waste service. Waste bill payment is sacrosanct.\u201d\n\nHe urged the council to work with residents to engage youths in the area to police the black spots to end the reign of illegal dumpsites, insisting that it would bring local solution to the perennial problem.\n\nOdumboni advised the council officials and residents to consider the idea of voluntary monthly environmental sanitation, as recently endorsed by Shomolu Local Government, for total transformation.\n\nThe Amuwo-Odofin Chairman, Engr. Valentine Buraimon, commended LAWMA for spirited effort at transforming the cityscape, as noticeable around the metropolis, adding that his council would do the needful, to help the agency return FESTAC Town and the entire Amuwo-Odofin, to the old glory of beauty, neatness and sustainable environment.\n\nAlso speaking, the Iyaloja of Omotanwa Market, FESTAC Town, Alhaja Atinuke Shittu, passionately appealed to market people and residents, to sort their waste for recycling, to reduce the volume of waste meant for landfills and to make money.\n\nThe Secretary-General of FESTAC Town Residents Association, Mr. Justice Unanka, advised the PSP operators to change their tactics and business approach, to earn revenue more easily from residents.\n\nIn attendance were: the Vice-Chairman of the council, Maureen Ashara; Managing Director of AM Protection and Security Services, Mr. Adebisi Adeniyi; Executive Director, Finance of LAWMA, Mr. Kunle Adebiyi; Chief Technical Officer of LAWMA, Dr. Olorunwa Tijani, and many senior LAWMA officials.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Garba Shehu\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru \u2013 Abuja\n\nTHE Presidency, Sunday night responded to what it described as \u201cEconomist\u2019s flawed anti-Nigeria cover\u201d, saying that President Muhammadu Buhari is strengthening Africa\u2019s democracy.\n\nThe Presidency also said that the resilience and fortitude of patriotic Nigerians will see the nation through the difficult times.\n\nThese were contained in a statement issued by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu in Abuja.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cThe Economist is correct: Nigeria faces four key threats to the stability and prosperity of the nation \u2013 namely: ISWAP/Boko Haram terrorism in the North-East; kidnapping and crime in the North-West; herder-farmer disputes in the central belt; and the delusions of IPOB terrorists in the South-East.\n\n\u2018The Economist is also accurate to state that they have come to a head under President Buhari and the All Progressives Congress, (APC) administration. Yet they do so, because for so long, under previous administrations, whether military or democratic, tough decisions have been ducked, and challenges never fully met \u2013 with the effect of abetting these dangers and allowing them all to fester and grow.\n\n\u201cToday, all four threats are being fought concurrently and it is only this President\u2019s administration which has finally had the will and determination to confront them.\n\n\u201cThe Buhari administration has sought to push back terrorism which has been a threat for more than two decades since the first emergence of Boko Haram. It is only the Buhari administration that has now sought to intervene against the kidnapping and banditry that has been a simmering threat for far longer.\n\n\u201cIt is only this President\u2019s government which has taken on IPOB, the violent terrorist group which bombs police stations and offices of security agencies, while also threatening those who break their Monday-sit-ins whilst claiming the mantle of forebears who half a century ago fought a civil war.\n\n\u201cAnd it is only the Buhari leadership which has sought \u2013 ever, in over one hundred years \u2013 to identify the root causes of the herder-farmer clashes and find durable solutions.\n\n\u201cThe forms may have altered, and the threats posed by each may have waxed and waned, but what has been constant is that administration after administration since independence \u2013 whether military or democratic \u2013 none sought to fully address these threats to Nigeria as President Buhari\u2019s government does now.\n\n\u201cToday, the military is engaged in almost all the states of Nigeria because the President has insisted upon addressing these decade-after-decade-long issues during his time in office.\n\n\u201cIn the North, Boko Haram members \u2013 many of whom now fight under the breakaway banner of Islamic State\u2019s West Africa Province (ISWAP) \u2013 have been pushed back. At the start of the President\u2019s tenure, Boko Haram was launching attacks across the majority of the country \u2013 including in southern states and Lagos.\n\nALSO READ: Buhari travels to Saudi Arabia\n\n\u201cToday they are cornered and confined along with their ISWAP compatriots in our country\u2019s outermost fringes of the border, unable to spread further.\n\n\u201cIn the South-East, IPOB \u2013 which the Economist rightly describes as \u201cdelusional\u201d \u2013 the arrest and present trial of the terrorist leader of the group is the beginning of its demise.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s administration is redoubling efforts to have IPOB rightfully designated as a terrorist group by our allies outside of Nigeria \u2013 an act which will collapse their ability to transact gains from crime and extortion in foreign currencies.\n\n\u201cIt is important to remind the Economist and the global media that this group\u2019s aggression and widespread presence on social media does not reflect their public support, for which they have none: all elected governors, all elected politicians and all elected state assemblies in the South-East \u2013 which IPOB claim to be part of their fantasy kingdom \u2013 reject them completely.\n\n\u201cThe only government of Nigeria which has ever sought a solution to the centuries-old herder-farmer disputes of the central belt is President Buhari\u2019s administration. The Federal ranches programme, launched shortly after the President\u2019s re-election is the first of its kind \u2013 and it is working: during the last 12 months clashes have significantly reduced.\n\n\u201cThe government now calls on State governors to have the imagination to join forces with the Federal administration and expand this programme by making available state lands for those interested, now that its effectiveness has been demonstrated.\n\n\u201cThe Economist opinionated and reported on banditry and kidnapping in the North-West. While this has been simmering for generations, it is the newest of the organized threats Nigeria faces to her stability.\n\n\u201cBut this too the Economist inaccurately described: \u201cbandits\u201d who have the resources and technology to shoot down a military fighter jet are not bandits at all \u2013 but rather highly organised crime syndicates with huge resources and weaponry. Yet they are essentially no different to Boko Haram in this regard who are now cornered. It will take time, but the President is unwavering in his determination to collapse this challenge to public order.\n\n\u201cThe Economist is correct: Nigeria faces multiple threats. They confluence now not because of this government; but on the contrary, it is this government which is addressing them concurrently, and simultaneously \u2013 when no other prior administration sought to adequately address even a single one.\n\n\u201cThat is the difference between what has gone before and what we have now. It is why the President and his party were re-elected with\u2019 an increased majority in national elections two years ago.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Any nation that jokes with the education of its younger generation is planning for self-destruction.\n\nThe seemingly insurmountable problems confronting the country are somehow linked to lack of education; be it general insecurity, institutional decay, infectious diseases, or low productivity and so on.\n\nAll around the country, one comes across young children wandering the streets, looking for food or carrying out hard labor. It\u2019s not only education that they lack; these kids are also without parental care, guidance, counseling or direction.\n\nThat makes them vulnerable to easy brainwash and so present soft target for criminals recruitment and political thuggery. This complements the country\u2019s current plight. Looking closely into Boko Haram and banditry, many of the murderers are young people abandoned by the society at early ages without education and care.\n\nNo investors will be attracted to a lawless society where peace is not guaranteed; you cannot risk your wealth in an environment where the future is uncertain. The youths are the driving force behind any development; without proper training, nothing good would be expected from that society.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nLack of education harm societies in both the short and long run; industrialization and medical care will collapse, the environment will deteriorate, agricultural output will reach its lowest while population growth will increase with relatively less productivity.\n\nThese vulnerable children are of poor family background, in which they lack basic tools, such as textbooks, school uniforms, notebooks, and other tools they need to excel in school. This is where the government at all levels should come in to ensure Nigerian children get free education regardless of family backgrounds.\n\nIndeed, the importance of education can never be overemphasized. The development of every country solidly depends on its level of education. The nation needs a holistic approach to make educating its new breeds a matter of priority.\n\nLasting solutions to the menace of out-of-school children can be achieved only when critical stockholders are engaged not only in the nation\u2019s educational sector. Parents, community leaders, traditional institutions must all be included. Awareness campaign with civility can make the parents understand the significance of educating their children to be decent ambassadors in the society.\n\nGovernment needs support of all and sundry to intensify effort in changing the narrative. Theoretically, basic education is a fundamental right of every Nigerian child; yet, we are not making it practical. Efforts must be intensified to make education not only priority, but accessible and affordable to make positive progress in the country.\n\nTajuddeen Ahmad Tijjani,\n\nAzare, Bauchi State.",

          "title": "Anambra 2021: Andy Uba and the hounds of AnambraVille",
          "text": "BORROWING my title from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s brilliant novel, \u2018 The Hounds of Baskerville\u2019 I have decided to write on a worrisome development witnessed in the course of the campaigns for who takes over the affairs of Anambra State as its governor for a period of four years.\n\nThis development has been directed or should I say targeted at the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, in the person of Senator Andy Uba. The development is simply the recourse sadly to the employment of vile and false propaganda with Andy Uba as its near helpless victim.\n\nSince Uba\u2019s emergence as the APC\u2019s candidate, the ruling party, APGA has repeatedly unleashed the hounds of propaganda using social media and a number of other mediums in a futile attempt to tar Uba with all sort of unspeakables rather than campaign on whatever achievements no matter how minute their eight year revelry in office yielded Ndi Anambra. While the APC candidate is leveraging his campaign on his messages of experience and trust, seeking to educate Ndi Anambra on what an Andy Uba administration will offer and stand for, the ruling party has rather reduced the election to one where the topical issues are not the quality of road infrastructure, state of Healthcare or the dismal state the state\u2019s educational facilities but who is Uba\u2019s wife and other nauseating stories such as the ridiculous plan of Uba to build two mosques using Anambra funds or his recent alleged declaration of his non support for the anti grazing bill. Using similar underhand tactics that portrayed the Hound of Baskerville as a specter, the Hounds of AnambraVille have used all sorts of fictitious names and ghost like organisations to carry out such diabolical lies against Uba. Such comical reports are usually sanctioned by the top echelon of APGA\u2019s media management, backed by huge funds and jwith a stream of obless youths these \u2018 Hounds of AnambraVille\u2019s singular aim is similar to the central theme of Doyle\u2019s novel is to create a pattern of fear within the Anambra electorate about the APC candidate in order to create some sort of dissonance about what the candidate truly stands for.\n\nUsing these patterns of fear, it is the hope of the hounds and their masters that Ndi Anambra will not be swayed by their non performance for the last eight years, a commonly held notion amongst a majority of citizens of the state but will rather stick to the fears of a mosque and open grazing and vote in an underperforming party. We see such a pattern when a Chris Ngige vied for Governor in 2013 and when Tony Nwoye followed suit in 2017, this time it is Uba that is in the cross hairs.\n\nAnd so while APGA\u2019s false cry everyday is that the APC will give the ancestral land of Ndi Anambra for open grazing, it is rather Governor Obiano who has pussyfooted on the issue of open grazing and has failed to join his fellow Southern Governors in solidarity on the subject. In his hypocrisy, Obiano and Soludo have repeatedly ordered the denouncing of the APC as a Muslim Fulani Party bent on the twin evils of Islamizing Ndi Anambra but the same Obiano and Soludo are friends with the Buhari who they have maligned in the past and even now as the linchpin of such a non existent threat. Matter of fact, Soludo works for Buhari as a member of his Economic Management Team, is it not then shameful that he would now malign his own boss as he is doing presently.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIs it not nonsensical that with all the problems staring Ndi Anambra in the face that an Andy Uba as Governor will busy himself as well as use scarce funds to build three mosques at the hilarious sum of 5 billion Naira ?\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhile sane readers will view these set of stories amusing and laughable but then understand that the ruling party is seriously bewildered by the rising status of Senator Uba\u2019s candidature, the fact that such a ludicrous story is likely to be believed by a number of people cannot be ruled out, given the pattern of fear created in the minds of Ndi Anambra.\n\nSo when these social media roustabouts accuse Uba of one misdeed after another, of ideas not tinkered with, no, not even as a brain zap, then the public should be aware that the hounds are at it!\n\nWhat is much more sickening about the whole arrangement is the attempt to portray a decent man as a daemon for the sake of elections such that what should count will no longer be his achievements in the past whether it is as a former aide to a president or a two time Senator.\n\nThese Hounds of AnambraVille will not appreciate Uba\u2019s numerous contributions to Igbo politics when he single handedly influenced a number of key appointments of Igbo sons and daughters into the Obasanjo administration. The hounds fail to understand how he helped a number of Igbo entrepreneurs, a majority of them from Anambra with access to President Obasanjo without asking for a bribe, many of them went on to build factories which are still employing a number of our youths today.\n\nThe hounds cannot fathom how an Uba as a Senator championed interests that are pro poor and pro Igbo, they forget that the recent declaration of Anambra as an oil producing state is as a result of Uba\u2019s efforts on the floor of the Senate. These hounds are aloof to the interventions of Uba in cases affecting Igbo Citizens such as Ralph Uwazuruike and Nnamdi Kanu, as recently affirmed by Uwazuruike himself in a recent video. Today, a debtor candidate and others who have been posturing as Champions of NdiIgbo including Governor Obiano had in the past shied away from such causes whereas the same Uba, now vilified wrongly as a Muslim/ Fulani loving candidate to the detriment of his own people dared to do otherwise.\n\nThe hounds are embittered that Senator Uba is coasting to victory, they are embittered that their nefarious hold on Anambra which they have maintained for long using political and ethnic like chicanery is coming to a sure end.

          "title": "Jail attack: FG talks tough, says enough is enough",
          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nFollowing last Friday\u2019s attack on the Medium Security Custodial Centre, of the Nigeria Correctional Service (NCoS), Abolongo, Oyo town of Oyo State, Federal Government has said enough is enough on the consistent attacks on custodial facilities in different parts of Nigeria.\n\nThe government noted that there have been consistent attacks on the custodial facilities in Owerri in Imo State, Benin in Edo State, and Kabba in Kogi State, before the most recent attack in Oyo State, saying the attacks are not just some random happenings, but premeditated, planned and coordinated attacks, meant to make Nigeria unsafe and ridicule the government.\n\nMinister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, made the disclosure when he paid an assessment visit to the attacked custodial centre at Abolongo, on Sunday.\n\nAn external attack was launched against the facility by gunmen around 10p.m., on Friday October 22, 2021. A total of 837 out of 907 inmates, held in the facility were freed by the gunmen. One soldier, one Amotekun operative and one inmate list their lives during the gun duel, while many also sustained varying degrees of injury.\n\n\u201cWe are going after every single inmate that escaped from custody. We shall hunt them to the ends of the earth. All the security agencies in the country are on their trail. We shall not rest or tire until we bring the last one in, dead or alive.\n\n\u201cLet me assure Nigerians of their safety of lives and property. Our custodial facilities are safe and we are putting extra safety measures in place, in light of the observed pattern of the external attacks we have seen, to prevent any such occurrence in the future.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m assuring Nigerians that the Federal Government will pursue not just those who attacked our facility, but those who have escaped lawful custody. The attack was unconscionable. I commend officers of the Nigeria Correctional Service and other members of sister security agencies, who provided perimeter security for our facility for fighting gallantly and holding the fort before the attackers were able to gain access to the awaiting trial section of the facility. However, those who escaped are already being pursued. Some have been rearrested, many more will still be captured,\u201d the Minister stated.\n\nThe visit of Aregbesola was preceded by separate visits to the facility by the Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State; Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III; and 5the state Commissioner of Police, Ngozi Onadeko.\n\nAccording to Makinde, the attack was shocking, saying: \u201cInvestigation is still ongoing. We cannot say precisely whether this is an isolated event, or this is the beginning of a wider issue that we have to deal with. But whatever the case is, we have made an assessment of here, we have taken some immediate decisions. We have asked that the road from the main road to this place be graded immediately. We are going to position cameras here and we will link them to our security situation room, not ust here, but all other correctional facilities in the state.\n\n\u201cWe are also making a list of critical state assets that we need to monitor. I have also asked that the entrance and exit points to the state be monitored.\u201d\n\nResponding to question on high profile inmates in the facility: Makinde said: \u201cPeople are very quick to start talking about conspiracy theory. Investigation is still on. Yes, there are high profile inmates that are held in this facility. But they are not the people that they are carrying their rumour. So, I will appeal again that we should be calm. We have challenges around the country. We have insurgency. We have banditry. But we can only deal with those issues when we have the people in alignment to what the leadership is doing. We should believe that their leadership would tell them the exact situation of things at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nThe Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Adeyemi, also remarked: \u201cWhat happened is so shocking to us. May God end such. This place is for those who are doing and acting against the law and all what the government is doing to make things good, so that they can be kept away and reform them before coming back into the society as better people.\n\n\u201cBut, the situation that they had to bring guns and explosives here to destroy the place is so shocking to us and painful. All those who died and injured, may God forgive them their sins and heal those in the hospital.\n\n\u201cThe people of the town should be calm and wait for what the government will do. I am sure that the government will react positively and this incident will be a thing of the past. By the grace of God, we will never witness this type of devastation again in this town.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as at Saturday afternoon, a total of 262, inmates had been recaptured, while 575 were still at large. But the number of inmates that have been recaptured has risen to 378, while 460 are still at large, according to Adams Ongaji, the officer in charge of the custodial centre. It was observed that repairs of damaged items at the centre have begun on Sunday.\n\nInside sources within the custodial centre, however, said only two soldiers and three armed guards were on grounds when the gunmen arrived at the facility with sophisticated weapons. They stated that the gunmen did not only overpower the five security personnel, they successfully took away three inmates that were remanded at the centre in connection with bank robbery. They added that the external attack of the facility occurred about a week after the three bank armed robbery suspects were remanded in the facility.\n\nThe Deputy Controller-General, Operations, of NCS, Abuja, Mohammed Tukur, also cleared the air on the speculations that the gunmen came to rescue th alleged territorial warlord and kidnapping kingpin on Ibarapa axis of the state, Iskilu Wakili, saying Wakili was not being held at the centre. He said the suspected serial killer that terrorised many communities in Akinyele Local Government Area of the state between May and August, 2020, Sunday Sodipe, was not also at the facility.",

In our globalized and technological world, national wealth is more and more based on knowledge, innovation and entrepreneurship.

Societies are transformed when girls and women are educated. We see these all over the world. When women are educated, families are smaller and healthier, more children go to school, infant and child mortality is reduced, national economic growth increases and corruption is reduced. All these are achieved from education.\u201d\n\nThe former Vice President made reference to a report by the US Center for Disease Control that early childhood education is an important contributor to better health in children, and that provides a foundation for children\u2019s academic success, health, and general well-being.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt even acts as a protective factor against the future onset of adult disease and disability. Everyone in a society benefits from the widespread availability of a quality education, from infancy to adulthood.\n\n\u201cWell then, how does Nigeria fare at this challenging time? How does Nigeria measure up? How are we doing? Not very well, it seems. It pains me to share this information with you. The most striking thing for which Nigeria has become known all over the world has been captured in a BBC headline \u201cNigeria\u2019s Kidnapped children\u201d. There are even whole websites now devoted to the latest kidnapping news in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd what has been our response to this horrible situation? Some say we cannot protect these most vulnerable of our citizens. Our very own children. No, they say. We can\u2019t protect them in Nigeria\u2019s schools.

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nThree persons, comprising a soldier, an inmate and Amotekun Corps member lost their lives, while many others, including an Amotekun Corps member, were critically injured when gunmen invaded Medium Security Custodial Centre, Nigeria Correctional Service (NCS), Abolongo, Oyo town in Oyo State around 10:00p.m. on Friday October 22.\n\nThe security personnel that died or injured, as gathered, were attached to the Correctional Centre to provide security. The soldier was attached to Operation Burst. A pick-up van, belonging to Operation Burst, which is a joint security network of Oyo State, was sighted at Abolongo riddled with bullets just as bloodstain was seen in the vehicle.\n\nBut the inmate that lost his life during the commotion reportedly tried scaled the fence of the centre, but could not make it as he landed on the ground on the other side of the fence.\n\nThe security personnel attached to the facility reportedly engaged the gunmen in a fierce duel with a view to repelling them for about 20 minutes, but the gunmen were said to have overpowered them and gained entry into the yard after using dynamite to blow open the wall.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nThe attackers, as gathered, used grenades and other explosives to gain access into the awaiting trial section of the facility before setting free many of the awaiting trial inmates. But the other sections of the facilities were said to have been left untouched.\n\nSunday Sun reliably gathered that a total of 837 inmates were freed by the gunmen that came in large numbers on motorcycles. But as at the time of filing this report, the authorities of the NCS disclosed that a total of 262 escapees had been recaptured, while 575 of them are still at large.\n\nBut some of the escaped inmates reportedly returned to the centre by themselves. One of them was said to have come back with bread and beans, saying: \u201cI know that with what happened, there will not be good for us for some days. This is why I went out to get food so that I will not starve.\u201d\n\nWhen this reporter visited the attacked facility on Saturday, it was observed that observatory towers, residence of the head of custodial centre, and the iron door at the entrance of the main building of the centre were severely damaged with bullets and explosives.\n\nBut journalists were not allowed to enter the main custodial centre, where the inmates are being kept in different cells to assess the extent of damage done by the gunmen.\n\nThe Controller of Corrections, NCS, Oyo State Command, Mr Noel Ailewon, who initially spoke through the command\u2019s spokesperson, Olanrewaju Anjorin, said that journalists were not allowed entry into the facility because the place was being treated as a crime scene.\n\nHe added that the Oyo Custodial Centre was established in 2007 with a capacity of 160 inmates, but at the time of the attack, the facility had a total population of 907 inmates, out of which awaiting trial persons were 837, representing 92 per cent, while 64 are convicts.\n\nTwo among the high profile inmates, remanded at Abolongo Custodial Centre, are the alleged territorial warlord and kidnapping kingpin of Ibarapa area of the state, Iskilu Wakili, and the suspected serial killer that terrorised many communities in Akinyele Local Government Area of the state between May and August 2020, Sunday Sodipe.\n\nBut the authorities of the NCS in the state said that they would not mention names of the inmates, adding that high profile inmates \u201care still in the cells.\u201d\n\nAddressing journalists thereafter, Ailewon explained that the gunmen that attacked the facility stormed the place around 10:00p.m on Friday October 22, 2021, came in large numbers and attacked the centre with sophisticated weapons.\n\nAilewon stated that he was informed about the incident around 10:05p.m., by the head of the custodial centre, adding that there were varying degrees of injury, but could only confirm the death of the inmate that attempted to escape.\n\nHe added that following the Controller General of Corrections, Haliru Nababa\u2019s directives, he has commenced the process of search and recapture, after visiting the scene of the incident.\n\nHe assure that no effort would be spared to recapture the fleeing inmates, even as he solicited credible intelligence to aid security agencies in tracking down the escapees.\n\nShortly after the interview with Ailewon, recaptured inmates were brought into the facility in one mini-black maria and a big black maria as well.\n\nThe Director General of Operation Burst, Col. James Oladipo (rtd), said that the injured soldier was not dead as at 1:30p.m yesterday, saying, however, that the soldier was critically injured and he was not sure if he could survive the injury.\n\nAn impeccable source, who did not want his name in print, however, confirmed the soldier\u2019s death at 4:00p.m to Sunday Sun.\n\nBut a group of soldiers that sat under a tree at the premises of the facility told journalists that one of them was killed by the gunmen.\n\nThe Commandant of Amotekun Corps in Oyo State, Col. Olayinka Olayanju (rtd) told journalists on phone that one Amotekun Corps member died during the gun duel, while another sustained critical injury.\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has said that he has been briefed on the attack, disclosing that he is monitoring the situation.\n\nA statement issued by his Media Adviser, Sola Fasure, stated that Aregbesola has assured members of the public to go about their normal businesses as the situation is under control, adding that the minister has also asked members of the public to report any suspicious movement or any sign of the escaped inmates and the gunmen in and around the vicinity to the nearest security post around them.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Snubbed by Tinubu in London, Osinbajo Ready for Presidential Fight of His Life",
          "text": "Ejiofor Alike\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo is set to fight the presidential battle of his life following a clash of his ambition with that of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Tinubu, THISDAY\u2019s investigation has revealed.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that Osinbajo has been left with no other option than to throw his hat into the ring after he was snubbed in London by the former Governor of Lagos State.\n\nTinubu had earlier this month returned to Nigeria after spending over three months in London on medical vacation.\n\nThe two-term governor of Lagos State, whose health has been a subject of controversy was reported to have undergone knee surgery in London.\n\nNo fewer than 30 politicians, including President Muhammadu Buhari, Governors Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Umar Ganduje (Kano), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti), and Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo), visited him in London.\n\nThe northern caucus in the House of Representatives, led by Deputy Speaker, Hon. Ahmed Wase also visited the APC national leader and endorsed his candidacy for the 2023 presidency.\n\nA source close to Osinbajo, however, told THISDAY last night that Tinubu snubbed the vice president during his medical vacation in London.\n\n\u201cEssentially, Osinbajo arrived London to attend a conference and then, see Tinubu. As he arrived, he was supposed to see Tinubu the next morning but Tinubu left town by 6 a.m. the next morning to avoid seeing him. Even Adeboye (General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye) had arrived a day earlier and they planned to see Tinubu,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe source further disclosed that the vice president has to make up his mind after his failed bid to see Tinubu.\n\n\u201cTinubu has ramped up his campaign and Osinbajo also wants to be president and both cannot be president.\n\n\u201cSo, now the die is cast for the battle of his life. He has not decided to run but a lot of people are mobilising him to run,\u201d the source explained.\n\nHowever, according to a source close to Tinubu, the former governor of Lagos State had been in London for two and a half months, adding that if Osinbajo wanted to come and see him, he had enough time.\n\n\u201cThe president came to see Asiwaju; other leaders came; Osinbajo did not come. If Osinbajo had wanted to come, he had enough time to do so. Tinubu wanted to return because he wanted to avoid the crowd in Lagos. And he returned when he did,\u201d he explained.\n\nStrong indications that Osinbajo may part ways with his political mentor over the 2023 presidency had emerged during his birthday in March 2020 when Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State, who delivered an address on behalf of the APC Progressives Governors Forum, hinted that Osinbajo is a good candidate to succeed Buhari.\n\nOsinbajo\u2019s supporters, under the aegis of the Progressives Consolidation Group (PCG), were the first and only support group that has received the approval of the APC to canvass support for his emergence as the party\u2019s presidential candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe approval was contained in a letter titled, \u2018Letter of Recognition as a Support Group,\u2019 dated October 4, 2021, and signed by the Director of Administration of the APC, Alhaji Abubakar Suleiman.\n\nThe letter, which was addressed to the PCG, read in part, \u201cWe write to inform you that the National Chairman, His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni, has approved your recognition as a support group of the party.\u201d\n\nEven though the supporters of Osinbajo and Tinubu have insisted that the alleged attempt to pit the two leaders against each other will fail, there are no indications that any of them will drop his presidential aspiration.\n\nReacting to a report where groups said to be supporting Tinubu and Osinbajo were pitted against each other over the 2023 presidency, the Special Adviser to the President on Political Matters, Senator Babafemi Ojudu, had stated in a statement that neither the vice-president nor his office will endorse \u201cthis kind of a divisive engagement and news reports\u201d.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo are members of the same party,\u201d the former senator said.\n\n\u201cOsinbajo regards Tinubu as a respected leader of a political family to which he belongs and will therefore not for any reason endorse an endeavour that seeks to pitch them against each other.\n\n\u201cWe are not unaware of some people who may want to foist a crack among our leaders. Such an attempt is abortive. Osinbajo and Tinubu relationship dates way back and it shall continue to wax strong,\u201d Ojudu reportedly explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Festus Akanbi\n\nBy his acquisition of 1,818,551,625 units of shares of First Bank Holdings Plc (FBNH), amounting to a 5.07 per cent of its total issued capital, the founder and Chairman of the Geregu Energy Group, Mr. Femi Otedola, has joined the trio of the Chairman of Globacom, Chief Mike Adenuga; the current Chairman of FBNH, Mr. Tunde Hassan-Odukale, and Oba Otudeko in the race for the control of the holding company, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nFBNH has a total issued share capital of 35,895,292,791.\n\nAccording to market analysis, Otedola, Adenuga, the Hassan-Odukales and Otudeko\u2019s shareholding are above five per cent and this has placed them in a position to control the organisation.\n\nA capital market source disclosed that contrary to the insinuations that Otudeko has offloaded his shares, he is still a force to reckon with because he is still retaining his shares in First Bank.\n\nThe source further disclosed that Otudeko\u2019s loan is performing, adding that he is ready to take some risk.\n\nAs at March this year, Otudeko was said to be holding a total indirect stake in excess of 532 million in First Bank, coupled with a direct stake of about six million units, bringing his total stakes to about 538 million units of the issued ordinary shares of the bank.\n\nAdenuga on the other hand is said to have been buying more shares and his shareholding is said to be between five and seven per cent.\n\nOn the other hand, Hassan-Odukale, and related parties had acquired a total of 1,923,512,099 units of shares, representing 5.36 per cent of the company\u2019s issued share capital.\n\nThese companies include: Leadway Assurance Company Ltd, ZPC/Leadway Assurance Prem & Investment Coll Acct, Haskai Holdings Ltd, Leadway Capital & Trust Ltd and LAC Investments Ltd.\n\nOthers are Leadway Properties &Investment Ltd, Leadway Holdings, OHO Investment/Oye Hassan-Odukale and Leadway Pensure PFA.\n\nCapital market observers said Otedola\u2019s acquisition of shares may open a floodgate of mop up exercise by the competing shareholders as they move to outdo one another in a bid to control the soul of the holding company.\n\nA statement signed by the Company Secretary of the holding company, Mr. Seye Kosoko, explained that FBNH believed the time had come to make the disclosure and has received notifications from its registrars on the substantial acquisition of its shares by Otedola.\n\nIn the letter dated October 23, 2021, and titled, \u2018Notification of Acquisition of Substantial Shareholdings in FBN Holdings Plc,\u2019 the Company Secretary stated: \u201cWe refer to our communication to the market dated October 22, 2021, on the above subject wherein we stated that we would inform the public of any substantial acquisition, upon receipt of notification from the Shareholder.\n\n\u201cThis morning, October 23, 2021, FBN Holdings Plc received a notification from APT Securities and Funds Limited, that their Client, Mr. Otedola Olufemi Peter, and his nominee, Calvados Global Services Limited have acquired a total of 1,818,551,625 units of shares from the company\u2019s issued share capital of 35,895,292,791. Based on the foregoing, the equity stake of Mr. Otedola Olufemi Peter and his nominee in the company is now 5.07 per cent.\n\nCommenting on the development, Managing Director, Financial Derivatives Limited, Mr. Bismarck Rewane, said Otedola\u2019s acquisition will still be vetted by the regulators, explaining that the CBN will ensure that such shareholders are fit and proper as an investor.\n\n\u201cThe shareholder will still go through the CBN vetting to determine he is proper and fit. They will have to make sure such new shareholders do not have any conflict of interest in the organisation, including insider-related loans in the bank,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that another hurdle would be decided at the company\u2019s annual general meeting where he will have to rely on the recommendations of the shareholders before he can emerge as a director.\n\nHowever, the source said Otedola may eventually emerge as the largest shareholder as shares held in the accounts of other indirect and nominee accounts are reportedly being consolidated and will be forwarded to the regulators in due course.\n\nIn a letter of acknowledgement to the Chairman of First Bank Holdings yesterday, Otedola explained that efforts were ongoing to consolidate shares held in the accounts of other indirect and nominee accounts, which would be made public soon.\n\nHe also placed it on record, his investment of $30million in the bank\u2019s long-term debt instrument.\n\nHis letter titled, \u2018Interest in First Bank Holdings Plc,\u2019 read: \u201cPursuant to the notice of substantial shareholding tendered by my Stockbrokers, APT securities Limited and dated 22/10/2021, it is pertinent to state that we are in the process of consolidating shares held in the accounts of other indirect and nominee accounts and this will be forwarded in due course.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the above , I also invested the sum of US$30million in the bank\u2019s long term debt instrument (classified as Tier II capital) and which constitutes a significant portion of the bank\u2019s capital base.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on why he made such a huge investment at this period, Otedola said, \u201cI believe in the Nigerian economy, it is resilient and has a bright future.\n\n\u201cThe current security challenges will be overcome. Anyone who fails to see the future now will lose out.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier notice to the Corporate Affairs Commission, (CAC) on Friday, FBNH declared that it received a notification on Friday from Leadway Assurance Company Limited that Chairman, First Bank Limited, Mr. Tunde Hassan-Odukale, and related parties had acquired a total of 1,923,512,099 units of shares, representing a 5.36 per cent of the company\u2019s issued share capital.\n\nA THISDAY analysis of the company\u2019s share movement on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NGX) showed that FBNH closed its last trading day (Friday, October 22, 2021) at N12.25 per share, recording a 1.2 per cent gain over its previous closing price of N12.10, was traded at N9.70 on October 10.\n\nFBN began the year with a share price of N 7.15 and has since gained 71.3 per cent on that price valuation, ranking it 16th on the NGX in terms of year-to-date performance.\n\nThe stock of the holding company has accrued an outstanding 63 per cent over the past four-week period alone\u2014second-best on NGX.\n\nBetween July 26 and October 22, 2021, FBNH has traded a total volume of 3.81 billion shares\u2014in 14,746 deals\u2014valued at NGN 38.1 billion over the period, with an average of 60.5 million traded shares per session.\n\nA volume high of 603 million was achieved on October 14th, and a low of 1.74 million on September 1st, for the same period.\n\nAnalysts said the sharp movement in the share price of the company became noticeable from October 14 when it jumped from N10.95 the previous trading day to close at N11.75.\n\nThe following day, the share price continued its upward swing when it closed at N12.70 and it has continued to stay above the N12 threshold since then.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s Director of Corporate Communications, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, did not respond to calls, SMS, and WhatsApp messages sent to him yesterday, while the spokesperson for SEC, Mrs. Efe Ebelo declined to comment because she had not been authorised to comment on the issue.\n\nFBN Holdings Plc is the non-operating holding company of First Bank of Nigeria Limited, a commercial bank with operations in 10 countries.\n\nAs a diversified and one of the largest banking and financial services organisations in Africa, FBN offers a broad range of products and services including commercial banking, merchant banking, asset management, and insurance.\n\nThe merchant banking and asset management business of the group comprises FBNQuest Merchant Bank Limited, FBNQuest Capital Limited, FBNQuest Trustees Limited, FBNQuest Capital Asset Management Limited, FBNQuest Funds Limited, and FBNQuest Securities Limited.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says report crafted to destabilise Nigeria\n\n\u2022Restates globally acclaimed status in restoration of democracy in West Africa\n\n\u2022Denies existence of ghost soldiers on payroll\n\n\u2022Declare state of emergency on security, Masari tells Buhari\n\nEjiofor Alike in Lagos, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja, and Francis Sardauna in Katsina\n\nThe Nigerian Army yesterday descended heavily on the London-based news magazine, The Economist, over the magazine\u2019s report, which described the army as \u201cmighty on paper,\u201d stressing that the report was crafted to denigrate, demonise and destabilise the Nigerian government.\n\nThe army, which also denied the existence of \u201cghost\u201d soldiers on its payroll, insisted that it has distinguished itself as a worthy contributor to global peace and security through regional, continental, and international peacekeeping and peace support operations.\n\nNotwithstanding the army\u2019s message of reassurance, a disturbed Governor of Katsina State, Hon. Aminu Bello Masari has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to declare a state of emergency on the nation\u2019s security to stem the tide of insecurity across the country.\n\nBut a former Chief of Army Staff and Nigerian Ambassador to the Republic of Benin, Lt. Gen. Tukur Yusuf Buratai (rtd), has identified porous international borders, which encourage the influx of weapons and other dangerous materials, as some of the factors fuelling the insecurity.\n\nThe Economist yesterday knocked Nigerian Army, accusing it of selling equipment to the insurgents terrorising Nigeria.\n\nWhile describing the army as only strong on paper, it also described President Muhammadu Buhari-led\u2019s administration as an inept and high-handed government that had also failed to tackle corruption.\n\nThe 178-year-old magazine said this in an editorial titled, \u2018The Crime Scene at the Heart of Africa,\u2019 which was published in its October 23, 2021, issue.\n\nIt alleged that the army had ghost workers on its payroll and often sold equipment to insurgents who destabilise the nation.\n\nThe news magazine said the Nigeria Police Force was poorly trained and underpaid hence they rob innocent citizens to augment their salaries.\n\n\u201cWhen violence erupts, the government does nothing or crack heads almost indiscriminately. Nigeria\u2019s Army is mighty on paper. But many of its soldiers are \u2018ghosts\u2019 who exist only on the payroll, and much of its equipment is stolen and sold to insurgents. The army is also stretched thin, having been deployed to all of Nigeria\u2019s states.\n\n\u201cThe police are understaffed, demoralised, and poorly trained. Many supplement their low pay by robbing the public they have sworn protect.\u201d\n\nIt called on the Department of State Services (DSS) to stop disobeying court orders and release all those being detained illegally.\n\nIt said due to Buhari\u2019s mismanagement of the economy, food prices had soared while life had become more difficult for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cEconomic troubles are compounded by a government that is inept and heavy-handed. Mr. Buhari, who was elected in 2015, turned an oil shock into a recession by propping up the naira and barring many imports in the hope this would spur domestic production.\n\n\u201cInstead, he sent annual food inflation soaring above 20 per cent. He has failed to curb corruption, which breeds resentment. Many Nigerians are furious that they see so little benefit from the country\u2019s billions of petrodollars, much of which their rulers have squandered or stolen,\u201d the report explained.\n\nThe Economist stated that even before COVID-19 last year, Nigeria was already witnessing unprecedented poverty.\n\nThe news magazine opined that this economic hardship was fuelling the current insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cTwo factors help explain Nigeria\u2019s increasing instability: a sick economy and a bumbling government. Slow growth and two recessions have made Nigerians poorer, on average, each year since oil prices fell in 2015.\n\nBut in a swift reaction to the editorial, the Director, Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, said in a statement that the report was crafted to denigrate, demonise and destabilise the Nigerian government.\n\nIt said the report also contained some \u201cunimaginable slurs targeted at the Nigerian Military and the Nigerian Army in particular\u201d.\n\nThe statement described the report as \u201cone of those deliberate falsehood and noxious narratives orchestrated by a network of detractors and coven of dark forces working very hard to adorn the Nigerian Army in an unfitting garb of infamy.\u201d\n\nIt said the report spared no effort in trying to vilify and rubbish the image, character, and reputational standing of the Nigerian Army, adding however that it failed woefully.\n\nThe statement noted that \u201cas a professional, hard-fighting and globally respected institution that has continued to occupy deserved glorious position in the comity of global defence forces, the Nigerian Army is certainly not what the so-called report by The Economist tried to characterise it.\n\nIt accused the magazine of lending its medium for a hatchet job of an article without committing little effort to find out the real truth about the Nigerian Army.\n\n\u201cHow is it imaginable that the Nigerian Army that has distinguished itself as a worthy contributor to global peace and security through regional, continental, and international peacekeeping and peace support operations would be characterised as \u201cmighty on paper?\n\n\u201cHow can the Nigerian Army that has restored democracies, brought peace to troubled lands, and stabilised the sub-region through the dint of hard work, commitment to duty, discipline, and professionalism be so denigrated?\u201d it queried.\n\nResponding further to the publication\u2019s description of the army as ghost soldiers, the statement said: \u201cIs it the \u2018ghost soldiers\u2019 of the Nigerian Army that have weathered the storm of terrorism and insurgency of Boko Haram and Islamic State of West African Province Terrorists (ISWAP) in the North-astern part of the country and parts of the Lake Chad region?\n\n\u201cIn case The Economist magazine and those who fed it all the lies it published do not know, the Nigerian Army working in a joint environment, has been able to stop ISWAP, a very formidable international terrorist organisation in its tracks, despite all the obstacles, including arm sale blackouts on its way\u201d.\n\nThe army further stated that \u201cThe Economist and it\u2019s ilk ought to have known that the Nigerian Army has long distinguished itself as a professional force that does not toy with accountability nor shirk from its statutory responsibility of defending Nigeria from external aggression or internal insurrection.\n\n\u201cIs it not curious that an otherwise respected international magazine could so easily be sucked in by the antics of conflict merchants and agents provocateurs who are uncomfortable with the steadfastness, patriotism, unwavering commitment, sacrifice, ruggedness, and resoluteness of the Nigerian Army in stamping out terrorism, banditry and other violent crimes assailing the country and the West African sub-region?\n\n\u201cHow The Economist magazine failed to do simple due diligence on the said fabricated report is worth interrogating by those who are interested in distinguishing between rogue journalism and professional one.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that the gallant officers and soldiers of the Nigerian Army are undeterred, undistracted, and unfazed by the assertions contained in that silly report.\n\nMeanwhile, miffed by the state of insecurity in the country, the Katsina State Governor, Masari, yesterday called on Buhari to declare a state of emergency on the nation\u2019s security.\n\nThe governor added that the declaration of the state of emergency on security would tackle the security challenges, particularly banditry and insurgency besetting Katsina and other states of the federation.\n\nMasari, who made the call at the third-quarter general meeting of the Conference of Speakers in Katsina, said that the security agencies were doing their best to bring an end to the carnage but added that more needed to be done to ward off the criminals.\n\nThe speakers\u2019 meeting with the theme: \u201cThe Menace of Insecurity in the Country and the Role of State Assemblies to Restore Peace and Order,\u201d was aimed at discussing and proffering solutions to the nation\u2019s security challenges, drawn speakers from across the 36 states.\n\nThe former speaker of the House of Representatives reiterated that insecurity, disunity, and economic stagnation were some of the most critical issues afflicting the country in its quest for development.\n\nMasari stated that given the security challenges in Katsina State, the state government had reviewed the 1975 Local Government Administration Law to enable traditional rulers and other stakeholders to participate directly in security decisions and management in the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn Katsina State, our major problem is the security challenges we are fencing in some parts of the state but with the support of the state House of Assembly, some legal frameworks were put in place while the existing ones were restructured to address the security challenges\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wish to call on the federal government to declare an emergency on the nation\u2019s security to bring an end to the loss of lives and property across the state.\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies are putting in their best to address the security issues across the country but more has to be done to curtail the activities of bandits, cattle rustlers, insurgents, and other criminal elements across the country\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman of the Conference of Speakers, Hon. Abubakar Suleiman said insecurity in the country has constituted a serious threat not only to the economic growth and development but also to the peace and unity of the nation.\n\nHe called on governors across the 36 states of the federation to grant financial autonomy to both the state legislatures and judiciaries to enhance good governance in the country.\n\nAlpha Jets, Helicopter Gunship Kill 60 Terrorists in North-east\n\nIn a related development, the Nigerian Air Force fighter jets under Operation Hadin Kai has launched airstrikes against insurgency targets in the Lake Chad basin killing 60 terrorists.\n\nThe airstrikes hit fighters of terrorist groups, Boko Haram and Islamic State for West African Province (ISWAP), who converged for a meeting in 20 boats on an Island in Tumbuns in the Lake Chad area and Malam Fatori.\n\nA statement by the Air Force said the military sustained their onslaught on terrorist and insurgent targets on islands and localities around Lake Chad.\n\n\u201cOn receiving credible Intelligence on October 20, 2021, that about 20 boats with suspected Boko Haram /ISWAP terrorists were converging for a meeting on an Island in the Tumbuns on the Lake Chad and at Malam Fatori, three NAF aircraft under Operation Hadin Kai were scrambled to carry out strikes on the targets.\n\n\u201cReaching overhead the targets, the pilots observed a gathering of about 20 boats consisting of 5-7 suspected terrorists in each boat. Using a mix of bombs and rockets, the three aircraft carried out series of strikes and scored devastating hits on the targets leaving some survivors scrambling for their lives\u201d, it said.\n\nBuratai Blames Porous Borders for Inflow of Arms\n\nHowever, the former Chief of Army Staff, Buratai yesterday lamented the nation\u2019s porous borders which he said were a channel for arms smuggling.\n\nSpeaking at an event in Yola, Buratai identified porous international borders which encourage an influx of weapons and other dangerous materials, and the tendency by the masses to leave the anti-insurgency war for the military as some of the reasons for persisting insecurity.\n\nBuratai also stressed that lack of development presented a breeding ground for poor nationals who become prone to acts that cause insecurity.\n\n\u201cThe quest for security must go with development,\u201d Buratai said, adding that terrorism thrived in the North-east particularly because it is the poorest region of the country.\n\n\u201cThe North-east lacks development in all areas. That is one of the major factors fueling the insurgency and insecurity in the region,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Ganduje, Adesina task broadcasters on ethics, professionalism\n\nUdora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe Chairman of THISDAY/ARISE Media Group, Prince Nduka Obaigbena, has said nobody can predict who will succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.\n\nThis is coming as the Kano State Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Ganduje and the Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, have tasked the leadership of the Broadcasting Organisation of Nigeria (BON) on the need to prioritise ethics and professionalism in the discharge of their duties.\n\nSpeaking in Abuja at the induction of the Chief Executive Officer of Multichoice Nigeria, Mr. John Ugbe, as BON Chairman, Obaigbena, while noting that Nigeria is in a momentous time, expressed optimism that the newly inducted BON executives will be able to guide Nigeria through this change.\n\nHe also said that with the current situation, nobody can predict who will succeed President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nObaigbena said: \u201cNigeria is in a momentous time \u2013 a time of great change that even on this table in the powerhouse in Kano, none of them can tell you who the next president would be. At this time in Nigeria, there is nobody who can predict 2023. Therefore, these are times of momentous change, when we have ideas of some of those who founded Nigeria in the 60s clashing with the new ideas of the millennials and who Femi Adesina will not like to hear at times. However, we are here to welcome the new leadership of BON, John Ugbe, and his colleague. I believe they are very capable to guide Nigeria through this change. I salute them all.\u201d\n\nIn their separate contributions, Ganduje and Adesina urged the leadership of BON to prioritise ethics and professionalism in the discharge of their duties.\n\nGanduje, who underscored the need for government to support the media industry to move broadcast media to greater heights in the face of emerging global challenges, also tasked broadcasters with the need to promote peace and national development above individual interest.\n\nAccording to him, the Nigerian media has an important role to play in promoting the unity and progress of the nation at this moment of challenges.\n\nGanduje also called on the executive arm of government to upgrade their broadcast facilities to ensure that they have the facilities with which they can effectively discharge their duties.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs media owners, you have a vital role to play in managing all communications in the public domain in the interest of peace and national development. Let me reiterate my call to you, to work with the other media industries in Nigeria, to make sure that the Nigerian media is not allowed to disrupt but play its traditional role of leading the way in the process of protecting public interest for nation-building.\n\n\u201cSecondly, it is to also understand the character of the media so that we don\u2019t misunderstand issues. We should be able to accommodate them; we should be able to understand their disposition, attitude, and the nature of issues in this country especially when different ethnic nationalities, leaders of tribal and ethnic organisations. I think this is the time that the media should be able to make them come together and talk \u2018One Nigeria.\u2019\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Adesina, while describing the newly inducted chairman and vice as consuming professionals, urged them to ensure unity of the country through their broadcast.\n\nHe also expressed optimism that during their tenure, there would be a lot of improvements in the broadcasting industry in terms of professionalism.\n\nAdesina said: \u201cI\u2019m glad that the DG of NBC is here, he knows the running battle that the NBC had had particularly with the broadcast stations in the country. You are driving in your car and you put on the radio in your car, the things that are coming from the station you can\u2019t believe. You can\u2019t believe that such things would be on the airwaves; some on television, you can\u2019t just understand how people who are allowed to speak on national television will say some things.\n\n\u201cI think BON needs to look into this and I believe that if any set of people can do something about it, the incoming chairman and vice chairman can. BON members need to collectively ensure that we have a country. Senator Abaribe is not in terms of a circle, the entire country; we need to have a country and if we are going to have a country that will be united and will be one, broadcasting has a very big role to play.\u201d\n\nIn his acceptance speech, BON Chairman, Ugbe, who rolled out a four-point agenda, reiterated his commitment towards prioritising training and development by sourcing for training opportunities for BON members to deepen their technical knowledge and competent skills, working with local and foreign partners.\n\nHe pledged resolve towards the establishment of the Society of Nigerian Broadcasters, adding that most professions have accreditation organisations that set standards for entry, retraining, and the code of conduct.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Ken Saro-Wiwa Foundation has said it wants exoneration and not pardons to be granted to the late environmental activist, Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others executed by the Nigerian military dictator, Sani Abacha.\n\nThe Foundation was reacting to a statement attributed to President Muhammadu Buhari saying he was considering granting a state pardon to Saro-Wiwa and others executed at the height of the Ogoni crisis in the 1990s.\n\nKen Saro-Wiwa\n\nSee Also News Buhari May Pardon Late Niger Delta Activist, Ken Saro-Wiwa, Eight Others Killed By Former Dictator, Abacha\n\nA statement signed by Dr Owens Wiwa, brother of Ken Saro-Wiwa, on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Foundation and obtained by SaharaReporters on Sunday, however, said the late activist and the eight others who were murdered by the Abacha regime were not criminals.\n\nThe group, which became known as Ogoni 9, were activists from the Ogoni region who opposed the operating practices of oil companies destroying their area.\n\nThey were author and playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa, Saturday Dobee, Nordu Eawo, Daniel Gbooko, Paul Levera, Felix Nuate, Baribor Bera, Barinem Kiobel, and John Kpuine.\n\nSee Also Politics Ogoni People Reject Buhari's Likely Pardon For Late Ken Saro-Wiwa, Demand Exoneration\n\nThey were tried by a special military tribunal for allegedly masterminding the murder of Ogoni chiefs at a pro-government meeting, and hanged in 1995 by the military dictatorship of General Abacha.\n\nThe statement titled, \u2018Exoneration Not Pardon For Ken Saro-Wiwa,\u2019 read: \u201cThe Board of Directors of the Ken Saro-Wiwa Foundation (KSWF) have received and read the statement from Mr (Femi) Adesina, the Special Adviser on Communications to the President of Nigeria, General Muhammadu Buhari (Rtd), in which the President conveyed his willingness to grant clemency or pardons to Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight Ogoni activists illegally executed by the Nigerian Military Dictatorship of Sani Abacha on November 10, 1995, after a sham trial.\n\n\u201cKen Saro-Wiwa and the other Eight Ogonis were not criminals. They were innocent activists unjustly murdered for fighting for a just cause on behalf of their oppressed community. The path to true peace in the region begins with justice. The cleaning up of the environment for which they campaigned and died for is a first good step.\n\n\u201cThe exoneration of Ken Saro-Wiwa and 8 other Ogoni activists, judicially murdered on November 10 1995 is another step towards peace.\n\n\u201cThe family of Ken Saro-Wiwa have made a request for the exoneration of Ken Saro-Wiwa to the President in the past and are still waiting for a response. We urge the President to again consider this request as a path to justice and peace.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that the \u201cfamily and the Foundation have not asked any individual to ask for pardon or clemency for Ken Saro-Wiwa on our behalf, nor are we aware of any group of Ogonis making such a request\u201d.\n\nExoneration for Ken Saro Wiwa KSWF by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nEarlier on Sunday, human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore faulted President Buhari's proposed posthumous state pardons for Saro-Wiwa and others.\n\nSowore said Saro-Wiwa never committed a crime, adding that an innocent person cannot be pardoned.\n\nSee Also Politics Ken Saro-Wiwa Didn't Commit A Crime, You Can't Pardon An Innocent Man\u2014Sowore Knocks Buhari On Proposed Pardon\n\nSowore, who disclosed this on Twitter, stressed that Buhari is the one who once carried out a coup, which is a treasonable offence for which he has yet to be tried.\n\n\"Ken Saro-Wiwa never committed a crime.

Yet they do so, because for so long, under previous administrations, whether military or democratic, tough decisions have been ducked, and challenges never fully met \u2013 with the effect of abetting these dangers and allowing them all to fester and grow. Today, all four threats are being fought concurrently and it is only this President\u2019s administration which has finally had the will and determination to confront them.\n\n\u201cThe Buhari administration has sought to push back terrorism which has been a threat for more than two decades since the first emergence of Boko Haram. It is only the Buhari administration that has now sought to intervene against the kidnapping and banditry that has been a simmering threat for far longer. It is only this President\u2019s government which has taken on IPOB, the violent terrorist group which bombs police stations and offices of security agencies, while also threatening those who break their Monday-sit-ins whilst claiming the mantle of forebears who half a century ago fought a civil war.

At the start of the President\u2019s tenure, Boko Haram was launching attacks across the majority of the country \u2013 including in southern states and Lagos. Today, they are cornered and confined along with their ISWAP compatriots in our country\u2019s outermost fringes of the border, unable to spread further.\n\n\u201cIn the South-East, IPOB \u2013 which the Economist rightly describes as \u201cdelusional\u201d \u2013 the arrest and present trial of the terrorist leader of the group is the beginning of its demise. The President\u2019s administration is redoubling efforts to have IPOB rightfully designated as a terrorist group by our allies outside of Nigeria \u2013 an act which will collapse their ability to transact gains from crime and extortion in foreign currencies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is important to remind the Economist and the global media that this group\u2019s aggression and widespread presence on social media does not reflect their public support, for which they have none: all elected governors, all elected politicians and all elected state assemblies in the South-East \u2013 which IPOB claim to be part of their fantasy kingdom \u2013 reject them completely.\u201d\n\nOn banditry, the presidential spokesman added that the attacks involving bandits have been \u201csimmering for generations\u201d, but \u201cit is the newest of the organised threats Nigeria faces to her stability\u201d.\n\nWhile faulting the description of banditry attacks in the article, Shehu said criminals who have resources to shoot down military aircraft shouldn\u2019t be referred to as \u201cbandits\u201d, but as \u201chighly organised crime syndicates with huge resources and weaponry\u201d.\n\nHe, however, added that while such organised syndicates are not different from insurgents, the current administration remain committed to addressing the situation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Economist is correct: Nigeria faces multiple threats.

          "title": "Baxi acquisition deal sees MFS Africa expand footprint into Nigeria",
          "text": "In a deal subject to approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria, MFS Africa has signed an agreement to acquire Capricorn Digital, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest digital solutions and distribution companies with a 90,000-strong agent network across the country, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nAs the largest fintech interoperability hub in Africa, MFS Africa connects banks, telcos, and money transfer operators across over 35 countries via a single integration point. Paga, MTN mobile money, Ecobank, and Safaricom are among the operators integrated on the hub, with an estimated 320 million mobile money customers interacting across various digital wallets without transaction fees associated with switching platforms.\n\nCapricorn, under its SME-focused brand, Baxi, operates an ecosystem of digital payment services. Its solution is built to help Nigerians with everyday payment needs; including utility bill payments, airtime purchases, pay-TV and data subscriptions, withdrawals, and money transfers. The company delivers these services through its retail network of agents and merchants in some of the remotest locations across Nigeria, and via its BaxiBox POS, BaxiPay, Baxi MPoS Device, and BaxiRIMS products.\n\nThe 100% cash acquisition, MFS Africa\u2019s third in five years, sees the pan-African payments giant expand into Africa\u2019s largest economy, where its presence to date has been limited given the country\u2019s small number of mobile wallets. Capricorn will be called MFS Africa but its core product, Baxi, retains its name.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBoth parties declined to disclose the value of the deal but on a call with TechCabal, Capricorn Founder and CEO, Degbola Abudu, said the deal is the second-largest of its kind in Nigeria\u2019s fintech space, behind the $200 million Stripe paid for Paystack last year.\n\nMFS Africa was founded in 2009 by Dare Okoudjou, a Beninese national, while Nigeria-born Abudu started Capricorn in 2014, with Folu Majekodunmi. The acquisition creates a larger, more versatile company that fuses interoperability between money operators and a super-agent network reaching the mass market.\n\nA pan-African march\n\nMFS Africa\u2019s big vision is to have a presence in all 54 African countries, serving 500 million people and millions of small businesses, according to Okoudjou.\n\n\u201cIf you have a phone or POS, it should be enough to transact with the rest of Africa and the world,\u201d he tells TechCabal. \u201cWe\u2019re building the foremost, currency-agnostic, real-time hub for payments on the continent, to enable people transfer money the way they can call each other.\u201d\n\nOften, MFS Africa\u2019s continental expansion plan has involved partnering with money operators and making minority investments in other fintech companies across Africa, as in the case of Julaya, Maviance, and Numida.\n\nHowever, Okoudjou explains that the company opts for full acquisition when both parties consider that more effective for achieving their shared long-term ambitions.\n\nDare Okoudjou, MFS Africa founder and CEO (left) and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Baxi.\n\nWhy an acquisition?\n\nSimilar to Beyonic, a Ugandan fintech startup MFS Africa bought in June 2020 also for an undisclosed amount, acquisition talks with Capricorn evolved from a minority investment to a full buyout.\n\n\u201cThe more we spoke with Dee, the more we realised what we could achieve with a full acquisition instead of being only investors in which case there could be misaligned incentives.\u201d\n\nOkoudjou further explains that the need to \u201cbolster our presence in Nigeria\u201d given its unique market features\u2014the prevalence of offline payment touchpoints over mobile-first transactions\u2014drove MFS Africa\u2019s interest in Capricorn.\n\n\u201cIn other markets, one or two partnerships with mobile money operators could see us reach 60% of digital payment users in the country,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, mobile money isn\u2019t that widely adopted in Nigeria. Instead, agent networks such as Capricorn\u2019s have grown rapidly.\u201d\n\nWhile MFS Africa can service SMEs online through Beyonic, for instance, Baxi enables the company to reach offline merchants in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nFor Abudu, the future of the mobile payments landscape in Africa is a game of few, where consolidation is the way forward, and attempting to scale alone would require more capital expenditure and a longer time to execute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to partner with a company that brings a real pan-African presence and we see synergies across our operations. They offer a wide range of value-added products and services like cross-border payments while we have access to SMEs in Nigeria, one of the biggest markets in Africa,\u201d he says. \u201cWe believe that we\u2019ve barely scratched the market\u2019s potential. The deal brings many things that allow us to grow very quickly.\u201d\n\nFollowing the acquisition\u2019s close, MFS Africa will build Baxi into a key node on its digital payment network, allowing customers to make cross-border payments to and from Nigeria, similar to what it\u2019s done with mobile money operators across Africa. MFS Africa will also expand Baxi\u2019s proposition for offline SMEs to select markets within its footprint.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to build a large business with relatively small capital but now we want to be able to compete, not just in Nigeria but also across Africa,\u201d Abudu says. \u201cThe deal with MFS Africa gives us leverage to take Baxi and the model that\u2019s been so successful in Nigeria to other African countries.\u201d\n\nMFS Africa plans to engage with Nigeria\u2019s central bank and other regulators to seek any other additional licenses needed to operate its full-service offerings\u2014such as remittance, micro-lending, insurance\u2014while also exploring commercial partnerships in the country.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Editi Effiong: father, writer, producer and tech bro",
          "text": "Editi Effiong\u2019s genius is quiet yet obvious at the same time. He\u2019s a multifaceted creator, builder and thinker\u2014unafraid to tackle the impossible without doubt. From setting up Anakle, a Nigeria-based digital marketing agency, 10 years ago to transitioning into film-making a few years later, Editi has established himself as one of the leading entrepreneurs of his generation. When asked how he would define himself, he responded with, \u201cI\u2019m a father, writer, producer, and tech bro.\n\nThe big picture: Editi Effiong is not your average guy\n\nMany people know Editi Effiong as the brains behind Anakle. Some others might know him for the films he made through his production company, Anakle Films or might have stumbled across him after his involvement in the post-#ENDSARS judicial hearing panel in 2020. Editi attended and documented the daily proceedings, sharing videos, photos and commentaries on his Twitter page. His dedication to reporting on how Lagos State investigated the unforgettable event that took place on October 20 last year, garnered him respect, admiration and a flock of new followers and cheerleaders.\n\nAnakle Films\u2019 theatrical releases, Up North and The Setup, were acquired by Netflix in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Up North, which was based on a story written by Editi, is best described as one of Nollywood\u2019s most adventurous films. Up North did two things successfully: It brought some versatility to Nollywood, Nigeria\u2019s behemoth movie industry; and heralded the arrival of a different Editi. He was no longer just the CEO of a well-respected digital agency with a client list that most marketing agencies would love to get their hands on\u2014Wikipedia, Flutterwave, Glo, to name a few\u2014he was now a film producer and writer who took his craft seriously.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi at a filming location in Northern Nigeria\n\nThe Set Up pulled us in a different direction. In this film, there are no adventures or lush, green fields. But there\u2019s suspense and the dirty underworld of crime. Anakle Films distributed The Set Up with legendary film-maker, Niyi Akinmolayan, sitting on the director\u2019s chair.\n\nEditi displayed his writing chops in his most recent short film, Fishbone, released in May 2020. Fishbone, written and directed by Effiong himself, unearths the terrifying business of counterfeit drugs and how it strips our society of its ability to show love and compassion. Fishbone is a deliberately revealing film; it shows us snapshots of Effiong\u2019s mind and showcases his directorial ingenuity.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with TechCabal, Editi opens up about his childhood, the complexity that is his mind, building Anakle, being a father, and his decision to become a full-time film-maker and writer.\n\nAnakle and the race to get businesses online\n\nEven though Editi is eager to hand over the CEO reins to Anakle\u2019s COO, Munachi \u201cMuna\u201d Nwoke-Ekpo, and purposefully step into his role as founder and CEO of Anakle Films, I was compelled to kick off the interview with questions about Anakle\u2019s beginnings.\n\nIn 2011, digital marketing didn\u2019t have as much clout as it does now. It is hard to imagine a world that didn\u2019t exist with numerous digital and social media platforms. Our current economic climate demands that entrepreneurs move their businesses online and acquire a new crop of customers who are obsessed with social media and consumer technology. In conversation, Editi is a masterful storyteller who uses transparency and humour to pull his listeners in. At no point during our chat did he leave me feeling confused or unimpressed.\n\nKoromone Koroye: What inspired you to start Anakle? What did you see and understand about digital marketing that most people didn\u2019t back in 2011?\n\nEditi Effiong: Back in 2011, we had a slide that predicted that internet penetration would deepen in five years. We also predicted that more than five million Nigerians would be on the internet and that that number would eventually rise to 30 million by 2016. Back then, mobile penetration wasn\u2019t that great and Blackberry phones were still a thing. My business partner, Abass, would charge business owners \u20a650,000 to help them run digital marketing campaigns. And that 50K came with a money-back guarantee: if we weren\u2019t able to successfully promote their brands, they got their money back without any hassles. I mean, how on earth does someone believe that the internet can help you sell more? But we saw that there was a market online and we bet big on what we saw.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: According to the Digital 2021 report, there were an estimated 104 million internet users in Nigeria in January this year. Additionally, internet penetration stood at 50% and 33 million Nigerians with active social media accounts, within that same period.\n\nDo you remember Anakle\u2019s first major campaign?\n\nEditi: In 2010, we ran Interswitch\u2019s first digital campaign. We did this whole flash animation video to push Interswitch\u2019s anti-fraud campaign. I designed the flash. In the early stages of Anakle\u2019s business, I was in charge of execution and Abass handled business operations. So, in this flash animated campaign, if someone emails you for your password or PIN, you don\u2019t give them because Interswitch would never ask you for your PIN or personal information. It was a really great campaign at that time. I mean now, we might take a simple campaign like that for granted; but 12 years ago, building and executing a campaign like that was a phenomenal experience for us and the brands we served during that period.\n\nHow did businesses relate with social media back when Anakle started out?\n\nEditi: \u200b\u200bThe first bank to get on social media was GTB (Guaranty Trust Bank) followed by Diamond Bank. We worked on a project with them and they had their brand assets burned onto a CD. Yes, CDs were a thing back then. But, anyway, they opted for the CD route because they didn\u2019t want anyone to distribute their assets to other sources or agencies. So I picked up Diamond Bank\u2019s CD on a Tuesday and started working on it straight till Thursday. And Thursday happened to be my wedding day.\n\nWoah. You did client work on your wedding day?\n\nEditi: Yes! I was out in the foyer of the hotel room working on this project until I got called into the hall to say my vows and, you know, get married. So I put down my laptop, you know, went and got married and came back and continued working even through my honeymoon. And to think that this was only the second bank that we helped build a Facebook app and get them on social media. Diamond Bank was the second bank in Nigeria to go down the digital marketing route.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, there was a huge opportunity to help businesses get online. And one of the things Anakle was trying to do was help smaller businesses improve brand visibility by getting them acquainted with the internet. We didn\u2019t just target the big brands and enterprise businesses, especially in the beginning. Anakle saw the future of digital marketing and built a business out of it. Our mission was to help businesses grow into the online space, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nAt what point did you realise that Anakle had fulfilled its mission, or at least a part of it?\n\nEditi: There have been many moments. In 2017 we did a very successful campaign with Wikipedia. And that campaign was a forerunner to what became Anakle films. That campaign counted as a major milestone for us. There\u2019s also the part we played in hiring and training people who were new to the digital marketing space. For most of them, Anakle was their first job out of school, and now, most of them are running their own successful companies and projects. You know, making money and growing a company are necessary targets, but I\u2019ve always been more excited about mentoring people and helping them grow in the industry and become better versions of themselves even outside of the work they do at Anakle or anywhere else.\n\nIf our business no longer inspired the people who walked through its doors, then we have failed at our mission. So I get really excited when I see consistent growth in the people who walk through our doors; they come in, grow and become more than they thought they could be before they joined the company.\n\nWhat were Anakle\u2019s hiring values in the beginning? And did those values change after the business grew and garnered success?\n\nEditi: We were looking for people who had the \u2018Anakle spirit\u2019, which is a certain level of fearlessness. We wanted people who could work without fear. I didn\u2019t care too much about CVs and cover letters. We were looking for people who could challenge us; people who could look at the universe as it is and ultimately try to bend it. Because when people are able to challenge the status quo and say, \u201cI can take that on\u201d, then they can create a fire campaign for Sterling Bank or any other enterprise client.\n\nEditi Effiong\n\nHow did you delight Anakle\u2019s early employees?\n\nEditi: I\u2019ll be honest: Back then, we couldn\u2019t compete with Nigerian banks and their salary offerings and other benefits. so we ended up designing a workplace that was exciting. We wanted young people to feel excited about working for us and working out of our office. The Anakle office became our recruitment tool and it was so inspiring to hear people say they wanted to work with us, especially after visiting our office.\n\nNew beginnings: Anakle Films and the road to becoming a director, screenwriter, and producer\n\nKoromone: Moving swiftly along from building Anakle to setting up Anakle films\u2014\n\nEditi: Thank God!\n\nWhen did you know you were ready to make the move?\n\nEditi: Money! I had the money to make that leap of faith into Anakle Films.\n\nSo, how did it feel making that transition from running Anakle to leading the charge at Anakle films? Especially knowing that you were going to put a lot of time and effort into building out Anakle Films\u2019 brand?\n\nEditi: I think the biggest factor there is having a team that can do its job\u2014big props to Munachi. If you\u2019ve never heard of Muna, he\u2019s the best COO in the business. He\u2019s quiet but hard-working and has been with me for 11 years. Muna has done an amazing job at running the business at a group level, and having him around has been extremely helpful and instrumental. I recently received and turned down a global leadership position at a global company\u2014a fantastic offer with great pay\u2014but I turned it down because I wanted the freedom to wake up and do what I love doing or to not do something I hate doing. There\u2019s a madness to having that freedom that works for me. And I think I owe a lot of that to Muna. He gave me the courage to step out of Anakle.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi directing a film at a location in Nigeria\n\nTell us about your history and relationship with writing\n\nEditi: This isn\u2019t common knowledge, but I didn\u2019t start writing today. I\u2019ve been writing my entire life. I was also an avid reader when I was younger. My father studied literature and linguistics, so there were a lot of books around the house. I write almost every day and have written almost every day for my entire life. And when I cannot put into words things I want to say, I end up writing them down. I have hardly ever gotten in trouble for writing because I\u2019m able to articulate my thoughts without ambiguity. Wow! I just used a big word.\n\nMy move to Anakle Films is my way of preparing for retirement. I want to retire as a writer. My entire life is run by writing and this is the direction it is headed now. Anakle Films is my excuse to write; it gives me a reason to write, create and build something from the ground up. As you can imagine, there\u2019s a lot of craziness and madness around the work, but I love it.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Ambiguity is a situation or statement that is unclear because it can be understood in more than one way. [Source: Cambridge dictionary]\n\nEditi on documenting justice for #EndSars victims and survivors and finding his voice again\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: A few months after the #ENDSARS massacre, Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu set up a nine-person Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate allegations of police brutality perpetuated by the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Lagos State. This part of my conversation with Editi struck a raw nerve for the both of us, especially for Editi who had to restrain his emotions while he answered my questions. I think it takes a lot of courage to document the truth in the midst of pain and grief.\n\nKoromone: Let\u2019s pivot and talk about 2020. How did you find yourself involved in the #EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry that sat in Lagos? A number of people don\u2019t know this, but you were shooting a film during that period.\n\nEditi: Yes, I was. When I couldn\u2019t attend sessions, I was on set. When I was a kid, I used to stutter. And, you know, I managed it through my teenage years until it went away. After October 2020, my stutter returned. I stutter a lot these days, especially when I\u2019m dealing with difficult situations. So if you pay attention when I speak, you will hear how slow and deliberate I am with my words. I speak slowly to avoid stuttering, and everytime I think about what went down during #EndSars, it messes up my speech.\n\nThe night of the shootings, I could hear the gunshots. And I was going to drive out there because our people were bleeding and needed help, but my wife said, \u201cNo, you cannot go. It is too dangerous.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t go, and that night, I couldn\u2019t speak at all. For hours, I could not say a word. Anytime I tried to say a word, something came up from inside me and blocked off my speech. And since then, I\u2019ve been managing a very bad stutter that comes and goes\u2014but mostly only comes when I\u2019m dealing with difficult subjects. And in the days following October 20, I felt nothing but numbness. Going to those panel sessions was kind of a metaphor for trying to find my voice again.\n\nFor a few weeks following the shootings, I couldn\u2019t speak properly, and writing about the sessions was my way of speaking and reconnecting with the voice I had lost.\n\nShare this article\n\nKoromone Koroye | Author",

          "title": "Who\u2019s afraid of crypto-salaries?",
          "text": "Like most Nigerian workers, Kola*, at his former job, used to be paid his salary in the country\u2019s official currency: the naira\u2014until he started working at a fintech company registered outside Nigeria. Now he gets paid in USD Coin (USDC), a Stablecoin tethered to the US dollar. With this switch in his salary\u2019s currency, Kola was offered a juicy opportunity to exit a quagmire many young Nigerians find themselves in: they make more money than their parents did but in a currency that has fallen so low their paycheck doesn\u2019t reflect in their purchasing power.\n\nNigeria, like many African countries, grapples with currency risk. Back in 2015, its current president, Muhammadu Buhari, campaigned on a promise to increase the value of the naira. But since the start of his presidency, the country\u2019s currency has plunged badly because demand for the dollar continues to outstrip supply. This plunge in the value of the naira has been majorly fueled by Nigeria importing more goods than it exports. With declining oil prices forcing the Nigerian government to devalue its official currency twice in the past year, and by roughly 35% over the past five years, the resultant inflation has thrown over 7 million people into poverty in 2020 alone, according to the World Bank.\n\nSince saving in naira is a dead plan, more Nigerians now save their earnings in foreign currencies. Data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) revealed that Nigeria had a total domiciliary account balance of \u20a66.566 trillion as of March 2021, and when this figure is converted to dollars at the official rate of \u20a6410 per dollar, it translates to about $16 billion.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nVolatile naira drives Nigerians to digital currencies\n\nNigeria\u2019s weak currency has pushed its citizens into saving their money in foreign currencies, for wealth and value preservation. But even this is in limbo because uncertainties rule the country\u2019s financial regulatory climate. Nigeria\u2019s CBN has a long history of clamping down on individuals, groups and companies it suspects of being responsible for the slump in the value of the naira. Out of nowhere, the CBN banned the sale of foreign currencies to bureau de change operators\u2014also called the parallel or black market\u2014in the country, accusing them of creating an artificial foreign exchange scarcity. It also threatened to go after abokiFX, a website that collates the black market foreign exchange rates daily, asserting that there is only one acceptable exchange rate: the Investors\u2019 and Exporters\u2019 FX Window.\n\nThis has made a lot of people apprehensive, especially those with funds in their domiciliary accounts. Their fears were heightened after Ibrahim Obanikoro, a member of parliament, suggested in a tweet that the CBN close all domiciliary accounts for the next year.\n\nIn addition to saving in foreign currencies, Nigerians have turned to cryptocurrencies\u2014digital currencies that are out of the reach of federal government control.\n\nThis newfound hunger for cryptocurrency has seen Nigeria emerge as the leading country, per capita, for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption in the world, according to a report by Statista\u2014despite government crackdown. In fact, the African continent has been the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency in the world. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 billion worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. For context, sub-Saharan Africa received an estimated $48 billion worth of remittances in 2019, about half of which went to Nigeria, according to a Brookings Institute study. Between July 2019 and June 2020, the volume of cryptocurrencies sent to Africa from outside the continent was the highest of all regions Chainalysis studied. With 96% of the crypto value coming from outside the continent, this suggests that more Africans are receiving remittances via crypto.\n\nDigital money is the future of finance\n\nIn February this year, the CBN placed a ban on cryptocurrency in the country when it directed banks to close the accounts of persons or entities involved in cryptocurrency transactions. At the time, the Nigerian apex bank claimed that cryptocurrencies and digital currencies were largely used in terrorism financing and money laundering, citing the anonymity of their transactions.\n\nBut months after that, the government, seeing it couldn\u2019t quench the fire of cryptocurrency in the country, bet on digital money as the future by launching a central bank digital currency (CBDCs) named eNaira and nicknamed \u201cProject Giant\u201d.\n\nDigital money like cryptocurrencies, CBDCs and Stablecoins will play a significant role in the future of financial services. Cryptocurrency is gaining worldwide acceptance; Stablecoin, a peculiar type of cryptocurrency, has been labelled the \u201cfuture of money\u201d by the Harvard Business Review; and all these are in direct competition with CBDCs.\n\nRest of World reported on how Stablecoins have found a use case in volatile markets like Nigeria, where CBN\u2019s regulations force Nigerians to spend limited amounts of US dollars via their dollar cards each month. In order to bypass this limitation, Nigerians have switched to using Stablecoins to make their payments.\n\nStablecoins, such as the Tether (USDT), Binance USD (BUSD) and USD Coin (USDC) are a form of cryptocurrency pegged to a traditional asset like the US dollar or gold. In sub-Saharan Africa, Stablecoin remittances can be up to 20 times cheaper than traditional money transfers. USDT and USDC transfer fees are often as low as 0\u20131%. Paxful, a leading cryptocurrency trading platform in the country, declares that 1.5 million Nigerian users, representing about 5% of the platform\u2019s trading volume, use USDT, the most popular Stablecoin.\n\nThere is a growing adoption of Stablecoins like $DAI, $USDT, $BUSD and $USDC in Nigeria. Unlike such cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are notorious for their volatility, Stablecoin, like CBDCs, is a non-interest coin. Stablecoins have seen rapid growth this year, with USDC, the second-largest Stablecoin in the world, reaching a market capitalisation of over $30 billion.\n\nSalary alert\u2026but in crypto\n\nJust like Olaf Carlson-Wee, Coinbase\u2019s first employee who was paid entirely in Bitcoin, as far back as 2013, for three years, Nigerians also want to be paid in crypto.\n\nEarlier this year, in July, Timi Ajiboye, CEO and CTO of Helicarrier (formerly Buycoins), announced that the company\u2019s employees would now be paid in USDC. Twitter went agog, with many presenting themselves to Ajiboye for employment at his company.\n\nIn a process Kola describes as \u201cseamless\u201d when he receives his salary in USDC, he converts to naira only the amount he plans to spend for the week. \u201cI don\u2019t withdraw my full salary at once because you never know what the exchange rate will be tomorrow. So, even if waiting would add \u20a6500 to my salary, I\u2019d rather wait than withdraw all at once and have the naira in my account drop in value between when I withdraw it and when I spend it.\u201d\n\nKola says he can convert his crypto, using his company\u2019s product, a cryptocurrency trading app, within two hours. He is unbothered by persistent news around the steady drop of the naira. He isn\u2019t completely insulated from the naira crash, though, as a Nigerian living in Nigeria. But, he notes: \u201cAt least my salary\u2019s value isn\u2019t dropping as fast as it would have if I was earning in naira.\u201d\n\nA colleague of Kola\u2019s, Deji*, who receives his base pay and benefits in USDC as well, reveals that all employees were kept in the loop right from when the company decided that that was the route it would take regarding employee compensation. As a fintech company, there was no need to convince anyone on the team about how Stablecoins would protect them from the steady fall of the naira.\n\nThe problem with crypto-salaries\n\nAt Kola\u2019s company, individual contract staff, who make up a majority of its workers, are responsible for remitting their taxes. To help the employee with this process, an internal document containing information on tax and pension calculations and payments has been circulated around the company. This is the company battling the challenge that comes with paying employees in crypto, as legal barriers in many countries prevent this. Some of the barriers include the non-recognition of cryptocurrency as a legal tender and the challenge of calculating taxes when employees are paid in cryptocurrency.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019s still risky to pay employees in crypto in the US because the currency is recognised by the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) as a property and not a legal tender. A piece of legislation, the Fair Labour Standards Act\u2014a major custodian of employee rights\u2014backs this position. The act states that employees must be paid in \u201ccash or negotiable instrument payable at par\u201d.\n\nWhile legal systems around the world need more time to develop regulations that cater for crypto adoption, US-based Coinbase announced last week that it is launching a new direct deposit service, \u201cGet paid in crypto,\u201d that will let nearly anyone in the US receive all or part of their wages in cryptocurrencies. There are high hopes for the success of this rollout because if even a fraction of Coinbase\u2019s millions of US customers sign up, the service will contribute, in no small way, to making crypto mainstream in the broader American workforce.\n\nSome countries are already making progress with creating laws that define the payment of workers in cryptocurrency. For example, since 2019, New Zealand has made it legal to receive salaries in cryptocurrency and be taxed accordingly.\n\nBut in Nigeria, paying employees in crypto remains illegal. Nigeria\u2019s primary legislation on the relationship between an employer and employees, the Nigerian Labour Act\u2014established in 2004\u2014renders any contract where part or all of a worker\u2019s wages is made payable in another manner apart from legal tender illegal, null and void.\n\nDespite these legal constraints, Nigerian employers in technology startups continue to make smart moves to create value for their employees and the move towards remunerating employees in crypto is one that\u2019s unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\n*Names have been changed.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nSultan Quadri | Author",

          "title": "I promise it\u2019s funnier in Swahili\u2026Kenyan Comedian Eddie Butita is Showing Netflix How Swahili\u2019s Done",
          "text": "For about a month now, Ubers branded with Netflix\u2019s logo have been zipping through Nairobi\u2019s streets. An Uber driver pulls up, blasting early-2000s hip-hop, ready to take on his next ride.\n\nWhen asked why his car is decked out in Netflix decals, he says that he and a group of other drivers were approached by a marketing company offering $90 to anyone willing to ride around the city with the Netflix promotion plastered on the side of their cars. \u201cEasy money,\u201d he says.\n\nStreaming Gets Serious\n\nNetflix is more serious than ever about capturing Kenyan viewers. Since September, Netflix has been offering freemium services and running targeted Twitter campaigns. But, in a move that displays a real willingness to solidify themselves in the hearts and minds of the East African nation\u2019s growing viewers, the streaming giant is now offering Swahili-language programming.\n\nTo roll out this project, the $25 billion company enlisted the help of celebrated Kenyan comic, Eddie Butita.\n\nOver a period of months, Butita translated and oversaw the dubbing for the Swahili language version of Wanda Sykes and Regina Y. Hicks\u2019 Netflix sitcom, The Upshaws.\n\nAt 28 years old, Butita has contributed to iconic series like Churchill Show and the work of other famous Kenyan comedians like Eric Omondi.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that he was not approached by Netflix based on comedic talent alone. Butita is skilled at wielding digital technology in a market that\u2019s grown so big that Netflix can\u2019t ignore it.\n\nComedy Meets Digital Media\n\nComedy is big in Kenya, but digital media made it bigger.\n\nKenya\u2019s mobile penetration rate grew by 11% from 2020 to 2021 alone, making it one of the most connected countries in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria and South Africa. On top of higher-than-average mobile phone usage, the country is also home to some of the fastest mobile broadband speeds in Africa.\n\nMobile phone adoption in Kenya opened access to on-demand content via platforms like Youtube and Facebook. Before this, the nation\u2019s airwaves were more competitive than ever, forcing users to prioritise watch time.\n\n\u201c[It] has made it easier for people to access content anytime, anywhere. They don\u2019t have to be at home to watch certain TV shows. They can come back and watch. And if it\u2019s live, you can post it later,\u201d said Butita in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nThe flexibility viewers have to watch what they want when they want has the ability to extend the shelf life of content, opening the door for brand deals and collaborations for Kenyan comics\u2014an income stream that didn\u2019t always exist.\n\n\u201cPreviously you had to wait to perform or be featured in a movie. But now, you get a brand deal that gives you $10,000, $20,000 or $5,000 just to shoot content and do product placement,\u201d Butita said.\n\nBut Butita\u2019s collaboration with Netflix wasn\u2019t as simple as product placement. The process of translating and recording a dub from English to Swahili, for a US comedy show, was one that involved new levels of creativity and innovation, forcing Butita to ask himself \u201cSanifu or Sheng?\u201d\n\nLocalising Swahili\n\nSwahili is a regional language spoken throughout East Africa and it takes on different forms in each country.\n\nSanifu Swahili or \u201cproper Swahili\u201d is a term used to describe Swahili spoken in the standard form. Standard Swahili is spoken widely in Tanzania and on Kenya\u2019s coast, but in Nairobi, the language has taken on a new life. In the multicultural environment that is the Kenyan capital, a Swahili- and English-based slang called Sheng is spoken among the youth. The urban language has become popular enough for Butita to consider its use in his translations.\n\nBut Butita wanted to make sure that the comedy translated in his dubs could be felt by Swahili speakers across the world.\n\n\u201cI did some lines more than five or 10 times because you rewrite the sentence, it becomes funny, but now you feel like it\u2019s funny to just you because there\u2019s something you understand that other people might not understand. So you change the line. When you\u2019re recording again, you get a different feeling because of the cultural diversity that\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nROI on Local Content\n\nButita\u2019s dubbing and development of The Upshaws is nothing short of revolutionary, but one has to wonder if Netflix\u2019s Kenya-play will be the one that wins the game.\n\nAlthough Netflix is offering a free, limited mobile plan for Kenyan users in the short term, the viewer is still responsible for footing the data cost required to use the streaming service.\n\nMobile broadband speed in Kenya may be high, but the cost of data is high as well. According to the Worldwide Mobile Data Pricing (2021) report from Cable, a British technology research firm, Kenya takes the lead as the most expensive country for mobile data in East Africa. Viewing one hour of Netflix content on low resolution (480p) uses 300 MB of data per hour; in high resolution (1080p), Netflix uses 3 GB per hour. At an average cost of $1.05 per GB of data, Netflix viewers in Kenya stand to pay anywhere from $0.32 to $3.15 to watch a one-hour show.\n\nOn top of high data costs, Netflix will, in order to retain Kenyans\u2019 attention, eventually have to pivot to local content instead of dubs alone. The streaming giant has already done this with some success in South Africa, with shows like the teen drama, Blood and Water.\n\nBut in Kenya, content creation has been somewhat hampered by the low return on investment on original content due, in part, to the difficulty creators face finding fair-priced outlets to screen their content allowing them to recoup funds.\n\nGlobally Competitive Content\n\nMaybe this is where Netflix plans to make an intervention with streaming services. Netflix is a global platform that allows viewers to tap into content from any country at any time. The overnight success of the South Korean film, Squid Game, showed us just how successful well-made local content, that does not come from the West, can be. But, Korea\u2019s success in film and television has been hard-won through more than 40 years of carefully mobilized political and financial resources. It\u2019s paid off, in 2020 the nation\u2019s film industry was valued at around $884,229,150.\n\nIn markets like Kenya, where the culture of content creation is still growing, Netflix will have to spend more time and money developing local content that pops.\n\n\u201cIf we have platforms willing to purchase the content and make the returns be meaningful to creators, that means more content can come out and more people [can] get opportunities,\u201d Butita said.\n\nThere are signs that Netflix is already taking steps to make this happen. Netflix teamed up with UNESCO to fund six young creators in sub-Saharan Africa to develop six short films that reimagine folktales, set to be released in 2022.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author @alexandriasahai",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

But, his strongest point was that she stuttered when answering his questions about her whereabouts.\n\nAnd therein lies a major misconception: people stutter when they are lying. Twenty-one years later, the chorus of that song still forms the basis of many people\u2019s interactions with stutterers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone with a slight stutter, I\u2019d be irked if people conclude I\u2019m fibbing because I can\u2019t get my words out coherently or quickly enough (for them). And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone.\n\nSadly, being branded a liar because of a stutter is just one of the issues we stutterers face.\n\nStuttering in a tech-enabled world\n\nOne can be forgiven for thinking that there is a tech solution somewhere that does away with stuttering. Stuttering has no known cure, and the best technology can currently do is what therapy does \u2014 treat or manage the condition like other speech defects.\n\nPeople can get the most out of treatment if they address stuttering early enough \u2014 preferably as children. Treatment at any age seeks to improve speech fluency while simultaneously building the stutterer\u2019s confidence, thus helping them participate in school, work, and social settings.\n\nExpectedly, tech interventions exist, with many applications \u2014 Balbus Speech, Smarty Ears, and Stamurai (I like this name), to mention a few \u2014 for smartphones and tablets to help people with stuttering.\n\nStamurai, for instance, is a mobile app available on Google Play Store and the App Store. With the app, people learn and practice speech therapy exercises for stuttering. The best result they can get, however, is improved speech control.\n\nIn a world where social media is the go-to for content, many creators generate content from people\u2019s challenges for their jokes. Mildly put, this is insensitive and hurtful, and Charles strongly believes that people should be kinder to not only stutterers but everyone dealing with a disability.\n\nNumbers don\u2019t lie\n\nAccording to The Stuttering Foundation, stuttering affects 1% of the world\u2019s population; depending on what global population you accept, that\u2019s 78 or 79 million people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer a paper on the International Stuttering Association website titled, Increasing Stuttering Awareness in Africa, 11% of children in Africa \u2014 nearly 6.5 million \u2014 of pre-school age (between 2 and 5 years of age) stutter. About 20% or 1.3 million of these children are at the risk of developing chronic stuttering in adult life, and approximately one million school-age children and over ten million adults stutter in Africa.\n\nScience trumps mythology\n\nAcross Africa, traditional beliefs about stuttering abound, varying from one location to the next.\n\nIn South Africa, for instance, stuttering is believed to result from leaving a baby out in the rain, failing to inform ancestors of imminent childbirth, emotional trauma, and tickling a baby too much, among others.\n\nThe remedies for stuttering in these circles border on the hilarious, from standing in front of a mirror and speaking to oneself, to eating a fruit pecked by a bird, and maintaining correct posture, to mention a few.\n\nThankfully, science has provided clarity \u2014 for those ready to accept it \u2014 about the causes of stuttering.\n\nAccording to DoSomething.org, stuttering (or stammering, if you will) is a speech disorder that breaks up a speaker\u2019s flow of speech. A biological and neurological condition, it is caused by one or more of four possible triggers, the first being genetics, and the others, child development, the make-up of the brain, and family dynamics.\n\nFor some reason, stuttering is more common in boys than girls. Consequently, it tends to persist into adulthood more often in boys.\n\nOngoing research shows that people who stutter appear to process speech and language differently than those who don\u2019t. And while children with speech problems or developmental delays are more likely to stutter, strokes and traumatic brain injuries can also contribute to stuttering in adults.\n\nIt would be remiss of me to proceed without stating that proponents of traditional African ideologies about stuttering are right about emotional trauma having an impact; however, they\u2019d probably struggle to explain how. But science has shown that families with fast-paced lifestyles, high expectations, and emotional trauma often have stutterers.\n\nBeyond words; into the mind\n\nOther physical senses somewhat compensate for the loss of any sense, and so the blind, for instance, have keener senses of smell and hearing.\n\nPeople who struggle to speak often fill the vocal expression gap with writing, artwork, and other predominantly non-vocal forms of communication. Mostly, however, writing does it.\n\nFun fact: Isaac Newton stuttered throughout his life.\n\nFor Charles, who has stuttered for as long as he can remember, writing as early as seven has been a valuable alternative to sharing his experiences and documenting his thoughts.\n\nSpeaking about misconceptions he\u2019s had to deal with, he said, \u201cGrowing up in a country like Nigeria where people don\u2019t approach stuttering from a scientific point of view, you either get pity from people, or they assume you have anger issues.\u201d\n\nChioma, a recent mass communications graduate, shares Charles\u2019 thoughts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learnt over time that I\u2019m okay; there\u2019s nothing incredibly wrong with me.\u201d\n\nPutting it succinctly, Charles said, \u201cstutterers are simply audibly different from other people, and that shouldn\u2019t be an indictment on capability or anything else for that matter,\u201d and with the right support systems in place from people, workspaces, and other social touchpoints, they can control their stutters, but even more, feel safe to be someone who stutters.\n\n\u201cHaving understanding parents helped me a lot; they shielded me from people who had the worst to say about me. The support of my extended relatives was also a good thing,\u201d he continued.\n\nAnother misconception people have is that stutterers bottle things up and are impatient. So they are often encouraged to speak up.\n\nHolders of the belief that stutterers don\u2019t know what they want to say often complete their sentences for them, suggesting words and phrases that they think express the thoughts in the speakers\u2019 minds. Interestingly, they are not always right, and Charles couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, my parents never completed my sentences; they were always patient enough for me to get my words out. But in my experience as an adult, people try to finish my sentences or, as they think they\u2019re doing, help me out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfair to do this because you\u2019re more or less saying \u2018I\u2019m helping you because you\u2019re incapable of doing this on your own,\u2019 and that\u2019s not true. All that\u2019s required of listeners is a bit of patience.\u201d\n\nResearch by Leila Cherif and other members of the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Hedi Chaker Hospital and University of Sfax, Tunisia, shows that \u201cstuttering children (SC) are perceived negatively by peers and are rejected by peers more often than children who do not stutter. SC are often exposed to negative social experiences with both their peers and families such [as] teasing and bullying. These problems interfere negatively with self-esteem (SE) development and anxiety levels.\u201d\n\nConsequently, stutterers\u2019 personalities are shaped by their experiences and interactions with people wherever they go.\n\n\u201cStuttering has shaped my personality; I\u2019m reserved, and I don\u2019t say anything around strangers unless it\u2019s necessary because I don\u2019t like being asked to repeat myself. It\u2019s hard to express my feelings, so, rather than talk, I write down my thoughts,\u201d Chioma submitted.\n\nBeing sensitive to the issues people face is a no-brainer, yes? Unfortunately, it isn\u2019t in some circles.\n\nA very Nigerian challenge is comedians joking about people\u2019s speech difficulties, such that rather than being given room for expression, they become the butt of jokes.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the comedians; the audiences who find these jokes funny are the people with whom stutterers have to interact daily during their commutes, at work, at home, everywhere.\n\nRegardless of what they say, no one likes to be laughed at. So I was not surprised at how emphatically Chioma responded when asked if she would be open to trying out something to help with her stuttering.\n\n\u201cABSOLUTELY, I would like to speak without it looking like I have hot yam in my mouth.\u201d\n\nCharles, however, had different thoughts.\n\n\u201cA philosophy in support circles is do not do anything for anyone that they are capable of doing for themselves, it\u2019s a form of theft of people\u2019s responsibilities.\n\n\u201cAt this point in my life, having a speech defect is an important structure around which my life is built. I won\u2019t exactly say that taking that away is wrong. Stuttering or any disability adds to a person\u2019s humanity in a sense, and I don\u2019t know what kind of world we would have if we cannot feel the way others feel.\n\n\u201cTo take away a disability from someone who has likely lived this way all their lives is to level the playing field for them knowing that they didn\u2019t start the race at the same time. And I think that\u2019s unfair.\n\n\u201cInstead of taking it away with tech or medical intervention, I\u2019d rather create a world where people are kinder to those who function differently from how people typically act.\u201d\n\nInternational Stuttering Awareness Day (ISAD), or International Stammering Awareness Day, is a day set aside to raise awareness of the issues faced by millions of people who stutter or stammer. It is celebrated annually on October 22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecious Mogoli Website I love love and a little peace and quiet.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In 2021, over 1 million people registered to take the Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) exams in Nigeria. This is a compulsory test that determines qualification for entrance into a Nigerian university. But, it continues.\n\nAfter JAMB, students undergo another test from their chosen universities. These processes are one-off. If they don\u2019t pass, most young people have to reapply the following year. Some schools have the direct entry option but with the same level of uncertainty\u2014the ones who can leave the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis cycle thrives because of low spending power, lack of options, and the tendency to acknowledge skill or relevance based on a university degree. This lack of degree options and the scarcity of developers is what TalentQL is looking to solve with AltSchool.\n\nFounded by Adewale Yusuf, Opeyemi Awoyemi, and Akintunde Sultan, TalentQL launched in November 2020 as a talent pipeline to connect developers with jobs. On Thursday, October 21, 2021, AltSchool was launched.\n\nWhat is AltSchool? It is a 9-month mentorship and upskilling program to train entry-level developers.

With two decades of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) experience, Toyin Akintayo acutely understands this struggle. And with the help of his team, he decided to build BIZ301 to help entrepreneurs digitise small businesses operations.\n\nThink of a platform that manages expenses and budgets, invoices, employee and payroll management, helpdesk, and facility management applications.

On Thursday, October 21, 2021, Brass, a Nigerian digital bank, announced $1.7 million in funding to aid their growth across Africa. The raise saw participation from US-based early-stage investors, Hustle Funds, Acuity Ventures, Ventures Platform, and Uncovered Fund.\n\nProminent ecosystem individuals like Flutterwave\u2019s Co-founder, Olugbenga \u2018GB\u2019 Agboola, and Paystack\u2019s Co-founder, Ezra Olubi, also participated in this round.\n\nWhat does Brass do? Sola Akindolu, ex-Head of Products at Nigerian fintech, Kudi, and Emmanuel Okeke, ex-Engineering Manager at Paystack, launched Brass in July 2020 to provide SMEs with banking services and help business owners have control over their money operations.\n\nCurrently, the platform provides SMEs with various services, including payroll and expense management, credit and payment services, and API support.\n\nBrass has reportedly served thousands of businesses from schools to restaurants and malls, with a customer portfolio that includes platforms like Mono and Eden.\n\nThey claim to have disbursed $2 million in credit via their crediting platform, Brass Capital, which is still in the Beta phase.\n\nWhere are the funds going? With this raise, the startup is looking to scale and improve upon its products. Already, they have completed incorporation in Kenya and are looking to do the same in South Africa. By 2022, they want to launch in both countries fully.\n\nThe big picture is to develop innovative products that offer all-inclusive banking solutions in Africa.\n\nNeobanks spree? With the number of Business to Customers (B2C), and Business to Business (B2B) neobanks like PayHippo, Prospa, and Sparkle already offering similar services, one wonders what makes Brass different. Per TechCrunch, Akindolu shares that the company\u2019s focus is financial operations and cash flow support for SMEs.\n\nIn case you missed it on Techpoint Africa\n\nTechpoint Awards 2021: Nominate your favourite startups, influencers, and investors.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, October 6, 2021, the BBC Insider Series hosted a few players in Africa\u2019s fintech sector during a panel discussion to discuss strides made by the sector to aid innovation and financial inclusion in Africa.\n\nModerated by BBC presenter, Zeinab Badawi, the panel had Olugbenga Agboola, founder and CEO of Flutterwave, Usoro Usoro, CEO, Y\u2019ello Digital Financial Services, MTN\u2019s fintech subsidiary, Bola Asiru, Principal/Divisional Lead, sub-Saharan Africa for Mastercard Advisors, and Yasmin Masithela, Managing Executive, Transactional Banking, Absa Corporate and Investment Banking.\n\nThe virtual event focused on fintech\u2019s allure to investors, the benefits Africans derive from fintech start-ups, partnerships between banks and fintech startups, and the role of regulators in the industry.\n\nDiscussing fintech\u2019s attractiveness to investors, the panelists were unanimous in their agreement that the scale of opportunity available to players in the fintech industry was a big factor in why investors are taken in by fintech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Mastercard Foundation, as of 2017, about 43% of people living in sub-Saharan Africa were financially included. This presents a huge opportunity for investors and entrepreneurs willing to look beyond the myriad of challenges that they are sure to face to build solutions.\n\nHowever, for Usoro, beyond the scale, the unserved segment of the market represents a huge opportunity as well. \u201cWhen we look at the market segment, you look at a lot of people that are unserved and when you look at the served segment, they\u2019re still lots of people that have not adopted the services. So it\u2019s both scale and the fact that a lot of people are still unserved that makes the market very attractive.\u201d\n\nWith the speed of innovation and execution exhibited by fintech, arguments have been made regarding fintech\u2019s potential to replace traditional banks. However, Agboola disagreed with that view, arguing that he sees a situation where fintech complement the works that banks do and vice versa, advocating for partnerships between banks and fintech.\n\nEven with the gains recorded, there is still a long way to go for fintech to plug the gaps in financial inclusion in Africa. For this Usoro argued that fintech in addition to providing a huge opportunity for investors also do good in the communities where they operate. \u201cIt\u2019s commercially attractive to investors but it also does some social good.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cWith the kind of services that we offer to customers, whether it\u2019s those micro-loans that enable SMEs to access inventory on daily basis, a lot of these services actually transform the lives of our customers.\u201d He added that with innovations in USSD technology and the adoption of agent banking networks, fintech are able to make it easier for most users to access financial services.\n\nDeepening financial inclusion is high on the agenda of Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank and Y\u2019ello Digital Financial Services has been playing its part in helping the apex realize this goal. With its wide network of over 150,000 MoMo agents, the organization offers financial services to customers.\n\nCustomers can pay bills, deposit and withdraw cash, as well as purchase data and airtime from agents. Through partnerships with over 40 banks and financial institutions in the country, customers can access funds in their accounts without using an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) in a secure manner.\n\nWith 54 countries in Africa, providing financial services to users comes with lots of regulatory hurdles in each country. However, startups need to build services for users regardless. Usoro stated that being able to build solutions that allow for these differences could fix these challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt the technology and fintech level, the ability for us to build an interoperable switch to allow multi-currencies, multi-wallets, to speak to each other seamlessly may be one of the things we need to do to fix that hurdle.\u201d\n\nSome may argue that there are too many players in Africa\u2019s fintech sector but with the scale of the problem, there might be a need for more players to throw their hats in the ring to solve some of the problems.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "The real rate of return on Nigerian assets has been negative for years, and even though it is now narrowing, it is not happening fast enough for some investors.\n\nWhile the investment return on Nigeria\u2019s one-year treasury bill was 7.35 percent in the month of September, inflation rate was 16.63 percent. That leaves Nigeria\u2019s real rate of return, which is the difference between the expected return on investment of an asset and rate of inflation, at -9.28 percent.\n\nThat is down by more than 500 basis points compared with the -14.47 percent level it was in January 2021.\n\nInvestors are taking note of the shrinking negative real return but are still holding out on Nigerian assets amid higher returns in other markets from Egypt to Kenya.\n\n\u201cIt is happening at a pace too slow,\u201d a fund manager based in South Africa said about the collapsing negative real returns in Nigeria. \u201cThe question is why invest in Nigeria if I can be guaranteed higher returns elsewhere? Nigeria is not as competitive if the real rate of return stays this way,\u201d the fund manager said.\n\nNigeria is in need of foreign investments, portfolio and direct, as it seeks to breathe life into its embattled currency and restore investor confidence in the economy.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria\u2019s foreign portfolio investment slides 3-year low on FX crisis\n\nA positive real rate of return is one of the factors that can help Nigeria attract foreign portfolio investment, which it has been lacking since 2020.\n\nForeign portfolio investments in Nigeria fell 77.4 percent in the first quarter of 2021 to $974 million, according to data by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nSome analysts are of the view that the negative real return in Nigeria will narrow further on the back of declining inflation.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that the negative real return will narrow further largely because we expect inflation to continue to moderate downward, partly due to moderation in food inflation on the back of the harvest season, as well as the high base effect from last year,\u201d Tajudeen Ibrahim, head of Research and Strategy at Chapel Hill Denham, said.\n\n\u201cFor investors to see a positive rate of return in Nigeria, it will be dependent on inflation. This is because it looks more like a compelling factor for a positive real rate of return than an increase in NTB interest rate,\u201d Ibrahim said.\n\nThe last transaction auction in September showed that investors\u2019 appetite for the longer 364-day bill remained higher than the 91-day and 182-day bills. The 364-day bill with a higher interest rate was oversubscribed by N57.61 billion, while shorter 91-day and 282-day bills were oversubscribed by a combined N1.75 billion.\n\nThe CBN offered to raise N106.37 billion through the 364-day Treasury bill but investors said they were willing to invest more with N166.32 billion. The apex bank later raised N108.71 billion, N57.61 billion more than the initial offer.\n\nThe CBN also planned to raise N2.26 billion for the shorter 91-day bill, investors said they were willing to subscribe with N5.47 billion. The apex bank eventually issued N4.61 billion, with N2.35 billion worth of unsuccessful bids.\n\nMeanwhile, investors were willing to bid with N2.95 billion for the N3.24 billion offered for the 182-day bill, N290 million less than what the CBN had offered. The apex bank was able to raise N2.09 billion, N1.15 billion less than its initial offer.\n\nPaul Uzum, head of Securities Trading in Planet Capital Limited, believes that the devaluation of the Maria and high inflation influenced investors\u2019 request for premium during the auction, which led to increase in interest rate.\n\n\u201cAmid the devaluation of currency and high inflation, you expect investors to ask for a premium, a rate higher than what they got before, so they can have something closer to a positive real return,\u201d Paul said.\n\nA Lagos-based fixed income analyst said further narrowing of the real returns for investors through the Treasury bill might not be feasible because of the fluctuation in the Nigeria Treasury Bill (NTB) rates.\n\n\u201cWhere the NTB rates will go, no one can tell. At the beginning of the year, it was expected that yields would go up but it reduced,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Is Nigeria winning war on terror?",
          "text": "Last week, a colleague whose daughter was posted to Jigawa State, North West geo-political zone of the country, for the mandatory one year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), was apprehensive.\n\nHe wondered how the young lady would make it to Jigawa under the climate of insecurity in Nigeria. He decided to fly her to Kano, and then got the assistance of a friend of his who works with the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Kano to arrange for her movement to Jigawa.\n\nAccording to him, when they got to the airport in Lagos, Friday morning, they met a number of other prospective corps members going to the same state.\n\nToday, parents are spending their scarce resources to ensure the safety of their children, unlike many years ago when it used to be fun to travel by road.\n\nIt is unimaginable the trauma many families without resources to fly their children are going through nowadays.\n\nLast Monday, October 18, 2021, two prospective members of the NYSC from Benue State, were reportedly kidnapped by bandits in Zamfara on their way to Kebbi State.\n\nOn a daily basis, Nigerians witness gruesome killings of their fellow citizens; unknown gunmen are on rampage, bandits have taken over some states and Boko Haram has intensified its onslaught, conquering more territories and challenging the sovereignty of Nigeria.\n\nThis persisting ugly state of affairs across the country is forcing many to ask, \u201cIs Nigeria winning the terror war?\u201d\n\nIt is worrisome that Nigeria, the supposedly African giant that led others and fought successful ECOMOG wars, has spent over \u20a66 trillion on security without making much headway in the last decade.\n\nWith a $2.07 billion gross military spending in 2015, estimated $1.72 billion defence budget in 2016, about $1.62 billion in 2017, $2.04 billion in 2018, an estimate of $1.8 billion in 2019 and an estimate of $1.2 billion in 2020, the country cannot point to what it has achieved with the allocations as insecurity has taken a deadlier level.\n\nDespite the huge expenditure on defence without result, the Nigerian Air Force took an allocation of N31.97 billion, the largest share of the Ministry of Defence\u2019s total Capital Expenditure Ceiling of N120.04 billion for 2021, the Nigerian Army followed with N27.87 billion, while the Navy got N12.04 billion.\n\nConsidering the scores that are reportedly killed every day, more hostage takings by bandits, open killings by gunmen, more towns taken by Boko Haram and even attack of the army in their barracks, Sam Ajanaku Onikoyi, a Nigerian historian and Commonwealth researcher based in Brussels, lamented that Nigeria is losing the terror war and has refused to seek for collaborations with foreign partners that have successfully dealt with insecurity in their countries.\n\nRead Also: Insecurity costs Nigeria $40.6bn worth of investments in 1 year\n\n\u201cWhat more evidence do we need to know that Nigeria is losing the war against terrorism when what appear on international news networks about Nigeria are killings and violence? Some of my partners here keep asking what the government is doing and why the relations of those killed are keeping quiet,\u201d he said.\n\nHe observed that it appears there is compromise somewhere and the government and the military cannot execute the war.\n\n\u201cI was in Nigeria when Olusegun Obasanjo, former president, sent soldiers to Odi, Bayelsa State, in Niger Delta and they razed a whole village and nothing happened. If government is serious and engages the military properly, Nigeria will win the war against terrorism,\u201d Onikoyi said.\n\nTalking from experience, Ifewodor Ogala, a retired Navy officer, cleared the air on the fight against terrorism, saying it is not huge budgetary expenditure or heavy weapons that fight wars, but soldiers with the right frame of mind.\n\n\u201cIf you spend our entire national budget on acquiring the best fighter jets, you need to make the boys happy to fly the jets or some unhappy pilots will crash it or even surrender it to the enemies. We have seen that happen in recent times,\u201d Ogala said.\n\nThe retired Niger Delta-born naval officer further explained that the war on terrorism can be with fewer weapons if government plays its part and allows soldiers to play theirs.\n\n\u201cCounter orders have ruined some of the achievements made in the fight against terrorism. We need to be on the same ship, under one captain and move to the same direction in order to win the terror war,\u201d he advised.\n\nWhile also regretting that Nigeria is losing the terror war, Chijioke .J. Umelahi, a former Abia State lawmaker, blame the persisting insecurity on corruption and lack of accountability from those appointed to execute defence budget, especially the military, which seems unquestionable and untouchable.\n\n\u201cIt is expected that having severally allocated huge funds to defence without results, the government should query the Ministry of Defence and the military or even stop the allocations. We as citizens, who die daily in the hands of these terrorists, should wake up, summon our governors, representatives in the National Assembly and demand action. We can protest if possible because the political elites are safe, their families and investments are safe too. We are the one suffering and the ones that need to make the noise,\u201d Umelahi said.\n\nThe aggrieved former lawmaker and legal practitioner noted that the anti-graft agency is not beaming its searchlight on defence and military spending, and will not also look for the corrupt politicians who helped to influence the approval of the huge allocations for defence, which seemed to be shared, going by the ineffectiveness of the fight despite the huge budget.\n\n\u201cHow do we know that the huge defence budgets do not end in private pockets, who monitors the military, can\u2019t the public call for probe of the funds because government cannot keep spending tax payers\u2019 money or foreign loans on security that is, obviously, not going to improve with the look of things,\u201d he lamented.\n\nHowever, with the facts and worries expressed by the observers, it is clear that the country is losing the war on terrorism.\n\nBut they think that the Nigerian government knows what to do to curtail insecurity and until it wakes up to its responsibility, shows political will, amid corresponding actions, the country will keep losing the fight at the risk of its sovereignty and existence.\n\n\u201cIt is saddening to recount how our so-called government of this day has continued to sugar coat banditry, and not spill out the situation report how it is meant to be. By this time, these groups should have been declared terrorists and threats to our Nation, but the reverse is the case as we continually see them enjoying that freedom of continued threats to endanger the lives of the masses.\n\n\u201cBy all parameters available, it is glaring that the government is losing the war against insecurity. We live in fear of the unknown every minute. Our travelling routes are no longer safe to ply as the day goes by. The most annoying part is how these bandits are addressed by our security operatives and the Government,\u201d Kayode Kehinde, a Lagos-based political analyst, said.\n\nSome stakeholders have equally carpeted state governors for not doing enough to tackle the situation in their respective states, despite huge budgetary allocation for security vote.\n\nAlthough, the governors have always argued that it is not as huge as being perceived, they have refused to disclose the correct amount to Nigerians, which has only sustained the suspicion.\n\nAmid the blame, the governors have maintained that the security arrangement in the country as enshrined in the Constitution had practically rendered them handicapped and incapable of solving the security challenges in their domain despite being the chief security officers of their states.\n\nExperts say that the country requires a multi-stakeholder approach to deal with the situation; they are of the opinion that not only has the continued spate of insecurity threatened the very fabric of national integration in the country and created the ecology of fear, disquiet and anxiety, it has also meted a deadly blow to industrial development and economy growth.\n\n\u201cIn as much as some of these governors have shown lack of capacity to solve the problems affecting our people, we can also say that there are some hindrances.\n\n\u201cThat is why some of us are calling for restructuring of the country; right now the police commissioners are not answerable to them. I mean, the governors can give them orders and they get a call from Abuja not to obey them. I think this is a step backward in the security fight,\u201d Femi Akinwunmi, public affairs analyst, said.\n\nKehinde further stated that the worsening insecurity and government\u2019s helplessness was an indication that Nigeria was a failed state.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cA failed state is not difficult to define \u2013 it is one that is unable to provide security to its people, and this is what we are currently experiencing in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe train system which was receiving some worth appraisal has now become the target of bandits, meaning no safer means of moving within Nigeria if not by air. And what happens when you cannot afford to fly or your destination has to be ply by road?\n\n\u201cThe way out right now from this turbulence is for the government to take up its responsibilities taking out tribalism or any form of ethnic bias. Let us call a spade a spade.\n\n\u201cDeclare bandits and kidnappers as terrorists tighten all security processes and call for a state of emergency on all prone routes to terrorist/banditry/kidnappers attacks.\u201d\n\nChekwas Okorie, a founding member of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), said the security situation in the North-East had degenerated into war, adding that the government should consider and give priority to community and state policing urgently.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe security situation now comes in two different categories, what we have in North East is outright war. They should treat it as such. There should be more deployment of troops. There is a war situation in the North; you can see the attack of trains in Kaduna State last week. Ordinarily, you would have expected that the ground troop should be moved in and clear the terrorists out.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we consider state and community policing as a matter of national emergence. People don\u2019t have confidence in the police, most state actors have taken the police, and the ordinary man pays for their service when they need them.\n\n\u201cThe government should act; the security vote is enough to keep our environment safe, especially with the kind of money they collect.\u201d\n\nLast Thursday, Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State, called on the Federal Government to declare bandits as terrorists to allow the Nigerian military deal with them according to international law.\n\nThe governor said that between July and September, bandits killed over 343 persons in the state, while 830 others were kidnapped.\n\n\u201cWe have written letters to the Federal Government since 2017, asking for this declaration because it is the declaration that will allow the Nigerian military to attack and kill these bandits without any major consequences in international law.\n\n\u201cSo, we support the resolution by the National Assembly and we are going to follow up with a letter of support, for the Federal Government to declare these bandits and insurgents as terrorists, so that they will be fair game for our military.\n\n\u201cThis is the view of the Kaduna State Government,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernor El-Rufai\u2019s outcry came three days after President Muhammadu Buhari had said that insecurity in the country was trending downwards, emphasising that narrative of rising insecurity is inaccurate.\n\nAccording to the President, \u201cWhile there is work to do, the men and women in uniform who are helping the nation to achieve this goal, desire our collective appreciation and encouragement to do even more.\n\n\u201cThe whole country and its mass communications systems have a duty in this regard.\u201d\n\nWhile Buhari said in his message to Moslem at Id El Maulud that insecurity in the country was receding, report emerged that a woman in Nimbo, Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area of Enugu State, was butchered by AK-47 wielding herdsmen in her farm.\n\nThe report said the woman was in the farm together with her daughter when the herdsmen swooped on them. While the daughter escaped unhurt, the woman was short at as she tried to run.\n\nThe assailant reportedly used their machete and chopped off her two hands. They did not stop at that, they smashed her head with a hard object.\n\nTo those in that community, and particularly to the daughter that witnessed the horror, they would not buy into any narrative that insecurity is receding.\n\nReports also have it that bandits attacked GUO Luxury Bus in Edo and kidnapped many passengers.\n\nThe Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal a few days ago, lamented the upscaling insecurity in his state. The media was awash recently that bandits attacked some villages in the state, killing over 30 people in a single swoop.\n\nWednesday, the Nigerian Railways Corporation (NRC) said explosion occurred on its passenger train on Abuja-Kaduna line. Passengers escaped by a whisker.\n\nA Lagos-based businessman, who spoke with BusinessDay SUNDAY, lamented what he described as an \u201cugly development.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cYou know, some of us are now patronising the train services, on that axis, since the roads became death traps on account of bandits\u2019 activities. That these terrorists are now targeting the train is a dangerous development. I hope all the security architecture would be activated to ensure this is nipped in the bud.\u201d",

          "text": "Although he has been reluctant to declare bandits operating in Northern Nigeria as terrorists, President Buhari said Sunday that \u201cthey are essentially no different to Boko Haram\u201d in some areas.\n\nMr Buhari\u2019s spokesperson, Garba Shehu, said this in response to the UK based news magazine, The Economist, which reported that the security situation in Nigeria was getting worse under Mr Buhari.\n\n\u201cBut this too the Economist inaccurately described: \u201cbandits\u201d who have the resources and technology to shoot down a military fighter jet are not bandits at all \u2013 but rather highly organised crime syndicates with huge resources and weaponry. Yet they are essentially no different to Boko Haram in this regard who are now cornered,\u201d Mr Shehu wrote in his response that he sent to PREMIUM TIMES.\n\nMany Nigerians including the Nigerian Senate and Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai have asked the president to declare the bandits as terrorists.\n\nThe bandits, several armed groups operating mainly in North-west and North-central Nigeria, have killed or kidnapped thousands of people since Mr Buhari assumed office.\n\nIn his response, Mr Shehu acknowledged the various security challenges facing the country but said President Buhari was addressing them.\n\n\u201cThe Economist is correct: Nigeria faces multiple threats. They confluence now not because of this government; but on the contrary, it is this government which is addressing them concurrently, and simultaneously \u2013 when no other prior administration sought to adequately address even a single one,\u201d the spokesperson wrote.\n\nRead the full statement by Mr Shehu below.\n\nSTATE HOUSE PRESS RELEASE\n\nECONOMIST\u2019S FLAWED, ANTI-NIGERIA COVER: PRESIDENT BUHARI IS STRENGTHENING AFRICA\u2019S DEMOCRACY\n\n*Resilience and fortitude of patriotic Nigerians will see the nation through the difficult times\n\nThe Economist is correct: Nigeria faces four key threats to the stability and prosperity of the nation \u2013 namely: ISWAP/Boko Haram terrorism in the North-East; kidnapping and crime in the North-West; herder-farmer disputes in the central belt; and the delusions of IPOB terrorists in the South-East.\n\nThe Economist is also accurate to state that they have come to a head under President Buhari and the All Progressives Congress, (APC) administration. Yet they do so, because for so long, under previous administrations, whether military or democratic, tough decisions have been ducked, and challenges never fully met \u2013 with the effect of abetting these dangers and allowing them all to fester and grow. Today, all four threats are being fought concurrently and it is only this President\u2019s administration which has finally had the will and determination to confront them.\n\nThe Buhari administration has sought to push back terrorism which has been a threat for more than two decades since the first emergence of Boko Haram. It is only the Buhari administration that has now sought to intervene against the kidnapping and banditry that has been a simmering threat for far longer. It is only this President\u2019s government which has taken on IPOB, the violent terrorist group which bombs police stations and offices of security agencies, while also threatening those who break their Monday-sit-ins whilst claiming the mantle of forebears who half a century ago fought a civil war. And it is only the Buhari leadership which has sought \u2013 ever, in over one hundred years \u2013 to identify the root causes of the herder-farmer clashes and find durable solutions.\n\nThe forms may have altered, and the threats posed by each may have waxed and waned, but what has been constant is that administration after administration since independence \u2013 whether military or democratic \u2013 none sought to fully address these threats to Nigeria as President Buhari\u2019s government does now.\n\nToday, the military is engaged in almost all the states of Nigeria because the President has insisted upon addressing these decade-after-decade-long issues during his time in office.\n\nIn the North, Boko Haram members \u2013 many of whom now fight under the breakaway banner of Islamic State\u2019s West Africa Province (ISWAP) \u2013 have been pushed back. At the start of the President\u2019s tenure, Boko Haram was launching attacks across the majority of the country \u2013 including in southern states and Lagos. Today they are cornered and confined along with their ISWAP compatriots in our country\u2019s outermost fringes of the border, unable to spread further.\n\nIn the South-East, IPOB \u2013 which the Economist rightly describes as \u201cdelusional\u201d \u2013 the arrest and present trial of the terrorist leader of the group is the beginning of its demise. The President\u2019s administration is redoubling efforts to have IPOB rightfully designated as a terrorist group by our allies outside of Nigeria \u2013 an act which will collapse their ability to transact gains from crime and extortion in foreign currencies. It is important to remind the Economist and the global media that this group\u2019s aggression and widespread presence on social media does not reflect their public support, for which they have none: all elected governors, all elected politicians and all elected state assemblies in the South-East \u2013 which IPOB claim to be part of their fantasy kingdom \u2013 reject them completely.\n\nThe only government of Nigeria which has ever sought a solution to the centuries-old herder-farmer disputes of the central belt is President Buhari\u2019s administration. The Federal ranches programme, launched shortly after the President\u2019s re-election is the first of its kind \u2013 and it is working: during the last 12 months clashes have significantly reduced. The government now calls on State governors to have the imagination to join forces with the Federal administration and expand this programme by making available state lands for those interested, now that its effectiveness has been demonstrated.\n\nThe Economist opinionated and reported on banditry and kidnapping in the North-West. While this has been simmering for generations, it is the newest of the organized threats Nigeria faces to her stability. But this too the Economist inaccurately described: \u201cbandits\u201d who have the resources and technology to shoot down a military fighter jet are not bandits at all \u2013 but rather highly organised crime syndicates with huge resources and weaponry. Yet they are essentially no different to Boko Haram in this regard who are now cornered. It will take time, but the President is unwavering in his determination to collapse this challenge to public order.\n\nThe Economist is correct: Nigeria faces multiple threats. They confluence now not because of this government; but on the contrary, it is this government which is addressing them concurrently, and simultaneously \u2013 when no other prior administration sought to adequately address even a single one. That is the difference between what has gone before and what we have now. It is why the President and his party were re-elected with\u2019 an increased majority in national elections two years ago.\n\nGarba Shehu\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President\n\n(Media and Publicity)\n\nOctober 24, 2021",

As long as he is in detention our individual businesses do not matter so much because he is suffering for us all and we can\u2019t abandon him.\u201d Powerful said.\n\nHe further noted that, \u201cThis one week sit-at-home is also to let our oppressors understand that we are not going to tolerate any plan to torment or abandon our leader in DSS custody through frivolous court adjournments.\n\n\u201cAny plans to subject him to trauma in detention through long adjournments while real terrotists and mass murderers are having fun across the country cannot fly. Nnamdi Kanu must be freed because he committed no crime.\n\n\u201cAsking for referendum so that Biafrans will decide whether or not they want to continue as part of Nigeria is no crime.

          "text": "Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, has vowed to pursue and recapture all inmates who escaped from the Abolongo custodial centre of the Nigeria Correctional Service (NCoS) in Oyo State on Friday night when the facility came under attack by gunmen.\n\nThe minister gave the assurance during an inspection visit to the facility on Sunday in Oyo, Oyo State.\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019m assuring Nigerians that the Federal Government will pursue not just those who attacked our facility, but those who have escaped lawful custody.\n\n\u201cThe attack was unconscionable. I commend officers of the Nigeria Correctional Service and other members of sister security agencies who provided perimeter security for our facility for fighting gallantly and holding the fort before the attackers were able to gain access to the awaiting trial section of the facility. However, those who escaped are already being pursued. Some have been rearrested, many more will still be captured.\u201d\n\nGiving more details about those who escaped, Aregbesola noted that 446 out of 907 escapees have been recaptured, while 69 never left the facility.\n\n\u201cAs at the last count, 446 of the escapees have been recaptured, leaving 392 still at large. We want to assure Nigerians that the service have an updated database of the escapees which includes their biometrics. We are sharing the database with all security agencies in the country, including the Interpol, so those who escaped our recapture efforts can be nabbed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cTo those on the run, be assured you have nowhere to hide. You can run, but you can\u2019t hide. We\u2019ll fish you out! We are publishing details of those who escaped in the mass media so the public can assist in that effort,\u201d the minister reiterated.\n\nOn the effort to rebuild the damaged part of the facility, the Minister noted that he has directed the NCoS, to immediately begin remediation work.\n\n\u201cI have instructed the CG of NCoS to immediately begin the reconstruction of the damaged parts of the building. We hope to make the facility better secured and more habitable for the inmates.\n\nAlso speaking during the inspection, the Controller General of the Nigeria Correctional Service, NCoS, Haliru Nababa, noted that so far, the service has successfully prevented internal jailbreaks in all her facilities.\n\n\u201cThe NCoS have so far prevented internal jailbreaks in the country. What we have reoccurring in recent times are external attacks on our facilities. We have been retraining our officers not just on securing those in lawful custody, but prevent external attacks.\n\n\u201cWe are collaborating with other security agencies in the country to make such attacks near impossible and where they do occur, the attackers will not live to regret it,\u201d the CG stated.\n\nOn the instruction given by the Minister of Interior to immediately begin remediation work on the facility, CG Nababa noted that work has begun already.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, workers are already on site fixing damaged doors, broken windows and mounting walls. Before the end of today, work would have been completed on it,\u201d Nababa stated.\n\nBefore leaving Oyo, the minister\u2019s entourage paid a courtesy visit to the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III, and commiserated with him over the attack of the FG facility in his town.\n\n\u201cWe are here to commiserate with your majesty over the attack in your town less than 72hours ago. Oyo is known as a peaceful town and with the measures we are putting in place, you can be assured nothing of such will take place again,\u201d Ogbeni Aregbesola assured the monarch.",

          "text": "by Joy Mbachi\n\nSen. Andy Uba, the candidate of All Progressives Congress, APC in the November 6 Anambra Governorship election, has said that he said that he wept and was deeply touched by the poor road network he saw during his campaign visits to some communities in the state.\n\nUba in a statement signed by his Director Media and Publicity, Mr Afam Ogene on Sunday in Awka listed some of the communities where the condition of the roads brought tears to his eyes to include Ojoto and Ogidi in Idemili South and Idemili North Local Government Areas of the state.\n\n\u201cFor us to get to Ojoto and Ogidi communities respectively, we had to traverse several communities \u2013 all sitting on good roads built around 15 years ago.\n\n\u201cBut since we flagged off our local government campaigns in Onitsha North and South federal constituency, to Anambra East and West, Oyi and Ayamelum, it has been one hellish movement after another, leaving me with so many questions.\n\nUba said the culture of poor quality road construction across the state must stop as the badly done roads have cost the state huge losses as funds which ought to be channeled to other sectors, would now be used to rehabilitate roads.\n\n\u201cImmediately my government is inaugurated, by the Grace of God, we would face, head on, the issues of potholes in the state alongside erosion, and subsequently build quality roads that will stand the test of longevity.\n\nAndy Uba praised the ingenuity of Senator Chris Ngige, the APC leader in the state, for building durable road networks that have lasted beyond 15 years, and at a time when the revenue of the state was still meager.\n\nThe APC governorship candidate assured the electorate that he would return the state to the glory days of good connectivity in road network across all 21 local government areas (LGAs) as was experienced under Ngige.\n\n\u201cThese communities were reference points when you talk of good network of roads in south east under Gov.

          "title": "INVESTIGATION: PoS transactions from 307,000 machines hit 15.67trn in 4 years in Nigeria",
          "text": "Transactions on Point of Sale (PoS) in Nigeria have hit N15.67 trillion in the last five fiscal years, Blueprint can authoritatively report.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) introduced the PoS system and agent banking in 2013 to achieve financial inclusion and develop a cashless economy.\n\nHowever, this novel system of business transactions was not well embraced until recently when Nigerians troop to the PoS points to facilitate their businesses.\n\nTransactions\n\nBlueprint gathered that over 146.3 million transactions were made in 2017, with N1.4 trillion as total transactions. In 2018, the worth of PoS transaction rose to N2.3 trillion after a total of 285.9 million transactions were recorded. In 2019, PoS transactions increased by 53.42 per cent to 438.61 million transactions with the total value increasing by 37.97 per cent to N3. 21 trillion. In 2020, transactions rose by 49.51 per cent to 655.75 million as the total value increased by 47.50 per cent to N4.73 trillion.\n\nAvailable data has also shown that point of sale transactions carried out in the first eight months of 2021 stood at N4.06 trillion, representing a 45% increase compared to N2.81 trillion recorded in the corresponding period of 2020. This is based on data obtained from the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS).\n\nAccording to the data, PoS transactions hit its highest levels for any eight-month period, increasing by 44.8% and 108% compared to N2.81 trillion and N1.96 trillion recorded in the similar period of 2020 and 2019 respectively.\n\nSimilarly, the volume of PoS transactions recorded between January and August 2021 stood at 619.3 million, increasing by 61.8% compared to 382.9 million recorded in the corresponding period of 2020. It is worth noting that a total of 686,577 PoS terminals were deployed nationwide as of August 2021, representing an 84.4% increase compared to 372,333 recorded as of the same period of 2020.\n\nThe value of POS transactions in the country for the month of August 2021 stood at N504.88 billion, lower than N554.67 billion recorded in the previous month, while it rose marginally compared to N503.91 billion carried out in June 2021.\n\nA total of N4.06 trillion worth of POS transactions have been carried out so far in this year, making a grand total of N15.67 trillion.\n\nIn terms of volume, 146.27 million, 285.89 million, 438.61 million, and 655.75 million transactions were carried out in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively, while 619.28 million transactions have so far been recorded by August in the current fiscal year.\n\nThe figures indicate an increased interest in the use of PoS as a transaction method.\n\n307,000 PoS machines\n\nAlthough the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) data shows there were about 307,000 PoS machines in Nigeria as at March 2021, only167,000 are active.\n\nSimilarly, there are 30,000 Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and over 6,000 bank branches, according to the organization.\n\nWhile agent banking promotes financial inclusion, it might not usher the nation into a cashless economy, experts have noted.\n\nIronically, a random survey of several PoS points shows cash withdrawals make up 90% of their daily transactions.\n\nDigital banking\n\nDigital banking is the new route that financial service providers and regulators are travelling to achieve better results, increase transaction speed and security.\n\nToday\u2019s reality demands that real-time payments and banking capabilities should be available whenever and wherever they are needed by customers.\n\nThe road to seamless digital banking and improved access to financial services is long and challenging in Nigeria no doubt.\n\nImproving financial inclusion, access to credit and getting transactions done at the lowest possible cost are challenges banks and other financial institutions are grappling with.\n\nStill, banks and other financial institutions with eyes on the future are taking advantage of digital banking that is defining the sector\u2019s successes and reach.\n\nRise in PoS transactions\n\nBank customers are also not left behind, as majority are now thinking and acting digital.\n\nThere has been rise in PoS, ATM, mobile and internet banking activation and usage across different segments of the economy, including among the unbanked at the base of the society.\n\nHowever, there are still challenges facing the sector, some of which the PoS payment agents have eased when customers don\u2019t get paid at the ATM points.\n\nThe PoS became handy for Nigerians, especially during the coronavirus pandemic era, where they needed to reduce the number of people gathering in the banking halls.\n\nIt is even more convenient for people to use the PoS by paying service fee, which people considered as being in order when viewed against the backdrop of the cost of going to the banks to transact similar business.\n\nThe good side\n\nOn the good side of it, some financial experts said it has created jobs for a lot of people, and also liberalised the banking sector by ensuring people no longer gather in the banking halls which often results in waste of man-hours.\n\nDespite the fact that the ATMs were still working, some customers still use the PoS, depending on the sense of urgency of their need and services.\n\nInsecurity may also be responsible for the proliferation of the PoS business as explained by Mr. Tunde Mabawonku, the chief financial officer of Wema Bank.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe insecurity in the country has its own challenges. Since 2018, we had almost six robbery attacks. In Iju-Itaogbolu, Osun state. we were burgled; we suffered major loss. For us, the money lost was not the problem, but the loss of lives, where they killed staff; killed customers. This is what you can\u2019t get back. Some of the locations where we have closed down, once there is a business justification, we will go back.\n\n\u201cFor example, Igbara Oke, we are reopening it; we suffered robbery attack but we are going back. Iyin Ekiti, we also had robbery attack, we are going back. Okuku in Osun state, we had robbery attack. We had a meeting. We said, let things calm down a bit. So, we take justification, look at it and determine when to go back.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we try to do is turn to technology through agency banking, through other means, that, at least, get the community transacting pending when we see that the business is justified, then we will come and rebuild the branch.\u201d\n\nPreference over ATM\n\nMany bank customers across the country have complained of the difficulty in trying to withdraw cash from the ATMs.\n\nIn some cases, they said the machines often come up to say they were empty and had no money to dispense.\n\nTimothy Alkali, a civil servant, lamented that due to the inefficiency of the ATM platform, he recently lost N25,000 as he attempted to use the PoS machine around his abode in Nyanya.\n\nAlkali said he was debited while the cash was not given to him and that he had to visit his bank to retrieve his cash.\n\nHe further said, up till date, he was yet to be credited one month after.\n\nAnother ATM user, Stanley Egbodo in Aso Pada, who spoke on his experience, complained that \u201cif one is not careful, the card may be compromised because some PoS operators can easily copy a customer\u2019s details in the process of one trying to withdraw cash. I narrowly escaped being swindled.\u201d.\n\nBut in their separate reactions, some ATM users namely, Abiodun and Mohammed said, the ATMs were being starved of fund by bankers to the advantage of PoS because \u201dthe bankers are behind the PoS.\u201d\n\nAbiodun said: \u201cThe bankers are not fair to us. The ATM charges low while PoS, though convenient, charges higher. The bank staff do this so they can get their profit from the pay centres.\u201d\n\nSharing similar view, Mohammed said \u201cthe bankers are ripping us off. They are making a lot of money from PoS, and it is therefore convenient for them to starve the ATMs of fund.\u201d\n\nConspiracy theory\n\nFrustrated, many customers blamed the proliferation of agent banking as responsible for this, while others alleged conspiracy between the banks and its regulator, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nBut dismissing the allegation, its Director, Corporate Communications, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, described the conspiracy theory as preposterous.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is highly preposterous for anyone to say that CBN connived with banks to deprive people of their money. The primary purpose for which ATMs were introduced is to ease the sufferings of Nigerians and to make banking easier and convenient.\u201d\n\nHowever, the apex bank said it was still investigating the matter and the results would be made known.\n\nBanker faults CBN\u2019s claim\n\nBut contrary to the CBN\u2019s position, a banker with one of the new generation banks in the country, who pleaded anonymity, disclosed that it was a way to make extra income for bankers and others.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is not a secret, the bank I work for is aware, they offer me cash and I, in turn, make money for myself and the bank. We noticed people these days don\u2019t have patience to queue at the ATM, they prefer the PoS, which is fast and easy; that is why we get assistance from our banks. They(banks) make profit from every transaction.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s for convenience\u2019\n\nExperts in the nation\u2019s financial Industry have said the increase in PoS patronage was due to convenience and the frustration experienced by customers at ATM points.\n\nChief Research Officer Investdata Consulting Ltd, Lagos, Ambrose Omorodion said the use of PoS seems to be more attractive or convenience for Nigerians because it promotes the cashless policy of the CBN.\n\nHe said with the use of genuine PoS, bank customers were less exposed to robbery attack and misplacement of money.\n\nHe said: \u201cATM is good for quick cash but its exposure to attack is high, even at the point of withdrawals. Though there are some fraudulent activities carried out by PoS operators or their owners when customers withdraw money, but those frauds can be checked or control.\u201d\n\nAdmitting that no system is perfect, he said with the advent of technology, CBN can further put measures in place to track the fraudulent activities among PoS operators.\n\nA financial analyst, Mr Chudi Okagbue, said bank customers patronised PoS regularly because they were faced with the ATM challenges of not being been able to dispense cash.\n\nHe said:\u201cAs you want to withdraw money through ATM in some cases, the machines will signal no money to dispense or there is no network.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe issue of no money or no network while using ATM is frustrating, especially for those that do not have alternative means to get cash or if it happened in an area where you will not have access to banking halls.\n\n\u201cIt is better for one to do transaction with PoS as their operators are staying within the environment we live, so going to the bank or ATM is another stress and waste of time because the way PoS is booming, some financial institutions acquire the PoS machine and engage vendors to work for them and remit to the managers.\u201d\n\nHe stated that apart from banks, there were so many outlets whose business it is to acquire many PoS machines and give out to willing vendors to operate and bring returns.\n\n\u201cIf the acquisition of POS is from banks alone, it might not be everywhere as it is today,\u201d he added.\n\nLike ATMs, Okagbue said, PoS operators also faced challenge of network services, \u201cbut because most of their customers are people they know one-on-one, they can do the transaction later.\u201d\n\nOn PoS locations\n\nHowever, in Abuja, most PoS operators said they avoid situating their kiosks close to any ATM machine because many bank customers actually prefer using the ATM to patronising them (PoS operators) because of their higher charges.\n\nYohana Sadiq, a PoS operator in Kubwa area of Abuja, said: \u201cWhen you withdraw N10,000 using your ATM card on my PoS, I\u2019ll charge you N150 for that transaction.\n\n\u201cSome customers would say it\u2019s too high but the banks also charge us on many fronts. The profit margin is extremely low. Most times, I don\u2019t keep more than N300,000 cash with me at any given time because of security and demand.\u201d\n\nMonday Akpan, another PoS operator, said most people now dread ATMs because their cards could be swallowed by faulty machines and they also risk being attacked by thieves.\n\n\u201cThese days, some ATMs do not have sufficient cash. We are now hot cakes,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Moses Akin, many PoS operators were funded by bank staff: \u201cI\u2019m aware of about three owned by bankers. They ensure they never run out of cash. But this business is really not lucrative, especially if you\u2019re not in a market environment.\u201d\n\nDowntown Mararaba in Nasarawa state, Priscilla Ayuba, a PoS operator in Aso Kucha, told Blueprint that getting funds from the bank is not difficult because she is an agent.\n\nWhile saying the business is very competitive, she noted that \u201cyou either gain or lose, depending on how you handle it. Sometimes, you do transfer and you may get fake alert and pay the customer, but you may never get credited or when you overpay a customer you lose as well.\u201d\n\nShe pointed out that most PoS were not owned or funded by the banks to starve the ATM platforms, but rather \u201cPoS is taking banking nearer to the people and boosting financial inclusion policy of the CBN.\u201d\n\nAyuba, however, said \u201csome operators were less knowledgeable about the system and how it works, such persons lose money often times and would subsequently close shop.\u201d\n\n\u2018CBN should regulate\u2019\n\nOn his part, Mr. Festus Ogwu, a legal expert, said: \u201cI see that part of these PoS operators is the extension of the private business of the bankers. It is a sort of bringing double interest in the banking transactions.\n\n\u201cAnd in that circumstance, loyalty becomes a question here. Even if anything like that is to be done, it should be properly organised. The CBN has directives, orders and regulations. But it has not taken time to look at that level of operation. The CBN should regulate what goes on in the PoS vendors\u2019 operations. I doubt if CBN has a data of PoS operators in this country.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Elvis Paul, a PoS operator, admitted some bank staff operate PoS business but that they have no right to stock money and starve ATM machines.\n\n\u201cFor the question, yes, some banks\u2019 staff really have PoS stands but that\u2019s not to say they have the right to stock money for their PoS and allow the ATM machines of their banks to be starved of funds. It\u2019s totally false and wrong notion for anyone to have that belief.\u201d\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t starve ATMs\u2019\n\nDismissing the allegations, Head, Corporate Communications of Unity Bank, Matthew Obiazikwor, told Blueprint it\u2019s unfounded to say banks starved ATMs of fund to meet PoS\u2019 needs.\n\n\u201cThere is no mechanism or operational process for that to happen. All of them are alternate channels through which customers can access financial services of banks. So, it is not true. They\u2019re not operational reality,\u201d Obiazikwor said.\n\nObiazikwor said the number of customers using the ATM was more, and that the pressure exerted by customers on the cash in the machines, especially at weekends when staffers of the bank won\u2019t be there to reload cash into the machines.\n\nExplaining customers\u2019 preference for ATM, he said, \u201c90 per cent customers will choose the ATM over the PoS because with the ATM you\u2019re dealing directly with your bank and there may be no charges. ATM penetration is somewhat overwhelmed by the population. What is happening is that the uptake of the ATM channel is responsible for the shortage in service rendered.\u201d\n\nSome other bankers believed there could be a conspiracy where those who were supposed to load the ATM machines lodged the cash with their PoS cronies at a fee.\n\nSome even alleged that such funds were always in mint which they sprayed on celebrants at wedding, birthday ceremonies or other forms of celebration as the case may be.\n\n",
          "summary": "In 2019, PoS transactions increased by 53.42 per cent to 438.61 million transactions with the total value increasing by 37.97 per cent to N3.\nSimilarly, the volume of PoS transactions recorded between January and August 2021 stood at 619.3 million, increasing by 61.8% compared to 382.9 million recorded in the corresponding period of 2020.\nA total of N4.06 trillion worth of POS transactions have been carried out so far in this year, making a grand total of N15.67 trillion.\n307,000 PoS machinesAlthough the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) data shows there were about 307,000 PoS machines in Nigeria as at March 2021, only167,000 are active.\nHe said with the use of genuine PoS, bank customers were less exposed to robbery attack and misplacement of money.",

          "text": "\u2026\n\nCommander of a notorious group of bandits terrorising communities in Shiroro local government area of Niger state popularly called Alhaji Na Mata, has reportedly surrendered and handed over three AK47 rifles to the Joint Security Taskforce in Iburo general area of operation.\n\nBlueprint learnt that the commander voluntarily handed over himself and turned in the weapons after suffering devastating defeat in a recent encounter with the security taskforce.\n\nA source from the Iburo community said the commander carried out series of banditry-related attacks in the area before the security taskforce began operation some days ago to clear the bandits.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe Joint Security Task Force recorded this breakthrough at Iburo community during their operation in the area when the commander voluntarily surrendered himself and his weapons to the Joint Security Task Force. He decided to drop his weapons after two of his sons who were also members of his gang were killed during an encounter with the Joint Security Task Force.\u201d\n\nIt was learnt that his group is the third most notorious groups in the area and was responsible for a number of bloody attacks on communities around Shiroro and Munya local government areas.\n\n\u201cAfter the killing of his two children during an operation by the Joint Security Task Force, he decided to repent and surrender his weapons (about three AK 47 riffles) to the security agents,\u201d Blueprint further gathered.\n\nPolice Public Relation Officer (PPRO) in the state, DSP Wasiu Abiodun could not be reached for comment at the time of this report.\n\nIt was however gathered that the ongoing operation by the Joint Security Task Force, comprising local hunters and vigilantes, as well as the conventional security agencies has continued to yield positive results with the killing of scores of bandits in the last one month.\n\nIburo community has remained the epicentre of banditry before the taskforce began operation in the area.\n\nEbonyi\n\nIn a related development, some gunmen in the early hours of Sunday allegedly attacked Nigerian Police Division at Unwana, Afikpo North local government area of Ebonyi state and killed three policemen on duty.\n\nThe gunmen reportedly attacked the division at about 2am, killing one constable and two inspectors in the process.\n\nA source from the area who spoke to Blueprint said the gunmen masked their faces and one of them was killed by the policeman who repelled the attack.\n\n\u201cThey killed 3 policemen, one constable and two inspectors and the police killed one of the gunmen. Nobody knows the identity of the gunmen and Police have taken away their remains.\n\n\u201cThe incident happened around 2 am, nobody knows the route they came from, all we heard was gunshots for about 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, there is no information to know if they destroyed or stole anything from the police station. The men were masked but the one killed had his face unveiled by the police to ascertain his identity. He also had red clothe tied around his waist believing it was a charm,\u201d our source revealed. Spokesperson of the state Police commend, DSP Loveth Odah could not answer call put across to her by one of our reporters as at the time of this report.\n\nEditors want collaboration\n\nMeanwhile, the 17the All Nigerian Editors Conference has called for healthy and harmonious collaboration between the media and security agencies in the fight against insecurity across the country.\n\nThe conference also admitted insecurity was taking a huge toll on societal life and posting negative development indices in several areas.\n\n\u201cThe peace and development, which are germane to further advancement of Nigeria, cannot thrive in times of crises,\u201d the editors said , adding governments at all levels have a huge responsibility to defend, protect and provide for its citizens.\n\nThe positions were contained in a communiqu\u00e9 signed by the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) President Mustapha Isah and General Secretary Iyobosa Uwugiaren at the end of the conference held recently in Abuja, with theme \u201cMedia In Times of Crises: Resolving Conflict, Achieving Consensus.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem of insecurity confronting the country is taking a huge toll on societal life and posting negative development indices in several areas. That the insecurity crises stem from leadership failure that has bedevilled the country for many years\u2019\u2019, the communique stated.\n\nThe conference attended by 350 editors, security chiefs, and other stakeholders, noted: \u201cThere are fears in some quarters that editors and media professionals seem to have taken sides in the raging crises. That journalists and security agents who are first line responders to every flash points appear locked in mutual suspicion.\u201d\n\nThe conference resolved: \u201cGovernments at all levels have a responsibility to defend, protect and provide for its citizens. That agitations for self-determination, which are raging in the South-east, South-west and the South-south regions do not augur well for the unity of the country.\n\n\u201cThe conference called for an end to raging insecurity so that citizens can conduct their normal lives in an atmosphere of peace and concord. That there\u2019s need for healthy and harmonious collaboration between the media and the security agencies in the fight against insecurity.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for security agents to appreciate the role of journalists and media professionals and refrain from anything that will abridge it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conference also advised editors and other media professionals to ensure that they are conflict-sensitive and ensure they do not publish stories that are capable of inflaming ethnic, regional and religious passion, while calling for urgent need to tackle the monster of misinformation and sanitise the media against unprofessional and unethical behaviour.\n\n\u201cThe conference also called on government to support the survival of the media as part of the task of building the nation\u2019s democracy and avoid any acts that will put the media in chains.\n\n\u201cWhile calling on the federal government to confront issues that have given rise to the demands of the different self-determination groups, the conference advised it to endeavour to deal with the different sections of the country on the basis of fairness, equity and justice.\n\n\u201cThere is need for government to ensure that its policies and actions are sensitive to the multi ethnic and religious makeup of the country.\n\n\u201cGovernment needs to commit more resources to education, healthcare and tackle the rising costs of food and other social services,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 further stated.\n\nThe two-day conference was chaired by a veteran journalist, Ray Ekpu, with Group Managing Director, Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Malam Mele Kolo Kyari, as special guest of honour, and President, Newspapers Proprietors of Nigeria (NPAN), Malam Kabiru Yusuf, represented by NPAN Secretary Mohammed Idris Malagi who is also Publisher Blueprint newspapers as guest of honour.\n\nAlso in attendance were Kogi state Governor Yahaya Bello, representatives of Kaduna state Governor Nasir El Rufai (represented by the Special Adviser on Inter-Governmental Affairs, Hajia Hannatu Dalhat) and Osun state Governor Isiaka Adegboyega Oyetola(also represented by Deputy Chief of Staff Prince Abdullah Adeyanju Binuyo).\n\nOthers were Inspector General of Police Usman Alkali Baba (represented by Commissioner of Police Frank Mba, Force Public Relations Officer); Director General Department of Security Service (DSS) Yusuf Magaji Bichi (represented by its spokesperson, Dr Peter Afunanya), and Director General Nigerian Intelligence Agency (NIA) Ahmed Rufai Abubakar (represented by Mr Emma Engon Anzaku, Director, NIA) and Managing Director/CEO Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System For Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) Aliyu A. Abdulhameed among others.\n\nAnsar-ud-Deen tasks FG\n\nSimilarly, the Northern States Council Secretary of Ansar-ud-Deen Society Alhaji Isiaq Sanni has urged the federal government to expose the sponsors and people supporting banditry in Nigeria.\n\nSanni made the call at the 8th-day Fidau (prayer for a deceased person) of late chairman of Kaduna branch of ADS, Alhaji Liadi Adeyinka Olapade, who died penultimate Friday.\n\nHe said Olapade, who until his death was President Yoruba Community in Kaduna state and Muslim Council of Nigeria (MCON), lived, worked and died in advocacy for a united and secured Nigeria through promotion of citizen education.\n\n\u201cAlhaji Liadi Olapade was a philanthropist. The little things we have seen have shown that he is well loved. He did very well for Ansar-ud-Deen Society and humanity at large. Due to his passion for religion and education, which he said is the best way to fight insecurity, he accepted the nomination and represented Northern States Council of Ansar-ud-Deen as board of trustees member of Summit University, Offa.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that today, the insecurity that Olapade fought for still persists. Thus, we are calling on government to put in more effort to the fight against banditry and other security challenges, because their current effort is not enough to address the challenges. Government should expose those behind banditry, those sponsoring the insecurity, to let us know those who don\u2019t want Nigeria to progress,\u201d Sanni said\n\nAlso in his lecture, Missioner ADS Northern states Council, Alhaji Muyideen Ajani Bello, who was represented by Chief Imam of Ansar-ud-Deen Society, Zaria, Alhaji Tajudeen Akewusekisa, urged Muslims to prepare their exit from life.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe should all prepare for our exit because many good people have gone. Alhaji Olapade was one of the major donors and supporters of Summit University.\n\n\u201cHe was very diligent in supporting da\u2019awah. He did everything in religion, he believed in God as one. He was a devoted Muslim, a great philanthropist and a cheerful giver always putting smiles on the face of others. He donated generously towards Summit University. Two years ago, he came to Zaria with some of his friends on the occasion of our anniversary and donated generously.\n\n\u201cThere are three types of grave, you are left to chose which one you want. Some peoples\u2019 grave after death will be illuminated till the day of judgement. Some will remain in darkness in their graves; the unbelievers, those who are not true Muslims. Some will remain as if they are asleep till the day of judgment such as righteous humans devoted to their religions, who take their religion with seriousness. We should all look at where we are going, what is next for us.\u201d\n\nPresident State of Osun Indigenes Association and Public Relations Officer (PRO) Yoruba Community in Kaduna state, Alhaji Yunus Ajao Muibi urged Nigerian youth to emulate Alhaji Olapade. \u201cIf Alhaji Olapade could hold six leadership positions successfully, then the youth of today need to emulate him. He was an icon, a bridge builder. He was one of those who fought for the creation of Osun state. He was actively involved in Yoruba community for 25 years serving in various positions.\u201d",

Abas Tajudeen, the Director-General of the agency, Dr. Omale Joseph explained that not less than 15 percent of every 1,000 women die due to blood loss during childbirth and urged Nigerians to imbibe the practice of donating blood.\n\n\u201cAs you donate blood, you\u2019re saving a life, and not only that, research has shown that people who donate blood regularly live more healthy\u201d, he submitted.\n\nAccording to the DG, the Commission was putting the mechanism in place to check sharp practices by hospitals in the use of blood for patients, adding that through its One Million Safe Blood Initiative, it was expected that safe blood will be accessible for Nigerians in the six geopolitical zones of the country at any point in time.\n\nSpeaking further, he said the Commission which had the three core mandates of \u201cregulation, coordination and ensuring the provision of safe blood to the people\u201d, gave the assurance that plans were already in top gear to ensure that wastage of stored blood is halted through the use of expired blood for the production of usable components, noting that safe blood had a viable lifespan of between 30 and 35 days.\n\nFielding question on how Nigerians could be encouraged to have their blood groups handy to help in cases of emergency, the DG disclosed that for a start, the Commission was already collaborating with the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) , to ensure that drivers\u2019 licenses are issued with the holder\u2019s blood IDs.\n\nEarlier Hon. Tajudeen had described President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s assent to the Bill as \u201ca very important milestone achieved in the health sector\u201d, as according to him, blood transfusion before now had been largely unregulated, with a lot of sharp practices involved.\n\nThe lawmaker said available statistics have shown that over 40 percent of voluntarily donated blood was unsafe for use, with the majority of donors doing so for monetary gains, adding that in some cases, recipients ended up being infected with diseases, but that with the Commission in place, a lot of such issues will be addressed.\n\nIt would be recalled the Commission\u2019s establishment Bill, which was introduced by Hon.

          "title": "ICC Prosecutor Seeks Investigation Into Abduction Of Nigerian Schoolchildren",
          "text": "The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) is set to seek authorisation from the Pre-Trial Chamber of the court to open an investigation into cases of abduction of schoolchildren in several parts of Northern Nigeria.\n\nAlso to be investigated are the closure of schools, and the \u201cpersistent failure of Nigerian authorities\u201d at both the federal and state levels to end the abduction.\n\nThis is according to a statement on Sunday by Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP).\n\nAccording to the agency\u2019s Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, the ICC prosecutor\u2019s decision followed a petition sent to the court by SERAP.\n\nSERAP had in the petition dated 4 September 2021 urged the ICC prosecutor, Mr Karim A. A. Khan, QC, to \u201cpush for those suspected to be responsible and complicit in the commission of these serious crimes, to be invited and tried by the ICC.\u201d\n\nIn the petition, SERAP argued that, \u201cThe severe and lifelong harms that result from depriving children the right to education satisfy the gravity of harm threshold under the Rome Statute.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Low Passenger Turnout As Train Services Resume On Kaduna-Abuja Route\n\nResponding, the ICC prosecutor in a letter with reference number OTP-CR-363/21, and dated 22 October 2021 confirmed to SERAP that \u201cthe criteria for opening an investigation into a string of abductions and closure of schools in some parts of Nigeria have been met.\u201d\n\nThe letter signed on the prosecutor\u2019s behalf by Mark P. Dillon, Head of the Information and Evidence Unit, read in part: \u201cOn behalf of the Prosecutor, I thank you for your communication received on 13/09/2021, as well as any subsequent related information.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe preliminary examination of the petition is considered complete. Under Article 53 of the Rome Statute, the next step in the judicial process is for the Prosecutor\u2019s Office to prepare and submit a request to the Pre-Trial Chamber for authorisation to open an investigation on Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce submitted, the request will be made publicly available on the Court\u2019s website: www.icccpi.int.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour communication will be forwarded to the relevant team to be analysed, together with other related communications and other available information, in the context of any future investigations. We thank you for your interest in the ICC.\u201d\n\nSERAP deputy director, Kolawole Oluwadare said: \u201cBy this decision, the ICC prosecutor has taken a significant step toward ensuring that those suspected to be responsible for grave crimes against Nigerian schoolchildren are exposed, and held to account.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe victims of these crimes deserve justice. Impartial justice and reparation will deal a decisive blow to impunity of perpetrators, and improve access of Nigerian children to education. SERAP will work closely with the ICC to achieve these important objectives.\u201d\n\nSERAP\u2019s petition to the ICC prosecutor, read in part: \u201cSenior government officials know well or ought to know that their failure to prevent these crimes will violate the children\u2019s human rights and dignity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe absence of any tangible and relevant investigation or prosecution in Nigeria suggests that the authorities are unwilling or unable to carry out genuine investigation or prosecution of those suspected to be responsible for and complicit in the abduction of students.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe consequences of persistent abductions of students, closure of schools, and the failure to provide safe and enabling learning environments despite federal and state authorities yearly budgeting some N241.2 billion of public funds as \u201csecurity votes\u201d, are similar to those of the offences in article 7(1).\u201d\n\n\u201cMore than 10,000 schools have been reportedly closed in at least seven northern states over the fear of attack and abduction of pupils and members of staff. The states are Sokoto, Zamfara, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Niger and Yobe.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmong the string of abductions in Zamfara was the abduction of over 200 schoolgirls in the town of Jangebe in February. The latest abduction comes after widespread reports of abduction of students and closure of schools in many states of Nigeria, including in north-central Niger State where some 91 schoolchildren were abducted.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn estimated 1.3 million Nigerian children have been affected by frequent raids on schools by suspected terrorists. Some 13 million Nigerian children are out of school nationwide. According to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), more than 1,000 students have been abducted from schools in northern Nigeria since December 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cFamilies and parents have reportedly resulted to paying the terrorists thousands of dollars as ransom to secure the release of their children. An estimated $18.34 million was reportedly paid in ransoms between June 2011 and the end of March 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerian authorities have also failed and/or neglected to satisfactorily address the abduction of 276 schoolgirls from Chibok in 2014, which prompted the #BringBackOurGirls campaign. According to reports, more than 100 of those girls are still missing.\u201d\n\nNigeria is a state party to the Rome Statute and deposited its instrument of ratification on 27 September 2001, thus giving the court jurisdiction over crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes committed on its territory or by its nationals.\n\nThe ICC prosecutor decided to seek an investigation after undertaking a preliminary examination of the cases of abduction of children in the country.\n\nA three-member panel of ICC pre-trial judges will consider whether to grant the prosecutor\u2019s request, once it is submitted, to let the ICC step in as a court of last resort.\n\nJudges will rely on the materials submitted by the prosecution to determine whether there is a \u201creasonable basis\u201d to proceed. Victims and their families may also make their views known to the pre-trial chamber.\n\nIf the investigation identifies suspected perpetrators of the crimes alleged in SERAP\u2019s petition, prosecutors can ask judges to issue international arrest warrants, which can remain under seal to help authorities apprehend those charged.\n\nAs an international court of last resort, the ICC is mandated to bring to justice people suspected to be responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so.",

I commend officers of the Nigeria Correctional Service and other members of sister security agencies who provided perimeter security for our facility for fighting gallantly and holding the fort before the attackers were able to gain access to the awaiting trial section of the facility. However, those who escaped are already being pursued. Some have been rearrested, many more will still be captured,\u201d he said.\n\nGiving more details about those who escaped, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola noted that, 446 out of 907 escapees have been recaptured, whilst 69 never left the facility.\n\nRead Also: President Buhari To Participate In Investment Summit In Saudi Arabia\n\n\u201cAs of the last count, 446 of the escapees have been recaptured, leaving 392 still at large. We want to assure Nigerians that the service has an updated database of the escapees which includes their biometrics. We are sharing the database with all security agencies in the country, including the Interpol, so those who escaped our recapture efforts can be nabbed.\n\n\u201cTo those on the run, be assured you have nowhere to hide. You can run, but you can\u2019t hide. We\u2019ll fish you out! We are publishing details of those who escaped in the mass media so the public can assist in that effort,\u201d the Minister reiterated.\n\nOn the efforts to rebuild the damaged part of the facility, the Minister noted that he has directed the NCoS, to immediately begin remediation work.\n\n\u201cI have instructed the CG of NCoS to immediately begin the reconstruction of the damaged parts of the building. We hope to make the facility better secured and more habitable for the inmates,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking during the inspection, the Controller General of the Nigeria Correctional Service, NCoS, Haliru Nababa (mni), noted that so far, the service has successfully prevented internal jailbreaks in all her facilities.\n\n\u201cThe NCoS have so far prevented internal jailbreaks in the country. What we have reoccurring in recent times are external attacks on our facilities. We have been retraining our officers not just on securing those in lawful custody but in preventing external attacks.\n\n\u201cWe are collaborating with other security agencies in the country to make such attacks near impossible and where they do occur, the attackers will not live to regret it,\u201d the CG stated.\n\nOn the instruction given by the Minister of Interior to immediately begin remediation work on the facility, CG Nababa noted that work has begun already.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, workers are already on site fixing damaged doors, broken windows and mounting walls. Before the end of today, work would have been completed on it,\u201d Nababa stated.\n\nBefore leaving Oyo, the Minister\u2019s entourage paid a courtesy visit to the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III, and commiserated with him over the attack of the FG facility in his town.\n\n\u201cWe are here to commiserate with your majesty over the attack in your town less than 72hours ago.

          "text": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer insisted he is the right man to manage Manchester United despite a historic hammering by Liverpool on Sunday as Mohamed Salah scored a hat-trick in a 5-0 rout at Old Trafford.\n\nFor the first time in Premier League history, United trailed 4-0 at half-time and lost by five goals without scoring at home for the first time since 1955.\n\nThe Red Devils have now taken one point from a possible 12 in the league to fall to seventh, eight points off leaders Chelsea.\n\n\u201cI do believe in myself, that I am getting close to what I want with the club,\u201d said Solskjaer.\n\n\u201cThe results lately haven\u2019t been good enough, that brings doubt in anyone\u2019s mind, but I\u2019ve got to keep strong and believe in what we\u2019ve been doing.\u201d\n\nNaby Keita started the rout before Diogo Jota doubled Liverpool\u2019s lead inside 15 minutes.\n\nREAD ALSO: Salah Hits Hat-Trick As Liverpool Humiliate Man Utd\n\nSalah then took centre stage to take his tally for the season to 15 goals in 12 appearances and become the top-scoring African player in Premier League history in the process.\n\nTo round off a miserable day for United, Paul Pogba lasted less than 15 minutes as a second-half substitute as he was shown a straight red card for a reckless lunge that forced Keita to leave the pitch on a stretcher.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s first victory in front of a crowd at Old Trafford under Jurgen Klopp moves them back above Manchester City into second, just a point behind Chelsea.\n\n\u201cWhat we did in the last third was insane. Pressing high, winning balls, scored wonderful goals,\u201d said Klopp after Liverpool\u2019s record away win against United.\n\n\u201cThe result is insane. I asked if there was one like this in history and if there isn\u2019t then it will take a while (to beat).\u201d\n\nBy contrast, United\u2019s hopes of a first league title since 2013 already look over.\n\nThat gap is likely to grow in the coming weeks with Tottenham and City to come in the next fortnight before an international break.\n\nWhether Solskjaer will still be in charge come November is now in serious doubt as he has completely failed to form a balanced team from a talented collection of star players.\n\n\u201cIn the last few weeks we\u2019ve hit a brick wall,\u201d added Solskjaer. \u201cThe performances haven\u2019t come, the results haven\u2019t come. We\u2019ve conceded too many easy goals and that\u2019s a concern.\u201d\n\nSalah teed up Keita to open the floodgates after just five minutes with a composed low finish past David de Gea.\n\nUnited came from 2-0 down at the break to beat Atalanta 3-2 in the Champions League on Wednesday.\n\nBut former midfielder Paul Scholes\u2019 warning after that match that Liverpool would be 4-0 up in 45 minutes if handed the same space to attack into came to fruition.\n\nJota justified his selection ahead of Sadio Mane as he stretched to turn in Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s cross to double Liverpool\u2019s advantage.\n\nSalah has now scored in 10 consecutive games and overtook Didier Drogba with his 105th Premier League goal when the Egyptian turned home Keita\u2019s cut-back with the United defence all at sea.\n\nLiverpool inflicted further punishment before the break when Salah smashed home at De Gea\u2019s near post.\n\nSalah then completed his hat-trick with another cool finish five minutes into the second-half after Jordan Henderson\u2019s pass dissected the United defence once more.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo thought he had pulled a goal back only for a VAR review to catch him in an offside position.\n\nAnother VAR check saw the end of Pogba\u2019s brief cameo for a horrendous studs-up challenge on Keita that forced the Guinean off.\n\nSolskjaer sacrificed Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford to try and stop the bleeding as Old Trafford emptied during the final half-hour.\n\nDe Gea ensured Liverpool failed to match their record margin of victory against United with an incredible save from Alexander-Arnold\u2019s drive.\n\nHowever, that did not subdue the mood among the travelling fans as they mockingly chanted for Solskjaer to remain in his job.",

          "text": "Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, have intercepted over 2,060 kilograms of assorted drugs, including heroin, methamphetamine, cannabis, tramadol, and rohypnol, in operations at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos as well as Ondo, Edo, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, and some courier companies.\n\nOn October 6 and 15, respectively, two consignments of heroin measuring 4.40kg and 550grams were intercepted at the MMIA\u2019s cargo facility in Ikeja. The first was detected inside bags of granulated sugar and flour on an Ethiopian Airlines aircraft from Johannesburg, South Africa, through Addis Abeba, to Lagos at the airport\u2019s SAHCO import shed. Two suspects were detained for further investigation: Chukwuemeka Ugochukwu, a freight agent who approved the shipment, and Kabiru Aminu, a stock keeper who was to collect the package for further distribution to beneficiaries.\n\nOn the 9th of October, one Adeoya Segun Joy, who was supposed to pick up the suitcase from Kabiru Aminu, was apprehended in Ajao estate, while Enahoro Emmanuel Annointing, who was also assaigned to pick up the shipment, was apprehended in Abule-egba area of Lagos. Both of them were following orders from their South African counterparts.\n\nA statement issued by Femi Babalola, Director, Media & Advocacy on Sunday said the second consignment discovered at the SAHCO export shed and concealed in walls of 10 cartons laced with tailoring materials, was heading to Malaysia via Addis Ababa on Ethiopian cargo airline, while a freight forwarding agent, Ekpe Samson Victor was arrested in connection with the illegal export.\n\nAttempts by another freight agent, Igwe Okoye Onwukwe to export two consignments of cannabis to the United Kingdom have been foiled by NDLEA operatives. The first attempt was made on October 15, when Igwe Okoye Onwukwe presented a carton of 16.55kg cannabis for export to UK at the NAHCO export shed where he was promptly arrested. Curiously, another consignment of 15.85kg cannabis also heading to UK and intercepted on 20th October, was traced to Onwukwe as the owner even while still undergoing investigation in custody.\n\nIn Ondo state, two persons; Uchenna Obodo Ali, 22, and Tochukwu Eno, 20, were arrested with 302kg of cannabis when operatives raided a warehouse in Emure forest, Owo LGA on Friday 22nd October.\n\nMohammed Haruna, 45, was arrested in Kano with 10,161 sachets of Tramadol and Rohypnol pills and capsules while transporting them on a bus for distribution. Abiodun Ademoya, a suspected fake soldier from Akure south in Ondo state, was caught in Zaria with 11.6 kg of cannabis.\n\nAlso in Plateau, operatives apprehended a Yola-bound mass transit bus, with registration number FKY 341 ZA, belonging to Gombe Express, on the Jos-Abuja Road, within Riyom LGA. Ahmad Musa Musa, 32, was discovered in possession of 22 compressed Cannabis Sativa pellets weighing a total of 15kg packed inside a black bag.\n\nIn a most audacious move, a nursing mother, 35-year-old Mariam Drissu was arrested at the Edo state Command headquarters of the Agency on Thursday 21st October while trying to smuggle drugs into the cell for a suspect in custody. Officers on duty had while searching the food brought by Mariam for her relation in custody discovered two cups of \u201cLoud\u201d cannabis weighing 13grams buried inside the food (akpu) meant for the suspect in custody.\n\nIn the same vein, officers of the Edo State Command also on Thursday raided a Cannabis farm measuring 3.210691 hectares, in Ayegunle forest, Akoko Edo area of the state, destroyed the plantation and evacuated 100 bags of harvested cannabis weighing 1,639kg, while a suspect, Samuel Ochonogor was arrested in the forest with 66.7kg of cannabis.\n\nAt some courier companies in Lagos, over 4.5kilograms of methamphetamine concealed in palm fruit tins, artwork, bottles of cashew nuts, auto spare parts, and picture frame going to Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Qatar were intercepted by operatives of the Directorate of Operation and General Investigations, DOGI, of the Agency.\n\nCommending the officers and men of the MMIA, Ondo, Edo, Kano, Kaduna and Plateau Commands as well as DOGI, for their resilience and tenacity, Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) urged them and others across the country to continue to keep their eyes on the goal until all the drug cartels in the country are totally dismantled.",

          "text": "A Somali film exploring what people will do for love has won the grand prize at the prestigious Pan-African film festival in Burkina Faso.\n\nThe Gravedigger\u2019s Wife, written and directed by Finish-Somali director Khadar Ahmed, beat off competition at Fespaco from 16 other movies.\n\nIt focuses on Guled, whose job it is to wait outside hospital to bury the dead, and what he does to save his sick wife.\n\nThe head of the prize jury called it a courageous film, Reuters reports.\n\n\u201cIt is a beautiful film that tells a story with humanity,\u201d Mauritanian film director Abderrahmane Sissako is quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in awe. I\u2019m speechless. Words can not express my gratitude and appreciation for this type of love from the continent,\u201d Ahmed wrote on Instagram.\n\nA rare feature-length film in Somali, The Gravedigger\u2019s Wife is also Somalia\u2019s first entry in the Best International Feature Film category at the Oscars.\n\nSet in Djibouti, it details the struggles faced by Guled, played by Omar Abdi, when he learns he has to raise funds to pay for his wife\u2019s treatment.\n\nNasra, played by Yasmin Warsame, is dying of kidney failure.\n\nIronically, as a gravedigger, Guled waits for the deaths of others in order to make the money which could mean his wife survives.\n\nAhmed wanted to \u201ctell this story with dignity, tenderness and compassion \u2013 all the qualities I\u2019ve been raised with\u201d, the director told the Guardian newspaper.\n\nHe was born in Somalia but moved to Finland as a teenager.\n\nHis film was 10 years in the making. Ahmed wrote it a decade ago, but was determined to direct it himself and so had to learn how to be a director, the Guardian reports.\n\nAs well as winning the prestigious award, known as the Golden Stallion of Yennenga, he also received $36,000 (\u00a326,000) in prize money.\n\nThe Silver Stallion went to Haitian director Gessica Geneus for her film Freda. And the Bronze Stallion went to the Tunisian director Leyla Bouzid for Tale of Love and Desire.\n\nThe prizes were handed out at Fespaco\u2019s closing ceremony in the Burkinabe capital, Ouagadougou.\n\nIt was the 27th edition of the week-long biennial event, the continent\u2019s biggest film festival that celebrates films largely produced in Africa by Africans.",

          "text": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan moved to expel the ambassadors of 10 Western countries who appealed for the release of a jailed civil society leader.\n\nSeven of the ambassadors represent Turkey\u2019s NATO allies and the expulsions, if carried out, would open the deepest rift with the West in Erdogan\u2019s 19 years in power.\n\n\u201cI have ordered our foreign minister to declare these 10 ambassadors as persona non grata as soon as possible,\u201d Erdogan said on Saturday, referring to a term used in diplomacy that signifies the first step before expulsion. He did not set a firm date.\n\nPhilanthropist Osman Kavala has been in prison since late 2017, charged with financing nationwide protests in 2013 and with involvement in a 2016 failed coup. He denies the charges.\n\n\u201cThey must know and understand Turkey,\u201d Erdogan added, accusing the envoys of \u201cindecency\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey must leave here the day they no longer know Turkey,\u201d Erdogan said.\n\nThe envoys had issued a highly unusual joint statement on Monday saying the continued detention of Parisian-born activist Osman Kavala \u201ccast a shadow\u201d over Turkey.\n\nThe US, Germany, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden called for a \u201cjust and speedy resolution to [Kavala\u2019s] case\u201d.\n\nKavala has become a symbol of the sweeping crackdown Erdogan unleashed after surviving the coup attempt.\n\nSpeaking to the AFP news agency from his jail cell last week, Kavala said he felt like a tool in Erdogan\u2019s attempts to blame a foreign plot for domestic opposition to his nearly two-decade rule.\n\nKavala said on Friday he would no longer attend his trial as a fair hearing was impossible after recent comments by Erdogan.\n\nThe Council of Europe, the continent\u2019s top human rights watchdog, issued a final warning to Turkey to comply with a 2019 European Court of Human Rights order to release Kavala pending trial.\n\nIf Turkey fails to do so by its next meeting from November 30 \u2013 December 2, the Strasbourg-based council could vote to launch its first disciplinary proceedings against Ankara.\n\nEuropean Parliament President David Sassoli tweeted: \u201cThe expulsion of 10 ambassadors is a sign of the authoritarian drift of the Turkish government. We will not be intimidated. Freedom for Osman Kavala.\u201d\n\nErdogan was quoted as saying the ambassadors in question would not release \u2018bandits, murderers and terrorists\u2019 in their own countries [\u0130slam Yakut/Anadolu]\n\nA source at the German foreign ministry also said the 10 countries were consulting with one another. German legislators called for a tough response.\n\n\u201cErdogan\u2019s unscrupulous actions against his critics are becoming increasingly uninhibited,\u201d Bundestag vice president Claudia Roth told the dpa news agency. She said Erdogan\u2019s \u201cauthoritarian course must be confronted internationally\u201d and demanded sanctions and a halt to weapons exports to Turkey.\n\n\u201cThe possible expulsion of 10 ambassadors, including the representatives of Germany and many of Turkey\u2019s NATO allies, would be unwise, undiplomatic and would weaken the cohesion of the alliance,\u201d lawmaker and foreign policy expert Alexander Graf Lambsdorff tweeted. \u201cErdogan can have no interest in that.\u201d\n\nNorway said its embassy had not received any notification from Turkish authorities.\n\n\u201cOur ambassador has not done anything that warrants an expulsion,\u201d said the ministry\u2019s chief spokesperson, Trude Maaseide, adding that Turkey was well aware of Norway\u2019s views.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to call on Turkey to comply with democratic standards and the rule of law to which the country committed itself under the European Human Rights Convention,\u201d Maaseide said.\n\nDanish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said his ministry had not received any official notification, but was in contact with its friends and allies.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to guard our common values and principles, as also expressed in the joint declaration,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe US said it was aware of the reports and was seeking clarity from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s foreign ministry meanwhile said it would not comment until it hears \u201canything formally through official channels,\u201d and added in an e-mailed statement that \u201cNew Zealand values its relationship with Turkey\u201d.\n\nErdogan was quoted on Thursday as saying the ambassadors in question would not release \u201cbandits, murderers and terrorists\u201d in their own countries.",
