          "text": "To celebrate the diversity and uniqueness of Canada as a land of opportunities, Africanad,a company based in that country, in collaboration Opeyemi Olatunji popularly known as YemyTpx, a Nigerian songwriter and recording artist, have released a song titled \u2018O Canada\u2019, a celebration song filled with lyrics of the nation\u2019s anthem with a blend and fusion of Afrobeats and western feels.\n\nThe song was produced by a veteran music producer Edward Sunday, while the video was shot live by award wining video director Otega Ododoru at the scene of the music production.\n\nThe song is a collaborative effort between YemyTpx and a friend, Ayodele Odeyemi, also known as Ay De\u2019 Senator who is a Canadian citizen and the Chief Executive Officer of Africanad with the partnership of some other stakeholders both in Canada and Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking on how it all started, YemyTpx said: \u201cIt was one beautiful weekend earlier in 2020 that I got a call from Africanad\u2019s Chief Executive, Ayodele Odeyemi, who I have been working together with on some other philanthropic projects. Right in the middle of our conversation, he then talked to me about a vision he\u2019s been nursing for Canada overtime on a content that can serve as a fulcrum of unity for all Canadians. We both reached an agreement that it can only come either through sport or music because those are the two phenomena that can bring people of different tongues and colours together. So we both put heads together and agreed on making a music rendition that can be sang by all Canadians all around the globe, something they are familiar with.\n\n\u201cThen we thought of making a new vibes and music out of the Canadian anthem lyrics fusing it with some other original lyrics of mine with a sweet sensational tone and that\u2019s what birthed \u2018O Canada\u2019 celebration song today. After I was done with the song writing, the vision and song was presented officially to the AFRICANAD team for deliberation, approval and funding so as to progress into the next stage, which is music and video production.\n\n\u201cWe also had to seek for collaborations with other art and media companies, such as NaijaGoSmile Media Consult, Azusa Productions and GAP Studio, to make the project a success. This was because it was a tasking project that require the involvement of different stakeholders.\u201d\n\nYemyTpx said composing such a song was not an easy job, but the experience was worth it.\n\n\u201cAs an artiste and a song writer, it was an opportunity for me to express and explore my gift as a singer making such a global landmark with Africanad support, most especially the Executive Producer of the project, Ayodele Odeyemi, who shared the vision with me.\n\n\u201cIt was a means to foster our continuous philanthropic contributions and adventure towards humanity, especially Canada and the world at large.\n\n\u201cWriting the song was a very sweet experience for me because we could foreseen the impact the song was going to have on the end consumers, which are Canadians.\u201d\n\nOn how he got the idea to try something different with Canada\u2019s anthem, Odeyemi said as he listened to the country\u2019s anthem, he thought maybe he could jazz up it up.\n\n\u201cYou know, Africans love their music. We love to groove. We love to dance. We love our drums. I\u2019m thought to myself, \u2018I can infuse something in here,'\u201d said Odeyemi.\n\nHe had the idea to infuse the alternative anthem with elements of afrobeats \u2014 a music style that combines West African musical elements \u2014 along with vocal work by Winnipeg\u2019s Africanad community choir and a range of different drumming styles.\n\nOdeyemi says he saw Canadians, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, also battling racial injustice, coping with mental health struggles and dealing with the fallout of an ongoing opioid crisis. He thought now was the time to release the song to bring people together.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Joseph Erunke, Abuja\n\nProf. Abdulrasheed Na\u2019Allah, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Abuja, has taken a swipe at governments in Africa over what he described as their failure to address the yearnings of the masses in the continent.\n\nThis was as he said Nigeria\u2019s democratic structure and institutions have been compromised, noting that a sterling leadership was imperative for development in the country.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday at the inaugural annual retreat of the Abuja Leadership Center, a TETFund centre of excellence in public governance and leadership in Abuja, through the Deputy Vice Chancellor Academics, Prof. Clement Alawa, he noted that the crisis of public governance and leadership was pervasive across Nigeria and Africa.\n\nALSO READ: \u2018Soludo not interested in 2023 presidential election\u2019\n\nHe regretted that African continent was bedeviled with matters of political instability arising from civil and militant agitations, insurgencies, military interventions in governance, state failures, wars and genocides, which he noted,have wreaked significant human and material damage in the continent.\n\n\u201cDemocracy has been variously instrumentalized to cause extraneous to the public good and public value. In this subversion of democratic principles, the structures and institutions of democracy, including the political party system, legislative processes, the judiciary, gender mainstreaming, electoral system, the ethics and value system, security and law and order, fiscal management, civil society among others, are all compromised,\u201d he said.\n\nHe spoke:\u201d In this setting, leadership has often been mobilized on principles that deviate from the ethics and tenets of substantive democracy.\n\nALSO READ: Twitter Ban: Sanwo-Olu calls for restraint, dialogue\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria today the nation is virtually blanketed in an avalanche of uncivil discourse that threatens the foundations of the fundamentals of constructive and mutually engaging citizenship. Harmonious intercommunal living across societies and communities that was taken for granted until only recently have morphed into a dangerous enterprise.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that since the institution of colonial leadership on Nigeria and different parts of Africa till date public governance has never been responsive to the yearnings of ordinary people of Africa. The concept of public governance has been bastardized.\n\n\u201cThe evidence of failure of leadership at all levels abound. The failure spans the communal through the ethnic to the tribal to the religious. The consequences of the death of leadership across the board could not be more devastating in this anarchic environment replicated across the continent.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

So, I got up and tapped her on her shoulder and said hi, she was under the drier, she said oh hi, how are you and we exchanged pleasantries and I went back to my side where I was having a conversation with the shop owner.\n\n\u201cAnd 20 minutes later, Tiwa came and the drama started.

          "text": "From Laide Raheem, Abeokuta\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo has called on agitators for the disintegration to rethink the idea and work for the unity and oneness of the country.\n\nHe said it was better for Nigeria to remain as one indivisible nation than for each tribe to go its separate way.\n\nObasanjo made the call at the luncheon and his investiture as a Fellow of Nigerian Institution of Surveyor, organised by the Body of Fellow of the NIS, Ogun State chapter, yesterday.\n\nHe said though the situation in the country was not palatable, calling for the disintegration of the country was not the solution, declaring that \u201cit is better we stay together.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there is any Nigerian who does not feel apprehensive on the situation of the country, the person is a human being without being human. Any Nigerian who is human will be apprehensive, if not frustrated with the present situation in the country. We are apprehensive about security situation, apprehensive about economic situation, apprehensive about our political situation and the drum we are hearing is of disintegration of the country.\n\n\u201cI am a strong believer of one Nigeria, but not one Nigeria at any cost, but one Nigeria where every Nigerian can feel proud that he or she has a stake in this country/\n\n\u201cNo Nigerian is born a slave in this country. No Nigerian is born to be oppressed in this country and those of us that have shared part of our blood and sweat for this country, we did that because we wanted a country where every Nigerian can claim as his or her own.\n\n\u201cI believe that if we talk among ourselves the way we should and if we change the narrative, I believe this is a great country. That we are not making Nigeria what God wants it to be is not the fault of God but the fault of ourselves, particularly our leaders.\n\n\u201cOne thing that gives us strength is our diversity. If all that we have is Republic of Oduduwa for those who said so, their position is understandable. If that is all we have, members of that country will be diminished compared to be a citizen of Nigeria. Citizens of Oduduwa Republic or any other republic from Nigeria will be diminished compared to citizens of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn this age and time that we are talking about the reintegration of Africa for economic development, disintegration of any country will be almost idiotic. Even if we have Igboland as an independent country, Yorubaland an independent country and Fulani/Hausaland an independent country.\n\n\u201cAnd as a friend of mine in the military used to say then, what will become of the over 300 minorities \u2013 the Jukuns, the Gbasamas? Where will they belong? The only reason they can raise up their heads is because they belong to Nigeria. Are we thinking of them or are we just being selfish? It doesn\u2019t matter what we do, we will still be neighbours.\n\n\u201cWe had seen it before; India was broken into India and Pakistan, they are still at war till today. Yugoslavia was broken into how many countries, they haven\u2019t sorted it till today. Sudan was broken into Sudan and South Sudan, I don\u2019t believe South Sudan is better for it and that is the truth.\n\n\u201cI believe it will cost us less to work for our unity. There are many things wrong but those things are correctable if we make efforts to correct them and hold us together than what it will cost us to break up and be perpetually at war and all our money will be spent in building an army. I know what an army contains, I know what it means to keep an army, an army that may not be productive. Let us think about it.\u201d\n\nOn the importance of survey to the national development, Obasanjo said the entire country should be surveyed in order to achieve economic development and transformation.\n\nHe therefore charged the national body of the Nigerian Institution of Surveyors to draft a proposal on the national survey of the country to the federal government.\n\n\u201cWhen I was the president of the country, the project of surveying the entire country began, but it got stuck and I don\u2019t know where the project is now,\u201d Obasanjo noted.\n\nThe state chairman, Nigerian Institution of Surveyors, Ademola Adebowale disclosed the Ogun State chapter of the NIS had concluded plans to produce a unique digital map of Ogun State which will be updated regularly for meaningful and sustainable development.\n\n\u201cThis will make us to become self sufficient in geospatial information which will affect all sectors positively and thereby increase the state internally generated revenue geometrically,\u201d Adebowale said.\n\nThe event held at the Marquee of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) Abeokuta, also saw to the investiture of Kehinde Isijola as the new chairman of the Body of the Fellows.",

          "text": "\u2022Gives conditions to lift suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations\n\n\u2022Impose visa ban on Buhari, Malami, others, PDP tells US, UK, others\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday insisted that all Over The Top (OTT) platforms, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram, must register with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and be licensed by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to continue operating in the country.\n\nIt also rolled out conditions that Twitter must fulfill before the suspension of its operations in Nigeria could be lifted.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, while briefing State House correspondents after a Federal Executive Council meeting in Abuja, also said Twitter had reached out to the federal government for talks on resolving the issues that led to the suspension of its operations in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) doubled down on mobilising pressure on the federal government to reverse the suspension with a plea to the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Saudi Arabia and others to impose a visa ban on President Muhammadu Buhari and Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, and other cabinet members involved in stifling free speech in Nigeria.\n\nA day after Mohammed announced the suspension, Malami, in a statement last Saturday had directed the prosecution of those still tweeting after the suspension.\n\nAlso, the Minority Caucuses of the two chambers of the National Assembly rallied defiance of the federal government\u2019s directive stopping Nigerians from tweeting.\n\nAlso, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has urged Nigeria to immediately reverse the suspension of Twitter, saying it is tantamount to opposing free speech.\n\nMohammed said Twitter yesterday morning reached out to the federal government, calling for a high-level discussion to resolve its operation suspension issue.\n\nHe said: \u201cYes, it is true they\u2019ve made, reached\u2026only this morning I got, you know, communication that yes, they are now ready to hold senior-level discussions with us. Just now, I just confirmed with my colleague now. Yes, we just got the information now.\u201c\n\nAsked whether the government will hold the discussion with Twitter, Mohammed replied: \u201cWhy not? We will. But our conditions are already laid out to you. One, to do business in Nigeria, they must register as a Nigerian company. Two, they must be licensed and three, they will have to refrain from using the platform for activities that are inimical to the growth of Nigeria, to the corporate existence of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFrom there, any other issue can come up. We already talked to them.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the microblogging platform was suspended because it provided an avenue for people threatening the corporate existence of Nigeria.\n\nHe also accused Twitter founder, Mr. Jack Dorsey, of helping to fund last October\u2019s #EndSARS protest while allowing the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, to use the platform to call for the killing of policemen.\n\nHe said Twitter failed to take down Kanu\u2019s tweets despite repeated requests to do so.\n\nHe listed conditions that must be met even if there is a discussion with Twitter to include that it must now be registered in Nigeria as a business concern.\n\nApart from Twitter, he said other social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram must now be registered in the country.\n\nAccording to him, there is no infringement on freedom of speech with the suspension of Twitter because Nigerians can still use other platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.\n\nHe also denied that the suspension is not effective as Twitter is losing money as a result of the action.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor those that have heard that Oh, the ban is not effective, to the best of my knowledge, I think the ban is very effective. Otherwise, how would they be complaining that they are losing billions of naira every day if the ban is not effective? But that is not the issue.\u201d\n\nOn the circumstances that led to the suspension of Twitter, Mohammed said all social media groups would have to be registered like they did in other countries, for them to function now in Nigeria.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs you are aware, last Friday the federal government suspended Twitter operations in Nigeria indefinitely, and the reason we gave was because of the persistent use of the Twitter platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\n\u201cOn Friday, also the government directed the regulatory body, the National Broadcasting Commission, to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT, Over The Top social media operations in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe that we\u2019ve done that I think by today, that advert is out asking that all OTT and social media coverage operating in Nigeria should apply for registration and licensing.\n\n\u201cI want to repeat that is because Twitter has consistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence that is the reason for suspending their operations in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019ve found out that Twitter is actually the platform of choice for a particular separatist leader who resides outside the country and issues directives to its members to attack symbols of government authority, such as the police, the military, the electoral commission offices, correctional centres, etc. And this is being done willfully and consistently without any consequences from Twitter.\n\n\u201cYou know, no country worth its name will tolerate that. And no company, no matter its self-importance, will force any nation to accept this.\n\n\u201cIt may interest you to know that most of the OTT and social media platforms operating in Nigeria do not have any office in Nigeria and do not pay taxes to the Nigerian government for the billions they earn here. That is not the best practice globally, and that is why we are insisting that for you to operate in Nigeria, you must first be a Nigerian company and be licensed by the broadcasting commission.\n\n\u201cTherefore, any OTT or social media platform operating in Nigeria must do so legally. One, registered with Corporate Affairs Commission, licensed by National Broadcasting Commission and then adhere to the conditions stipulated in their licences. We have already advertised the notice to the companies concerned to apply for registration of licence.\n\n\u201cMany one of the commentators have said suspending the operation of Twitter is like stifling freedom of expression. And I said no. Twitter is just one of the many platforms through which Nigerians can express themselves. There is Facebook, there is Instagram, there\u2019s WhatsApp. There\u2019s Google Hangout and others. They have not been suspended.\n\n\u201cAnd in any case, as I have said in several fora, it is because we have a country called Nigeria that we can start talking about free speech. And of course, there has to be a country before people can able to transact their businesses using social media platforms.\u201d\n\nCiting the fact-checking done by online newspapers, the minister accused Dorsey of funding the #EndSARS protest.\n\nHe said: \u201cSo, whether he donated money himself or helped to raise money, the Twitter owner is one of those who helped to fund the #EndSARS protests that were later hijacked leading to loss of lives and massive destruction of property.\n\n\u201cLike I said last Wednesday, you can see from the fact-checking, the role of Jack Dorsey is suspect. His interest in Nigeria is inimical to our growth.\n\n\u201cOur decision to suspend Twitter has been lauded by some, it has been decried by some. But we want to make it clear that what is important to us is the sovereignty of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd until when Twitter responds and the cardinal thing is that Twitter must be registered in Nigeria. Twitter must be licensed in Nigeria and Twitter must stop using its platform for activities that are inimical to the growth of Nigeria and its corporate existence.\u201d\n\nImpose Visa Ban on Buhari, Malami, Others PDP Tells US, UK, Others\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP yesterday called on the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Saudi Arabia and other members of the international communities to immediately impose a visa ban on President Muhammadu Buhari and members of his cabinet involved in stifling free speech in Nigeria.\n\nThe PDP predicated its demand on the alleged violation of UN International Charter on Human Rights by Buhari by suspending the use of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, described the suspension as a violation of Article 19 of the UN Charter as well as section 39 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), which guaranteed freedom of expression to all Nigerians.\n\nThe party also urged the world bodies to also sanction Mohammed, Malami and some leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for their individual roles in the suspension of Twitter in addition to associated harassments and threats to Nigerians.\n\nThe PDP urged the countries to bar Buhari, Mohammed, Malami and their family members from entering their territories for any private purposes whatsoever.\n\nContinue Tweeting, N\u2019Assembly Minority Caucus Tells Nigerians\n\nAlso, the joint Minority Caucus of the Senate and the House of Representatives has called on Nigerians to ignore the Twitter suspension.\n\nThe lawmakers described the suspension as draconian as it has resulted in the loss of sources of livelihood for many Nigerians.\n\nThe Minority Leader of the Senate, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, and Minority Leader of the House, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, in a joint statement said the joint caucus \u201crestates its condemnation of the embargo as draconian and unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe caucus also dismissed threats by the federal government to arrest and prosecute Nigerians for using Twitter, calling on Nigerians to \u201cgo ahead and use their Twitter (handles) as they would not be contravening any law in Nigeria or any international statute.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers cited the provisions of Articles 19 and 20 of the United Nations Charter on Fundamental Human Rights, which Nigeria is a signatory to, as well as provisions of Sections 39 and 36 (12) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), stating that \u201cby these provisions, no one will be violating any law for using Twitter in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cAs lawmakers, the joint caucus is pained by the anguish Nigerians, especially the youths, who find the use of Twitter as a means of livelihood and genuine social interaction, are passing through just because the APC-led federal government feels slighted that an individual\u2019s post was deleted by Twitter for an ethical violation.\n\n\u201cThe joint caucus, therefore, calls on Nigerians to use various opportunities offered by technology and continue making use of Twitter since such does not violate any law in our country.\n\n\u201cIt is agonising that Nigeria and Nigerians have been losing billions of naira on a daily basis since the ban on Twitter. This is completely unacceptable as it is worsening the already biting economic hardship and frightening unemployment level in the country.\u201d\n\nReverse Twitter Ban Immediately, USAID Warns FG\n\nAlso yesterday, USAID urged the federal government to immediately reverse the suspension.\n\nAn administrator of USAID, Samantha Power, in a statement, said: \u201cThere are nearly 40 million Twitter users in #Nigeria, and the country is home to Africa\u2019s largest tech hub.\n\n\u201cThis suspension is nothing more than state-sanctioned denial of free speech and should be reversed immediately.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Kayode Fasua\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo yesterday called on secessionist agitators to shelve the idea and work for the unity and oneness of the country.\n\nHe said it is better for Nigeria to remain as one indivisible nation than for each tribe to go its separate ways.\n\nHe spoke in Abeokuta at his investiture as a Fellow of the Nigerian Institution of Surveyors (NIS), organised by the Body of Fellows of the NIS, Ogun State chapter.\n\nObasanjo, while reviewing the state of the nation, stated that though the present situation in the country is undesirable, calling for the disintegration of the country is not the solution.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is better we stay together. If there is any Nigerian who does not feel apprehensive about the situation of the country, the person is a human being without being human.\n\n\u201cAny Nigerian who is human will be apprehensive, if not frustrated with the present situation in the country.\n\n\u201cWe are apprehensive about the security situation, apprehensive about the economic situation, apprehensive about our political situation and the drum we are hearing is of disintegration of the country.\n\n\u201cI am a strong believer of one Nigeria, but not one Nigeria at any cost; but one Nigeria where every Nigerian can feel proud that he or she has a stake in this country.\u201d\n\nThe former president added that no Nigerian was born a slave and as such, no ethnic group deserves to oppress the other.\n\nHe said: \u201cNo Nigerian is born a slave in this country. No Nigerian is born to be oppressed in this country and those of us that have shared part of our blood and sweat for this country, we did that because we wanted a country where every Nigerian can claim as his or her own.\n\n\u201cI believe that if we talk among ourselves the way we should and if we change the narrative, I believe this is a great country.\n\n\u201cThat we are not making Nigeria what God wants it to be is not the fault of God, but the fault of ourselves, particularly our leaders.\u201d\n\nHe identified Nigeria\u2019s diversity as one of the nation\u2019s major strengths, adding that breaking into splinter groups will weaken the influence to be asserted in the community of nations.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOne thing that gives us strength is our diversity. If all that we have is Republic of Oduduwa for those who said so, their position is understandable. If that is all we have, members of that country will be diminished compared to being a citizen of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cCitizens of the Oduduwa Republic or any other republic from Nigeria, will be diminished compared to citizens of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn this age and time that we are talking about the reintegration of Africa for economic development, the disintegration of any country will be almost idiotic; even if we have Igboland as an independent country, Yorubaland an independent country, and Fulani/Hausaland as an independent country.\n\n\u201cAnd as a friend of mine in the military used to say then, what will become of the over 300 minorities \u2013 the Jukuns, the Gbasamas?

It doesn\u2019t matter what we do, we will still be neighbours.\u201d\n\nObasanjo cited cases of countries that broke and are yet to know peace till date.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe had seen it before, India was broken into India and Pakistan, they are still at war today. Yugoslavia was broken into how many countries? They haven\u2019t sorted it till today. Sudan was broken into Sudan and South Sudan; I don\u2019t believe South Sudan is better for it and that is the truth.\n\n\u201cI believe it will cost us less to work for our unity, there are many things wrong, but those things are correctable if we make efforts to correct them and hold us together than what it will cost us to break up and be perpetually at war and all our money will be spent on building an army.\n\n\u201cI know what an army contains, I know what it means to keep an army, an army that may not be productive, let us think about it.\u201d\n\nAt a separate forum yesterday, Obasanjo advised every citizen to take the task of \u201cbuilding a new Nigeria at heart\u201d, if the country must quickly overcome its current challenges.\n\nHe said this had become necessary as Nigeria is currently in a bad shape.\n\nObasanjo spoke in Abeokuta while hosting Team New Nigeria (TNN), a group of eminent citizens that seek to promote genuine democratic values, equality and peaceful coexistence among Nigerians.\n\nThe former president, who expressed delight at the coming into existence of TNN, stated that the current situation in the country called for every Nigerian \u201cto prioritise in their heart, the task of building a new country\u201d.\n\nHe, however, said that \u201cthe situation is obviously in a very bad shape\u201d.\n\nEarlier in his speech, the National President of the group, Dr Modibbo Farakwai, said the visit was part of the TNN\u2019s efforts towards mobilising the eminent Nigerians to identify with the ideal of the group.\n\nFarakwai stated that the group, which comprises distinguished citizens who all shared attributes of patriotism and nationalism, could no longer afford to sit back, doing nothing about the problems that are daily threatening the collective well-being of Nigerians.\n\nHe stated that his group has resolved to embark on the mission of making Nigeria work for Nigerians.\n\nAccording to Farakwai, though TNN has realised the \u201cenormous task ahead\u201d, Obasanjo\u2019s endorsement of the group will be a morale booster.\n\n\u201cWe intend to introduce to the polity, such narratives that will eradicate poverty, religious extremism, hate, political strife, disunity, inequity and corruption,\u201d he added.\n\nCommenting on the importance of the former president to the TNN\u2019s advocacy, a former member of the National Assembly, who also doubles as the North-east Zonal Coordinator of TNN, Senator Abdulaziz Ibrahim, said Obasanjo\u2019s past achievements, both as a military head of state and a civilian president, endeared him to the group.\n\n\u201cBack in history as military head of state, the toughest and the roughest terrain in Nigeria, you have heard of Mambilla. It was Baba as military head of state who gave the contract for the tarring of the road to Mambilla.\n\n\u201cIt was only 20 kilometers and it took them 10 years to bring down the rock to get the road to Mambilla.\n\n\u201cWhen I became the senator, there was no single grid of electricity in the whole of Taraba State.\n\n\u201cThe baba (Obasanjo) you are seeing here approved the biggest transmission line from Yobe to Jalingo. No electricity, no roads, nothing in Taraba before he came to our rescue as head of state and president,\u201d Ibrahim said.\n\nIbrahim, who represented Taraba Central Senatorial District between 1999 and 2003, described Obasanjo as a leader that would be remembered for the positive influence he made on the state.\n\nHe, however, said it would be unfair to Obasanjo if he and his kinsmen failed to appreciate him publicly for the achievements he recorded for Taraba while in office.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) yesterday predicted that oil price could climb as high as $200 per barrel, as banks and major International Oil Companies (IOCs) withdraw from funding critical projects in the industry, leading to supply shortage and a huge upsurge in the amount the commodity is sold.\n\nIt said with the accelerated push to migrate to low carbon-intensive alternatives, time would tell whether the decisions being taken \u201cvery hastily\u201d by some big oil companies would remain the right decisions.\n\nGroup General Manager, National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS), a subsidiary of NNPC, Mr. Bala Wunti, said at the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit (NIPS), in Abuja, that the impact of the current decision to stop investing in the sector would begin to manifest in about five years, shooting oil price to around $200.\n\nOther speakers at the session included the Deputy Managing Director, Deep Water, Total, Mr. Victor Bandele; Managing Director, Shell Nigeria E&P, Mr. Bayo Ojulari; Managing Director, Aftrac Limited, Mrs Patricia Simon-Hart; Managing Director, Aiteo Eastern E&P, Mr. Victor Okoronkwo, who was represented, and Managing Director, Waltersmith Petroman Oil, Mr. Chike Nwosu.\n\nWunti stated that the world is waiting to see whether the decision to begin defunding hydrocarbons are being compelled by activism or based on data, science, and reality.\n\nHe said: \u201cI was talking to one of my senior colleagues yesterday, and he said, well, it is time for someone to speak the truth. If nothing is done and this trend continues, guys, we should be ready for a $200 per barrel of oil. The reason is simple, if you stop investing in the oil and gas sector, you can only produce what you have today.\n\n\u201cAnd what you have today, in many instances in five years, it will start declining, that is, if you we are not already in a declining mode, because many in Nigeria are in declining mode. So, if there\u2019s no fresh capital for either brownfield or greenfield investment, we cannot grow production; if we don\u2019t grow the production, the consequence is that we\u2019re building a short supply for tomorrow.\n\n\u201cIn basic economics, short supply means a higher price. So this is the world. This is the world that we see today and this has presented some very emergent trends.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, despite the decreasing investment in fossil fuels, demand for gas will increase as part of the energy mix, and this will continue to power businesses.\n\nHe predicted a growing power demand, saying that by 2050, the power consumption globally is going to grow from the current level of 27 terra joules of electricity to about 54 terra joules of electricity, exactly twice the current consumption.\n\nWhile raising posers over where the electrical energy is going to come from, he said the present outlook showed both opportunities and some challenges.\n\nHe stated that the reason for choosing gas is not far-fetched, being a low-carbon intensive hydrocarbon.\n\n\u201cSo, we see thermal power plant growing and these plants will need gas, and that indeed has led some of us to believe that gas, contrary to what many people think, is a destination for this transition point and a bridge fuel.\n\n\u201cIn my own view, gas is going to be a destination fuel because at the end of the day, gas will be there, it will be there in the front, pronounced,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, as a gas country, with the declaration of the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d, it means the stage is now set and Nigeria can take advantage and position itself for the future.\n\nWunti said energy demand would continue to come from energy-deficient countries where energy poverty was pronounced and in undeveloped countries as well as developing countries. He added that the developed world has reached its saturation level.\n\n\u201cWhere we see growth coming is in the emerging markets. Nigeria is one of them, Turkey, India is another, even China. You will see clearly that demand for hydrocarbon is going to come not from the US. Our hydrocarbon, when we export today, is heading to Asia, India, China,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said renewables would only be relevant for \u201cintermittent power\u201d, adding that it will take a long time for carbon-free energy sources to take a foothold globally.\n\nWunti said big oil companies might reduce investment in hydrocarbon, the lowest being 10 per cent reduction and the largest being 40 per cent.\n\nAt the last estimation, Wunti stated that Nigeria has 36.89 barrels oil reserve and about 203 TCF of gas, meaning that NAPIMS controls about 70-75 per cent of the total oil reserves.\n\nOn the challenge of the cost of production, he said: \u201cAll we know is that $30 is very high, and therefore in reducing that, it presents a lot of opportunities for service contractors to come out with a very creative solution.\u201d He stated that the target was to hit a single-digit production cost.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Members of famous Indian family the Sandesaras, indicted or on the run for tax evasion, loan fraud, and other alleged offences enjoy state protection from Albania, Kosovo, and Nigeria, says an investigative report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).\n\nThe Sandesaras\u2014Chetankumar, his wife Diptiben, and elder brother Nitin had been on the run since 2017, when authorities in India accused them of defrauding local banks out of loans worth over $700 million at the time.\n\nAbubakar Malami\n\nDespite the allegations and their fugitive status, the family had been allowed to invest in projects in Albania, Kosovo, and Nigeria. In fact, they hold Albanian and Nigerian passports.\n\nThe OCCRP investigation says high-ranking Albanian and Nigerian officials helped the family evade repeated attempts to extradite them to India. Police reports, court documents, interviews, and flight data obtained by reporters show how these officials allowed the family to move freely and continue to run their businesses while at large.\n\nNigeria's Attorney-General rebuffed an Indian request for their extradition, arguing that the case appeared to be politically motivated.\n\nDocuments obtained by OCCRP also show that Indian state companies continued to buy hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of oil sourced from the Sandesaras\u2019 Nigerian firm after the family went on the run - implying that the family yet maintains ties with some state authorities in India.\n\nThe family owns Nigeria-based Sterling Oil Exploration and Energy Production Company (SEEPCO).\n\nThe brothers\u2014Nitin Sandesara and Chetankumar Sandesara\u2014control some 340 companies, including 92 outside India in energy, construction, and healthcare. Their conglomerate has claimed to be worth nearly $7 billion.\n\nAs their wealth grew, the family became a staple of the Indian tabloids, which gushed about their extravagant properties, lavish parties, and appearances with Bollywood stars. In one anecdote, Chetankumar reportedly complained to journalists when a media portal underestimated the cost of the family\u2019s new jet.\n\nBut the Sandesaras\u2019 fortunes shifted in the fall of 2017 when the Central Bureau of Investigation in New Delhi accused them and their company of cheating and criminal conspiracy. A subsequent investigation by the Indian government\u2019s Enforcement Directorate claimed that their Sterling Biotech group had criminally acquired and laundered over $700 million for the benefit of its \u201cpromoters,\u201d including the Sandesara brothers and Diptiben.\n\nInvestigators claimed that the family\u2019s companies had obtained the money by fraudulently obtaining loans from various Indian banks. In 2019, the amount those banks declared as fraudulent had risen to over $1.1 billion (about N600 billion).\n\nMuch of this money was allegedly siphoned off using shell companies which listed employees and associates of Sterling Biotech as their shareholders and directors. Prosecutors say the money was transferred under the guise of asset purchases and property transactions. These transactions were also allegedly used to inflate the balance sheets of the shell companies, which then borrowed even more money from the banks and diverted those funds as well.\n\nThe Sandesaras also appear to have played politics in Kosovo. In February 2019, Kosovo\u2019s then Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj posted on Facebook that he had met with Chetankumar Sandesara, describing him as a \u201crepresentative of \u2018Sandesara Group\u2019 from Nigeria,\u201d to discuss investments in tourism and agriculture.\n\nThey have found shelter in Nigeria, along with lucrative business opportunities.\n\nIn 2011, SEEPCO partnered with Nigerian-owned Allenne Energy Ltd. on a concession licence to exploit an oil field worth over $3 billion. Nigeria\u2019s then-president Goodluck Jonathan named Sterling as one of the country\u2019s top 100 businesses in 2014.\n\nThe accusations against them back home do not seem to have troubled Nigerian officials. A month after they were charged in India, Khadija Bukar Abba Ibrahim, who was Nigeria\u2019s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs between 2016 and 2018, wrote to the Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs asking for Nitin Sandesara to be appointed honorary consul to Nigeria. She cited Nitin\u2019s \u201ceffort to expand the friendship\u201d between Nigeria and Albania and \u201cthe need to provide [an] avenue for boosting trade and investment relations between the two countries.\u201d\n\nAlbanian authorities immediately began the process, and Nitin received the position in January 2019, a year after he and his brother received their Albanian citizenship.\n\nIn June 2018, Nigeria\u2019s judiciary also handed down a ruling that reinforced the narrative that the Sandesaras had faced persecution by Indian authorities. The decision was made as part of a suit filed by Allenne Energy to prevent information about the Nigerian oil concession from being shared with any law enforcement agencies or banks in India or Nigeria.\n\nAllenne\u2019s suit alleged that the Indian banks were acting with \u201culterior motives\u201d and asked the court for a declaration that the \u201cchange of government in India as well as the government policies and political and religious victimization and persecution of [SEEPCO] constitute force majeure capable of raising concerns by [Allenne Energy] in protecting its interest.\u201d\n\nA judge in Nigeria\u2019s Federal High Court agreed, writing that the Sandesara brothers and their families were being \u201ctargeted by Indian government agencies\u201d for their political and religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cIt would be inappropriate for this court to allow any Nigerian company to be economically imperiled, because of political vendetta of Indian Government and banks,\u201d the judge\u2019s statement read. \u201cNigeria is keen on keeping and protecting the present legitimate investors and to even encourage more to come into the economy.\u201d\n\nLater, in 2019, Nigeria\u2019s justice ministry made a similar argument when it rejected a request from India to extradite members of the Sandesara family, citing its power to refuse requests if it believes that the offence is \u201cpolitical in nature.\u201d\n\nPrashant Bhushan, the prominent public interest lawyer in India, called the High Court\u2019s decision \u201claughable,\u201d and pointed out that the Sandesaras are close to a former top Central Bureau of Investigation officer, R.K. Asthana, whose daughter\u2019s wedding was held in their farmhouse.\n\n\u201cSomeone who is so close to Asthana cannot fear persecution by the Indian government,\u201d said Bhushan, who in late 2017 made public a diary belonging to the Sandesaras that allegedly detailed kickbacks to top Indian officials. \u201cA sham show is being put on to show that an attempt to extradite them is being made.\u201d\n\nWhether or to what extent the Sandesaras have been protected in India is a matter of debate. Indian authorities have reportedly sought to freeze over $2 billion worth of Sandesara assets as part of their investigation.\n\nBut oil shipping data provided to OCCRP also shows that state-run Indian companies continued buying Nigerian crude sourced from SEEPCO even after the money laundering charges against the Sandesaras, raising questions about how hard the Indian state and the defrauded banks are working to reclaim the money they allege the family stole.\n\nThe Nigerian court decision in the case filed by Allenne, handed down on June 8, 2018, ultimately helped the Sandesaras avoid extradition from Albania as well. A copy of both this case and the decision by Nigeria not to extradite the four family members were given to the Tirana District Court by a special envoy of the Nigerian government.\n\nRejecting to order extradition, an Albanian judge argued that Nigeria\u2019s High Court had shown the Sandesara family were being targeted because of their \u201cpolitical and religious beliefs.\u201d",

          "text": "Lai Mohammed, minister of information, says the ban on Twitter in Nigeria does not stifle the citizens\u2019 freedom of expression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter was suspended two days after it deleted a tweet from President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s handle for violating its policy.\n\nSpeaking on the development on Wednesday, the minister said Nigerians still have the options of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and other social media platforms.\n\nReferring to a fact-check by TheCable, he maintained that Twitter played a prominent role in the destruction that took place after the #EndSARS protest was hijacked, and as such, must be sanctioned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI want to repeat that it is because Twitter has consistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence, that is the reason for suspending their operations in Nigeria,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\n\u201cFor those that have heard that the ban is not effective, to the best of my knowledge, I think the ban is very effective. Many commentators have said suspending the operations of Twitter is like stifling freedom of expression. And I said \u2018no. Twitter is just one of the many platforms through which Nigerians can express themselves. There is Facebook; there is Instagram; there\u2019s WhatsApp; there\u2019s Google Hangout, and others. They have not been suspended.\n\n\u201cWhen I addressed you on Wednesday, I said, among other things that Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is suspect. And I went further to say yes, that Twitter funded the #EndSARS protests in Nigeria last year. And people have challenged it. And I\u2019m glad that TheCable has done some fact finding and their conclusions are as follows: they said the truth is that, fact checking showed that indeed, Twitter played a prominent role in helping to raise funds for the #EndSARS protesters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhether they paid directly, helped to pay, or helped to raise funds, it\u2019s a matter of semantics. So, whether he donated money himself or helped to raise money, the Twitter owner is one of those who helped to fund the #EndSARS protests that was later hijacked, leading to loss of lives and massive destruction of property.\n\n\u201cLike I said last Wednesday, you can see from the fact check the role of Jack Dorsey is suspect. His interest in Nigeria is inimical to our growth. Our decision to suspend Twitter has been lauded by some, it has been decried by some. But we want to make it clear that what is important to us is the sovereignty of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe minister maintained that Twitter must register its presence in the country and must be regulated by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC).",

          "text": "Lai Mohammed, minister of information, says the ban on Twitter in Nigeria does not stifle the citizens\u2019 freedom of expression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter was suspended two days after it deleted a tweet from President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s handle for violating its policy.\n\nSpeaking on the development on Wednesday, the minister said Nigerians still have the options of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and other social media platforms.\n\nReferring to a fact-check by TheCable, he maintained that Twitter played a prominent role in the destruction that took place after the #EndSARS protest was hijacked, and as such, must be sanctioned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI want to repeat that it is because Twitter has consistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence, that is the reason for suspending their operations in Nigeria,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\n\u201cFor those that have heard that the ban is not effective, to the best of my knowledge, I think the ban is very effective. Many commentators have said suspending the operations of Twitter is like stifling freedom of expression. And I said \u2018no. Twitter is just one of the many platforms through which Nigerians can express themselves. There is Facebook; there is Instagram; there\u2019s WhatsApp; there\u2019s Google Hangout, and others. They have not been suspended.\n\n\u201cWhen I addressed you on Wednesday, I said, among other things that Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is suspect. And I went further to say yes, that Twitter funded the #EndSARS protests in Nigeria last year. And people have challenged it. And I\u2019m glad that TheCable has done some fact finding and their conclusions are as follows: they said the truth is that, fact checking showed that indeed, Twitter played a prominent role in helping to raise funds for the #EndSARS protesters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhether they paid directly, helped to pay, or helped to raise funds, it\u2019s a matter of semantics. So, whether he donated money himself or helped to raise money, the Twitter owner is one of those who helped to fund the #EndSARS protests that was later hijacked, leading to loss of lives and massive destruction of property.\n\n\u201cLike I said last Wednesday, you can see from the fact check the role of Jack Dorsey is suspect. His interest in Nigeria is inimical to our growth. Our decision to suspend Twitter has been lauded by some, it has been decried by some. But we want to make it clear that what is important to us is the sovereignty of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe minister maintained that Twitter must register its presence in the country and must be regulated by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC).",

This is an incremental provision to the N100 billion already provided for in the 2021 budget.\n\n\u201cThe council also approved an aggregate sum of N770.60 billion to further enhance the capacity of the defence and security agencies to address current and emerging security challenges in our country.\u201d\n\nAhmed noted that the bill would be transmitted to the national assembly for approval.\n\nShe added that the council also approved permission to borrow N722.53 billion for security expenditures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe will be working with the World Bank to restructure some of the existing facilities to realise this N39.58 billion. We have also been given approval to withdraw N135 billion from some special reserve lobby accounts to part fund this supplementary budget but specifically related to COVID-19 vaccine, salaries and other health-related expenditure as well as the recurrent component of the defence and security expenditures,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFinally, this approval also contains an approval to borrow the sum of 722.53 billion for security expenditures and these are the capital components of the security expenditure in the absence of any other additional supplementary sources of borrowing.

          "text": "This year\u2019s edition of Apple\u2019s annual software developer conference, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), kicked off on Monday with a roughly 90-minute keynote address that saw top company executives show off a slew of new updates for major products.\n\nKey announcements made by the American technology giant included software for iPhone, Mac, iPad, Watch and Apple TV, new health features, and updates to Siri, AirPods, and iCloud. In addition to these, Apple unveiled new updates focused on tightening the protection of its users\u2019 privacy.\n\nA particular update that stood out from Apple\u2019s several privacy-focused measures is \u201cPrivate Relay\u201d. This new feature encrypts all browsing history and prevents third parties from intercepting the communication between your device and the server you\u2019re requesting information from. When turned on, nobody can track a user\u2019s online activity \u2013 not even the internet service provider or Apple itself. This is due to the fact that the feature uses a server maintained by a third-party operator, which will assign temporary IP addresses for users as they browse the internet.\n\nApple\u2019s use of an outside party in the relay system is intentional to prevent even the company from knowing both the user\u2019s identity and what website the user is visiting, it explained.\n\nPrivate relay is the latest in a string of efforts by Apple meant to curb the tracking of its users\u2019 browsing activity by ISPs, advertisers, and other third parties. The feature is likely to go live later this year but Apple has revealed that it won\u2019t be available in some countries due to \u201cregulatory reasons\u201d.\n\nCountries where the company will not offer private relay include South Africa, Egypt, Uganda, Saudi Arabia, Belarus, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, the Philippines and China. In the latter, users live under a vast surveillance system and notorious internet censorship, and Apple has had to make several compromises on privacy to meet the demands of the ruling Communist party.\n\nIt is unsurprising to see African countries on the list of nations excluded from the private relay rollout as cutting off access to the internet and social media is common in the region. A report by privacy protection company Surfshark shows that at least 27 countries in Africa have blocked or heavily restricted social media access since 2015.\n\nLike China, those excluded by Apple have in place some kind of internet censorship regulating their citizens\u2019 online activities \u2013 often in the form of laws guiding against misinformation, hate speech, or cybercrimes \u2013 or have outrightly blocked access to social media and the internet in recent times.\n\nThe Egyptian government in particular has one of the most extensive surveillance networks in Africa and has ordered the blocking of hundreds of websites that belong to news outlets, blogs, human rights organisations, and tools such as virtual private networks used to bypass the blockades.\n\nApple is yet to disclose the outside partners it will use for the private relay system. The company also did not specify if the update will be blocked by internet providers in the countries where the feature is restricted or will simply be excluded from system upgrades for users there.",

          "title": "Exposure to risk: What tech investors fear and find interesting about Nigeria\u2019s Twitter ban",
          "text": "For the second time in six months, a major government announcement is causing startup founders and investors to ponder the effect of politics and sudden regulation on doing business in Nigeria.\n\nIn February, it was the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ban on cryptocurrency transactions. This time it is the ban on Twitter, a social media platform that has been used for everything from crowdsourcing pro-bono lawyers for people in distress and finding missing persons, to raising capital.\n\nOn January 11 this year, the Cowrywise team received a direct message from Sahil Lavingia, a tech entrepreneur and angel investor from Silicon Valley. He had learned about the savings and wealth management startup and wanted to invest, so he reached out the best way he could \u2013 via Twitter.\n\nTwo weeks and two days later, Cowrywise closed a $3 million pre-seed round. It was led by Quona Capital, a multinational investment firm, with Lavingia and other investors participating.\n\n\u201cThe power of Twitter,\u201d Lavingia declared after the announcement.\n\n\u201cThe timing of this DM was just perfect\u2026\u201d Razaq Ahmed, Cowrywise\u2019s CEO, said.\n\nIn a different decade, startup fundraising in Africa involved long-distance travels. Primed by stories of fake companies and phantom Nigerian princes, investors needed to physically verify business authenticity, assess startup-investor chemistry and speak to customers.\n\nIn 2021, investing in Nigeria can take one DM. But this ease and perfection is now under threat.\n\nOne less medium for investor contact\n\nAfter the government ban on Twitter last week, a number of startups are anxious about using the platform.\n\nMost have suspended customer support on Twitter, while some have disclaimed that their accounts are operated outside Nigeria.\n\nThe anxiety around the ban has gotten to the international community of startup investors too.\n\nAs providers of capital, investors influence the pace and scale of innovation. Often, their decision to do so is based on perceptions about the business environment. What are they feeling and fearing about Nigeria now?\n\nIdo Sum, a partner at TLCom Capital, says the ban \u201cmay put a dampener on some foreign investments for tech companies in the short term but this is unlikely to be sustained.\u201d\n\nNigeria grabs attention for being the most populous country in Africa, with 200 million people. That number doesn\u2019t necessarily speak to the opportunity size for every startup; after all, the country\u2019s 40% poverty rate is the highest in the world.\n\n\n\nBut 81% of the country\u2019s 106 million adults have mobile phones and broadband penetration is at 40.6% \u2013 a vast improvement from 19.69% in June 2017. A growing supply of high-quality tech entrepreneurs, including from former employees of startups like Paystack and Andela, is fuelling the rise of more startups each year.\n\nSum, whose firm has invested in uLesson, Okra and Terragon among others, believes investors will continue to focus on this trend.\n\nAs the general partner at Kepple Africa Ventures, Satoshi Shinada is constantly watching the 89 companies they have invested in across 11 countries. He\u2019s had to pay particular attention to their Nigeria portfolio \u2013 which includes Decagon, Lifestores Pharmacy, Bamboo and BuyCoins \u2013 following a flurry of regulatory actions this year.\n\n\u201cI think the ban on Twitter will definitely affect investor sentiments and perception about Nigeria negatively, especially foreign investors who invest in Nigeria remotely,\u201d Shinada says.\n\nAs he describes it, Twitter has been a medium for such investors to establish contacts and engage in conversations that illuminate the market opportunity in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, he thinks that the impact will be minimal. With Nigerians finding alternative paths to retain access to Twitter, it shows that the market is resilient, keeping the investment corridor open for business.\n\nTwo other tech investors who spoke to TechCabal largely agreed with this view of the Twitter ban\u2019s possible effect on foreign investments into tech startups.\n\nFive days after internet service providers turned off the Twitter switch, the site is still being accessed through VPNs. Therefore, DMs remain open for communication between prospective investors and founding teams. It helps that such chats are never public unless one party divulges conversation history.\n\nBut even in terms of communication, other avenues exist. Email and then WhatsApp remain the major channels for hashing out term sheet details, one investor said. Zoom calls and regular phone conversations still work.\n\nMore discount on regulatory risk\n\nOne area of investment concern following the Twitter ban is \u201ca higher sense of political and regulatory risk,\u201d where unilateral decisions can put whole companies in jeopardy.\n\nBeyond assessing Nigerian startups on market size and tech gadgets penetration, there will now be a need to put a lot more discount on potential returns by taking political risk into account.\n\nBut if investors have to put a lot more political-risk discount on potential returns, would that not increase their scepticism to invest in the first place?\n\nIt would, for firms who find that the adjusted returns do not fit their investment strategy. Where a firm sets its Internal Rate of Return at 40% and gets 20% after factoring in these risks, it would be inclined to decline such opportunities.\n\nWhat that does is that an investor served with a similar opportunity in a lower-risk market, say Ghana, may likely fund the Ghanaian startup instead.\n\nThat said, investors who write million-dollar tickets and have taken a long-term view of their play in Nigeria will likely not be turned off by such discounts.\n\n\u201cFor investors like ourselves who are focused on Africa for the long term, this has no effect, and we hope that this will be the case for non Africa based investors as well, who will keep seeing the great long term potential and upside and keep increasing their exposure to the African tech ecosystem,\u201d says Sum, the TLCom Capital partner.\n\nHe also hopes that the Nigerian government will realise that bans have not worked and seek collaborations and partnerships with the \u201cvery influential\u201d tech community as a path forward.",

          "title": "Femi Iromini is improving the employability of students in Nigeria",
          "text": "Femi Iromini has been active in the African tech ecosystem for the past 5 years. As a young student, he ran many businesses\u2014 at one point, he performed due diligence for foreign investors looking to invest in African startups. Now he\u2019s focused on improving the Nigerian education system and the employability of Nigerian graduates.\n\nTo understand how he got here, let\u2019s look at his life\u2019s journey.\n\nReading Gifted Hands by Ben Carson at an early age sparked Iromini\u2019s interest in medicine. This interest was also encouraged by his secondary school teachers. He was the best student in chemistry, physics and maths so naturally, they all thought he would do well to study medicine.\n\nHe secured admission into the university and had begun studying medicine for some months before his father pulled him out of school.\n\n\u201cHe just told me that he didn\u2019t think the school was meant for me,\u201d Iromini told me.\n\nFortunately, Iromini got into university at a young age so taking an involuntary gap year wasn\u2019t too big a deal.\n\nSwitching to Geophysics\n\nIromini\u2019s switch to geophysics is a story that many may relate with. It involves a rich uncle and a desire to be as rich as the said uncle.\n\nOne day, while he was at home, this uncle came around. As they played chess, Iromini asked him what he did for a living. He worked with the oil company ExxonMobil and he had studied geophysics.\n\nIromini recalled, \u201cWhen my uncle mentioned geophysics, I thought to myself, \u2018This must be God speaking to me.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith the career prospects of geophysics looking promising, he decided to study geophysics.\n\nA year into studying geophysics at Obafemi Awolowo University, he started questioning whether he had made the right choice.\n\nThe answer to that question came during a field trip to Ekiti. The students and lecturer had gone out to identify some rocks and minerals.\n\n\u201cDuring this field trip, a professor leading the delegates carried a boulder. I could see he was passionate about it. He then said if you really want to succeed as a geologist you need to fall in love with rocks. You need to romance rocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was at the back, watching and listening. I didn\u2019t find that appealing. I told myself there are better things in life to romance than rocks.\u201d\n\nNone of his lecturers back at school were passionate about rocks and they didn\u2019t answer field questions with certainty. By the end of the trip, he knew he wasn\u2019t going to end up in a career related to geophysics.\n\nThat trip became a turning point for him and pushed him to attend a variety of non-academic events. He got into a number of social impact and entrepreneurial programs like the One Young World, Goldman Sachs Program, World Business Dialogue and Global University Initiative. These programs expanded his mind and opened him up to a world of possibilities.\n\nContributing to society through business\n\nDuring one of these programs, his life took a turn after Nelson Mandela charged him and other participants to focus on changing Africa by looking for ways to contribute.\n\nHe returned from the program and started businesses in school. He opened a laundry business and restaurants on three campuses. He also started a social enterprise that helped students get internships.\n\nAs he built these businesses, other students supported him. Back then, he didn\u2019t know anything about financing. He just wrote a letter soliciting contributions from his peers and they showed up. He bought his first washing machine after a \u20a620,000 ($125 at the time) contribution came in from another student.\n\nDespite the initial support he was fortunate enough to receive, he realised it was difficult to get the additional financial support he needed to build his businesses. The traditional funding channels weren\u2019t a viable option because the business didn\u2019t have a track record.\n\nDuring this phase he stumbled on Kickstarter \u2013 a crowdfunding platform. At the time, it was a new idea that opened up his mind to the concept that people can leverage their social capital to raise funds. His businesses thrived because other people believed and supported him, so he wanted to build a similar platform for others around him to raise funds.\n\nTo build this platform he collaborated with some Indian engineers he met during a program he attended years before. Building the platform took longer than expected and he spent more money than he planned to.\n\nTo increase the pace of development, he learnt a bit of coding and joined in building the platform.\n\nEventually, Crowdy, a platform that helped people in his community raise funds from family and friends, was launched. Its fundraising process was similar to the rolling fund investment model.\n\nIn 2014, fresh out of school and still running the Crowdy platform, he was approached by AXA Venture Partners, they needed help in deal analysis and sourcing for African startups.\n\n\u201cThey were looking to invest in Africa, but they weren\u2019t sure about the numbers. With Crowdy we were able to aggregate startups, especially in East Africa for them. We were more like deal aggregators.\u201d\n\nIromini and his team at Crowdy helped conduct due diligence on the startups they referred to AXA Venture Partners, they were paid for the consulting services they offered.\n\nWhile at Crowdy, Iromini also partnered with the cofounding team for the first few months of the formation of agritech company Farmcrowdy.\n\nPreparing students for employment\n\nIn 2013, while still running Crowder he enrolled in an post graduate program in innovation and entrepreneurship at Stanford University. During the program, he spent a lot of time around the Stanford campus and other neighbouring universities. He noticed a common denominator that was missing back home. In every university, there was a career center. The schools were intentional about preparing students for the world of employment.\n\nComparing this approach with his undergraduate days where there was no structure around preparing students for employment, he decided to do something about this problem.\n\n\u201cUniversities should be thinking about career outcomes. How many [of their] graduates are employed, unemployed or furthering their education. Career outcomes are a selling proposition for universities,\u201d Iromini said.\n\nThis led to the creation of Lead 360, an education technology company. The company has worked with a number of public and private universities like Covenant University and Afe Babalola.\n\nBased on the few engagements Lead 360 had with these universities, they learned that it\u2019s more than just establishing a career centre in these schools. Making students more employable requires a step by step approach.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s typically found is that in many of these schools, in the final year, a one-week seminar on employability will be organised. You\u2019re meant to have a career advisor whose performance is based on the successful employment of students. Someone who helps with internships, reviewing CVs and evaluating the interests of students,\u201d Iromini said.\n\nAs opposed to engaging with governments and universities directly, Lead 360 has adjusted its model to focus on working with institutions like the World Bank and the International Labour Organisation first, then using them to engage with the governments and universities. It has proven to be more effective.\n\nThey\u2019ve successfully collaboration with the state governments and corporate organisations to develop over 40 digital centres like one in Makoko, Yaba, Lagos.\n\nLead 360 is working on a few projects right now. Top on the list is a labour market information system. A system that informs the government and universities on what skillsets employers are looking for and how many students have these skillsets in real time. This project is funded by international agencies.\n\nIt also has other solutions for students like career services, a learning management system, a transcript management system, and an education financing product.\n\nAs someone who has always sought to solve problems around him, Iromini is taking the Nigerian education system heads on.\n\nBy 2050, Africa is going to have a large population with Nigeria at the forefront, he is constantly asking himself, \u201cwhat are we going to do with this population?\u201d",

          "text": "It\u2019s a revolutionary feature that helps clients evaluate and choose Master Traders\n\nOctaFX Copytrading is a popular service that allows clients to profit by copying trades from professional traders, also known as Master Traders. The company recently introduced Risk Score\u2014a game-changing feature that enables copiers to choose Master Traders based on the risk of their trading strategy.\n\nOctaFX Copytrading is a top-rated service among the company\u2019s clients. There are two great reasons for its popularity. First, you can access the service with just one tap through the OctaFX Copytrading app or the desktop version. Second, you need zero Forex expertise to start making a profit.\n\nWondering how it works? The clients, known as copiers, choose professional traders, known as Master Traders, to copy their trades. Whenever a Master Trader opens an order, the same order opens in a copier\u2019s account automatically. That way, a copier can simply trust a Master Trader\u2019s expertise and profit with minimum effort.\n\nHowever, it is important to choose a Master Trader wisely and invest your funds securely. For this reason, OctaFX offers a Master Rating, where the best traders are placed at the top. Previously, they were evaluated only by their profitability and popularity. Now OctaFX took it to the next level.\n\nOctaFX Copytrading introduced Risk Score\u2014a new feature that shows how risky each Master Trader\u2019s strategy is. The score is calculated by a special algorithm and depends on a Master Trader\u2019s average profit, number of orders, and how stable their strategy is. The introduction of Risk Score is fundamental because copiers can now choose a Master Trader based not only on their profit but also on their strategy. Master Traders who score 1 or 2 on a 6-point scale apply more stable, long-term oriented, and less risky strategies.\n\nOctaFX hopes that with this new feature, their copy trading clients will be able to choose Master Traders who best suit their preferences.\n\nOctaFX is a global broker that provides online trading services worldwide since 2011. It offers a state-of-the-art trading experience to over 7 million trading accounts globally. OctaFX has won more than 40 awards since its foundation, including the \u2018Best ECN Broker 2020\u2019 award from World Finance and more recently the 2021 \u2018Best Forex Broker Asia\u2019 award and the 2020 \u2018Most Transparent Broker\u2019 award from Global Banking & Finance Review and Forex Awards, respectively.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have definitely offered more people access to the global financial system \u2014 but African consumers have repeatedly told us that Bitcoin and Ethereum can still be way too expensive to use in many cases, and it is therefore, not necessarily the answer for the financial needs of all communities. More African Bitcoin and Ethereum users are increasingly using other cryptocurrencies which offer better value for money\u201d\n\nOnuoha added: \u201cIn response to consumer demand, we are solely focused on the ease of sending and receiving value through cryptocurrency using the most affordable means. Our vision is to bring Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to low and middle income countries where remittances account for 5% or more of GDP and make these DeFi services more accessible.\u201d\n\nThe threshold for sending and receiving money using crypto on EasyShare.Africa is capped at a maximum of US$2,500 per transaction and a minimum of US$1. Users can seamlessly send money to a mobile wallet or bank account using crypto in five easy steps. EasyShare.Africa supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT ERC20) and other low transaction cost cryptocurrencies such as Binance Coin (BNB), Litecoin (LTC), Tether (USDT TRC20) and Tron (TRX). More cryptocurrency options will be added in due course.\n\nThe Easyshare.Africa platform is crowdsourcing to meet its expansion plans\n\nIn addition to serving ordinary consumers, Easyshare.Africa is committed to extending its impact, by pioneering the world\u2019s first decentralized network of verified peer to peer crypto-powered remittance agents. Current crypto remittance systems and peer to peer platforms use centralized escrows to guarantee settlement. This centralized escrow model is oftentimes plagued with bad actors, as well as centralized judges and juries settling disputes. EasyShare.Africa improves on this crypto peer-to-peer remittance model by adding a decentralized layer where verified remittance agents can stake SHARE Token \u2013 the native crypto of the Easyshare ecosystem \u2013 as collateral/insurance to guarantee the agents complete transactions.\n\nThe Easyshare model is poised to contribute to eight out of the seventeen United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by making a case for the unbanked and underbanked through offering various services such as micro remittances, microfinance loans, savings, insurance, payments, e-commerce and more for low-income populations in Africa and other emerging markets.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing\n\nNigeria\u2019s information minister\u2019s invitation for questioning over Twitter ban\n\nNigerian Uber and Bolt drivers\u2019 partnership with local ride-hailing companies\n\nBolt\u2019s electric tuk-tuks and e-bikes in Kenya\n\nNigeria\u2019s information minister invited for questioning over Twitter ban\n\nIn yet another twist to Nigeria\u2019s Twitter saga in Nigeria, the House of Representatives has invited the Minister for Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, to brief the house over the ban on the social network.\n\nThis is coming after widespread criticism by citizens over lawmakers\u2019 silence since the ban was announced. We even had some lawyers discuss the legality of the ban.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the resumption of plenary duties, the House set up a Committee on Communication, Justice, Information and Culture, and National Security and Intelligence.\n\nWhat has been said? The speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, ordered the Committee to investigate the legality of the Federal Government\u2019s ban and report to the house within 10 days.\n\nHe noted that the legislative body recognised the value of social media as a tool for communication and commerce in the country but insisted that it must be balanced with the need to protect national interests.\n\nExternal pressure? Various bodies, including High Commissions and Embassies of foreign nations spoke out against the Twitter ban. However, this is the first response by the country\u2019s lawmakers.\n\nUber and Bolt drivers set to partner with local companies\n\nFighting back? The National President, Professional E-Hailing Drivers and Private Owners Association (PEDPA), Mr Idris Shonuga, has announced plans by members of the body to ditch Uber and Bolt in favor of local companies, Active Rides and My Cab App.\n\nThe drivers hope that this new arrangement would improve their welfare and customer service while giving the Association a greater say in decisions affecting its members.\n\nRecall that in April 2021, riders on Uber and Bolt drivers embarked on a week long warning strike. They called on the ride-hailing companies to review prices in line with increased living expenses in the country.\n\nUber responded with a 13% price hike for its UberX offering. However, it appears that the drivers remain dissatisfied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe not enough: While it seems drivers are getting improved conditions with this new arrangement, it is not yet clear how the Association\u2019s plan to partner with the local ride-hailing companies would play out. Its success would most likely hinge on users\u2019 adoption of the two partners which are relatively unknown.\n\nGo deeper with this article: Uber, Bolt drivers move to dump ride hailing companies, partner with indigenous firms\n\nBolt unveils electric tuk-tuks in Kenya\n\nBolt Foods electric motorcycles. Source: Techish\n\nBolt has unveiled electric tuk-tuks \u2014 tricycles \u2014 and e-bicycles in Kenya. The move is geared towards eliminating the challenges associated with fluctuating fuel prices.\n\nWith this, Kenya becomes the first African country where Bolt has launched its electric bike service as it continues a trend of eco-friendly initiatives in the country.\n\nIn March 2021, the mobility startup introduced Bolt Green using electric and hybrid cars to reduce emissions during trips.\n\nFor now, only Bolt Food couriers would use these bicycles and tuk-tuks as they look to expand into other towns.\n\nThese initiatives are part of Green Plan \u2014 Bolt\u2019s global environmental strategy \u2014 which aims to reduce the company\u2019s environmental footprint by providing commuters with eco-friendly options.\n\nOur reporter, Joy Matthew, delved deeper into this story here.\n\nSME Clinic by Techpoint\n\nOne of the lessons we learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic was how technology could make a difference for small and medium enterprises.

          "title": "Global EV adoption: The reality in Africa may be different",
          "text": "A decade ago, the notion that Electric Vehicles (EVs) could be an alternative to the popular gas vehicles was unthinkable. Then, electric vehicles were more for research & development projects and the few that roamed the roads were so expensive that they were exclusive to the rich.\n\nHowever, thanks to technological advancements, evolving policies and the growing popularity of EV companies like Jet Motor Company, EVs are now sharing the same roads with conventional vehicles. And some regions already perceived it as the future of transportation.\n\nAccording to reports, the adoption of EVs across the globe is rapidly gaining steam. It is estimated that adoption has increased more than six-fold since 2015.\n\nLast year, over 11 million registered electric vehicles including cars, buses, vans and trucks were on the road across the world. This number is projected to rise to 145 million by the end of the decade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe number of different EV car models available in the market has risen to 370\n\nIn terms of sales, the past year was similarly a ground-breaking one for EVs. Sales grew globally by 41% in 2020 despite the 16% pandemic related drop in overall car sales across the world.\n\nEurope overtook China as the centre of the global electric car market for the first time. The region saw electric car sales of 3 million, with registrations doubling to 1.4 million, while in China\u2019s increased to 1.2 million.\n\nChina has been the world\u2019s largest market since 2015. It has almost five million EVs, accounting for more than half of the world\u2019s total, according to the Chinese Ministry of Public Security.\n\nThe US and Africa still lag in the transition to EVs. However, while the world\u2019s biggest economy has started adopting measures that would benefit the adoption soon, Africa has shown little progress.\n\nThe International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) says the huge gap in adoption between regions is related to the level of the challenges affecting the EVs growth.\n\nEVs Challenges in Africa\n\nElectric vehicles remain rare in most of Africa, the probability of finding one is about one in a million. In South Africa, which is thought to be the largest EV market on the continent, only 1,000 out of more than 12 million vehicles on its roads are EVs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven fewer electric cars are in operation in most other African countries. This is because the most popular vehicles are second-hand cars.\n\nReports estimated that about 40% of the global exports of used vehicles go to Africa. Specifically, in Nigeria, Kenya and Ethiopia it is estimated that the proportion reaches about 80\u201390% of total vehicles imported.\n\nGovernment Policies\n\nHowever, this might not change soon. Unlike Europe where government policies are forcing automotive markets to embrace more climate-friendly options like Evs, Africa\u2019s governments are more relaxed.\n\nOnly one African country, Cape Verde, has taken steps to phase out the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles by targeting an end to imports of such vehicles by 2035.\n\nIn comparison, about 17 countries have made similar laws across Asia, Europe and America. In addition to that, many of the countries pledge to SDGs net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nPoor Infrastructure \u2013 Roads, Electricity, EV chargers\n\nSecondly, even the relatively slow adoption of EVs in Africa faces infrastructural challenges like weak electricity grids, Bad roads and lack of public E-chargers.\n\nWhile grids in Europe have been able to cope with electric mobility, electricity systems in many African countries are already under strain. Frequent blackouts in some countries could limit consumer demand for electric cars, as it cuts off access to transport.\n\nFor example, in Nigeria, the average access to electricity is about 12 hours and there are no known public EV charging stations in the country.\n\nThings are a bit better in SouthAfrica. The country is ranked fifth globally in the ratio of public electric vehicle (EV) chargers to electric vehicles in 2020. Only Korea, Chile, Mexico, and the Netherlands have more chargers per EV.\n\nHowever, that is just one out of 54 countries that are on the continent.\n\nInsufficient charging infrastructure continues to prevent wider use, as does the low supply of appropriate electric vehicles in many sectors, such as heavy industry.\n\nLess than the average cost of living\n\nThe cost of EVs have dropped drastically over the years, the advancement in Battery Technology and the huge investment in EV startups have made buying an EV affordable.\n\nHowever, despite falling battery costs, the promise of savings over the lifetime of an EV from lower fuel and maintenance costs, the upfront prices remain out of the range of average Africa.\n\nAccording to Cox Automotive, the average cost of a new electric vehicle is about $55,600 (N23M). This is way above the average yearly salary of N2M made by the average Nigerian living in Lagos.\n\nA local solution\n\nDespite the many problems plaguing the adoption of EVs in Africa, A handful of startups and companies in several countries are building electronic vehicles to push adoption within the continent.\n\nThese companies are finally bringing the electric-car revolution to the streets of Africa with the production of electric-vehicle fleets of light carriers and motorcycles\u2014vehicles well suited for the continent\u2019s challenging roads.\n\nWith smart technologies and appropriate regulation, these EVs could become an asset rather than a threat to grid stability, through dynamic charging and vehicle-to-grid applications.\n\nWhile electricity systems in many African countries are currently limited, they are expanding fast: power generation capacity is expected to more than double by 2040.\n\nAfrica has the smallest per-capita car ownership level of any region in the world. Transportation using buses, taxis and motorcycles are more popular than personal cars, this shows that it may be better suited to electrification first.\n\nIn addition, the shift to transport electrification will be far easier to manage if it is factored into grid upgrades at an early stage, instead of taking grid operators by surprise further down the line to consumers.\n\nSome examples of these startups are Kenya-based ARC Ride launched electric two- and three-wheelers for UberEats deliveries in Nairobi. In Kigali, Rwandan start-up Ampersand is introducing a fleet of electric motorcycle taxis and plans to expand to other East African countries.\n\nIn Uganda, locally manufactured electric buses from Kiira Motors have started transporting passengers in Kampala. Finally in Nigeria, Jet Motor Company has partnered with GIG Logistics to provide its EVs for both transport and logistics services in the Nigerian market.\n\nIn Summary\n\nWhile progress is being made, electric cars currently make up 1% of the global fleet. And significant barriers to the wholesale adoption of EVs remain. The report predicts that with even bolder climate programmes and emission reduction targets, there could be up to 230 million electric vehicles on our streets \u2013 12% of all road transport \u2013 by 2030.\n\nSimilarly in Africa, SDG scenarios are predicting around 40% of light vehicles in Africa are electric by 2050.\n\nWith market forces gaining momentum, consumer consciousness on the rise and the emergence of Local EV companies this forecast is not impossible.\n\nHowever, for Africa to become a fast-growing source of demand for electric transport, governments and investors need to support these innovations to scale up and accelerate adoption.",

          "text": "The Buhari regime like NEPA, had no friends. They came to power proclaiming themselves friends of the people. They had come, so they assured an unsuspecting populace to save them from the suffocating embrace of the politicians. But a few weeks after the duo of Muhammadu Buhari and Tunde Idiagbon marched triumphantly into Dodan Barracks, the seat of government, Nigerians were already asking themselves; \u201cWith friends like these, who needs enemies?\u201d\n\nThe self-styled off-shoot government of the decisive Muhammed/Obasanjo regime did not move fast to make it appear as if it deliberately wanted to estrange itself from the society. This its top men did with an unparalleled arrogance and unnecessary combativeness, a mindless witch-hunting and needless antagonism against all sections of the populace. It was like a death wish.\n\nThe government\u2019s hostile attitude was so suffocating that it was commonplace for Idiagbon to appear on the television network and in his usual aggressive manner pronounce: \u201cYou are warned to abide by \u2026.\u201d When he was not warning people, he was threatening to \u201cdeal ruthlessly\u201d with anyone who dared disagree. On one occasion when Idiagbon smiled, it made headline news. It was that bad.\n\nThere had not been any government in the history of Nigeria that had so blatantly disregarded public opinion as did the Buhari regime. The ousted head of state\u2019s standard reply whenever a slight pressure built up on any particular issue was \u201cwe cannot be rushed.\u201d The country was run as a personal fiefdom, an apparatus to use in settling personal scores.\n\nThe first indication of this came when he granted his first interview to the local press. When Dele Giwa, Ray Ekpu and Yakubu Mohammed, then with the Concord asked what his government\u2019s attitude to the press would be. Buhari went into a fit of anger. \u201cl will surely tamper with press freedom.\u201d he said, almost shouting.\n\nHis reason was that he was embarrassed with the allegedly missing N2.8 billion oil money reports which broke after he left the government of Obasanjo as Commissioner for Petroleum in 1979. And that was how the infamous decree number four which stipulated a jail term for a journalist who published an embarrassing report about a public Official, even if it was true, came into being.\n\nRead Also: What a Netflix Documentary Taught me About Buhari\u2019s War on Everybody\n\nEven in anticipation of the official promulgation of the decree, it was already being put into use when four months into its tenure, the government ordered the arrest and detention of Tunde Thompson and Nduka Irabor, both reporters of The Guardian. The government was piqued because of a minor report concerning ambassadorial postings. Shortly after, the decree was published and a special tribunal chaired by Olalere Ayinde was set up to try the two reporters.\n\nDespite a massive outpouring of public demonstrations, including pleas from traditional rulers and some of Buhari\u2019s former bosses, both journalists were tried and convicted, they were arrested on April 4 and jailed on June 4 under Decree 4, the alienation of the press and the public had set in.\n\nHarassment of journalist did not stop there. Almost every month in their first year, one newspaper editor or another was detained for the slightest excuse. Duro Onabule, editor of National Concord was arrested and detained at least thrice. Once for two weeks; Haroun Adamu editorial adviser of The Punch, a man Buhari had personal animosity against was detained until the government was toppled last week. also kept in jail till the end came for Buhari government was Rufai Ibrahim ex-editor of The Guardian (Sunday) for writing an open letter to Balarabe Musa, the former radical governor of Kaduna state who was impeached by a conservative opposition in 1980.\n\nIn the same boat were Hamza, editor Of Amana, the Hausa language newspaper of the Concord group, Leke Salawu of the Triumph, and only one month ago, Bukar Zarma, editor of New Nigerian and Aliyu Babatunde Ahmed, editor of Sunday New Nigerian.\n\nThe deposed government tried other means to cripple the press as well. There are deliberate policy to starve newspapers of raw materials, especially newsprint. This was done through ridiculously low import license allocation and extremely high import duties. It was so bad at one point that many newspapers retrenched staff and cut their print run and reduced pagination to eight. The government also imported newsprint through the Nigerian Newsprint manufacturing company at Oku Iboku, Itu, for sale to newspapers.\n\nThe government was still not satisfied. It unearthed a dormant directive restricting federal government advertisement placement to the Daily Times and the New Nigerian. Buhari\u2019s press secretary, who has also now lost his job later explained in the government\u2019s usual bland manner that the \u201crevenue-saving measure\u201d was \u201ctemporary.\u201d Till the dying days of his government. Buhari continued to threaten the press, especially the privately owned ones, with closure\n\nIf the press went through its worst period ever, including the sentencing to jail of journalists for the first time, labour had a worse experience. The leadership of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) was completely emasculated so much that the NLC president Ali Chiroma became redundant and irrelevant. There was a sustained effort at embarrassing the union leaders. Only recently, when he visited Allison Madueke, Anambra state governor until last week, Chiroma was subjected to an undignifying body search.\n\nThe impotence of the labour leadership led to the disgraceful booing of NLC officials and then labour, Minister, Solomon Omojokun on May Day, workers day of celebration. This year Omojokun represented Buhari who considered it below his dignity to attend the celebration, if only as a token of concern following the most massive retrenchment of workers in Nigeria\u2019s history. As Chiroma got up to read his address, a pall fell over the gathering of several thousand workers who responded to the speech with a rumbling boo. Omojokun received the same treatment. In a touching side action, a little boy of about six displayed a placard that read; \u201cplease give my daddy a job.\u201d\n\nThe Buhari government, which had promised to clear a backlog of unpaid salaries on coming to power, did not fulfil this promise, instead, the situation became worse leading some states to engage in rationing salaries. A notable example was the \u201cImo formula,\u201d which the Imo state government devised to pay workers \u201cwhatever money we have in hand.\u201d Niger state copied the \u201cformula\u201d in the final months.\n\nAny kind of organised labour or pressure group was treated with high-handedness. The Airline Pilots and Flight Engineers Association (APFEAN) fell early in 1984. The association was banned when pilots of Nigerian Airways, the national carrier, embarked on a strike over conditions of service and lack of safety facilities, including radars and instruments landing system (ILS) at the nation\u2019s airports. The pilots were fired. After a new employment screening was carried out, 14 of the pilots were dismissed. The government did its best to discourage other employers from giving them jobs.\n\nThe doctors were to follow the pilots later. In September 1984, after months of warning, the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) decided to hold the Buhari regime to its promise. When Brigadier Sanni Abacha announced the change of government in December 1983 he gave the deplorable state of medicare as one of the major reasons for the take-over. After waiting nine months and nothing was forthcoming, the NMA called its members out on strike reminding the government of Abacha\u2019s statement on the coup date that the nation\u2019s hospital had become mere consulting clinics. Out of character, the government called a truce and a stop-gap quickly ferried in N4 million worth of drugs and medicaments through the UNICEF, the crisis came to a temporary end.\n\nFive months later in February this year, the health sector continued to suffer terribly from government inactions. Virtually everything was in short supply, from dressings to potable water for hospitals. So the doctors went on strike again, after putting the government on notice. But this time Buhari replied with a big stick. The NMA was banned, and its leaders, including the president Edmundson Thompson-Akpabio and the first vice-president, Beko Ransome-Kuti, were packed off into detention.\n\nBefore some of them were picked up, their families were harassed, and Akpabio\u2019s children were detained for a few days. Other leaders of the doctors\u2019 association, like Boniface Oyo-Adeniran, Wole Atoyebi, and Ayo Falope fled through bush paths to Britain and the United States to escape the terror of what was becoming a fascist regime. Last week, President Babangida maintained in a broadcast that hospitals still remained \u201cmere consulting clinics.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s intelligentsia, like other sections of the society, was hounded into submission. University lecturers were barred from talking to foreign media. Facilities in higher institutions were also stopped from being used for \u201csubversive activities\u201d, a catch-phrase of Idiagbon meaning lectures, symposia, and student rallies and meetings. The opposition to academia was so much that Idiagbon identified campus \u201csubversive elements\u201d, including a college rag at the University of Ife called Cobra, The newsletter was actually a gossip periodical that published materials similar to those found in Lagos Weekend.\n\nMany lecturers especially officials of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), were randomly picked up and detained. Among those dumped behind bars were Tunde Fatunde, then secretary of ASUU in the University of Benin, and an activist at the University of Ibadan, Ola Oni. To further cow the academic community, the government directed that lecturers should be retrenched, and the process was in full gear at the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Ibadan, Lagos, and Nsukka Universities.\n\nUniversity students had an especially raw deal. Following the introduction of higher feeding and accommodation fees in early 1984, the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) entered into negotiations with Yerima Abdullahi, then Minister of Education. When the talks appeared bogged down, the government, true to type, promptly declared that it no longer recognised the association it had been negotiating with and warned students to behave or face its usual punishment \u2014 detention.\n\nThe students soon embarked on a nationwide boycott of lectures, which was broken when the universities were closed down and the students sent home. On many occasions, student leaders were arrested and detained, including the president of the \u201cunrecognised\u201d NANS, Lanre Arogundade. Two months ago, when some student leaders from the universities met in Port Harcourt in the night, police were waiting for them. They broke up the meeting and arrested some who were later released when the students threatened to go on demonstrations. The Ife University student leader, in a classical Gestapo style, was lured to a post office where he was arrested.\n\nThe Buhari government managed to stir up some trouble on religion as well. It cut a traditional two-day Christian Easter holiday to one, but back-pedalled after protests from the Christian Council of Churches. When it decided to import rams for the Muslim Id-el-Kabir festival, Christians were quick to remind the government to import turkey for Christians. Meanwhile, the fundamentalist Maitasine Islamic sect continued to kill people mindlessly, and the government seemed incapable, despite assurances to the contrary, of controlling the riots.\n\nEven traditional rulers, who were described by Buhari as \u201chighways to national unity\u201d, felt the regime\u2019s iron fist. Two of the foremost traditional rulers, the Ooni of Ife and Emir of Kano were punished for paying a private visit to Israel \u201cwithout official permission\u201d. The two \u201chighways of national unity\u201d were stripped of official functions and restricted to their respective domains for six months.\n\nAnother aspect of Buhari\u2019s war against everybody was one which wrought disaster in virtually every home in the land. The first was the mass retrenchment of workers, for which the government declared that it would not make amends even if someone were unjustly sent into the throes of unemployment. In addition, nobody could challenge his retrenchment in court, by force of the decree. Last May, the NLC said unemployed people had passed the one million mark. Simultaneous with the retrenchments, all the state governments embarked on an orgy of demolition of market stalls and homes in the name of environmental sanitation. Millions of petty businesses were ruined, and millions of people left heartbroken. There were many families in which every member was unemployed: the husband retrenched, the wife\u2019s stall demolished, and the school leaver kid unable to get a job.\n\nFor the houses bulldozed, especially in Lagos, the government later found that many of them might have been wrongly wiped out. Solution: a government promised to set up a probe panel to look into grievances and that was the end of the matter. And then there were the levies slapped on the poverty-stricken from just about every direction. There were levies in most states of the federation for development, education, radio set, television set, and involuntary donations.\n\nTwo weeks ago in Bendel State, the governor, Jerry Useni not reputed for finesse in handling state matters, ordered that \u201cenvironmental sanitation levies\u201d be collected from travellers passing through Bendel during the Muslim Id-el-Kabir festival. Those who could not pay had to pass through another state to their destinations. The indiscriminate levies elicited a bitter sarcasm from Stanley Macebuh, Executive Editor of The Guardian. \u201cCall Me Levy\u201d, he admonished in an article.\n\nThe environmental sanitation programme was sometimes carried to unreasonable extents. Many of the states closed offices at noon or shortly after so that all civil servants could spend three or four hours extra to clear refuse dumps and clean the road and drains. Motorist in Oyo state for instance were usually forced to cart away the rubbish in their car booths. The target of all the effort; a N1 million prize promised by the sacked federal government for the cleanest state in Nigeria.\n\nSchool fees were reintroduced in certain parts of the country which hitherto enjoyed free education, much to the chagrin but helplessness of the people. it was worst in Oyo state, where primary school fees were introduced for the first time in 30 years.\n\nWhile the government floundered, it engaged in frivolities, Ondo state found time to erase Obafemi Awolowo\u2019s name from the signboard of the state university. Detention without trials was not restricted to politicians and journalists alone. Schoolteacher Tai Solarin was detained for more than a year before his release last month. So also was Sule Katagum, former chairman of the Civil Service Commission (CSC), their offences were that they made pronouncements that were not sweet to Buhari\u2019s or Idiagbon\u2019s ears.\n\nThe execution of drug pushers against the overwhelming objection of the society was a clear instance of the government\u2019s refusal to listen to the populace. It was a regime that refused to change its mind even if it made mistakes so that it would appear tough. The stubbornness provoked an exasperated Wole Soyinka, the Buhari government\u2019s most persistent critic into a kind of discomforting resignation. \u201cI don\u2019t talk to deaf people\u201d, he said. It was a surprise to many people that he was not detained until the regime fell.\n\nPerceived double standards in the handling of issues were also a major source of disillusionment. There was the case of Alhaji Abubakar Alhaji, former permanent secretary in the federal ministry of finance. He lost thousands of pounds of his personal money to Austrian-thieves while on an official trip abroad. He could not explain how he came about such money since civil servants are not allowed by law to keep foreign accounts. The uproar did not move the Buhari administration, which merely reposted Abubakar to the ministry of national planning, with a Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) board membership to the bargain. Both Melford Okilo and Sam Mbakwe, former governors of Rivers and Imo States respectively were jailed for the same offence, Abubakar Alhaji is still in government.\n\nThe 53 suitcases issue also generated heated debate. During the currency exchange exercise in April and May last year, tight controls were clamped on the airports and other inlets. Anybody found carrying the old currency was arrested and detained. But a retired ambassador and an emir brought in 53 suitcases during the period, and the luggage was forcibly cleared without being checked in full view of everyone at the Murtala Muhammed Airway in Lagos. The soldier who threw his weight around was Major Jokolo, Buhari\u2019s aide-de-camp. The government has not been able to explain it away satisfactorily. And it haunted the government forever.\n\nThese and other blunders drove wedges between different sections of the community, and the divisions inevitably led to impassioned calls for confederation, occasioned, perhaps, by a sense of alienation felt by certain sections of the country. The government was getting jittery, and its ad-hoc solution, true to character, was to ban all debates on the political future of Nigeria, any newspaper which published such debates, warned by the Buhari regime, would be closed down. And so the stalemate continued.\n\nYou can force the horse to the pond, but you cannot force it to drink. The society drifted farther and farther away from the rulership, and the government inevitably could not get anything done. Instead of a war against poverty, corruption, and illiteracy, the Buhari administration waged a war against the people of Nigeria, and discredited the armed forces in the process, making President Babangida\u2019s first task that of putting an end to the war on everybody.\n\nThis article, culled from Newswatch, was first published on 9 September 1985",

          "text": "The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) may conduct a second 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination for candidates with genuine registration challenges.\n\nThe Registrar of the board, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede, made the disclosure on Wednesday in Lagos while monitoring profiling of candidates with 2021 UTME registration challenges.\n\n\u201cSo far, we have just 17, 758 candidates with challenges that had been profiled, nationwide.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the entire exercise, we may have to conduct another examination for those with genuine cases after the main UTME slated for June 19 to July 3,\u201d the JAMB official said.\n\nHe reiterated the board\u2019s commitment to ensuring that every Nigerian child desirous of tertiary education would be given an equal opportunity.\n\n\u201cSince I came here this morning and interacted with candidates, I have discovered that most of them are largely unserious and are basically the cause of most of their challenges.\n\n\u201cWe keep hearing flimsy excuses such as my lesson teacher used his phone to generate the profile code, our tutorial centre helped us to register and I was not in town.\n\n\u201cOther reasons advanced are: I used my mother\u2019s NIN to generate my profile code, my mummy did the registration for me,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the registrar, some candidates were honest enough to say they did not have money to procure UTME forms.\n\n\u201cWe have also seen cases where rather than send their NIN to 55019, candidates sent it to 55012, while others sent the same command with post-paid phones rather than pre-paid,\u201d he said.\n\nOver 500,000 candidates had claimed they were unable to register for the examination within the given time frame \u2013 before May 15. JAMB later extended the registration to May 29.\n\nThe candidates cited inability to generate a profile code and difficulty in obtaining the National Identification Number (NIN).\n\nJAMB had insisted that no candidate would be allowed to sit for the examination without providing the NIN.\n\nFollowing the challenges, the board allowed a two-week window for the affected people to lodge their complaints at its offices or registration centres and get help.\n\nAddressing journalists later, Mr Oloyede called on state ministries of education to regulate activities of tutorial centres as a strategy to save the education sector from collapse.\n\nMr Oloyede said that activities of some tutorial centres remained a hindrance to efforts at sanitising the country\u2019s education system.\n\nAccording to him, tutorial centres are a haven for examination malpractice.\n\nThe JAMB registrar said some tutorial centres held the system to ransom with ungodly activities.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said that many operators of the centres were school dropouts operating from dilapidated, abandoned and uncompleted structures.\n\nHe regretted that some parents were patronising them with delight.\n\n\u201cThese people are just introducing these candidates to how to beat the system, how to make sure that they get questions, particularly fake questions, because they cannot get JAMB questions,\u201d he said.\n\nThe registrar said that parents must learn to allow their children and wards to go through the normal process of learning for them to be psychologically mature for tertiary education.\n\n\u201cAnother major challenge threatening the system is that of intruding parents,\u201d the JAMB official said.\n\n\u201cThey are intruders, who will not allow these children to think rightly and do things on their own but want to hurriedly push them into primary, secondary and tertiary schools at very tender ages.\n\n\u201cThat is why many of them are prone and exposed to so many mistakes.\n\n\u201cIn order to show the nation that the problem of registration is not what a section of the media is painting it to be, we came up with this initiative of asking all candidates with genuine excuses to visit our offices nationwide,\u201d he said.\n\nThe registrar said through the process JAMB discovered that some candidates went as far as using their bank verification numbers in a bid to get their profile codes rather than the NIN.\n\n(NAN)",

The nation is losing billions of Naira from tax evasion on daily basis, and the man in charge is expected to come to the Parliarment so that a solution can be found on how to stop the urgly development but he has refused to honor the invitation.\n\n\u201cLooking at the seriousness of this issue, the FIRS boss is to course physical appearance before this Honourable Committee by 10.00 am on Thursday, we are determined to stop this nonsense, the nation is bleeding,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Business development experts have identified lack of adequate knowledge and requisite skills in chosen fields as factors responsible for the untimely death of most startup businesses in Nigeria.\n\nThe experts pointed out that most small scale entrepreneurs in the country go into businesses without being armed with the basic fundamentals and rudiments of the business they want to invest in, and as such, when they run into trouble waters, they have swept away in the tide, losing all their investments in the process.\n\nSpeaking at a two-day workshop organized by She4She Initiative, a not-for-profit Non-Governmental Organization, NGO, established to develop, empower and support women and the girl-child to attain self-dependency and sufficiency, Mr Olalekan Brahim, a business coach and founder Centre for Learning, CfL, emphasized that Knowledge of the business is the first capital to acquire and not money.\n\nIbrahim maintained that the mistake most people make is to go for money first believing once they have money, they can go into any business they want.\n\nHe said, \u201cKnowledge is the first thing, not money. But the mistake people do is go for money first. When you have the knowledge, money becomes tools for you, but if you have money without knowledge you will waste the money.\u201d\n\nThe business coach noted that beyond whatever one might have heard about entrepreneurship as a means of doing business, there are still certain critical facts to consider entrepreneurship before venturing into it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard about entrepreneurship, we know it\u2019s doing business, but there are things we don\u2019t consider on entrepreneurship. We don\u2019t consider the problem first.\n\n\u201cMaybe you want to sell or render service, you have to realize it\u2019s problem you are trying to solve. Once you determine the problem, you will be able to know the solution. You have to understand the problem, the customer, once you know the problem you be able to determine those who are carrying the problem and you be able to understand how you can find solutions to it.\n\n\u201cOnce you are able to establish this, you will be able to do analysis: am I really ready for this business? Do I have the right knowledge, resources, tools to do this?\n\nThe CEO of Centre for Learning advised every startup business owner to ensure they attend a workshop like this one put together by She4She in order to take advantage of opportunities like this.\n\nAlso speaking on Mental health and fitness development, Dr. Yomi Jaiye, a life coach and the founder of CECY Health, emphasized on the need for participants to develop their mindset to improve their creativity.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we have to talk about mental wellness because wealth is a mindset. If you are able to develop your thinking, you can create anything in the world without needing anybody\u2019s help take your life from the lowest point to the top.\n\nIn her remarks, the founder of She4She Initiative, Barr. Oyanbo Peace Owei, said the essence of the 2-day training for empowerment of women and girls was to be able to impact their lives and to support women and girls so they can have access to quality health care, good education, personal development.\n\nBarr. Owei said, \u201cIt\u2019s a personal development training for women and girls child to be able to build themselves. \u201cWe looked at the statistics of unemployed, poor and deprived women, and out of school girl-child, we decided that we can not just fold our arms. After the adverse effect of the Covid-19 pandemic we decided to stand up for women and that\u2019s where the theme \u201cWomen Up\u201d meaning women stand up for women was coined from.\n\n\u201cWe want to use our platform and wealth of knowledge to let people know what they need to know to develop themselves. We also want to give them awareness about various government programmes and plans that are available for women that can benefit them that they are not aware of. We want to take this advocacy upon ourselves. We want to create positive impact in our society.\u201d\n\nThe workshop had in attendance over 200 participants who were drawn from the online platforms, and were taught how to develop and improve their businesses.\n\nOne of the participants, Felicia Anita, said, \u201cI learnt about entrepreneurship and public speaking. There are some mistakes I used to make during resume writing that I got to know they were actually the wrong. I ended up providing a Solution to the problem I didn\u2019t know was there in the first place.\n\nAnother participant said, Mercy Mikel Ogwuche, said, \u201cThe speaker we had yesterday taught us about public speaking and it was so helpful. I also learnt about entrepreneurship on how to set up my own business, my vision, mission and how to have market policy. I have my own business already, this will help me take my business to another level.\u201d",

Ndudi Elumelu the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives.\n\nIn the statement, the Joint Minority Caucus also dismissed threats by the APC-led government to arrest and prosecute Nigerians using Twitter and calls on Nigerians to go ahead and use their Twitter as they would not be contravening any law in Nigeria or any international statute.\n\nThe Joint Minority Caucus recognized the provisions of Articles 19 and 20 of the United Nations Charter on Fundamental Human Rights, which Nigeria is a signatory to, as well as provisions of Sections 39 and 36 (12) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), and notes that by these provisions no one will be violating any law for using Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nREAD ALSO: Suspension: FG Should Have Sued Twitter, Not Place A Ban \u2013 Falana\n\nAs lawmakers, the Joint Caucus said it is pained by the anguish Nigerians, especially the youths, who find the use of Twitter as a means of livelihood and genuine social interaction, are passing through just because the APC-led Federal Government feels slighted that an individual\u2019s post, was deleted by Twitter for ethic violation.\n\nThe joint caucus, therefore, called on Nigerians to use various opportunities offered by technology and continue making use of Twitter since such does not violate any law in our country.\n\n\u201cIt is agonizing that Nigeria and Nigerians have been losing billions of naira on daily basis since the ban on Twitter. This is completely unacceptable as it is worsening the already biting economic hardship and frightening unemployment level in the country.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the ban on Twitter in Nigeria appears to be in favour of criminal and terrorist elements, whose activities fester in an environment of suppressed information flow.\n\n\u201cThe Joint Minority Caucus sympathizes with the organized private sector, manufacturing and service providing companies, small and medium enterprises, online business owners and other hardworking entrepreneurs across the country, whose genuine business and means of livelihood have been crippled by the unwarranted ban on Twitter by the APC federal government,\u201d the statement partly reads.\n\nThe caucus also identified with our students, research-based organization, media houses, the organized civil society, faith-based organizations, community groups among others, whose information-based activities have been violently disrupted by the ban.\n\nIn the same vein, the Joint Caucus sympathized with regional, states, local government as well as members of the international community, whose genuine and constructive activities have been crippled by the prohibition of twitter in Nigeria\n\nIt also identified with traditional rulers, who have even found Twitter as a means of communicating with the constituents, especially in this era of insecurity in the country.\n\nThe Joint Caucus vehemently berated the APC-led government for abandoning its duty of addressing the serious economic and security problems confronting our nation to rather focus on dissipating energy victimizing Nigerians over their disagreement with Twitter for deleting a post by an individual.\n\nThe Caucus counseled the Federal Government to swallow its pride, accept its misdoing and go and settle whatever issue it has with Twitter instead of this resort to inflicting pains on Nigerians.",

          "text": "The US will buy 500 million more doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to share through the global COVAX alliance for donation to 92 lower income countries and the African Union over the next year, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was set to make the announcement Thursday in a speech before the start of the Group of Seven summit.\n\nTwo hundred million doses \u2014 enough to fully protect 100 million people \u2014 would be shared this year, with the balance to be donated in the first half of 2022, the person said.\n\n\u201cWe have to end COVID-19 not just at home \u2014 which we\u2019re doing \u2014 but everywhere,\u201d Biden said Wednesday in a speech to the U.S. military at Royal Air Force Mildenhall, the first stop of an eight-day, three-country foreign trip.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Wednesday that Biden was committed to sharing vaccines because it was in the public health and strategic interests of the U.S.\n\nAs Biden embarks on his first foreign trip, he is aiming to show \u201cthat democracies are the countries that can best deliver solutions for people everywhere,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nThe news of the Pfizer sharing plan was confirmed to The Associated Press by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the president\u2019s formal announcement. The news was first reported by The Washington Post.\n\nThe U.S. has faced mounting pressure to outline its global vaccine sharing plan. Inequities in supply around the world have become more pronounced, and the demand for shots in the U.S. \u2014 where nearly 64% of adults have received at least one dose \u2014 has dropped precipitously.\n\nLast week, the White House unveiled its plans to donate an initial allotment of 25 million doses of surplus vaccine overseas, mostly through the United Nations-backed COVAX program, promising infusions for South and Central America, Asia, Africa and others at a time of glaring shortages abroad.\n\nOverall, the White House has announced plans to share 80 million doses globally by the end of June, most through COVAX.\n\nOfficials say a quarter of the nation\u2019s excess will be kept in reserve for emergencies and for the U.S. to share directly with allies and partners.\n\nThe White House has also directed doses to allies including South Korea, Taiwan and Ukraine.\n\nGlobal public health groups had been aiming to use the upcoming G-7 meetings in Cornwall, England, to press the nation\u2019s wealthiest democracies to do more to share vaccines with the world, and Biden\u2019s plans drew immediate praise toward that end.\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration\u2019s decision to purchase and donate additional COVID-19 vaccine doses is the kind of bold leadership that is needed to end this global pandemic,\u201d said Tom Hart, acting CEO at The ONE Campaign, a nonprofit that seeks to end poverty.\n\n\u201cThis action sends an incredibly powerful message about America\u2019s commitment to helping the world fight this pandemic and the immense power of US global leadership.\u201d\n\nBut others have called on the U.S. to do even more.\n\n\u201cCharity is not going to win the war against the coronavirus,\u201d said Niko Lusiani, Oxfam America\u2019s vaccine lead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to let the world help itself. Rather than more lucrative transactions with very profitable pharmaceutical corporations, we need a transformation toward more distributed vaccine manufacturing so that qualified producers worldwide can produce billions more low-cost doses on their own terms, without intellectual property constraints.\u201d\n\nBiden last month broke with European allies to endorse waiving intellectual property rules at the World Trade Organization to promote vaccine production and equity.\n\nBut many in his own administration acknowledge that the restrictions were not the driving cause of the global vaccine shortage, which has more to do with limited manufacturing capacity and shortages of delicate raw materials.\n\nSullivan said Wednesday that he does not expect the U.S. push to waive the patents on vaccines to cause tension with European counterparts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all converging around the idea that we need to boost vaccine supply in a number of ways, sharing more of our own doses,\u201d Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have more to say on that, helping get more manufacturing capacity around the world.\u201d\n\nGlobally, there have been more than 3.7 million confirmed deaths from COVID-19, and more than 174 million people have been confirmed infected.",

          "text": "A leading civil society organization, Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) has reminded the federal government that Twitter and other social media platforms belong to the Information Communications sector which contributed 14.9 per cent to the 2021 first quarter (Q1) gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nCSJ, which expressed regret over the recent ban on the micro-blogging site by the federal government called for an immediate reversal of the action.\n\nIn a statement made available to THISDAY by its Lead Director, Eze Onyekpere, the group described the ban as a gross violation of Nigerians\u2019 human rights and economic obligations to respect already accrued economic and social rights.\n\nThe group urged the government to refrain from taking steps that will prevent Nigerians from accessing services provided by third parties which do not violate laws enacted by the respective legislatures.\n\nIt noted: \u201cThe contribution to aggregate real gross domestic product as at Quarter 1 of 2021 by the Information and Communications Sector where Twitter and other social media platforms belong is valued at 14.91%, being one of the largest contributors to the total output of the country.\n\n\u201cThe Information and Communications sector is composed of the four activities of Telecommunications and Information Services; Publishing; Motion Picture, Sound Recording and Music Production; and Broadcasting.\n\n\u201cIt will be recalled that the Nigerian economy grew by less than 1%, specifically by 0.51% in Quarter 1 of 2021 and the contributions of the major sectors to aggregate real GDP is as follows: Oil sector accounted for 9.25%; the agriculture sector accounted for 22.35%; manufacturing was 9.93%; trade\u2019s contribution was 15.61%, construction was 4.12%, etc.\u201d\n\nCSJ observed that the overall growth pattern of the economy in the first quarter of 2021 was tepid and did not match population growth, adding that it failed to respond to stagflation \u2013 high unemployment, slow growth, inflation, and other macroeconomic challenges facing the nation.\n\nIt observed that the fact that Nigeria is just struggling to exit recession even compounds the scenario.\n\nAccording to CSJ, Twitter as part of social media platforms is a veritable medium for the outreach of enterprises in the Information Communications Technology (ICT) and other sectors, arguing that banning Twitter will retard investments, productivity, employment generation and the overall output and outcome of the economy.\n\nIt noted that the ban on Twitter at a time of great economic and social crisis has so many downsides without any evident upside.\n\nCSJ listed the downsides as increasing the cost of production of goods and service delivery as Twitter is a cheap means of driving traffic, advertisement in the ICT and other key sectors of the economy.\n\nAccording to the group, the ban will also retard the ease of doing business as many of its services will now be done through resource and time-consuming methods which will make the business environment inclement.\n\nCSJ further noted: \u201cIt will make more Nigerians especially the younger generation jobless at a time the official unemployment rate is 33.3% and the percentage of unemployed youths exceed the unemployment average of the overall population.\n\n\u201cIt will deter local and foreign investors who will see the country as undemocratic, without the rule of law and its due process where the ego, whims, and caprices of one man determines policy direction.\u201d\n\nWhile stressing that the federal government\u2019s action would worsen insecurity considering that unemployment contributes to crime, criminality, and the pervasive insecurity across the nation, it observed that the ban is a drag on information dissemination, and will provide an environment for compounding of criminality by state and non-state actors.\n\nCSJ therefore called on President Muhammadu Buhari to reconsider and lift the ban immediately to stop further irreparable damage to the Nigerian economy and to the economic and social rights of citizens.",

          "text": "One of the wives of Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna state, Hajiya Asia El-Rufai, has declared that she would rather die than ransom be paid to kidnappers if she gets abducted.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday while addressing participants at a peace and security training, organized for women by Equal Access International (EAI), Mrs. El-Rufai aligned herself with the position of the governor who has consistently maintained that no ransom should be paid to bandits.\n\nMrs. El-Rufai said the solution to ending kidnapping is to stop payment of ransom.\n\nShe said she was ready to die in the hands of kidnappers if it will bring peace to the country.\n\nShe said Nigerians must get back their once peaceful country, noting that women have a great role to play in achieving that.\n\n\u201cWe must sacrifice to bring this (kidnapping) to an end. I am ready to die in the hands of kidnappers if it will bring peace to this country.\n\n\u201cFor as long as you continue to pay ransom, it is like you are adding kerosene to fire. You are giving bandits, kidnappers money for ammunition to continue to haunt you.\n\n\u201cWe should not pay ransom. This is my personal opinion. I have said it before and I will say it again, if I am kidnapped don\u2019t pay any ransom, rather pray for me that if it is death, I go in a good way and if I am going to be released that I am not violated,\u201dshe said.\n\nAccording to her, as long as the bandits are paid ransom, they will not change.\n\n\u201cCollectively as a country we have to say no, we can not continue to give them our hard earned money to buy weapons and drugs to kill and maim our children,\u201d the governor\u2019s wife said.\n\nMrs. El-Rufai said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t put a stop to this, they will destroy us all. They will even kidnap the person that takes the ransom to them.\n\n\u201cYou will see that some of them you even give the ransom and they still kill the person, so you have lost twice.\u201d\n\nAlso commenting on the recent communal clashes in parts of Kaduna state, the governor\u2019s wife urged women to shun divisive narratives created by selfish politicians and work for the unity of the state.\n\nIn his remarks, the Country Director of the EAI, Mr. Maaji Peters said the training was aimed at securing Nigerian communities through creation of Civilian Security (CIVSEC ) who will make contributions and decisions on issues that affects them and their communities.\n\nBy John Shiklam in Kaduna",

          "title": "US Drops Trump Order Targeting TikTok, Plans Its Own Review",
          "text": "The White House has dropped Trump-era executive orders intended to ban the popular apps TikTok and WeChat and will conduct its own review aimed at identifying national security risks with software applications tied to China, officials said Wednesday.\n\nA new executive order directs the Commerce Department to undertake what officials describe as an \u201cevidence-based\u201d analysis of transactions involving apps that are manufactured or supplied or controlled by China. Officials are particularly concerned about apps that collect users\u2019 personal data or have connections to Chinese military or intelligence activities.\n\nIn revoking some of President Donald Trump\u2019s blanket-style orders against Chinese tech companies and replacing them with a narrower approach, the Biden administration has not actually weighed in yet on whether TikTok and other apps pose a danger to Americans.\n\nBut a senior administration official said Wednesday that the Trump actions weren\u2019t \u201calways implemented in the soundest fashion\u201d and the aim of the review is to set up clear criteria to evaluate specific data security and privacy risks for each app. He said that could lead to a range of potential future actions on an app-by-app basis.\n\n\u201cWe want to take a tailored, tough approach here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe department will also make recommendations on how to further protect Americans\u2019 genetic and personal health information, and will address the risks of certain software apps connected to China or other adversaries, according to senior administration officials.\n\nTikTok on Wednesday declined to comment. WeChat did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s attempted bans didn\u2019t hold up legally as courts blocked them, and also \u201cran up against this critique that they were mimicking China\u2019s Great Firewall,\u201d said Samm Sacks, a fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center. \u201cWhat the Biden administration wants to do is maintain an open, secure internet that doesn\u2019t take a page from Beijing\u2019s playbook, while addressing legitimate risk.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s move reflects ongoing concern that Americans\u2019 personal data could be exposed by popular apps tied to China, a chief U.S. economic and political rival. The White House and Congress have both taken action to address Beijing\u2019s technological advancement.\n\nThe Biden administration last week expanded a Trump-era list of Chinese companies that Americans can\u2019t invest in because of purported links to the Chinese military and surveillance. Companies on the list include China\u2019s state-owned telecommunications companies, telecom equipment maker Huawei and Chinese oil company China National Offshore Oil Corp.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Senate passed a bill that aims to boost U.S. semiconductor production and the development of artificial intelligence and other technology in the face of growing international competition.\n\nThe new executive order should lead to a framework for protecting Americans\u2019 data from China, rather than targeting specific companies, and could pressure Congress to enact a data-security law in the years ahead, said Paul Triolo, a tech policy expert at the Eurasia Group consultancy.\n\nCourts had blocked the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to ban TikTok and WeChat, which began in summer 2020, but a national-security review of TikTok by a government group called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, is ongoing. CFIUS had set deadlines for TikTok to divest its U.S. operations, but such a sale never happened.\n\nLast year, the Trump administration brokered a deal that would have had U.S. corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in the Chinese-owned app on national security grounds. Neither Oracle or Walmart returned requests for comment on Wednesday.\n\nThe Biden administration earlier this year had backed off President Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to ban TikTok and WeChat as it reviewed national security threats posed by Chinese technology companies. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has put on hold a case challenging Trump\u2019s TikTok divestment order.\n\nA cybersecurity and privacy analysis of TikTok published in March by the internet watchdog group Citizen Lab found no evidence of malicious behavior and said TikTok\u2019s data collection practices were no worse than other major social platforms such as Facebook.\n\n\u201cOur research shows that there is no overt data transmission to the Chinese government by TikTok,\u201d the report said. It added that TikTok\u2019s service did not contact any servers within China, but it was still theoretically possible that servers outside China could later transfer user data to China-based servers.",
