          "text": "No fewer than seven persons have been killed by members of rival cult groups in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, within a week.\n\nOur correspondent reported that the killings which took place in various places in the state capital were attributed to a supremacy battle between Eiye and Aiye cult groups.\n\nIt was further gathered that prior to the killing of a man in Abeokuta popularly known as Tommy who was hacked to death at Panseke last week Thursday night, six others have been killed by suspected cultists during the supremacy battle.\n\nA source, who did not want his name in print, listed those that have been killed so far in the supremacy battle to include Scatter, School Boy, Alakanni, Tommy Boy, Azeez, Olaosebikan and Babajide.\n\nThe killings, according to the source, took place at different scenes like a relaxation centre at Asero; other ones at Kugba, Ikereku, Panseke, Adigbe, Oke Ijeun and Isale Abetu, all in Abeokuta.\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed that there were killings in the state within the last week.\n\nHe said the command had made some arrests in connection with the killings.\n\nOyeyemi added that the command had resolved to go after landlords that harbour cultists in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have launched a very serious operation on them.

          "title": "2023: In Ebonyi politics, we believe in zoning \u2014 PDP Gov Aspirant",
          "text": ".\n\n\u2026I will not tax suffering people of Ebonyi\n\nBy Peter Okutu, Abakaliki\n\nA governorship aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Ebonyi State, Dr. Sylvester Ogbaga, weekend explained that the State, since 1999, has always operated the political culture of zoning the Ebonyi Governorship seat among the three senatorial zones of the State.\n\nHe added that there was no need to debate the zoning of the 2023 Governorship position as the Ebonyi North zone was next in line to produce the next Governor of the State.\n\nOgbaga who is the current member representing Abakaliki/ Izzi Federal Constituency at the National Assembly stated this in Abakaliki, while addressing newsmen after picking his nomination form.\n\nHe identified zoning arrangement as the beauty of democracy in the State \u201cin Ebonyi State politics, we believe in zoning.\n\n\u201cEbonyi North, Central have served and now South, it is the turn of Ebonyi North again. Courtesy demands that the North is spending 16 years without Governor, central 8 years without Governor and South still in power.\u201d\n\nHe described it as a high level of injustice, inequality and unfairness for anyone from Ebonyi South or Ebonyi central zone to be aspiring to become the next Governor of the State.\n\n\u201cThe North demands it is our turn and I am here; nothing will make me to stop pressing to occupy the seat.\n\n\u201cI have listened to the views of the concerned elders from the South and their positions is that it should be zoned to the North, they should not bring two zones together. We are not known for bloc from 1999 till date.\n\n\u201cThey said it is not good to bring the two heads together. If you want to zone it to Ebonyi North, zone it to the North, if you are not zoning to Ebonyi North throw it open; though, there have not be any response from the party, but I believe the party has leaders that are tested and trusted, they will just do the right thing at the right time.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the leadership of the PDP has agreed that they will constitute a zoning committee, which will zone the governorship position adding that it was the turn of Ebonyi North as they have spent sixteen years without without producing the Governor of the State.\n\nThe Governorship aspirant noted that he would create massive economic revolution, peace, employment opportunities as well as an enabling environment where business would thrive and ensure reduction of heavy taxation, if he clinches the position in 2023.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI will bring peace to Ebonyi State, it is lacking and everybody knows about it. People die on the daily basis and people are not enjoying it.\n\n\u201cSince 2015, there is no employment in Ebonyi State, graduates are coming up on yearly basis and we need to take care of them, we need to go back to industrialization and employ people who cannot access government into private sectors, thereby creating an enabling environment where business will prosper.\n\n\u201cPeople are suffering and you don\u2019t need to tax them when they are suffering as many businesses have closed in Ebonyi State.\n\n\u201cWe realized that Abakpa market, building material were close down, demolished, traders sacked from the place without any compensation. It is not done in any where, that market was taken from individuals, it is an act of overriding public interest, even if Government should take it for any reason, those people need to be compensated.\n\n\u201cAny property recovered for the purpose of overriding public interest must remain for public interest and not for private use. We need to go into those things.\n\n\u201cYes, of course we have over head bridges everywhere but the question is, are they all important where they are sited? how many employment opportunities is it giving? is it taking care of the youths?\n\n\u201cIn a our University today, we have divine mandate lecturers, we have divine mandate students and we have ASUU, those things did not create employment opportunities, let\u2019s look at the young ones and bring them in a lime light to what is happening in other States.\n\n\u201cEbonyi State is not in an envelope, it is an open place where we all watch what is happening. I have had time to study the problems of the State, the Governor was able to build some infrastructures but it is not all about infrastructures. We need to be alive to enjoy the infrastructures. Government is a continuity. I don\u2019t think we will allow what the current Government has built to be wasted, because it was built with Ebonyi State money and must be kept alive.\u201d",

          "title": "CITAD calls for sustainable community networks to bridge digital divide in Nigeria",
          "text": "The Centre for Information Technology and Development (CITAD) has called for commitments towards the establishment and sustaining of community networks, to help bridge the digital divide, across the country.\n\nCITAD made this call at a press conference in Lagos, where it listed efforts made on identifying and cultivating local champions to influence and support the community networks.\n\nRead the statement in full: The Centre for Information Technology and Development (CITAD) conducted a number of programmes toward supporting ICTs and specifically, advocating for the establishment and sustaining of community networks across the country.\n\nRecently, the centre organized meetings with friends of community networks, the CSOs and with larger stakeholders on identification and cultivating local champions to influence and support the community networks.\n\nJointly, CITAD and the Association for Progressive Communication (APC), a South Africa based group sharing same ideals with CITAD, drafted a Regulatory Framework for Community Networks in Nigeria (CNRF). This will soon be presented to the Honorable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy for action.\n\nToday, the international dimension of the digital divide remains a major point of the global struggle for justice. This requires both developed and developing countries to work together to address it. But, the internal dimension of the digital divide is what we as citizens and as a country can and should address.\n\nIn the present context, the certainty of the internal division of the digital divide is routinely acknowledged by the government and its agencies.\n\nBy government statistics, only about half of Nigerians have access to the internet. This means that within the country, an estimated population of 100 million people is already left behind and excluded from the benefits of the internet. To buttress this point, we can provide a few illustrations for you to understand how those who are left behind from the benefits of digital technology are left behind:\n\nAccess to some special interventions through financial institutions:\n\nIn many instances, people especially those at the community level often lose many opportunities provided especially on access to loans or other facilities. We all know that many financial institutions provide support with some conditions such as (provision of email addresses, etc) which lots of citizens, especially rural communities, don\u2019t have.\n\nThe second is about National Identity. For years now, the National Identity Management Commission, NIMC, has been trying to issue National Identity Cards to Nigerians and up till now, less than half of Nigerians have been able to enrol. The major reason is that because it is IT-based and people in rural areas where internet infrastructure is lacking find it difficult to be enrolled. Such people are \u201cidentity excluded\u201d. They will even face problems when travelling.\n\nThe third is about education. Today all those who wish to access higher education, have to sit and pass the computer-based examination of JAMB. For many communities, their children graduate from Secondary Schools without using the computer until they enter the JAMB examination hall. Clearly, they are disadvantaged and often get blocked out from the education system at that stage.\n\n\u201cThere are many reasons for the digital divide but one of those related to the model of technology rollout we use. In Nigeria, as in many other countries, technology rollout is market-driven, meaning that companies are willing to invest in infrastructure for connectivity only for areas where profits are assured and they are unlikely to invest in poor communities or communities that are sparsely populated that the telecommunication traffic cannot support profitably\n\n\u201cWhile this is not unique to Nigeria, many countries have solved the problem by deploying other models of rollout such as community networks to compliment market-driven rollout.\n\n\u201cCommunity networks are telecommunication infrastructure designed, deployed and managed by communities to meet their communication need. Globally these community networks are helping many countries such as Kenya, South Africa, Brazil and Mexico to address the internal dimensions of their digital divide.\n\n\u201cCommunity networks have failed to take roots in Nigeria because we do not have a national policy to guide their emergence and provide a supportive environment for communities to leverage various opportunities to bridge the connectivity gaps. The Universal Service Provision Fund (USPF) has said there are 114 communities where GSM signals are either weak or not at all.\n\n\u201cThese are called underserved and unserved communities. These communities could, if there is a policy that would provide clear rules for interconnectivity, frequency and spectrum allocation and use, etc, could mobilize their own resources and create their communication infrastructure to address their need.\n\n\u201cCITAD has, in the last eight months, been engaging the policymakers, especially the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, the telecommunication regulators, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and other stakeholders in the country such as NITDA, USPF and Galaxy Backbone with the aim of arriving at a consensus on developing a national policy for community networks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey all agreed on its desirability, noting that community networks will help greatly in accelerating efforts of the government to address the digital divide and to prime the country to achieve its digital transformation agenda.\u201d\n\nWe would like to use this conference to specifically remind all actors to match their commitments with action. In particular, CITAD would like to:\n\n1. Call on the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy to ensure full implementation of the draft National Policy on Community Networks\n\n2. Enjoin the Galaxy Backbone PLC to provide communities with access to its backbone for them to use as their community networks getaways\n\n3. The USPF to support the upgrading of the many communities\u2019 digital centres they set up in the country to serve as basis of community networks for communities that desirous and passionate to set up such in their communities\n\n4. Demand on NCC to develop guidelines and regulations for the operation of community networks in the country and to allow communities to access and use TV White Space (TVWS) for the purposes of setting up community networks\n\n5. NITDA to work with communities at grassroots level to drive digital literacy which is critical for the effective utilization of digital technology and which is the foundation upon which the digital transformation agenda of the country will rest.\n\n6. Urge the CSOs to sustain evidence-based advocacy for the establishment of CNs across the country\n\n7. Call on the private sector operators to as, part of their corporate social responsibility support communities to set up community networks\n\n8. Call on all other stakeholders, including political office holders to support communities to go digital as critical contribution to community development.\n\n9. Call on private sector operators to see community networks as complimentary but not competitors",

          "text": "A group, Citizens For Righteousness and Social Justice, Imo State chapter, on Sunday threatened to lead Nigerians in a nationwide protest if President Muhammadu Buhari led government refuses to use its relevant agencies to get the petroleum marketers to revert petroleum products to the old and approved pump prices in 14 days.\n\nThe Chairman, Bishop Kenneth Obi, who stated this in a release made available to newsmen in Owerri, Imo State capital, said, unfortunately, the increase in the products has consequently affected adversely the prices of goods and services in the nation.\n\n\u201cThe disheartening aspect of it is not that bad leadership has negatively affected the country\u2019s economy but that nobody is speaking out either for the fear of being killed or intimidated by those who are behind our woes in the society.\n\n\u201cIt is no longer news that factors including high exchange rate have caused inflation in Nigeria, the sudden increase in the prices of petroleum products has worsened the whole situation; stemming from the fact that almost all sectors of the economy depend on the use of petroleum products to produce goods or render meaningful services to the society.\n\n\u201cFor instance, fuel has risen to N240 per litre against the government approved pump price of #1I65. Diesel now costs more than #550 per litre, same as kerosene and Liquefied Petroleum Gas which are three times higher than what they used to be a few years ago.\n\n\u201cA bag of rice which was once sold below N800 is now N38,000. The transportation sector is also affected as people now pay through their nose, to embark on journeys.\n\n\u201cSadly enough, the hardest hit by this ugly development are the people considered as ordinary Nigerians; whose wages or salaries have not experienced the necessary upgrade.\n\n\u201cOf course, financially well to do individuals and highly placed government officials can afford petroleum products at whatever prices they are pegged which is why they rarely come out to speak for the masses.\n\n\u201cRecently the Federal Government imported bad fuel into the country which created an avenue for marketers to hoard the product; thereby creating an artificial scarcity which consequently skyrocketed the price even above N800. The situation which occurred in February last month has lingered with the price of fuel seemed not to be going down below N220 per litre.\n\n\u201d And it is crystal clear that the Federal Government has regulatory agencies like Petroleum Products Price Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) bestowed with the authority to ensure that petroleum marketers sell the products at the approved price.\n\n\u201cThe question now is \u2018does the failure of the government to get the marketers to sell at their approved price of N165 per litre entails that they have used the importation of bad fuel as a way to further increase the price of the product?\n\n\u201cIf the answer is in the affirmative, then the Federal Government should open up to us (citizens) and provide palliative measures to cushion the effect of the accompanying hardship.\n\n\u201cBut if the answer is \u2018No\u2019 the government should urgently prevail on the marketers to come down to the normal and approved price since the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has made persistent claims that they have enough product to serve Nigerians.\u201d",

Farouk Yahaya has said the service will not let the country down in addressing the multifaceted security challenges being faced.\n\nHe also insisted that the military was winning the war against insurgents, citing a recent Global Terrorism Index (GTI) report that commended the country\u2019s efforts.\n\nYahaya gave the assurances in Lagos after unveiling the solar and electricity borehole, street lights built at Isale Eko community by the Army Corps of Engineers to enhance civil-military relations.\n\nHe said security agencies have recorded several successes in the war with obvious results despite isolated attacks by insurgents, adding that appreciable milestones were also recorded in the fight against banditry and kidnapping.\n\nHe urged the people to continue to support the armed forces as eradicating the scourge completely would take time.\n\nYahaya said: \u201cIn other aspects of banditry and kidnapping we are achieving successes both in the North West, North East and North Central and across all tiers even in the South East where we are confronting secessionists.\n\n\u201cWe have achieved a lot of results. Like I said, it is not as if there are no isolated incidents here and there; but those also we are tackling with the support and commitment of the president and the synergy between the Nigerian Army, Nigerian Navy, Nigerian Airforce, other security agencies and stakeholders. We won\u2019t let the country down.\u201d\n\nOn the projects being unveiled, the COAS said it was aimed at bringing succour to the community as well as bringing the army closer to the people.\n\n\u201cThis time the projects that are ongoing in the army were identified areas where we have very senior officers who have through hard work, dedication and commitment, risen to the enviable rank of Major General. They were asked to identify projects of needs in their communities in order for the army to undertake them.\n\n\u201cThis is just one that we have commissioned today. Maj.-Gen. Kamalu Kadiri the Commander Corps of Engineers decided to come back to his roots at Isale Eko and provided them with water, street lights amongst others.\n\n\u201cWe have commissioned several others, three weeks ago at Okene and other places\u2026\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Maj.-Gen. Kadiri said each borehole has two power points one solar light and electricity, adding that also provided were generators to the street lights.\n\n\u201cWe have 38 solar power street lights for selected part of the community. We started the project in November last year and it ended this month,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Nation reports that Yahaya also inaugurated projects at Dondan and Abati Barracks including the Army Finance Corps Soldiers\u2019 Transit accommodation; Army Ordinance School Students\u2019 Hostel, Ablution Block; 70 Command Supply Transport Transit Officers\u2019 accommodation; newly built official residences for Regimental Sergeant Majors (RSMs) of 81 Division, NA Engineers Corps and Signals, as well as office houses at Apapa for the Commander and Deputy Commander, Finance Corps.\n\nThe COAS also visited the Oba of Lagos, Rilwanu Akiolu during the three-day working visit, who thanked the army for their intervention during the #ENDSARS violence and desecration of his palace.\n\nAkiolu dismissed rumours that death was recorded at his palace and urged the youths to stop destroying public infrastructure, just as he expressed optimism that next year\u2019s general elections would be peaceful.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has noted the unity leaders and members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) demonstrated at the just-concluded national convention has put the party on a firmer footing for victory in the 2023 general elections.\n\nBuhari gave the affirmation on Sunday evening in his message formally congratulating the Abdullahi Adamu-led 79-member National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party, which emerged at the convention.\n\nThe President, who returned to the Convention ground at the Eagle Square, Sunday morning with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and Senate President Ahmad Lawan to witness the inauguration of the elected party executives, said the smooth conduct of the exercise raised the prospect of a mouth-watering APC victory next year.\n\nAccording to a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity Mallam Garba Shehu, Buhari said: \u201cThe APC Convention hosted this weekend sets the scene for an APC victory in the presidential and general elections next year. It is a victory over naysayers who believed the party was divided but are now disappointed.\n\n\u201cWe believe that it is equally a victory for the president who has ensured unity across all party positions; and it is a victory for the voters of Nigeria who can now be assured of a smooth succession to new leadership in 2023.\n\n\u201cWhat the Convention made clear was how the media has been peddling fake news of division, when the hard reality of unity, cohesion, and indeed personal warmth between members of the party\u2019s leaders \u2013 incoming and outgoing \u2013 was evident for all to see.\n\n\u201cOf course, the blame for this mindset ought rightly to go to the opposition who in all these years had done the work to only divide the country, leading to all manner of separatist agitations. But this is not the wish, nor is it in the character of the citizens, as was clear for everyone to see at the Eagle Square.\n\n\u201cWhen their fake news of disunity was undone by the facts, some in the opposition could not help themselves but take to the newspapers and the airwaves to find another way to shore up their reputations. That some of the APC\u2019s new leadership were once in the opposition was the new line to take to the media, somehow suggesting that those who have left one party should not hold positions in another. Yet, do the Scriptures not teach us of the virtue of sinners who repent and change their ways?\n\n\u201cWhat the Scriptures say less is of sinners who repent, change their tune, and then choose to re-sin in full public view by returning to their former ways. Given that most important leaders of the opposition PDP first left the party before they returned to it, we might expect the media to ensure criticism of them is damning and absolute. It is incredulous that anyone would consider them trustworthy or acceptable candidates for any public office.\n\n\u201cThe stage is now set for the APC primary elections later this year when the party\u2019s new flag bearers will emerge. No doubt some will attempt to argue the impossible \u2013 that an APC primary election is a source of division while an opposition primary election is a source of consensus.\n\n\u201cBut the good voters of Nigeria can see through such acrobatics and know the facts that, when the contests for 2023 come, APC offers a track record of success and leadership, while the opposition has only decades of failure and complicity in response.\u201d",

We need to renew our faith in our party and its leadership at all levels in order to herald a new dawn. We need to commit to the resolution of our crisis within the confines of our party constitution. We must resist the temptation to blow every minor personal disagreement into a major party crisis.\n\n\u201cIt is time for us to do things differently. When we quarrel, we open our flanks to our rival political parties that are only too eager to exploit them for their own benefit.

This is a historic moment. There is no room for false steps. Our first step is to make our party the bastion of internal democracy. If a party is not internally democratic, it cannot offer the country true democracy.\n\n\u201cTogether, let us rise and march towards the sunrise in our party and in our country. The time has come for us to show statesmanship to arrive at the new dawn. The time has come for us to be patriotic in words and deeds. The time has come for us to affirm our being the party of the people, for the people and by the people,\u201d he assured.\n\n\u201cOnce more, I thank you very much for the confidence reposed in us and I solemnly promise that I shall not disappoint you, I shall not disappoint the APC and the nation. I shall not disappoint Africa. I shall not disappoint the world. So help me, Allah.

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja and Okey Sampson, Umuahia\n\nSome prominent members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Abia have faulted the zoning of 2023 governorship ticket to two different senatorial districts of the state at the same time.\n\nPDP had Saturday in a statement by the state chairman of the party, Asiforo Okere, said it zoned the party\u2019s governorship ticket to Abia Central and Abia North Districts.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nFirst to fault the decision was former Senate President, Senator Adolphus Wabara, who said it was \u201cabsolutely unconstitutional for the party to make a zoning that is confusing and not clear-cut\u201d.\n\nSenator Wabara, secretary, Board of Trustees (BoT) of PDP, expressed surprise that the party could take such a far-reaching decision without first convening a meeting of the State caucus and party elders.\n\n\u201cThe governor and the party chairman cannot stay in the comfort of their offices and zone the position without due consultations.\n\n\u201cPDP is a party that has constitution. So, I don\u2019t know where they got the whole idea from. As far as I\u2019m, and many other leaders of this party are concerned, they did not summon a meeting of the caucus.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure other leaders attended any caucus meeting not to talk of attending any Elders Council meeting where such decisions were reached.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cI may not be a founding father of PDP but I am a founding member of the party. In 1998 when we funded this party, I did not see the likes of Okezie and Asiforo there.\u201d\n\nThe former Senate President dismissed the zoning as \u201cunilateral, childish and laughable.\u201d\n\nSenator Wabara asked Governro Okezie Ikpeazu to copy the openness of his predecessors who left no one in doubt of where their preferred successor would come from.\n\n\u201cHe cannot read our constitution upside down and use excessive force because he is the governor. No, that won\u2019t work!\n\n\u201cI still stand by what I said before: If things are not done the right way, PDP will lose Abia State. So, we should try to do the right thing.\n\n\u201cThe Governor said that very soon he will show the way. By the time he shows us the way, he will now realize the full error in zoning governorship position to two senatorial districs with the flimsy and illiterate excuse that there are so many aspirants from both zones.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, also rejected the purported zoning arrangement.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nAbaribe, who represents Abia South was reacting to a statement credited to the Abia State chairman of the PDP, Dr. Alwell Asiforo, that the ticket had been zoned to Abia North and Central zones.\n\nIn a statement, he urged \u201call Abians who are desirous of an end to imposition in Abia State to disregard the purported zoning.\u201d\n\nHe said while any member of PDP has the right to support anybody for any elective position, it cannot be to the exclusion of other members.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that the statement was merely formulated to exclude me from the contest. By virtue of section 42(2) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, no person or body can exclude me (Nma Agha Ndigbo) from contesting and winning the 2023 elections in Abia State. All PDP members and Abia citizens are therefore urged to remain calm and participate in the forthcoming congresses and primaries where your voice will be heard as we dismantle the cabal that want to keep Abians subjected to further years of imposition. It is only Abians that will decide who will be their Governor in 2023,\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, youths in the state, under the aegis of Abia Youth Vanguard, have faulted the zoning of the governorship ticket to two districts instead of Abia North alone by the PDP.\n\nThe PDP on Saturday night announced the zoning of governorship ticket to Abia North and Abia Central.\n\nThe youths described the zoning as weird with sincerity, which is capable of throwing the ruling party into crisis.\n\nIn a statement by its chairman, David Onwuneme, in Umuahia, the youths said the action was a smokescreen for the actualisation of the self-succession agenda of Ngwa people through Governor Ikpeazu.\n\nThey said the zoning arrangements in the state, since 1999, had always been for one zone at a time and never two zones as announced by PDP.\n\n\u201cThe zoning started in Abia North in 1999, with Orji Uzor Kalu. Then it went to Abia Central in 2007 with TA Orji after which it got to Abia South with the incumbent, Okezie Ikpeazu in 2015. Naturally therefore, it should return to Abia North in 2023.\n\n\u201cOrji Uzor Kalu publicly declared TA Orji as his successor. TA did same by publicly announcing Ikpeazu as his successor. We expect the governor to follow suit by picking one person from Abia North as his preferred successor,\u201d Onwuneme said.\n\nHe said it was weird that Abia Central which handed over to Ikpeazu just seven years ago is included for the 2023 contest because of the quest for self-succession, knowing that Isiala Ngwa North and South are in the zone.\n\nThe youths said if Governor Ikpeazu and PDP believe in the Abia charter of Equity, the governorship ticket should be zoned solely to Abia North, in accordance with rotation arrangement in the state.",

          "text": "\n\n*Renames APC national secretariat after Buhari\n\nEmameh Gabriel in Abuja\n\nOutgoing Caretaker Committee Chairman of the ruling All Progressive Congress and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, has said that he would leave behind a strong and united APC family to his successor.\n\nBuni on his valedictory speech at the APC national convention, gave account of his stewardship as the caretaker chairman of the party in the last two years, noting that his efforts have repositioned the party.\n\nBuni had come under fire in recent times over how he managed the cracks in the party, and was almost removed from office by some powerful forces that were allegedly backed by President Buhari in his last days in office through what many had described as a palace coup.\n\nBuni was appointed to steer the affairs of the party after the removal of Adams Oshiomhole from office in 2019. His mandate however was to manage the crisis in the party and thereafter conduct a national convention that will produce a National Working Committee for the party.\n\nBut the convention was postponed several times. However, in his speech last night, Buni attributed it to the larger problems he inherited from a party he said was more polarised then and needed more time to be cured from its internal ailments.\n\nWhile he thanked the President and stakeholders of the party for the support they gave to him in his days in office, Buni boasted that he was \u201cmore confident than ever, that with a population of over 41 million registered members and still counting, APC has the potential and capacity to remain Nigeria\u2019s ruling party and indeed, Africa\u2019s largest political party.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cI am delighted with your esteemed presence at this epoch-making occasion in the life of our party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), as we assemble here for the National Convention, climaxing the transition process which started with the conduct of ward, local, and state congresses. Today, we are going for the zonal and national offices as well as, the ratification of the amended constitution of Africa\u2019s largest political party, the APC.\n\n*As you are aware, the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee which l am opportune to chair, is a child of circumstance constituted by the National Executive Committee (NEC), to restructure and reposition the party.\n\n\u201cYour Excellencies, distinguished personalities, ladies and gentlemen, permit me to quickly reflect on some of the modest achievements recorded by the party under the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee whose tenure is ending today, for us to appreciate how far we have gone in revamping and improving our beloved party.\n\n\u201cUpon assumption of office, the committee embarked on a genuine and all-inclusive reconciliation process to give everyone a true sense of belonging, confidence, and reassurance in the collective ownership of the party.\n\n\u201cWe, first of all, visited some critical stakeholders to engage them in resolving the disputes and other hanging disagreements in the party. While some of these visits were made public, others were done out of the public glare and without media publicity. Similarly, we visited some aggrieved chieftains who sincerely shared their ill feelings with the committee. We spoke to each other frankly, placing party interests above personal interests.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am glad to state that those frank discussions built a new hope in the hearts of the aggrieved persons such that, those who earlier left the party returned back, while those contemplating to forsake the party, never left.\n\n\u201cHowever, when we commenced the assignment, we realized that the problems on the ground had far outweighed our estimation of the time required to resolve the huge problems bedeviling the party. This made the initial Six months dateline grossly inadequate, unrealistic, and not practicable and therefore, the need for extension of more time. Happily, for every extension, we brought in additional values with positive developments into the party.\n\n\u201cHaving reconciled substantial stakeholders, members and groups, the committee commenced membership registration and revalidation exercise, being one of the mandates of the CECPC, to establish the party\u2019s numerical strength for proper planning and mobilization. The exercise provided our new members the opportunity to register as legitimate members of APC with equal rights, privileges, and opportunities, as well as, to give back the ownership of the party to the members, using the bottom-top approach.\n\n\u201cI am glad to state with all sense of fulfillment that the membership registration and revalidation exercise, recorded over 41 million members who registered with the details of their Permanent Voter Cards (PVC) and passport size photographs.

          "title": "How Nigeria\u2019s Justice Minister, Malami Manipulated Federal High Court To Issue Conflicting Orders On Section 84(12) Of Amended Electoral Act \u2014 Falana",
          "text": "Human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN) has alleged that the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami manipulated the judgement of the Federal High Court in Umahia, Abia State with regards to deletion of section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported that the AGF alongside some principal officers such as Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, and the Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele, worked behind the scenes to obtain an order by the Federal High Court Umuahia that would keep them in office even if they contest for political offices.\n\nThe controversial section 84(12) of the Electoral Act reads: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor instance, with the provisions of the act, political appointees such as Amaechi, Minister of Transportation; Malami, Minister of Justice; Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment; Emeka Nwajiuba, Minister of State for Education; Godswill Akpabio, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs; Timipre Sylva, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, among others who have been reportedly linked to presidential and governorship ambitions must resign from their various offices if they want to contest in 2023.\n\n\n\nHowever, Malami and the others cunningly sought the deletion of the provision from the constitution in their own favour.\n\n\n\nAlso, President Muhammadu Buhari had, after signing the bill into the law, written the National Assembly requesting that the provision be expunged from the Electoral Act.\n\n\n\nBut the opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party had on March 2, 2022, filed an ex-parte motion against the Nigerian government at the Federal High Court in Abuja seeking to stop attempts to tamper with the Act.\n\n\n\nThe PDP also prayed the court for an order of interim injunction restraining Buhari and other defendants from refusing to implement the duly signed Electoral Act or in any manner withholding the Electoral Act from being put to use, including the provisions of Section 84 (12) of the said Act pending the resolution of the suit.\n\n\n\nThis was granted on March 7 by the presiding judge, Inyang Ekwo.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, two other suits were filed both in Ibadan, Oyo State and Umahia, Abia State by one Oyewole Bolanle and Nduka Edede respectively compelling the AGF to delete the provision.\n\n\n\nOn March 19, the Federal High Court sitting in Umuahia ordered the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation to immediately delete Section 84 (12) of the Amended New Electoral Act.\n\n\n\nThe court in a judgment delivered by Justice Evelyn Anyadike held that the section was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever and cannot stand as it violates the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\n\n\nWhile Malami failed to react to the March 7 orders, the Umuahia judgment was recognised as the AGF\u2019s office gave the federal government\u2019s position through the Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, Umar Jibrilu Gwandu.\n\n\n\nGwandu said the minister would accordingly give effect to the court judgment in line with the dictates of the law and the spirit of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice will accordingly give effect to the Court judgment in line with the dictates of the law and the spirit of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe judgment of the Court will be recognized by the Government printers in printing the Electoral Act. The Act will be gazetted factoring the effect of the judgment into consideration and deleting the constitutionally offensive provision accordingly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 is not part of our law and will be so treated accordingly. This is in line with the dictates of chapter 7, Part 4, Section 287 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) on enforcement of decisions that make it a point of duty and obligation on all authorities and persons to have the judgment of the Federal High Court, among others, to be enforced,\u201d the AGF office said.\n\n\n\nBut in a statement on Sunday, Falana pointed out flaws, noting that the two cases filed by both Bolanle and Edede were similar despite being filed in different courts and locations \u2014 confirming SaharaReporters\u2019 story that Malami and others were able to find a judge to do their bidding.\n\n\n\nAlso, Falana noted that Malami, being the defendant in both cases failed to draw the attention of both Ibadan and Umuahia Judicial Divisions of the Federal High Court to the fact that the Abuja Judicial Division of the same Court already gave a verdict with regards to deletion of the section prior to the Umahia court.\n\n\n\nFalana further noted that Malami failed to inform the Umuahia court that the Ibadan Judicial Division of the court had struck out a similar case for want of locus standi.\n\n\n\nHe, however, warned that if the Attorney General goes ahead to delete section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, he (Malami) would be liable to be committed for contempt ex facie curiae as the Abuja Judicial Division of the Federal High Court has restrained him and other defendants \"from enforcing the provisions of the said Electoral Act, 2022 including the provisions of Section 84(12) of the said Act pending the determination of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.\"\n\n\n\nThis is even as the Senior Advocate noted that Malami cannot delete section 84(12) of the Electoral Act unless the valid and subsisting order of the Abuja Judicial Division of the Federal High Court is set aside, either by the trial Judge or an Appellate Court.\n\n\n\n\n\nFalana submitted, \u201cFrom the foregoing, it is crystal clear that even though the two lawyers who represented the Plaintiffs in Suit Nos FHC/ IB/CS/32/2022: CHIEF OYEWOLE BOLANLE v ATTORNEY-GENERAL OF THE FEDERATION and FHC/UM/CS/26/2002: CHIEF NDUKA EDEDE V ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE FEDERATION are based in Ibadan, Oyo State and Umuahia, Abia State, the two cases filed by them were similar in every material particular.\n\n\n\n\u201cHence, the two questions formulated for determination and the four similar reliefs sought by their clients in the two cases filed at the Ibadan and Umuahia judicial divisions of the Federal High Court are in pari material.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven though the Plaintiffs are different the Attorney-General of the Federation is the sole defendant in both cases. It is doubtful if the similarities in the two cases can be said to be mere coincidence.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, the Attorney-General of the Federation, the Defendant in both cases did not draw the attention of both Ibadan and Umuahia Judicial Divisions of the Federal High Court to the fact that the Abuja Judicial Division of the same Court had on March 7, 2022, restrained himself, President Buhari, National Assembly and the Independent National Electoral Commission from refusing to implement the provisions of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\n\n\n\u201cNeither did the Attorney-General disclose to the Umuahia Judicial Division of the Federal High Court that the Ibadan Judicial Division had struck out a similar case for want of locus standi.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn any case, since the case pending at the Ibadan Judicial Division of the Federal High Court was well reported in the print and electronic media, the Judge sitting in the Umuahia Judicial Division ought to have struck out the fresh case before her as it constituted a gross abuse of court process.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to note that while the Attorney-General of the Federation pretended not to know about the order of interim injunction granted by the Abuja Judicial Division of the Federal High Court, he has announced the plan of the Federal Government to comply with the judgment delivered in the Umuahia case soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, if the Attorney General goes ahead to delete section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, he would be liable to be committed for contempt ex facie curiae as the Abuja Judicial Division of the Federal High Court has restrained him and other defendants from \u2018from enforcing the provisions of the said Electoral Act, 2022 including the provisions of Section 84(12) of the said Act pending the determination of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cWe submit, without any fear of contradiction, that unless the valid and subsisting order of the Abuja Judicial Division of the Federal High Court is set aside either by the trial Judge or an Appellate Court, the Attorney-General of the Federation cannot delete section 84(12) of the Electoral Act.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is trite that the Attorney-General cannot choose and pick the orders of the court to obey or disobey. More so, when it is undoubtedly clear that the Attorney-General deliberately set out to manipulate the Federal High Court to issue conflicting orders in a desperate move to annul section 84(12) of the Electoral Act.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo doubt, this is the first time in the entire history of Nigeria that the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation has engaged in forum shopping for favourable orders of the Federal High Court or another Court. It is high time the dangerous manipulation of the Federal High Court was stopped as the nation prepares for the 2023 General Elections.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN) has alleged that the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami manipulated the judgement of the Federal High Court in Umahia, Abia State with regards to deletion of section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported that the AGF alongside some principal officers such as Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, and the Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele, worked behind the scenes to obtain an order by the Federal High Court Umuahia that would keep them in office even if they contest for political offices.\n\nThe controversial section 84(12) of the Electoral Act reads: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor instance, with the provisions of the act, political appointees such as Amaechi, Minister of Transportation; Malami, Minister of Justice; Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment; Emeka Nwajiuba, Minister of State for Education; Godswill Akpabio, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs; Timipre Sylva, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, among others who have been reportedly linked to presidential and governorship ambitions must resign from their various offices if they want to contest in 2023.\n\n\n\nHowever, Malami and the others cunningly sought the deletion of the provision from the constitution in their own favour.\n\n\n\nAlso, President Muhammadu Buhari had, after signing the bill into the law, written the National Assembly requesting that the provision be expunged from the Electoral Act.\n\n\n\nBut the opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party had on March 2, 2022, filed an ex-parte motion against the Nigerian government at the Federal High Court in Abuja seeking to stop attempts to tamper with the Act.\n\n\n\nThe PDP also prayed the court for an order of interim injunction restraining Buhari and other defendants from refusing to implement the duly signed Electoral Act or in any manner withholding the Electoral Act from being put to use, including the provisions of Section 84 (12) of the said Act pending the resolution of the suit.\n\n\n\nThis was granted on March 7 by the presiding judge, Inyang Ekwo.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, two other suits were filed both in Ibadan, Oyo State and Umahia, Abia State by one Oyewole Bolanle and Nduka Edede respectively compelling the AGF to delete the provision.\n\n\n\nOn March 19, the Federal High Court sitting in Umuahia ordered the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation to immediately delete Section 84 (12) of the Amended New Electoral Act.\n\n\n\nThe court in a judgment delivered by Justice Evelyn Anyadike held that the section was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever and cannot stand as it violates the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\n\n\nWhile Malami failed to react to the March 7 orders, the Umuahia judgment was recognised as the AGF\u2019s office gave the federal government\u2019s position through the Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, Umar Jibrilu Gwandu.\n\n\n\nGwandu said the minister would accordingly give effect to the court judgment in line with the dictates of the law and the spirit of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice will accordingly give effect to the Court judgment in line with the dictates of the law and the spirit of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe judgment of the Court will be recognized by the Government printers in printing the Electoral Act. The Act will be gazetted factoring the effect of the judgment into consideration and deleting the constitutionally offensive provision accordingly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 is not part of our law and will be so treated accordingly. This is in line with the dictates of chapter 7, Part 4, Section 287 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) on enforcement of decisions that make it a point of duty and obligation on all authorities and persons to have the judgment of the Federal High Court, among others, to be enforced,\u201d the AGF office said.\n\n\n\nBut in a statement on Sunday, Falana pointed out flaws, noting that the two cases filed by both Bolanle and Edede were similar despite being filed in different courts and locations \u2014 confirming SaharaReporters\u2019 story that Malami and others were able to find a judge to do their bidding.\n\n\n\nAlso, Falana noted that Malami, being the defendant in both cases failed to draw the attention of both Ibadan and Umuahia Judicial Divisions of the Federal High Court to the fact that the Abuja Judicial Division of the same Court already gave a verdict with regards to deletion of the section prior to the Umahia court.\n\n\n\nFalana further noted that Malami failed to inform the Umuahia court that the Ibadan Judicial Division of the court had struck out a similar case for want of locus standi.\n\n\n\nHe, however, warned that if the Attorney General goes ahead to delete section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, he (Malami) would be liable to be committed for contempt ex facie curiae as the Abuja Judicial Division of the Federal High Court has restrained him and other defendants \"from enforcing the provisions of the said Electoral Act, 2022 including the provisions of Section 84(12) of the said Act pending the determination of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.\"\n\n\n\nThis is even as the Senior Advocate noted that Malami cannot delete section 84(12) of the Electoral Act unless the valid and subsisting order of the Abuja Judicial Division of the Federal High Court is set aside, either by the trial Judge or an Appellate Court.\n\n\n\n\n\nFalana submitted, \u201cFrom the foregoing, it is crystal clear that even though the two lawyers who represented the Plaintiffs in Suit Nos FHC/ IB/CS/32/2022: CHIEF OYEWOLE BOLANLE v ATTORNEY-GENERAL OF THE FEDERATION and FHC/UM/CS/26/2002: CHIEF NDUKA EDEDE V ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE FEDERATION are based in Ibadan, Oyo State and Umuahia, Abia State, the two cases filed by them were similar in every material particular.\n\n\n\n\u201cHence, the two questions formulated for determination and the four similar reliefs sought by their clients in the two cases filed at the Ibadan and Umuahia judicial divisions of the Federal High Court are in pari material.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven though the Plaintiffs are different the Attorney-General of the Federation is the sole defendant in both cases.

          "text": "The ruling All Progressives Congress, on Saturday, held its national convention after postponing the exercise about four times since 2020.\n\n\n\nHowever, some members of the APC are currently lamenting the outcome of the convention with former members of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) clinching top positions.\n\nThe result of the convention was earlier announced on Sunday as Abdullahi Adamu, a former governor of Nasarawa State emerged as the new national chairman of the Party.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters observed that Adamu, alongside some others who clinched key positions in the party\u2019s new National Working Committee, had decamped from the PDP to the APC.\n\n\n\nFor the records, Adamu served as governor of Nasarawa State for eight years between 1999 and 2007 as a candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party.\n\n\n\nWhile in the PDP, Adamu was the first Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF). After his tenure, he got elected to the Senate in 2007 to represent Nasarawa West still on PDP\u2019s ticket.\n\n\n\nHowever, in January 2014, Adamu decamped to the APC despite being a founding member of the PDP in 1998.\n\n\n\nAlso, former Deputy Governor of Osun State, Senator Iyiola Omisore decamped to the APC in February 2021.\n\n\n\nOmisore became the deputy governor on the platform of the Alliance for Democracy (AD) between 1999 and 2003.\n\n\n\nHe later defected to the PDP where he served as a senator between 2003 and 2011.\n\n\n\nHe joined the Social Democratic Party (SDP) under which he contested the 2018 Osun governorship election on the platform, from where he crossed to the APC.\n\n\n\nChecks by SaharaReporters revealed other members of the newly constituted NWC who were former members of the PDP. This includes Barr Festus Fuanter (Plateau State) who was appointed as the deputy national secretary.\n\n\n\nThe new vice-chairman (North Central) of the APC, Muazu Bawa Rjau had also decamped from the PDP to the ruling party.\n\n\n\nOthers are Mustapha Salihu, national vice-chairman (North -East); Barr Ahmed El-Marzuk, national legal adviser; Uguru Matthew Ofoka, national treasurer; Senator Abubakar Maikafi, national auditor; Betta Edu, national women leader; Barr F.N. Nwosu, national welfare secretary, and Nze Chidi Duru, deputy national organizing secretary.\n\n\n\nVictor Giadom emerged as the National Vice Chairman, South-South. Before following the Minister of Transportation to the APC, Giadom served as Commissioner for Works under Governor Amaechi in Rivers State between 2011 and 2015.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters on Saturday, March 19 reported that several bigwigs in the ruling All Progressives Congress party were worried as it appeared that all its key national positions were being left for politicians and leaders who had defected from the PDP.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters has reported that there was confusion among the APC top shots as former PDP heavyweights were set to occupy key positions in the ruling party.\n\n\n\nFollowing Saturday\u2019s national convention of the party in Abuja, PDP defectors are now in firm control of the ruling party which could lead to its being ousted from power in 2023, as the APC cabal had feared.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters earlier today reported that top sources in the party listed names being considered for some key positions ahead of the March 26 National Convention.\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters about a week before the convention, one of the top sources said the APC cabals were worried about how former PDP leaders had infiltrated the ranks of the ruling party.\n\n\n\nHe had said, \u201cHow APC National Convention is turning out is that the party is considering Adamu Abdullahi for chairman. But there are worries that former PDP people will control our party.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Adamu Abdullahi is from PDP. There is also Victor Gaidom, who is to represent the South-South. Also, Yakubu Dogara is PDP. The Omisore being considered for National Secretary is PDP; even Kenneth Nnamani to contest from the South-East is also PDP.\n\n\n\n\"This is the reason why they want to drop Omisore and replace him with Ife Oyedele, who was with the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC).\"\n\n\n\n\u201cAlso, Senator Ali Ndume who is Amaechi\u2019s cheerleader is from the PDP. There are already plans to stop Omisore. The ruling party is worried that it cannot have too many former PDP defectors as leaders of the APC,\u201d another source hinted.\n\nRecently, David Umahi and Ben Ayade \u2013 governors of Ebonyi and Cross River states \u2013 had joined the APC, although they and their states had traditionally been PDP.\n\n\n\nSo also, Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State who joined the APC last year was with the PDP and won his election on the platform.\n\n\n\nBird Of A Feather \u2013Activists\n\nMeanwhile, before the announcement of the final list, human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore had also predicted that members of the PDP now manage the APC.\n\n\n\nSowore had tweeted, \u201c#APCConvention @OfficialAPCNg is the convening of some of the most corrupt, incompetent, wicked, unjust and dishonest men and women politicians the world has ever known! And just so that you understand what we\u2019ve been saying, @OfficialPDPNig will now manage @OfficialAPCNg.\"\n\nSimilarly, human rights lawyer, Inibehe Effiong mocked the APC and the anti-corruption fight of the Muhammadu Buhari-led government on Sunday.\n\n\n\nHe said there is no difference between the APC and the PDP, which the ruling party and Buhari\u2019s government have repeatedly accused of being corrupt and destroying Nigeria during its 16-year rule.\n\n\n\nIn a series of tweets, Effiong said, \u201cHave you seen that most of the names on the APC \u2018Unity List\u2019 are long time and some founding members of PDP? From the new National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, to Deputy National Chairman, Ken Nnamani, to National Secretary, Iyiola Omisore, they are largely from the PDP bloodline.\n\n\n\n\u201cSome of them have been accused of corruption at one point or the other. Tomorrow, they will say that the APC is different from PDP or that the PDP is different from the APC.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe joke is on their gullible supporters who are living in denial of the obvious fact that these two parties have nothing good to offer Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cMembers of the APC are talking about 16 years of PDP misrule, while their brothers in PDP are talking about 7 years of APC misrule.

          "title": "Convention: SaharaReporters\u2019 Report Confirmed, Alleged PDP Criminals Who Destroyed Nigeria Now In Firm Control Of \u2018Anti-Corruption Fighting\u2019 Ruling APC",
          "text": "The ruling All Progressives Congress, on Saturday, held its national convention after postponing the exercise about four times since 2020.\n\n\n\nHowever, some members of the APC are currently lamenting the outcome of the convention with former members of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) clinching top positions.\n\nThe result of the convention was earlier announced on Sunday as Abdullahi Adamu, a former governor of Nasarawa State emerged as the new national chairman of the Party.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters observed that Adamu, alongside some others who clinched key positions in the party\u2019s new National Working Committee, had decamped from the PDP to the APC.\n\n\n\nFor the records, Adamu served as governor of Nasarawa State for eight years between 1999 and 2007 as a candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party.\n\n\n\nWhile in the PDP, Adamu was the first Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF). After his tenure, he got elected to the Senate in 2007 to represent Nasarawa West still on PDP\u2019s ticket.\n\n\n\nHowever, in January 2014, Adamu decamped to the APC despite being a founding member of the PDP in 1998.\n\n\n\nAlso, former Deputy Governor of Osun State, Senator Iyiola Omisore decamped to the APC in February 2021.\n\n\n\nOmisore became the deputy governor on the platform of the Alliance for Democracy (AD) between 1999 and 2003.\n\n\n\nHe later defected to the PDP where he served as a senator between 2003 and 2011.\n\n\n\nHe joined the Social Democratic Party (SDP) under which he contested the 2018 Osun governorship election on the platform, from where he crossed to the APC.\n\n\n\nChecks by SaharaReporters revealed other members of the newly constituted NWC who were former members of the PDP. This includes Barr Festus Fuanter (Plateau State) who was appointed as the deputy national secretary.\n\n\n\nThe new vice-chairman (North Central) of the APC, Muazu Bawa Rjau had also decamped from the PDP to the ruling party.\n\n\n\nOthers are Mustapha Salihu, national vice-chairman (North -East); Barr Ahmed El-Marzuk, national legal adviser; Uguru Matthew Ofoka, national treasurer; Senator Abubakar Maikafi, national auditor; Betta Edu, national women leader; Barr F.N. Nwosu, national welfare secretary, and Nze Chidi Duru, deputy national organizing secretary.\n\n\n\nVictor Giadom emerged as the National Vice Chairman, South-South. Before following the Minister of Transportation to the APC, Giadom served as Commissioner for Works under Governor Amaechi in Rivers State between 2011 and 2015.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters on Saturday, March 19 reported that several bigwigs in the ruling All Progressives Congress party were worried as it appeared that all its key national positions were being left for politicians and leaders who had defected from the PDP.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters has reported that there was confusion among the APC top shots as former PDP heavyweights were set to occupy key positions in the ruling party.\n\n\n\nFollowing Saturday\u2019s national convention of the party in Abuja, PDP defectors are now in firm control of the ruling party which could lead to its being ousted from power in 2023, as the APC cabal had feared.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters earlier today reported that top sources in the party listed names being considered for some key positions ahead of the March 26 National Convention.\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters about a week before the convention, one of the top sources said the APC cabals were worried about how former PDP leaders had infiltrated the ranks of the ruling party.\n\n\n\nHe had said, \u201cHow APC National Convention is turning out is that the party is considering Adamu Abdullahi for chairman. But there are worries that former PDP people will control our party.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Adamu Abdullahi is from PDP. There is also Victor Gaidom, who is to represent the South-South. Also, Yakubu Dogara is PDP. The Omisore being considered for National Secretary is PDP; even Kenneth Nnamani to contest from the South-East is also PDP.\n\n\n\n\"This is the reason why they want to drop Omisore and replace him with Ife Oyedele, who was with the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC).\"\n\n\n\n\u201cAlso, Senator Ali Ndume who is Amaechi\u2019s cheerleader is from the PDP. There are already plans to stop Omisore. The ruling party is worried that it cannot have too many former PDP defectors as leaders of the APC,\u201d another source hinted.\n\nRecently, David Umahi and Ben Ayade \u2013 governors of Ebonyi and Cross River states \u2013 had joined the APC, although they and their states had traditionally been PDP.\n\n\n\nSo also, Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State who joined the APC last year was with the PDP and won his election on the platform.\n\n\n\nBird Of A Feather \u2013Activists\n\nMeanwhile, before the announcement of the final list, human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore had also predicted that members of the PDP now manage the APC.\n\n\n\nSowore had tweeted, \u201c#APCConvention @OfficialAPCNg is the convening of some of the most corrupt, incompetent, wicked, unjust and dishonest men and women politicians the world has ever known! And just so that you understand what we\u2019ve been saying, @OfficialPDPNig will now manage @OfficialAPCNg.\"\n\nSimilarly, human rights lawyer, Inibehe Effiong mocked the APC and the anti-corruption fight of the Muhammadu Buhari-led government on Sunday.\n\n\n\nHe said there is no difference between the APC and the PDP, which the ruling party and Buhari\u2019s government have repeatedly accused of being corrupt and destroying Nigeria during its 16-year rule.\n\n\n\nIn a series of tweets, Effiong said, \u201cHave you seen that most of the names on the APC \u2018Unity List\u2019 are long time and some founding members of PDP? From the new National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, to Deputy National Chairman, Ken Nnamani, to National Secretary, Iyiola Omisore, they are largely from the PDP bloodline.\n\n\n\n\u201cSome of them have been accused of corruption at one point or the other. Tomorrow, they will say that the APC is different from PDP or that the PDP is different from the APC.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe joke is on their gullible supporters who are living in denial of the obvious fact that these two parties have nothing good to offer Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cMembers of the APC are talking about 16 years of PDP misrule, while their brothers in PDP are talking about 7 years of APC misrule. Doesn\u2019t that show that both parties are decadent?\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are busy measuring their failures while we make silly excuses for them. What we should be talking about is the 23 years of PDP/APC misrule and how to put an end to their joint misrule.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have said it before and it bears repeating, choosing between the devil and the deep blue sea is not, and should not be the destiny of Nigeria. We will continue to suffer until we rise above partisan, ethnic and religious sentiments and vote credible people into power.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs long as we keep voting thieves and our enemies under different guises and make excuses for our terrible political choices, our misery as a people will not end. #WeCantContinueLikeThis\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has been pointed out that Emmanuel Enukwu was chosen to replace Ken Nnamani as Deputy National Chairman (South).

What the Scriptures say less is of sinners who repent, change their tune, and then choose to re-sin in full public view by returning to their former ways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGiven that most important leaders of the opposition PDP first left the party before they returned to it, we might expect the media to ensure criticism of them is damning and absolute.\n\n\u201cIt is incredulous that anyone would consider them trustworthy or acceptable candidates for any public office.\n\n\u201cThe stage is now set for the APC primary elections later this year when the party\u2019s new flag bearers will emerge. No doubt some will attempt to argue the impossible \u2013 that an APC primary election is a source of division while an opposition primary election is a source of consensus.\n\n\u201cBut the good voters of Nigeria can see through such acrobatics and know the facts that, when the contests for 2023 come, APC offers a track record of success and leadership, while the opposition has only decades of failure and complicity in response.\u201d",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: The pastor turned tech bro",
          "text": "\u201cEven if I have the call of God, it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t have a career. I shouldn\u2019t have to rely on church offerings to survive. Here\u2019s where people have a problem with pastors: they believe that most pastors wait for tithes or offerings. But that\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nWhen Jay*, a pastor-turned-data-scientist, was in his final year as a computer engineering student at the Oduduwa University in Osun state, Nigeria, he decided his final year project would focus on e-voting in Nigeria. \u201cBut that topic wasn\u2019t approved,\u201d he says. The reason, Jay says, was that the lecturers in charge, at the time, knew nothing about the applications of tech. \u201cThey told me to be realistic. This was 2018, mind you, but they said that tech wasn\u2019t that important in the country, and that I should research something else. I can\u2019t remember what I finally wrote about, but I know it had nothing to do with tech and its potential impact on our society.\u201d\n\nIf the impact of tech on voting would not be important in 2018, the year before Africa\u2019s most populous country conducted its last general elections, when would it ever be?\n\nFor Jay, this event pushed him towards putting his degree to good use and becoming an all-round tech bro. He doesn\u2019t think his lecturers meant any harm, but he believes their lack of knowledge on the impact of tech will have damning consequences on the students they teach.\n\nAlthough he\u2019d been studying computer engineering, Jay already had a first love: ministering. Born to a Muslim mother and Christian father, he believes he\u2019s been ordained by God to preach the gospel. \u201cMy father died early, so I had to live with my paternal grandmother, and that\u2019s where I got introduced to the word.\u201d\n\nFrom his university days, Jay had been working as a minister, teaching the bible under his own ministry. His only worry was how to make an income independent of the church\u2019s income. \u201cI knew I had to have a career outside ministering. The problem most people have with pastors is that a lot of us depend on the church\u2019s income. I didn\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\nSo, during his National Youth Service\u2014a mandatory 1\u2013year programme all Nigerians must participate in, in service of their country\u2014Jay branched out into tech. He developed design skills and worked as a graphics designer for 17 months before moving to another company to work as a user interface designer.\n\nMonths later, in 2020, Jay landed a hybrid role working as a data annotator for a US-based company that uses artificial intelligence to measure consumer needs.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what a data annotator does, you\u2019re right to wonder. It\u2019s an unsung profession. \u201cAs a data annotator, my job is to collect and label data that the AIs will use to forecast how consumers will react to e-commerce products,\u201d Jay explains. \u201cFor example, we take the iPhone 13 and try to figure out its impact on users in the next few years.\u201d\n\nThink of data annotation as teaching or training a computer. Focus on AI increased significantly this decade with $77 billion getting invested in the sector, a 113% increase from 2020\u2019s $36 billion investment. In Africa, though, investment in the AI sector is low, accounting for only 3% of total startup investments. It\u2019s no surprise then that data annotators, whose work primarily focus on AI, are scarce on the continent.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really hacked the importance of AI on the continent, and that\u2019s why there aren\u2019t many data annotators. Whenever I tell people about my job, there\u2019s a bit of scepticism and doubt. There are always questions about what I do, even from top professionals in the field.\u201d\n\nOn his experience with the job, Jay says he enjoys the process and hopes more Africans would get into the field. If there\u2019s any complaint he has, though, it\u2019s the pay gap between him and his non-Nigerian colleagues working for the same company. In the Nigerian context, the job pays fairly well, with Jay getting \u20a6250,000 ($600)/month plus benefits, including pension, HMO, and a work laptop. The benefits are the same with the company\u2019s non-Nigerian employees, except for one big difference.\n\n\u201cI know some of my US colleagues earn about \u20a62.5 million per month, even though we\u2019re doing the same job for the company.\u201d\n\nEven with the pay disparity, Jay is still pretty comfortable with his job. \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing, and it helps me provide for my family without having to depend on the church\u2019s income.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his design, product, and data annotation skills, he\u2019s also learning software engineering to help him become an all-round tech bro.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just doing this for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the same way I\u2019m teaching the word, I also want to teach tech, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m learning these skills.\u201d\n\nIn the near future, he hopes to bring more people to the altar of tech and preach to them the good news of how much tech can improve their lives.\n\n*Name has been changed to protect the owner\u2019s identity.\n\n\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech.

          "text": "In an email circular that went out from Bento Africa\u2019s board of directors to the company\u2019s customers and partners on Wednesday evening, the board announced that Ebun Okubanjo will be taking \u201csome time off\u201d and handing over all people-related decisions to his co-founder and COO, Chidozie Okonkwo. Chidozie will lead people operations alongside the company\u2019s country directors.\n\nBento\u2019s board\u2019s decision comes a few days after TechCabal exposed the harrowing experiences of ex-employees of payroll startup Bento Africa and how Okubanjo had allegedly been the orchestrator of that through direct and indirect bullying, verbal abuse, and threats to employees.\n\nIn their email to Bento\u2019s customers and clients, the board condemned Ebun\u2019s initial reaction to the story, especially his tweets attacking the credibility of publication TechCabal.\n\n\u201cAs professional Investors and Operators, we were aghast at the defensive and escalatory first tweets of Ebun on the matter, which we quickly moved against. Our responsibility and charter is to the Company, not the founders we invest in,\u201d the board said in an email sent to all Bento employees, past and present.\n\nFurthermore, the board said that while Okubanjo is taking a back seat with immediate effect, an internal investigation into Bento\u2019s workplace culture has begun. It also announced that it would be reviewing Bento Africa\u2019s internal management practices and processes.\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing the HR and People practices and guidelines at Bento and will work with HR consultants and the company\u2019s in-house team to make sure that it is reflective of human values that drive sustainable performance,\u201d said the board in the email.\n\nThe board claimed to have \u201c\u2026ensured that the current team is safe and free to speak freely. We voided any NDA\u2019s that may have been in place and instructed Management to let the Team know they were free to speak to any journalist that contacted them.\u201d TechCabal reached out to current Bento Africa employees who confirmed that they had been granted permission to speak freely without worrying about consequences.\n\n\u201cI think not restricting us from talking to journalists and cancelling our NDAs is the right thing to do,\u201d said one of the 3 employees TechCabal reached out to for the expose.\u201d\n\nOkubanjo also published a personal apology to current and past employees of the company via his Medium page. In the post titled From ebun. With Love, Okubanjo admits to encouraging a work culture of \u201clong workdays and weeks\u201d and apologised for his abusive outbursts. He also confirmed the board\u2019s decision to appoint Chidozie to lead people operations at the company.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Okubanjo writes. \u201cI have some work to do here and there is a lot of room for growth. It will [sic] be a lie if I say this is a switch I can make overnight, I would [sic] need to learn how to balance passion with empathy. I will step away from all people decisions in the company. Chidozie will take over along with our new Head of People \u2014 Her arrival could not have been more timely. The country leads will also be instrumental in helping shape a more humane people policy.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to repair broken bridges, the CEO also encouraged former and current employees who have \u201cfelt that fire that burns [sic] so hot when we are in the thick of it\u201d to reach out to him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in support of the way Ebun handled the situation, and we\u2019re currently running an internal investigation to quantify the scale of the damages his actions have brought to employees and the business,\u201d said board member and CEO at Zedcrest, Adedayo Hamza. \u201cWe\u2019re open to speaking to anyone about this process.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "\u201cBento took everything from me\u2014my sense of humanity, sanity, confidence, and trust,\u201d Pascal*, an ex-sales executive at Nigerian payroll startup Bento Africa, said about his time working there. \u201cWe worked around the clock. Ebun [CEO and co-founder of the company] would send you messages by 2 AM and expect a response asap. No rest. We went to bed every night praying our jobs would still be there when we woke up the next morning.\u201d\n\nOn March 18, 2021, Pascal\u2019s prayer, which had seemed to work for over a year, stopped working. He was abruptly fired from his job. He fell into a depressive state, and everything stopped making sense. He stopped going out, and his relationships with friends and family suffered. Even though he said working at Bento for over a year had been torture, it was all he had at the time.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng) is the brainchild of Ebun Okubanjo and Chidozie Okonkwo, his friend, business partner, and Bento\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO). Headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria, Bento provides payroll management software to 900 businesses, including Hygeia, Paystack, Kobo360, Branch, and LORI Systems.\n\nOkubanjo and Okonkwo built, and still run, multiple businesses together. While both co-founders flock together, they aren\u2019t quite of the same feather. All ex-employees who spoke to us described Okubanjo as fire and Okonkwo as neither water nor fire; Okonkwo simply remains in the background, silent and rarely engaged in the company\u2019s day-to-day operations. These ex-employees therefore believe that Okonkwo\u2019s attitude outsources all authority to Okubanjo and enables his toxicity.\n\nIn Okubanjo\u2019s termination email to Pascal, he was fired because of a \u201clack of cultural fit and poor performance\u201d. But Pascal wondered: \u201cHow could I have been culturally unfit and incompetent after working for you for over a year? Why did it take you that long to clock my incompetence?\u201d\n\nOkubanjo\u2019s email terminating Pascal\u2019s contract\n\nThe termination letter\n\nHe said, despite the daily verbal assaults he endured in the hands of Okubanjo, all he wanted to do was to be the best salesperson in the company and make his employer proud. He hadn\u2019t done much work in sales prior to Bento, so he put in the work. Within 5 months, according to him, he had the second-highest number of clients on their sheets at the time. He closed some of the biggest clients\u2014some of them with over 1,000 employees and a monthly payroll worth \u20a615\u2013\u20a620 million (~$47,000).\n\nDespite his achievements, however, Pascal did not succeed in making his boss proud. \u201cThere was no free day from Ebun\u2019s verbal abuse. If he wasn\u2019t calling me a useless person, he was threatening to beat me up,\u201d Pascal said. At some point, while recounting his experience to TechCabal, he paused to catch his breath.\n\nPascal described his time at Bento as the darkest period of his life.\n\nPascal narrated how employees would weep during the sales team\u2019s check-in call at 8 AM every weekday. Okubanjo harshly criticised their work and threatened to fire them all at these meetings.\n\nEzekiel*, who had worked with the company\u2019s growth marketing team, shared his experience with TechCabal. He had joined one of the sales calls and heard Okubanjo calling them \u201cpussies and deadweights\u201d. He also heard Okubanjo tell the team that they smelled. \u201cEven though he never attacked me personally,\u201d Ezekiel said, \u201cI always wondered how anybody could go through that every morning and remain sane.\u201d\n\nBento Africa\u2019s cofounders: Ebun Okubanjo (left) and Chidozie Okonkwo (right)\n\nEx-employees also revealed gaps in Bento\u2019s employment contract, specifically where leave days and time off were concerned. Okubanjo promised employees that they could take time off when they needed it, but Bola*, another ex-employee from the company\u2019s sales team, dispelled that promise as a myth.\n\n\u201cI can count on one hand how many people took leave during my stay there. Ebun said breaks are for pussies and fuckers, and whoever takes time out of the office for a whole week is a weak member of the team and not needed in the organisation,\u201d said Bola.\n\n\u201cEbun scarred me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have spent money on therapy, yet, I still suffer from anxiety.\u201d\n\nIn her early days at the startup, Bola asked a lot of people to come work with her at Bento. At that time, she was ignorant of Okubanjo\u2019s \u201cterrifying personality\u201d. \u201cHad I known about it, I wouldn\u2019t have asked anybody to join Bento. Now, when a prospective Bento employee reaches out to me, I just tell them to run!\u201d\n\nAccording to the sources we spoke to, Okubanjo rarely welcomed alternative opinions and monopolised making key business decisions; the punishment for criticising his ideas was immediate termination of employment. For a number of Bento ex-employees, termination simply entailed deactivated Slack accounts and emails.\n\nTinu*, who had been poached from another company to come join Bento, woke up one day and found out she\u2019d been fired and logged out of her Slack and work email. She\u2019d only been with the company as Communication Lead for less than 3 weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was a nerve-wracking experience and the worst 5 months of my adult life,\u201d said Amaka*, who was excited to join a tech startup in Nigeria after finishing her studies in the US. She was fired after enduring Okubanjo\u2019s insults and unwarranted comments about her body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a plus-size woman and Okubanjo would always have opinions about my dressing. He once told me to stop wearing dresses, that I need to wear jackets, trouser and suit all the time (presumably to cover my breast) after his girlfriend Alice commented that she liked my breast. What did I wear? Regular dresses that even my mother approved of.\u201d\n\nAmaka likened the day she was fired to a scene out of a movie. \u201cWe were on a sales call, and Ebun kept saying I wasted company resources while bringing in zero value.\u201d Okubanjo accused her of charging her personal Bolt ride on the company\u2019s debit card, unaware that Amaka had stopped using the card entirely and even ran the company\u2019s errands with her own car.\n\nFollowing Okubanjo\u2019s accusation, Amaka asked that the card be audited to ascertain whether she had indeed been wasting the company\u2019s money. Okubanjo checked the card and discovered that she hadn\u2019t been using the card for personal expenses. Rather than apologise to her, he changed tack and started accusing her of not working.\n\n\u201cHe called me useless and told me to f*ck off from the call. Next thing I knew, my colleagues were texting to inform me that he\u2019d fired me after I dropped off the call.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, when Kunle*, a lead engineer who worked for the company for over 2 years, was fired last November, he only found out about it when he couldn\u2019t access his Slack and work email the next morning. \u201cEbun fired me because he felt like I was trying to wrest authority from him,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo announcing on the company\u2019s slack after firing Kunle\n\n\u201cLeave Ebun, that man can literally kill you and brag about it. He\u2019s that vindictive,\u201d Ezekiel had mentioned while speaking to TechCabal. Ada*, another ex-staff, had also specifically declined to speak to us because she was worried about her safety, fearing that her former employer, could hurt her.\n\nIn the images above, Okubanjo referred to himself as Marlo Stanfield on Bento\u2019s Slack. Who is that, you may ask?\n\nMarlo Stanfield is a fictional character on the HBO television drama The Wire. He is a young, ambitious, intelligent, and ruthless gangster. In the drama series, Stanfield demanded unconditional respect, which superseded all other concerns. He was murderously narcissistic, and frequently ordered the deaths of those who disrespected or undermined him. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked him number 2 on their list of \u201c40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\u201d.\n\nThe day before Kunle was fired, the company\u2019s CTO Lede Adeniyi was on leave, so Kunle stepped up to lead the engineering team. Kunle recalled that one of the account executives had told him that a customer wanted a feature that was not in Bento\u2019s product roadmap for the year. Kunle said he explained to the executive that the company had prioritised other fixes and features for the year and would include the requested feature on their first sprint in 2022. He, however, suggested that if the customer wanted the feature added quickly, he could talk to Okubanjo.\n\n\u201cI referred the executive to Ebun because Ebun had already accused me, previously, of setting priorities behind him. But even that was a crime,\u201d said Kunle. The executive went to Okubanjo with their request, as Kunle had suggested, and all hell broke loose.\n\n\u201cI remember how Ebun came to shout at me: \u2018Hey motherfucker, what did you say to a customer about their ask?\u2019 He shut me up before I could even answer and called me names, which was normal. I was his usual point of reference whenever he wanted to benchmark weaknesses and redundancy in the team. Imagine being disrespected in front of your team members every day.\u201d\n\nNow, before the November firing, Okubanjo had fired Kunle once before. It happened on a trip to Ghana. Kunle had asked Okubanjo to stop calling him a monkey. Okubanjo responded to that by firing him on the spot. \u201cHe told me to find my way back to Nigeria, and that he didn\u2019t care how I did it.\u201d But then, he called Kunle after a few hours to give him his job back, knowing he needed him to sort out the business operations they had come for in Ghana.\n\nOn November 22, when Okunbanjo fired Kunle for the second and final time, he refused to pay his November salary and severance pay. Kunle reached out to Adeniyi, the CTO, to help him speak to Okubanjo about his owed payments, but Adeniyi couldn\u2019t do anything about it. \u201cYou know Ebun does what he wants,\u201d Kunle recalled Adeniyi saying to him.\n\nWhen TechCabal reached out to Adeniyi for comment on the incident, he confirmed Kunle\u2019s report: \u201cYes, Kunle asked me to follow up with Ebun, which I did, and Ebun promised to pay him.\u201d It\u2019s been 4 months now and Okubanjo still hasn\u2019t paid Kunle.\n\nBut after Kunle got fired, it seemed his former boss wasn\u2019t done with him.\n\n\u201cLast month, just when my mental health was getting back in shape, Ebun popped up on my LinkedIn, offering me my old job back,\u201d Kunle said. \u201cI declined. Such effrontery! No form of apology. I haven\u2019t found a new job yet because I\u2019m scared of working in another Nigerian startup.\u201d\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo reached out to Kunle* 4 months after to offer him his job back\n\nKunle claimed that Ebun sacked his friend John*, a former member of Bento\u2019s design team, because John was talking a lot about web3 on social media. Okubanjo accused John of finding Bento \u201cless interesting\u201d. TechCabal reached out to John through Kunle but he hasn\u2019t replied.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give Okubanjo notice period when you\u2019re leaving the company. He\u2019d fire you and tell you off,\u201d Ezekiel said. \u201cWhen Ebun fires you, he tells you to watch how he\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t get a job anywhere else in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nTare Johnson, Bento\u2019s ex-accountant and financial analyst, believes this was why he couldn\u2019t find a job for 6 months after leaving Bento in August 2020. When Johnson joined Bento in February 2020, his contract stated that he was coming in to lead the finance team. He would later find out that there was no team, and that he would be leading himself while reporting to a \u201cnarcissistic boss\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was basically the only one handling all the company\u2019s finances. I was also doing clerical jobs and running errands like a personal assistant, which was confusing and not even remotely close to my job description,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cMy initial thought was, \u2018It\u2019s a startup and things move around a lot.\u2019 But I was wrong. This place was designed to break employees. Ebun abused me verbally, which is standard behaviour for him with employees. He\u2019d call me a motherfucker, dullard, and every vulgar word in the dictionary. He even insulted my family.\u201d\n\nJohnson, running a one-man finance team, was stuck in a mess he hadn\u2019t bargained for. The pandemic lockdown hit barely a month after he got the job, locking him into the job at a time when companies were laying people off and not hiring. So he stuck around and took all the verbal abuse Okubanjo hurled at him. After 5 months, he figured he was coping, until an event on Monday, August 17, 2020 made him resign without notice.\n\nThe WhatsApp conversation between Johnson and Okubanjo\n\nThat Monday, Johnson\u2014like he had done every morning\u2014shared the company\u2019s daily bank statements to Okubanjo and Okonkwo on WhatsApp. Upon receiving them, Okubanjo replied with: \u201cBro, are you drunk???\u201d Johnson thought he must have made a mistake somewhere on the statements, so he quickly double-checked before re-sharing the statements with Bento\u2019s founding team. Okubanjo was still not satisfied with the statements. Apparently, some recent transaction hadn\u2019t reflected yet in the company\u2019s account at the time Johnson compiled the statement; there was no way Johnson could have included it in his report. But Okubanjo, \u201cin his usual fashion\u201d, asked Johnson to fix the spreadsheet or he\u2019d fire him. Finally fed up, Johnson resigned with a simple message: \u201cNo need, I quit\u201d and exited the WhatsApp group. An hour later, he sent in his resignation letter.\n\nFor Johnson, joining Bento Africa was \u201ca bad idea\u201d and leaving \u201cthe best thing he\u2019d ever done for himself\u201d.\n\nWhy were Okubanjo\u2019s red flags ignored?\n\nSome of the ex-employees said Okubanjo\u2019s ruthless leadership style was obvious from the first day they met him. \u201cThe day I met him for my interview, he told me he could read poverty all over my face,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cOn the first day we met,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cI witnessed an altercation that ended with Ebun threatening to punch a stranger in the face.\u201d\n\nAmaka, on her part, said she recognised Okubanjo from a video that had gone viral a year before, where he was in a heated argument with a female customer of Fitness Central, a gym he co-founded with Okonkwo. In the video, Okunbanjo\u2019s threatening personality was evident and on full-display.\n\nSo, why did these former Bento staff accept to work for the company after seeing these red flags from the CEO?\n\n\u201cI felt bad, but what could I do? I needed the job. I was just coming off the HNG Internship,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cThe money was good, for someone who hadn\u2019t even done the mandatory, one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC),\u201d said Amaka.\n\n\u201cI had already stayed about 7 months without a job, after NYSC, and was even planning to go back home [which is outside Lagos] when the job came. So, it was my best option at the time,\u201d said Adanma*, a former employee of the company.\n\nCulture shock after leaving Bento\n\nFormer employees who spoke to TechCabal confessed to experiencing culture shock at their subsequent jobs.\n\nAdanma \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe it when my current boss asked for my opinion on things. \u201cFor the first few months [at my current job], I was too scared to voice an opinion at meetings, for fear of being called stupid.\u201d\n\nBola \u201cwas surprised when my current boss said switching off Slack notifications is good to reduce anxiety, and that we should all try it.\u201d\n\nAccording to McKinsey, hundreds of experiments show that encounters with rude, insulting, and demeaning people undermine workers\u2019 performance, including their decision-making skills, productivity, creativity, and willingness to work harder and help coworkers.\n\nOkubanjo often claims that Bento is \u201ca mission and not a company\u201d hence his iron-fist leadership.\n\nBento is still toxic\n\nThree current Bento employees contacted by TechCabal were diplomatic about their responses, but they agreed that everything this publication has unearthed about Bento Africa\u2019s work culture \u201cis not false\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne minute it\u2019s silence; the next it\u2019s chaos. It\u2019s unstable here, and the pressure is too much,\u201d one of them said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really bothered,\u201d the second employee said. \u201cMy former place of work was also toxic, so I\u2019m kinda used to it. At this point, I think all startups are the same.\u201d\n\nThe third employee wouldn\u2019t \u201cdeny that Bento can be toxic for some people but not in my personal experience. We work very hard, and we play harder. Most people on the team love their jobs. It\u2019s not for everyone, really.\u201d\n\nWhile several ex-Bento employees agree that the company has a great and important product, they believe both founders in charge of the startup are unfit for their roles. The company\u2019s Glassdoor reviews tell more stories of its unconducive work culture.\n\nIn December last year, Bento expanded into Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with plans to set up operations in 6 other markets\u2014Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Angola, and Ethiopia\u2014by the end of this year. The company also leveraged the influence of music veteran and record label boss Don Jazzy to push a campaign supporting the African entrepreneurship spirit\u2014a campaign that arguably boosted its pan-African brand equity. These strides mean that the company is growing to a stage where its apparent lack of structure, process, and attention to employee welfare can no longer be ignored.\n\nTechCabal reached out to Okubanjo and Okonkwo for comments. Okonkwo didn\u2019t respond, but Okubanjo did. In his response, he called our then-developing story \u201cfiction\u201d and posted our email request to Twitter, claiming our article was a \u201chit job\u201d. He has followed his tweets with a series of abusive personal messages to members of the TechCabal team.\n\nEbun Okubanjo posted our email request on Twitter, he has since deleted the tweet.\n\nWhile Johnson, Bola, Amaka, Kunle, Ezekiel, Adanma, and others still scared to speak up have licked their wounds and moved on, Pascal\u2019s family refuses to let the abuse he suffered at Bento slide. They have sued Okubanjo. \u201cI just want him to rescind the lies he told in the termination email to me, I have all the evidence to prove he lied,\u201d Pascal said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: * Besides Tare Johnson who specifically asked not to be anonymous, other names have been changed to protect the identities of those involved. Furthermore, two current members of Big Cabal Media\u2019s team were former employees at Bento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng).\n\nUpdate: Amaka\u2019s account on Okubanjo\u2019s comment about her dressing was updated at 12:30 AM on March 22, 2020.\n\nUpdate: Tangerine Africa was removed from the Bento\u2019s client lists because the company said they have only provided insurance to Bento clients in the past, but never been a client themselves. This update was done 1:20 PM on March 23, 2022.\n\nTechCabal is working on a follow-up story exploring hostile work culture in African startups.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a 9-5er with great colleagues who own cars, you are probably already familiar with the concept of hitching a ride. Let\u2019s say your office is in Ikeja, you live in Surulere, and your colleague who also lives in Surulere has a car. So, you tend to get a ride with them, sometimes paying for fuel, saving you quite a bit of money that you\u2019d have spent on transport.\n\nBut what if you could hitch a ride with a stranger going in the same direction? Doesn\u2019t sound too safe, right? Especially if you\u2019ve been following the recent news on social media about insecurity on some ride-hailing and even government-owned transport systems.\n\nWell, Laolu Onifade thinks he might have found a sweet spot with his newly launched ride-sharing startup, Hytch.\n\nBut what does Hytch do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaolu Onifade, Hytch Founder\n\nAccording to Onifade, Hytch connects car owners and passengers going in the same direction. Using our earlier example, say you\u2019re trying to get to Berger from Surulere, all you have to do is launch the app, find drivers within a 2-3km radius going in that direction and, voila, you\u2019ve \u201chytched\u201d a ride.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilar to the defunct GoMyWay, the ride is shared with three other riders going in the same direction, making the fare cheaper\n\nModelled after popular ride-hailing companies like Bolt and Uber, Hytch doesn\u2019t own any of the cars on the platform and only onboards drivers, with certain safety restrictions \u2014 which we\u2019ll get into later \u2014 built in to prevent mishaps.\n\nHytch takes a 15% commission off every ride and operates a cashless payment method. All users \u2014 drivers and passengers \u2014 have a wallet, so passengers are automatically debited the amount for the trip when it ends.\n\nThe idea for Hytch was birthed between 2019 and 2020, following Onifade\u2019s frustrations with ride-hailing platforms.\n\n\u201cI have encountered this problem myself moving around and with Uber being so expensive; I\u2019ve had this problem with Uber since 2019/2020. I noticed that Uber and Bolt were getting so expensive and I used to wonder, how about I just hitch a ride?\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I just be in someone\u2019s car? Sometimes when I\u2019m in an Uber that\u2019s costing me say \u20a65,000, I don\u2019t mind sharing the ride with three other people in the back seat going in the same direction.\u201d\n\nRoping in his friends, Femi Omoniyi (CTO), Olawale Adeyeye (Chief Imagineer), and Kemdirim Akujobi (Product and Design Lead), they began building Hytch in 2021.\n\nAfter several months of beta testing, which saw them onboard 200 people, Hytch comes out of stealth mode today, with the app available on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnsuring user safety\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week Friday, March 18, 2022, this tweet by twitterer, @_kimaura set Nigeria\u2019s Twitter streets ablaze.\n\nso guys, i got robbed on wednesday night at ikoyi by my bolt driver, he took my phone, my cards, my ID, all my money and savings, lemme tell you how it happened. I ordered a bolt ride going to lekki, after i got into the ride which was a heavily tinted car and we started \u2026 \u2014 KIMBORO\ud83c\udf3a\ud83c\udf51 (@_kimaura) March 18, 2022\n\n@_kimaura described being robbed by the Bolt driver who took her phone, debit cards, and IDs, among other things. Barely a month after the tragic death of Oluwabamise Ayanwole on a BRT in Lagos, it was enough to cause an uproar, with many people narrating various incidents.\n\nAnother Twitter user, @ade_IDD, narrated how she was almost kidnapped by a Bolt driver whose appearance was different from the picture on the platform. He told her that he was using his brother\u2019s account because his had been blocked.\n\nSo @Boltapp_ng i have strength today. I ordered a ride from school to my house yesterday Friday 18th of march and i got a driver. He came and i confirmed car type and number plate and i put my stuff in the car and he started the ride. \u2014 AdaUgo.\ud83e\udd84\u2728Busiswadede. \ud83e\udd75 (@ade_IDD) March 19, 2022\n\nThankfully, she got to safety, before anything untoward happened.\n\nIn a since-deleted tweet, another user, @shugadupri reported encountering the same driver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, while Bolt\u2019s support team acknowledged some complaints on Twitter, it is yet to release an official statement on the matter.\n\nTechpoint Africa asked Onifade how Hytch hopes to ensure user safety.\n\nOnifade explained that user safety is provided for both drivers and riders.\n\n\u201cFor drivers, we verify driver\u2019s licence. For riders, you have to take a picture at the moment. So that means, the same picture you take at the time that you are signing up is what the driver is going to use to recognise you. So you have to make sure you\u2019re taking an actual picture or else the driver is not going to pick you up.\n\n\u201cYou also have to put in your legal first and last name while signing up.\u201d\n\nTo ensure that it is an actual picture, Hytch has partnered with Nigerian digital compliance and security company, IdentityPass, plugging in an API that determines whether it is a human face.\n\nFor added security, the driver and rider are sent a pin which both users must confirm on the app before a trip commences. This could also prevent issues of drivers starting trips before arriving.\n\nLike other ride-hailing/ride-sharing companies, Hytch provides a panic button that enables users to alert family and friends when they are in danger.\n\nWhere a rider receives a streak of three bad ratings, they are automatically blocked from using the app, although they can be reinstated. The driver would have to reach out to get the account unblocked after an investigation is carried out.\n\nOnifade said there are currently plans to include National Identification Number (NIN) verification as a security measure; however, he agrees this could be limiting for users with no NIN.\n\nThere\u2019s still much for the startup to do with plans to eventually include interstate travel and as Onifade laughingly told Techpoint Africa, the ability to book a seat on a private jet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuidax, Africa founded cryptocurrency exchange, unveiled its brand ambassador on Tuesday, March 22, 2022.\n\nAfter giving his opening remarks, Buchi Okoro, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and co-founder, Quidax, briefly talked about the brand, what they do, and what they have achieved over the years.\n\nHe said that Quidax makes it easy for users to buy, sell, store and transfer cryptocurrencies.\u201d There is a lot of exclusion that happens because we are Nigerians, Africans.\u201d Crypto is the solution. Quidax was built to solve issues affecting accessing funds and transferring them easily for Africans.\n\nQuidax On CoinMarketcap\n\nOver the years, Quidax has grown to be one of the largest crypto exchanges in Africa and the first African exchange listed on CoinMarketCap. By May 2021 they had processed over 3.2 billion dollars in transactions in less than three years and were awarded Business Day\u2019s 2021 digital assets company of the year.\n\nNew Year, New Quidax\n\nBuchi mentioned that improvements are constantly made to their platform through customer feedback, with the new price alert feature on the platform being a notable example. Quidax has also found a way to engage users to learn crypto on its platform and recently launched Quidax academy to train crypto beginners.\n\nAnswering how secure the platform is, Buchi said they have a custody solution that includes fund insurance; every fund in Quidax is insured. Also, there is a 13-man team constantly working on securing the platform from attacks and a three-factor authentification (3FA) feature that helps to confirm the user\u2019s identity.\n\nQuidax and Don Jazzy\n\nBuchi said that they started the #TheQuidaxCall recently, aiming to help put crypto in front of more people. \u201cThe point is to help preach the gospel of crypto,\u201d he said.\n\nBuchi introduced Michael Collins Ajereh, professionally known as Don Jazzy as a new member and brand ambassador of the Quidax family.\n\nWhen asked why crypto and why he feels it is important, Don Jazzy said he tries his best to stay ahead of the curve and know what is next to avoid being left behind in a fast-moving world. He added that he wants to get more people into crypto as he believes it is the future.\n\nDon Jazzy, who started his crypto journey during the Covid19 pandemic in 2020, said he finds crypto relatively easy to use and transfer money to various world parts.\n\nDon Jazzy also expressed his opinions on Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and their many use cases. He sees NFTs becoming a thing in the music industry, and he highlighted the other use cases like property ownership in the metaverse.\n\nBuchi said their choice in selecting Don Jazzy was because he is very easy to relate to and approach, and he is genuinely interested in crypto.\n\nCalling it a match made in heaven, Buchi said, \u201cAt Quidax, we believe that learning crypto should actually be fun. Learning crypto should be something you can relate to, and Don Jazzy exemplifies and shows what it means to be a Quidaxian.\n\nAlso in attendance at the unveiling event were Uzo Awili, Quidax Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and CO-Founder, Morris Ebieroma, Quidax\u2019s Chief Information Officer (CIO) and CO-Founder, members of the Quidax staff; Miss Techy, Money Africa, members of the media, among others.\n\nQuidax is an African-founded cryptocurrency exchange that makes it easy for anyone to buy, sell, store and transfer cryptocurrencies.

Humla Ventures, Nabuboto, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, and Pulse Africa founder Leonard Stiegeler also participated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaunched in 2019 by Romain Poirot-Lellig, CEO and Founder, the company\u2019s goal is to \u201cbring the informal economy into the formal economy,\u201d focusing on last-mile delivery, eCommerce (warehousing and fulfilment), and financial services.\n\nThe company claims that it has made significant progress in providing merchants with last-mile delivery and eCommerce fulfilment services.\n\nBy the end of 2022, they plan to launch a B2B lending marketplace to help merchants obtain financing. Also, Kwik will use the funds to acquire customers and finance operations in Ibadan, Kano, Port Harcourt, and Kaduna.\n\nAccording to the CEO, Kwik intends to increase the number of merchants on its platform from over 100,000 to 800,000 by the end of 2022.\n\nThe big question: How does the company hope to accomplish this in the face of competition? I mean, the company claims to have over 100,000 merchants since launching in 2019. So, with less than 200,000 merchants in over two years, what magic will it perform in nine months?\n\nWell, I\u2019m looking to expand my platforms organically, and maybe, I could become one of those 800,000 merchants.

The next few months should be interesting.\n\nNew regulations for Kenya\u2019s digital lenders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the introduction of a law regulating the financial sector, digital credit providers (DCPs) in Kenya will be required to reveal and provide evidence of their funding sources.\n\nWhy? The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) stated that disclosing the source of funds ensures that lenders are not engaging in financial crimes like money laundering, cybercrime, fraud and terrorist financing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new regulation was published on Monday, March 21, 2022, and requires digital lenders to obtain a licence from the country\u2019s monetary authority or cease operations by September 2022.\n\nTo begin operations in the country, digital lenders were previously only required to register their businesses without showing proof of funds.\n\nNow, the new law requires digital lenders to disclose all loan terms and fees, including interest rates and the total amount owed. They will also be required to obtain permission from the Central Bank of Kenya before changing their pricing models.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, they are also prohibited from sharing customer data with third parties, using threatening language, accessing or contacting their customers\u2019 phone contacts, and engaging in \u201cunconscionable debt collection tactics.\u201d\n\nWhat happens when digital lenders don\u2019t comply? Those who violate the regulations \u2014 like sharing loan defaulters\u2019 personal information with third parties \u2014 could face sanctions or licence revocation.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nThe Willie Lynch Letter: History or Hoax?\n\nLet\u2019s talk about ADHD.

          "text": "Ahead of party primaries, which according to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)\u2019s released timetable start from April 4 to June 3, politicians are weighing their options in their current parties.\n\nBusinessDay Sunday gathered that following the outcome of the just concluded National Congress of the All Progressives Congress (APC), a lot of feathers were ruffled, which may lead to those who felt had-done-by to seek exit routes.\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent weekend, a member of the APC said the consensus option adopted by the party, particularly in the chairmanship category, generated a lot a bad blood.\n\n\u201cIt is true that the Convention is holding, the enmity created from the consensus arrangement will be difficult to heal. How can anybody justify a situation where the President just decided those he wanted to emerge as chairman and vice chairman, without listening to the advice of those who have been in the party for a very long time?\n\nThis is just convention, we have not even gotten to primaries. I can tell you for free; many people are not happy,\u201d the member who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.\n\nThe convention, which is a precursor to the conduct of primaries for candidates of the party, has a direct bearing on the fortunes of the party in the 2023 general election.\n\nThose who lost out in the consensus arrangement are said to be aggrieved that they were not carried along in the arrangement and said to be reconsidering their future in the APC ahead 2023.\n\nAfter a meeting by President Muhammadu Buhari with key stakeholders in the party, including governors and leaders of the National Assembly the APC agreed to adopt Senator Abdullahi Adamu, as consensus national chairmanship candidate.\n\nAdamu, who was until recently the chairman of the APC National Reconciliation Committee will be the third substantive National Chairman of the party, as he takes over from Adams Oshiomhole.\n\nSince Oshiomhole was sacked in June 2020, the party had been run by a 12-member caretaker committee led by the Yobe state Governor, Mai Mala Buni.\n\n\u201cIt seems the choice of Senator Abdullahi Adamu has thrown the party in deeper trouble,\u201d an observer said Saturday.\n\nSigns that the idea of a consensus may breed trouble surfaced some weeks ago when some groups warned the party against breaching existing accord by not allowing party members to participate in delegates primaries.\n\nThey say that all the aspirants need to agree on the consensus whereby all the aspirants would sign a written document to show they agree with the consensus.\n\nMeanwhile, observers say that Adamu and Nnamani\u2019s nomination could be a pointer that President Buhari is less concerned about pampering those who ushered in his emergence in 2015.\n\nThey noted that for President Buhari to nominate them, was an indication that he is not only for the CPC or the ACN blocs of the party but always trying to satisfy certain unseen interest.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that their nomination was a product of power-sharing and stylish imposition by the Aso rock cabal. You will see that the President suddenly becomes the chief marketing manager of Adamu immediately after he got back to Nigeria from the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cAnother thing Nigerians care less to understand is that Buhari would never do anything against the decision of some people with close links to him, either at party level or governance level. Adamu and Nnamani are close allies of these people,\u201d Kunle Okunola, political analyst, said.\n\nSpeaking further, Okunola said the decision to impose the duo on the party may be a calculated move ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primary next.\n\n\u201cBuhari would not want to go against the choice of these unseen forces because he knows that the two of them would play a key role in the emergence of both the presidential candidate of the APC and as well the winner of the presidential election in 2023,\u201d he added.\n\nSimilarly, the PDP on the other hand appears to be engulfed in similar trouble. Part of it is the inability of the party to zone its presidential ticket despite clamour in some quarters. Rather, the party is encouraging anyone interested to contest.\n\nLast year, some political leaders of the South East warned that it would be forced to vote against any political party that does not pick its presidential candidate from the region.\n\nIn the last few months, political leaders in the South East have insisted and warned that the region must be given a chance to rule in 2023 judging that it had not produced a president since the beginning of current dispensation in1999.\n\nThus, observers say that last week\u2019s declaration by Atiku Abubakar for the presidency may further complicate issues ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primaries in May.\n\nDespite his influence, Atiku has faced criticisms in some quarters over his decision to contest the presidency after several attempts, they urged him to drop his ambition and support a younger candidate.\n\nWhile urging his party to consider him during the Board of Trustees (BoT) meeting, Atiku had said: \u201cI am worried and you should be worried too that if we do not win, it means we will be in opposition again for the next eight years. By the next eight years, I don\u2019t know how many will be left in politics and it may even ultimately lead to the death of the party because people gravitate, particularly in developing countries, towards governments.\n\nOrdinary people naturally gravitate towards government. So this is a very, very crucial and historical moment in history, for our survival. I want you to think about it.\n\n\u201cWe are now at a crucial moment in this country. Many of you here, it is either we retire together or we move on together\u201d, he told the BoT members.\u201d\n\nThe declaration came when the PDP has not even made any pronouncement on whether to zone the slot of not. After his public announcement, Peter Obi, a former governor of Anambra State, who also was the running mate of Atiku in 2019, declared his intention to run for the presidency in Awka, Anambra State.\n\nRead also: Atiku declares for 2023 presidential race [FULL DECLARATION SPEECH]\n\nIn the last few months, leaders of the party across Nigeria have spoken in different tunes on the issue of zoning.\n\nLast week, the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal says the party should give its presidential ticket to a candidate that can win the election, not minding what part of the country the candidate comes from.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m appealing to my party that we should be talking about how to win the election, not just zoning of where the President is coming from,\u201d Tambuwal said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cZoning was a deliberate action by the political class of this country midwifed by the government at the centre to address a particular concern, the June 12.\n\n\u201cHow come when we saw the advent of COVID-19, we were not applying HIV drugs to COVID-19? The power shift in 1999 was to the South-West to assuage a particular situation.\n\n\u201cGo back to the history of democracy in Nigeria. In 1979, NPN had Shagari, NPP had Azikiwe, UPN had Chief Awolowo, GNPP had Waziri Ibrahim and PRP had Aminu Kano.\n\n\u201cThere was no zoning. When you go to 1992/1993, SDP had Abiola, NRC had Bashir Tofa, and there was no zoning.\n\n\u201cThis is to show you that when you go back to our history, zoning has not been the main issue. The main issue is that political parties throw up candidates and Nigerians decide on who to elect president.\u201d\n\nThe governor noted that the president can come from wherever provided he has the capacity and competence to fix Nigeria of the moment, adding that the Nigeria of 1998 is different from the Nigeria of 2023.\n\nObservers says that Atiku see the coming general election as his last shot and would fight with his last blood, stressing that despite the challenge by younger politicians like Tambuwal, Saraki and Bala Muhammad he may likely emerge victorious at the primaries.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think the PDP is ready to zone the ticket to any region. Would that led to division? I don\u2019t see, I think there may be initial annoyance by the South East if they don\u2019t get the ticket, but in the long run it would be resolved.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think the PDP should work in accord and support any candidate now for them to defeat APC for now,\u201d Lanre Ogunyemi, public affairs analyst said.\n\nChristian Okeke, a Political Science lecturer at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka, said: \u201cUnderstanding that politics in our country is mainly and unfortunately driven by self-interest rather than national interest will clearly give a clue into what will happen among the national political elites in the coming days. It is this self-preservation that will push them into alignment and re-alignment as they rush into destinations where their bread is buttered the most.\n\nIt is sad that some of the negatively defining features of Nigerian politics right from independence have not given way for a more positive political participation in the country.\n\nIt is quite unfortunate that we still witness lack of internal party politics and dominance of money in politics.\n\n\u201cThese issues are going to shape outcomes of politicking within the dominant political parties as we approach the next general election.\u201d\n\nAccording to Okeke: \u201cAs expected, until the candidates for each of the major parties finally emerge, the politicians will keep moving from one party to another and making the much they can from the process. If you check well, the majority of members in APC were formerly in PDP, and some of the current members of the latter were in the former.\n\n\u201cThis kind of thing kills ideology, beauty and consistency in parties. Today, it is difficult to pin down what constitutes ideology of these parties. Actually, Nigeria is not showing leadership to other African countries in many fronts, including how to organise political parties to win elections.\u201d\n\nHe also faulted political parties of not having any worthy legacy for the younger generation.\n\n\u201cThe political class is not yet ready to bequeath decorum to upcoming politicians.\n\nInstead, they have sown the seed of chaos, discord, instability and gluttony, and those negatives have now become part of our political culture. It is very sad.\u201d\n\nPatrick Adewunmi, a political analyst, said that the likes of Tinubu, Atiku have plan B and C, being political strategists, adding that he does not see any of the two leading parties zoning their presidential slots.\n\n\u201cThe permutations thus far show clearly that mass defection is possible. I think neither of the two leading parties would come out and say they want to zone for now knowing the implication of such a decision. Atiku would get the PDP ticket I am sure of that and I don\u2019t see the party zoning,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u2026says Ukrainian war exposed inadequacies of global food system\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, at the weekend, said the state is sustaining investment in large-scale agricultural production and leveraging technology and the innovative potential of its youthful population to ensure food security and drive the state\u2019s post-COVID-19 pandemic recovery plan.\n\nObaseki disclosed this when he joined other world leaders and policymakers, at the 2022 Doha Forum in Qatar, to speak on innovations to solve large-scale economic shocks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and other critical challenges facing the world economy.\n\nThe governor was among the panelists at the 20th edition of the Doha Forum with the theme, \u2018Transforming for A New Era.\u2019\n\nOther panelists include H E Kandia Kamissoko Camara, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ivory Coast; Charles Murito, Director, Sub Saharan Africa, Government Affairs and Public Policy, Google; Wale Adeosun, Chief Investment Officer, Kuramo Capital Management, and Ken Njoroge, Founder, Cellulant.\n\nObaseki, who noted that the main effect of COVID-19 in Edo State was the disruption of livelihoods and small businesses, disclosed that the war in Ukraine has further exposed the inadequacies of the global food system.\n\nHe noted, \u201cFor us in Edo State, we didn\u2019t suffer much from the infections or mortality rate of the COVID-19 because of the very young population we have in Nigeria and Edo State. The infection wasn\u2019t so high and the mortality wasn\u2019t as bad as we get from malaria or other diseases.\n\n\u201cWhat really affected us was the disruption of livelihoods and with the lockdowns, a lot of small businesses were seriously affected and but the availability of technology as a response sprung up new opportunities for small businesses in particular.\n\n\u201cIn terms of our healthcare response, we realized the opportunities for investment in the healthcare space and the participation of the private sector in healthcare delivery. Before now, the bulk of healthcare investment was left to the government, even though the private sector is a key provider of healthcare services.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cFor small and medium businesses because they had been drained of capital as a result of the lockdown, it further showed the importance and necessity to reinvest in that segment of the economy. So, small businesses became a viable sector to invest money because most of them began to use technology for service delivery and production.\n\n\u201cThis opened an opportunity for other key investments that came out as a result of the COVID-19, which is investments in technology and tech startups.\n\n\u201cAs a lot of our young people began to invest and take opportunities in the tech space, we found companies outsourcing work to young people in Nigeria and Edo State, with many of our young people earning in foreign exchange for writing codes and programmes for companies abroad. So, that\u2019s another area we found significant investment.\u201d\n\nOn ensuring food security, the governor stated, \u201cThe Ukrainian war, for me, has created a real alarm for our food systems. With the increase in food prices, particularly, wheat, staples and grains, and the rise in energy prices, we as a government, have realized that we now have to put in a lot of resources and time in agriculture, and large-scale agricultural projects.\n\n\u201cFortunately, in Edo State, we have started investment in palm oil and have rolled out programmes where we could bring in serious investment into large scale oil palm production as the trigger for large scale investment in agriculture.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, the opportunities that we see in the next three years is to first secure our food supplies by food production and then utilize technology and focus on smaller businesses,\u201d Obaseki added.\n\nAlso, Murito said Africa\u2019s young population, which covers a third of the world\u2019s population, should be empowered to fill the future jobs locally and internationally.\n\nEarlier, Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani said Qatar looks forward to exploring ways to partner with Africa and discuss business opportunities that can empower the continent.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u201c I sat at the back of a man\u201d, wrote the great Russian writer, Leo Tolstoy \u201cchoking him and making him to carry my weight; yet, I assured him and I assured myself that I wish I could lighten his burden\u201d.\n\nWhy not climb down the man\u2019s back if you are indeed concerned about mitigating the suffering you have inflicted.\n\nIn all of the modern history of human conflict, there has not been a war more unjust and more anchored on the power dynamics of tyranny as this nauseating invasion.\n\nYet, there are some persons who continue to see this tyranny-let-loosed as a fallout of NATO\u2019s alleged promise not to expand eastward.\n\nWe are all creatures of emotions, we are as regulated by primordial instincts and idiosyncratic biases as by reason. This is why some folks can, in all honesty, attempt to defend such immoral and barbaric invasion. Miguel de Unamuno , the Spanish existentialist philosopher was right when he argued that reason is not man\u2019s towering crown but emotion. The man who philosophizes is a man of flesh and blood who feels more than he thinks. Reason and logic can never cause him to stray a hair\u2019s breath from his biases no matter the soundness of the logic or the strength of the facts.\n\nThere are despots who would have us believe that the era of an open society with its democratic ethos is over. They insist, blindly, that the pace of modern states cannot allow for democratic debates and consensus choices in running a nation. That democracy is inherently weak, time consuming and structurally unsustainable. That is what the Xis and Putins of this world would have us believe.\n\nIt was the great Scottish psychiatrist, R.D. Laing that warned us that the \u201crange and extent of the things that we think and do is limited by what we fail to notice. That because we fail to notice that we are failing to notice, there is little we can do to change, until we notice how failing to notice shapes our thoughts and deeds.\u201d\n\nThe danger of liberal democracies today is that inhabitants of the West are failing to notice that the freedom they presently enjoy and the democracy that underpins it, is in grave danger. They fail to see that democracy is a fragile thing and that the condition upon which God has given liberty to men, is eternal vigilance.\n\nTrump assaulted democracy from within and Putin is now attacking it from without and yet , there are good-natured people who would make case for both men. The argument today is that democracy and freedom are out of sync with the realities of modern states. At least, that is the unspoken creed of Xi and Putin and it is sad that some otherwise reasonable folks would strenuously attempt to justify such a brazen bare-faced invasion by a brute on any grounds even when the groundlessness of Putin\u2019s invasion yearns deeper than Grand Canyon. The West may not be as saintly as they claim but I tell you a truth : should the light of democracy be extinguished by the likes of Putin, mankind would spiral back to the Hobbesian state of nature where life was solitary, nasty, brutish and short.\n\nIt is sad to notice that were Hitler alive today and undergoing his monstrous pogrom, some folks would still make case for him: blame international Jewry for their perceived greed or America for some perceived mischievous globalization or the Poles for not willingly genuflecting before the German war machines.\n\n\u201cRemove law and justice,\u201d warned St. Augustine, \u201cand what are states but gangs of criminals on a large scale\u201d. It is fidelity to a set of moral code and decency that largely defines a civilised society. President Biden was on point when he described Putin as a thug: is anything more thuggish than sending armed mob into your neighbour\u2019s house without any provocation?\n\nThe point here is that America, for its faults and failings, remains the beacon of freedom, justice and opportunity for the world. It is only a fool that throws the baby away with the bath water. Democracy may not be the elixir that transforms base metals into gold, but it is definitely the best platform that guarantees that the light of justice, freedom , opportunity is not extinguished from the midst of men.\n\nDoes it not portend universal danger that one man could rally a military power like Russia into war?\n\nDoes it not bother a sane man that there are no institutions inside Russia that can checkmate or even mildly regulate Putin?\n\nShould one man possess such powers?\n\nIs it not indicative of tyranny and a failed system that one man should wield such powers?\n\nIt is only the most naive amongst us that would readily equate the West with total moral rightness. Frantz Fanon may have his points when he said that anytime he searches for man in the technique of the West , he sees only a succession of the negations of man and a avalanche of murders. However, the institutional guardrails of Western democracies are the best indicators of the survival of the human species.\n\nAbsolute power, said Woodrow Wilson, is what precedes the destruction of human liberty. Putin is pure, unadulterated evil and trying to defend him amounts to demons in search of logic and trying cosmos out of chaos.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOsazuwa Osahon Daniels, Esq.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

The Chief Executive Officer of NGX Regulation Limited, Ms. Tinuade Awe, stated this at the launch of Corporate Governance Triangle on Tuesday, 22 March, in Lagos.\n\nIn her remarks at the event, Ms Awe said, \u201cat NGX Regulation, we have been at the forefront of promoting corporate governance in Nigeria. In 2014, the then Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), partnered with the Convention on Business Integrity (CBi) to create the first Corporate Governance Rating System for listed companies in Nigeria. This initiative, which started off with eight companies that participated in the pilot phase of the project, now has thirty-nine companies that are CGRS rated and over six hundred directors that have passed the Fiduciary Awareness Certification Test (FACT).\u201d\n\nAccording to Ms. Awe, the CGRS serves to strengthen the corporate governance structures and ethical conducts of listed companies and enhances their ability to meet the compliance requirements of corporate governance code and sectoral guidelines where applicable. \u201cFrom an investor\u2019s perspective, this tool has provided vital information for investors and consumers, helping them to differentiate between companies on the basis of their compliance and integrity with minimum acceptable standards of Corporate Governance.\u201d\n\nMs. Awe restated the commitment of NGX Regulation to promote corporate governance in Nigeria. \u201cWe will continue to build on our strong heritage from Nigerian Exchange Group Plc (NGX Group) to promote best practices in corporate governance across our ecosystem. As regulatory services provider to Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX), we remain resolute in our mandate to monitor activities on NGX\u2019s market to ensure that the market and its participants comply with all applicable laws and market regulations.\n\n\u201cWe recognize the critical role of collaborations and technology in promoting transparency, which is critical to the effective functioning of the capital market and the financial industry as a whole, and we remain committed to supporting and fostering collaborations such as the Corporate Governance Triangle that promote best practices in corporate governance in Nigeria,\u201d she added.\n\nMs. Awe congratulated the key parties in the Triangle, the Nigerian Bar Association Section on Business Law (\u201cNBA-SBL\u201d), Nigerian Exchange Limited (\u201cNGX\u201d) and the Institute of Directors, Nigeria (\u201cIOD\u201d), three highly reputable institutions that are committed to leveraging their positions to influence their respective ecosystems, share best practices and develop frameworks that will enhance corporate governance in Nigeria",

Fintechs are attracting young people to do investments with their phones meanwhile the market still relies on paper documentation. This is really something of the past as we are committed to ensuring that our markets are technology driven. Technology is the way to go and it is the way to really engage people. Once the youths buy an idea, it goes far and wide\u201d.\n\nYuguda bemoaned the high level of unclaimed dividends in the capital market and enjoined investors to mandate their accounts for e-dividend in a bid to reduce the quantum.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo many investors have shares in the capital market and have abandoned them. People have not come forward to claim their dividends and this has led to huge unclaimed dividends and has increased the unclaimed dividends profile.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has over time been educating and enlightening the public on how they can get their dividends. Now they do not need to wait for the broker to send the dividend warrants through the registrars. The dividends can actually come to them directly into their bank accounts through e-dividend payments. We will arrange investor clinics to ABU to talk about issues in the capital market and encourage the staff and students to key in. ABU is reputed for giving the very best in tertiary education and some of us are proud graduates of the university.\n\nIn his remarks, Vice Chancellor of ABU, Prof Kabiru Bala described the visit as part of the advancement of the university to keep in contact with their alumni as is done in most global universities.\n\nProf. Bala implored alumni to collaborate with their universities and institutions to assist such institutions where necessary adding that many universities are currently grappling with issues of funding.\n\n\u201cWe know many institutions are grappling with issues of funding and these alumni can come in to assist. This will drastically reduce the incidences of industrial action by the staff,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Vice Chancellor also requested for collaboration with the SEC that would enable undergraduates of the institution intern with the Commission for specified period in a bid to understand in details the workings of the capital market adding that, this will increase their employability chances.\n\n\u201cWe are putting a lot of premium on these kind of relationship to ensure that students can conduct research that would also be useful to the capital market. We are working towards reviving our endowment fund in a bid to bringing sustainable development to the university and enhance revenue generation,\u201d he added.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "The People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), Nigeria\u2019s main opposition party, has said the nonchalant attitude displayed by the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration on matters of insecurity shows that it is either unwilling to stop the menace or complicit in some of the attacks.\n\nThe PDP which stated this in its reaction to Friday night\u2019s attack on Kaduna International Airport by terrorists, noted that the attack is evidence that the country\u2019s security architecture has collapsed under the Buhari led All Progressives Congress (APC) government.\n\nThe opposition party which stated this in a statement on Sunday by Debo Ologunagba, its national publicity secretary, noted that the inability of Buhari and the APC to take action against the attackers, but instead continue their jamboree in the name of national convention, shows that they have conceded the country\u2019s sovereignty to the bandits.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) alerts that the Saturday, March 26, 2022 invasion of the Kaduna International Airport by terrorists (code-named bandits by the APC) is a clear confirmation that our nation\u2019s security, command and control structure under the President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) administration has completely collapsed.\n\n\u201cThe alarming invasion of the airport by terrorists at a time outlaws, kidnappers and marauders have taken over our highways and railways has further heightened security concerns that nowhere is safe in the country under the APC.\n\n\u201cThe refusal and failure of President Buhari and the APC to take action on the airport attack but continued to jamboree in Abuja in the name of a National Convention reveal and confirm that the Buhari administration has conceded sovereignty over parts of our country to terrorists.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari\u2019s nonchalant disposition to this grave security challenge indicates that his administration is unable, unwilling and or complicit in this particular attack as well as various other acts of terrorism in our country.\n\n\u201cIt is indefensibly suspicious that while an international airport in our country was under attack by over 200 terrorists with many Nigerians being held hostage and traumatized, President Buhari and the APC continued in their carnival in Abuja without acknowledging or expressing concern. Is this not a case of \u201cBuhari fiddles while Nigeria burns?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe APC government has failed, become numb to violence against our citizens and can no longer perform its primary duty under Section 14 (2)(b) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) which provides that \u201csecurity and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government\u201d.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari\u2019s failure to address the Kaduna Airport attack is consistent with his characteristic abdication of duty at critical times. Nigerians can recall how in January this year, Mr. President cancelled his scheduled visit to Zamfara State, a state that is daily traumatized by terrorists.\n\n\u201cBy that action, Mr. President allowed shared sovereignty with terrorists over a part of the territory of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis acquiesce emboldened the terrorists to now expand their control to the international airport in Kaduna ostensibly with the possibility of using it to import arms and ammunition as well as coordinate terrorist activities in our country.\n\n\u201cOne of the main features or determinants of sovereignty is the ability of an authority to impose taxes, enforce collection, control commercial activities as well as exit and entry points including airports.\n\n\u201cUnder President Buhari terrorists have established sovereignty in substantial parts of the country especially in the North West and North East regions, where terrorists execute laws and impose penalties, collect taxes, control commercial and transportation activities and now scaringly take control of an international airport with grave negative consequences to our national image in the world.\n\n\u201cOur country has never had it this bad with such a weak, uncoordinated and clueless President with an inhumane, visionless and propaganda-driven political party like the APC.\n\n\u201cNigerians should therefore rally round the PDP in our mission to rescue our nation from the precipice and restore the unity and security of her people.\u201d",

We must celebrate the women for that.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe must also celebrate the men in women and who support the struggle that women are contributing meaningfully to national development. As we do this, we will encourage more women to contribute to the development of the nation,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Gloria Shoda, president of NCWS, appealed to men in the House of Representatives to open the door for women, saying the five bills they threw out should be reconsidered.\n\n\u201cThat is the way to equity. We are born the same, we go to school together, so we should also do what the men have. In the private sector and other aspects, women are excelling, so we should also be allowed to excel in government and politics, so that is why we are seeking equity. It is should be balanced.\n\n\u201cAs you know, women form almost half of the Nigerian populace and make critical contributions to nation-building.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDespite this, we are not so prominent, where it matters in the public space.\n\n\u201cData shows that women still lag in public affairs and decision making, as well as in political participation and representation. Gender-based violence is still rife and women face all manner of discrimination and challenges in society,\u201d she said.",

It is obvious that I am going to run for the presidency of this country. And I am declaring for the first time in Benue state because of my special relationship with them. People are merely not suspecting, but let it be known today that I am announcing it in Benue state because I have a special relationship with this state,\u201d Wike was quoted as telling members of his party.\n\nResponding to questions from journalists on what he was going to be doing differently if elected President, Governor Wike explained that he will pragmatically tackle the issue of insecurity.\n\nHe stated that Service Chiefs and heads of other security agencies will be provided the requisite equipment and incentives to discharge their constitutional obligations.\n\nAccording to him, they will also be given timeline to tackle the lingering insecurity as his administration will not be disposed to excuses.\n\n\u201cToday, you can\u2019t talk about security in this country and you must understand that without security you can\u2019t talk about governance. One first thing that anybody who takes oath of office sworn to, is that you must protect life and property. If you can\u2019t protect life and property then you can\u2019t talk about governance. So that major thing is that our people should be alive.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who condemned the terrorists attack at the Kaduna International Airport over the weekend, said Nigerians urgently needs a leader who can address the growing insecurity in the country.\n\nWike assured that if elected, his administration will engender the rule of law in order to attract more direct foreign investment into the country.\n\nAccording to him, disregard for the rule of law by the present federal government has been one of the banes of direct foreign investment in the country.\n\n\u201cNobody can bring investment in this country because there is no respect for the rule of law. Nobody obeys court order. Who will come and invest his money when court gives its judgement and it will not be obeyed? So, I am going to run for election and victory will be ours.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike accused some presidential aspirants who have indicated interest for the party\u2019s ticket as being responsible for PDP\u2019S failure in 2015.\n\n\u201cThose who want to be president now were the problems of the party in 2015. They ran away when the party needed them most. But I have stood and worked for this party. I have nowhere to run to because I take it personal that the party should not die. And I challenge anyone in a debate what they did for PDP.\u201d\n\nThe governor, while soliciting the support of delegates ahead of the PDP\u2019s presidential primary, said he has all that is required to defeat the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC.\n\nGovernor Wike stated that when some of those seeking to get the party\u2019s ticket left to gang up with the founders of APC, he and others remained in the party and sustained it.",

AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, for assaulting a traffic warden on duty along Ahmadu Bello Way, Ilorin.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that a video clip on how the governor\u2019s aide was allegedly caught by policemen with a cartridge and substance suspected to be hard drug had gone viral on social media.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday in Ilorin, the command\u2019s Spokesman, SP Okasanmi Ajayi, however said Esinrogunjo was not arrested for involving in arms and drug dealings, but arrested for traffic offence.\n\nThe statement explained that the aide slapped the traffic warden after being caught committing a traffic offence by driving against traffic, thereby causing a serious traffic hold-up at the area.\n\n\u201cThe attention of Kwara State Police Command has been drawn to a video clip making the rounds on some social media platforms depicting a scene of a man later identified as Comrade Musibau Esinrogunjo, being interrogated by a group of people over the recovery of some quantities of substance suspected to be Indian hemp and a cartridge wrapped in a paper.\n\n\u201cHe was also seen being slapped by an unidentified person.\n\n\u201cThe Command wishes to set the record straight. The video in question was posted by a mischievous individual to achieve a result still unknown to the command.\n\n\u201cWhat actually transpired in the day was that, the man in the video later identified to be one Musibau Esinrogunjo was caught committing a traffic offence by driving against traffic, thereby causing a serious traffic hold-up at Ahmadu Bello way, Ilorin.\n\n\u201cThe traffic warden on duty who arrested him for the offence was dealt a slap by Mr Esinrogunjo and his aide which drew the anger of passersby around the vicinity. They attempted to physically assault him, but for the prompt arrival of police officers that rescued and took the parties to the police headquarters, the closest police formation to the scene.\n\n\u201cA search conducted in the vehicle of Mr Esinrogunjo resulted in the recovery of a substance suspected to be Indian hemp and an item that looked like a cartridge wrapped with charm.\n\n\u201cThe incident was looked into by a very senior police officer in the command, Esinrogunjo was later identified to be Special Assistant to the state governor.\n\n\u201cHe was warned to desist from such behavior in future and the traffic warden assaulted by the Esinrogunjo was pacified and asked to go back to his duty post, while Esinrogunjo was also released.\n\n\u201cThe command wishes to reiterate that, at no time was the suspect Esinrogunjo arrested for being in possession of weeds or bullet.\n\n\u201cIt was a case of driving against the traffic and physically assaulting a police man that brought him to the police headquarters.\n\n\u201cThe physical assault on Esinrogunjo was from aggrieved passersby that followed the parties to the police headquarters and the men were arrested, reprimanded and equally released.\n\n\u201cThe Command has nothing to do with the video in circulation.\n\n\u201cEsinrogunjo was arrested for traffic offence and assault which had been satisfactorily dealt with,\u201d the statement read in part.",

          "text": "Nyeson Wike, the governor of Rivers State, has stated his desire to run for president in 2023 on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), claiming that he is the ideal individual to depose the current All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nWike made the announcement when he paid a visit to his Benue State counterpart, Samuel Ortom, at the Government House in Makurdi, the state capital, on Sunday. He said he was announcing his intention to run for president for the first time in Benue.\n\n\u201cTo remove APC from power, I\u2019m the person who can tell them enough is enough. We must take this power and I\u2019m ready to take it for PDP.\n\nGod is with us that\u2019s why APC keeps failing everyday.\u201d\n\nThe Presidential hopeful who urged stakeholders to give him their mandates and not to sell their votes, assured that he has the capacity to, \u201cface this evil government.\n\n\u201cHe queried those founding fathers who ran away from the party and still want to be recognised, saying, \u201d by the time you ran away, you sold your share as a founding father so you can no longer retain your position of founding fathers.\n\n\u201cI stood for this party. I work for this party since 1998. I have nowhere to run to and that\u2019s why anything that happens to this party I take personally. I have never relented.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, those who ran away made us loose election. Today, they are crying but some of us stood and said PDP will not die.\n\n\u201cSome people want to use Nigeria to buy back their personal business. They talk about private sector. Mention the private business that survive. Is it banks that your father had? Everybody is an employer of labour. Even in my house I have 50 people who feast from me.\n\nThey should stop deceiving us. I have performed as a governor and carry my shoulders high anywhere. I have the capacity to face this evil government. Just give me the mandate. I will speak the truth to power and nothing but the truth. I have the capacity to move this country forward,\u201d he said.\n\nThe presidential hopeful promised that if elected, security would be his topmost priority.",

He is using his position in Ogbia to call the shots of who will get the PDP\u2019s electoral tickets for various positions in Ogbia.\n\n\u201cHis intention is to select people, who will easily and willingly defect with him to the APC at the appropriate time. So, he is working against loyal PDP members, who are determined to win and remain in the party.\n\n\u201cBut Governor Douye Diri is playing into his hands. If Diri allows Jonathan to have his way, he will be the greatest loser because he will be alone to fight for his second term\u201d, the source, who craved anonymity said.\n\nJonathan was said to have settled for Prof. Edmund Allison-Oguru as his choice to fly the flag of PDP for the Ogbia Federal Constituency seat in the National Assembly.\n\nThe former President reportedly by-passed aspirants, who initially indicated interest for the constituency\u2019s ticket only to ask Oguru, who was not even in the picture to go and pick the expression of interest and nomination forms to contest the primary of the PDP schedule for May.\n\nTherefore, to protect his ambition, Jonathan was said to have settled for Allison-Oguru ahead of the current occupant of the position, Fred Obua; Local Government Chairman, Ebinyo Turner; a member of the House of Assembly, Chief Mietema Obodor and a former Commissioner, Daniel Iworiso-Markson.\n\nJonathan reportedly ruled out Obua because of the issue of zoning: Turner for immaturity and Obordor for having enjoyed his political patronage for a long time ahead of others.\n\nBut another close source said Jonathan believed he could only entrust his ambition on Allison-Oguru because of his long-standing relationship with him.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThis is the reason he is not even considering Iworiso-Markson. He believes that Iworiso-Markson will never defect with him to the APC. He knows that Iworiso-Markson will remain in PDP and that will be a big let down for him\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe former President has been thinking of the direction to take until recently when he was convinced by some stakeholders to choose Prof. Edmund Allison-Oguru. If you recall, it was Jonathan who nominated him as Secretary to the State Government in the first tenure of Senator Seriake Dickson\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cHe also recently nominated him to be among the members of the governing board of the University of Africa, Toru-Orua in Sagbama. So it is him that he has chosen\u201d.\n\nIt was further gathered that while Jonathan would discuss his choice for the House of Representatives with Governor Douye Diri next week. He had asked the Ogbia PDP caucus to meet on Monday to agree on Allison-Oguru as the consensus candidate.\n\nHowever, some of the stakeholders were concerned that if the PDP picked Allison-Oguru as its candidate, the party would lose the main election because of his unpopularity.\n\n\u201cWe will lose to any party if Allison-Oguru is our candidate. It is a huge joke for the former President to be insisting that we endorse him as our candidate. I mean this is why people like me are against it. Jonathan is blindfolded by his ambition. The earlier th governor knows this the better for him and for the PDP.\n\n\u201cThe man is not popular and we shouldn\u2019t make that kind of huge mistake. This is an election and not comedy. We need our very best and those on parade are worth winning election for us and not the Professor\u201d the stakeholder said.\n\nIt was gathered that for Bayelsa East Senatorial ticket zoned to Ogbia, Jonathan was in dilemma whether to settle for the Chief of Staff, Benson Agadaga or Rex-Jude Ogbuku, a lawyer and former Executive Secretary of Federal Character Commission, who recently defected to the PDP.",

The source at the Airport told our Correspondent that the bandits have vowed to shutdown the Airport.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cthe bandits attack started around 12:00am today (Saturday). They started attacking the Airport around the midnight. The bandits were alleging that the military personnel took away their cattle.\n\n\u201cThe military were able to repel them that midnight and we thought that was all. In fact, our staff resumed work this morning as usual. They worked around the runway five till around 12:00pm.\n\n\u201cThen, shortly after that, some NAMA staff went to check some of their equipment, then these people (bandits) appeared and started shooting. The NAMA engineers scampered for safety, they could not even go and enter the vehicle that took them to the site.\n\n\u201cIt was in the process that their security man was shot in the head. The security man was rushed to the hospital and he was confirmed dead.\n\n\u201cAs I am talking to you now, the military are still battling those guys, and they are proving difficult to be repelled. Now, they had shutdown the Airport,\u201d the source said.\n\nIt was however gathered that, many of the staff have already fled the Airport, while more military personnel have been deployed to the scene on clearance operation with a Armoured Personnel Carrier.\n\nHowever, at the time of filing this report, the Kaduna State Police Command\u2019s Public Relations Officer, ASP Muhammad Jalige, promised to get across to the DPO in charge of the area and get back to correspondents.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike has declared that he will be vying for the office of the President of Nigeria under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nGovernor Wike, who made his intention known in Makurdi, Benue State after a meeting with PDP stakeholders on Sunday, stressed that his priority will be to tackle the festering insecurity in the country and engender rule of law.\n\n\u201cLet me thank the people of Benue for receiving me to come and talk to them. It is obvious that I am going to run for the presidency of this country. And I am declaring for the first time in Benue State because of my special relationship with them. People are merely not suspecting, but let it be known today that I am announcing it in Benue State because I have a special relationship with this state,\u201d the governor was quoted as saying in a statement by his media aide, Kelvin Ebiri.\n\nResponding to questions from journalists on what he was going to be doing differently if elected President, Governor Wike explained that he will pragmatically tackle the issue of insecurity.\n\nHe said service chiefs and heads of other security agencies will be provided with the requisite equipment and incentives to discharge their constitutional obligations. According to him, they will also be given timeline to tackle the lingering insecurity as his administration will not be disposed to excuses.\n\n\u201cToday, you can\u2019t talk about security in this country and you must understand that without security you can\u2019t talk about governance. One first thing that anybody who takes an oath of office is sworn to, is that you must protect life and property. If you can\u2019t protect life and property then you can\u2019t talk about governance. So that major thing is that our people should be alive,\u201d Wike said.\n\nThe governor, who condemned the terrorist attack at the Kaduna International Airport over the weekend, said Nigerians urgently need a leader who can address the growing insecurity in the country.\n\nSpeaking further, Wike assured that if elected, his administration will engender the rule of law in order to attract more direct foreign investment into the country.\n\n\ufeff\n\nAccording to him, disregard for the rule of law by the present Buhari-led Federal Government has been one of the banes of direct foreign investment in the country.\n\n\u201cNobody can bring investments in this country because there is no respect for the rule of law. Nobody obeys court orders. Who will come and invest his money when the court gives its judgement and it will not be obeyed. So, I am going to run for election and victory will be ours.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the governor has accused some presidential aspirants who have indicated interest for the party\u2019s ticket as being responsible for PDP\u2019S failure in 2015.\n\n\u201cThose who want to be President now were the problems of the party in 2015. They ran away when the party needed them the most. But I have stood and worked for this party. I have nowhere to run to because I take it personally that the party should not die. And I challenge anyone in a debate what they did for PDP.\u201d\n\nWhile soliciting the support of delegates ahead of the PDP\u2019S presidential primary, the governor, said he has all that is required to defeat the All Progressives Congress.",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged Professor Mahmood Yakubu, the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to \u201cwidely publish the details of safeguards and mechanisms put in place to protect the privacy and security of election information and data in the custody of INEC, including in its servers, databases and other electronic formats\u201d.\n\nSERAP urged him to \u201cclarify whether any third-party is involved in the collection, control, and use of election information and data, the legal rules and processes guiding the choice of any such third party\u201d.\n\nSERAP also urged him to \u201cclarify the other location or locations where election information is stored apart from Abuja, and the details of any third-party who has access to such a database, the safeguards and contingency plans put in place by INEC to address any threats to the privacy and security of election information\u201d.\n\nIn a Freedom of Information request dated 26 March 2022 and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cEnsuring adequate safeguards and mechanisms to protect the privacy and security of election information and data would improve the ability of INEC to effectively discharge its constitutional and statutory duties\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: APC National Convention In Pictures\n\nSERAP said: \u201cThis would also help to remove risks of attack and unlawful interference by any unauthorised person with election information and data\u201d.\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cWidely publishing the details of safeguards and mechanisms of election information and data would also contribute to improving the sanctity and integrity of the electoral process, and public trust and confidence in the process\u201d.\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cPutting in place adequate technological security measures to prevent unauthorized access to election information and data would improve the credibility of the electoral process and the enjoyment of people\u2019s right to participate in their own government.\n\n\u201cAs an institution, which collects, controls and uses election-related information and data in the discharge of its constitutional and statutory duties, INEC has a legal responsibility to ensure adequate protection of such information and data from threats and vulnerabilities to attack or interference.\n\n\u201cAny interference by unauthorised third party in election information and data may be used for corrupt, political and other unlawful purposes, and would expose election systems to fraud and meddling, as well undermine the right to participation and the country\u2019s democratic system.\n\n\u201cThe right of people to participate in their government is a fundamental feature of any democratic society, and any infringement of privacy and security of election information and data would strike at the heart of representative government.\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 7 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall consider appropriate legal actions to compel INEC to comply with our request in the public interest.\n\n\u201cSERAP notes that voter registration systems and voting systems are the most vulnerable and susceptible to manipulation by corrupt politicians and other actors.\n\n\u201cAs the experiences in other countries have shown, election information is often susceptible to unlawful interference by corrupt politicians and other actors, which can be damaging to the integrity of the electoral process and democratic practices.\n\n\u201cThe experiences of other countries demonstrate the need for INEC to take effective and transparent measures to ensure and protect the privacy and security of election information and data, which would protect the integrity of the country\u2019s democracy.\n\n\u201cAny privacy or security weakness in any component of any of the election systems can be easily exploited to cast doubt on the integrity of the electoral process.\n\n\u201cOur requests are brought in the public interest, and in keeping with the requirements of the Nigerian Constitution 1999 [as amended], the Electoral Act, the Freedom of Information Act, and the country\u2019s international obligations including under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, and the African Charter on Democracy, Elections, and Governance.\n\n\u201cSERAP notes that Section 9(2)(a) of the Electoral Act 2022 provides that INEC \u2018shall keep the Register of Voters in its National Headquarters and other locations as the Commission may determine.\u2019 The provision also states that INEC \u2018shall keep the Register of Voters in electronic format in its central database.\u2019\n\n\u201cSection 153 of the Act defines \u2018electronic format\u2019 to include \u2018the electronic version of the Register of Voters or National Electronic Register of Election Results, as the case may be, created, recorded, transmitted or stored in digital form or in other intangible forms by electronic, magnetic or optical means or by any other means.\u201d\n\nThe organisation said: \u201cSection 37 of the Nigerian Constitution, article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and article 5 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights protect against arbitrary or unlawful interference with one\u2019s privacy.\n\n\u201cInterference with the privacy of election information and data would clearly undermine the security of any such information and data. Similarly, Article 9 (1) of the African Charter provides that, \u2018Every individual shall have the right to receive information.\n\n\u201cArticle 2(10) of the African Charter on Democracy, Elections, and Governance requires states parties including Nigeria to \u2018promote the establishment of the necessary conditions to foster citizen participation, transparency, access to information, and accountability in the management of public affairs.\u2019\u201d",

          "text": "Christian Eriksen sealed a fairytale return to international football with a goal, but it was not enough to prevent Denmark from slumping to a 4-2 friendly defeat to the Netherlands.\n\nThe midfielder, playing his first international since suffering a cardiac arrest at Euro 2020, scored with his first touch after coming on as a half-time substitute on an emotional night in Amsterdam.\n\nAn entertaining game saw the Netherlands take the lead after just 16 minutes when Steven Bergwijn brilliantly headed Daley Blind\u2019s left-wing cross into the top corner, but the Danes equalised with their next attack as Jannik Vestergaard flicked home from Joakim Maehle\u2019s delivery.\n\nThe Dutch restored their advantage before the half-hour mark though. Manchester City defender Nathan Ake was left unmarked at the back-post and he nodded Bergwijn\u2019s cross past Kasper Schmeichel for his third international goal.\n\nA foul in the penalty area by Jannik Vestergaard on Berghuis allowed Memphis Depay to make it 3-1 from the spot on 39-minutes, but Denmark were back in it straight after the break as Eriksen pulled one back by brilliantly finding the far top corner.\n\nThe Danes did play with more control following their half-time substitutions, but Bergwijn settled the tie when he cut inside and curled into the far top corner to make it 4-2.\n\nLess than a year ago, Christian Eriksen\u2019s career looked over after he collapsed from a cardiac arrest during Euro 2020.\n\nThe midfielder, who\u2019s played three times since joining Brentford earlier this season, came on as a substitute at the break to a standing ovation from the Amsterdam ArenA crowd, the home of his former club Ajax\n\nWithin two minutes of taking to the field he had scored, calmly curling into the far top corner with his first touch of the game to reduce Denmark\u2019s deficit, and he was not finished there, smashing a wonderful 30-yard drive against the post mid-way through the second half.",

          "title": "Russia-Ukraine War: Nigeria Ready to Step in as Alternative Gas Supplier to Europe, Says Deputy Oil Minister Sylva",
          "text": "Following the war between Russia and Ukraine, which is threatening the supply of gas to European countries by Russia, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, has revealed that Nigeria is ready to offer its services as an alternative gas supplier to Europe.\n\nHe urged the European Union (EU) to increase investments in gas and hydrocarbons in Nigeria to enable the country to meet the bloc\u2019s energy needs.\n\nThis is coming as the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), has declared that the emergence of China as almost the sole destination for Nigeria\u2019s solid minerals resources export poses a risk to the country\u2019s economy.\n\nNEITI advised the federal government to develop a business relationship with other countries to reduce over-dependence on China.\n\nSylva spoke when he received a delegation led by the EU Ambassador to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Samuela Isopi on a courtesy call to his office in Abuja.\n\nThe minister\u2019s call comes on the heels of the festering war between Ukraine and Russia, which threatens gas supply to European countries.\n\nRussia currently supplies about 30-40 per cent of the EU\u2019s gas needs.\n\nIn a statement issued Saturday by his Senior Adviser \u2013 Media and Communications, Mr Horatius Egua, the minister said Nigeria was ready to step in as an alternative gas supplier to Europe, urging the EU to encourage its oil and gas companies such as Shell, Eni, and Total Energies to scale up investments in the Nigerian gas sector.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we warned against earlier was the speed with which the EU was taking away investments in fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cWe warned that the speed was faster than they were developing renewable energy. You can see now that what we were warning against is what is happening now,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe told the delegation that what stunted growth in the development of gas in Nigeria was the lack of fresh investments, and called for a change of attitude on the part of the EU if its requests to increase supplies to Europe would be realised.\n\nAccording to the minister, one of the biggest challenges the sector has is a lack of investments.\n\n\u201cIn the last 10 years, over $70 billion worth of investments came to Africa, but sadly less than $4 billion came to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, we are the biggest in Africa. If we cannot attract investments to Nigeria, you know where we are heading.\n\n\u201cYou have been our longtime friend. As of today, our gas reserve is one of the biggest in the world. We have a proven gas reserve of 206 tcf and if we focus on gas exploitation we can get up to 600 tcf.\n\n\u201cWe are already building gas infrastructure such as the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) pipeline project, expected to take gas to Algeria, and the West Africa Gas Pipeline project designed to take gas to Morocco,\u201d Sylva explained.\n\nThe minister further said that after the Russia-Ukrainian war, the EU must have a buffer or an alternative source of gas, and collaboration with Nigeria in that regard was paramount.\n\nHe reiterated Nigeria\u2019s commitment to working with the EU to bridge the gap in terms of gas, adding that from the Russian-Ukranian crisis, it was evident that gas had been weaponised and unless it created an alternative, it would only get worse.\n\nHe reassured the EU diplomats of Nigeria\u2019s readiness to be an alternative supplier of gas to the EU but urged its companies operating in the country to invest more here.\n\n\u201cWe would like to be reliable partners to solve the energy problem in Europe and we can only achieve this by working together. It is only when investing in these areas is increased that Nigeria can meet that obligation,\u201d Sylva said.\n\nWhile emphasising the need for the transfer of technology in gas and renewable energy, he said Africa must be allowed to continue to exploit its hydrocarbon deposits to develop the continent.\n\nIn her response, Isopi urged Nigeria to take advantage of the opportunity offered by the present crisis in Europe to shore up gas supplies to Europe.",

          "text": "Foreign ministers from four Arab League countries, along with the US secretary of state, are holding an historic meeting in Israel.\n\nIt is the first time the ministers from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Morocco and Bahrain will meet their Israeli counterpart in his home country.\n\nIt comes after they normalised relations with Israel for the first time during the past year-and-a-half.\n\nThe foreign minister of Egypt is also joining the talks.\n\nEgypt was the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, in 1979, though relations between them have often been cool.\n\nThe six top diplomats are meeting on Sunday at a hotel in Sde Boker in the Negev desert in southern Israel and will hold talks on Monday.\n\nThe meeting coincides with a tour of the region by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken.\n\nHe is visiting Israel, the West Bank, Morocco and Algeria on a five-day trip for talks on issues including Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, tensions with Iran and the Israel-Palestinian conflict.\n\nMr Blinken will also meet Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and later Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah.\n\nHis meeting with Mr Bennett is taking place at a time of growing Israeli fears that the US is on the brink of signing a new agreement with Iran to curb its nuclear programme in return for an end to crippling US-led sanctions.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 global nuclear deal with Iran and restored sanctions in a move which led Iran to significantly advance its nuclear activities which had been barred by the accord.\n\nIsrael says it believes a new deal will be weaker than the previous one and enable Iran to intensify its military activities across the region.\n\nIsrael also fears that the US might remove Iran\u2019s powerful Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) from its list of terrorist groups as part of a new nuclear deal.\n\nThe IRGC, it says, has helped sustain the wars in Syria and Yemen and bolstered anti-Israel militant groups in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria.\n\nMr Blinken has also taken a different approach to the Israel-Palestinian issue to Mr Bennett. He supports the idea of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, something resolutely rejected by the Israeli prime minister.\n\nTalks will also focus on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, with Israel having taken a lead role as a mediator in the conflict.\n\nIsrael has good relations with both Ukraine and Russia, and Mr Bennett has held several face-to-face meetings and telephone conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of efforts to end the month-long war in Ukraine.",

          "title": "Russia Sowing a Deep Hatred Among Ukrainians, Zelensky Says",
          "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy angrily warned Moscow that it is sowing a deep hatred for Russia among his people, as constant artillery barrages and aerial bombings are reducing cities to rubble, killing civilians and driving others into shelters, leaving them to scrounge for food and water to survive.\n\n\u201cYou are doing everything so that our people themselves leave the Russian language, because the Russian language will now be associated only with you, with your explosions and murders, your crimes,\u201d Zelenskyy said in an impassioned video address late Saturday.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has ground into a war of attrition in many places, with the toll on civilians rising as Moscow seeks to pound cities into submission from entrenched positions.\n\nA nuclear research facility in the besieged city of Kharkiv, near the Russian border, again came under fire Saturday, and Ukraine\u2019s nuclear watchdog said that because of ongoing hostilities it was impossible to assess the extent of the damage.\n\nKharkiv has been besieged by Russian forces since the start of the invasion and has come under repeated shelling that has hit residential buildings and critical infrastructure.\n\nUkrainian authorities have previously reported that Russian shelling had damaged buildings at the facility, but there had been no release of radiation. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said the nuclear material in the facility is always subcritical and the inventory of radioactive material is very low, reducing the risks of radiation release.\n\nOn the western side of the country, Russian rockets struck Lviv on Saturday while President Joe Biden visited neighboring Poland, serving as a reminder that Moscow is willing to strike anywhere in Ukraine despite its claim to be focusing its offensive on the country\u2019s east.\n\nEarly Sunday, a chemical smell still lingered in the air as firefighters in Lviv sprayed water on a burned section of an oil facility hit in the Russian attack.\n\nA security guard at the site, Yaroslav Prokopiv, said he saw three rockets strike and destroy two oil tanks but no one was hurt.\n\n\u201cThe third strike threw me to the ground,\u201d he said.\n\nRussia\u2019s back-to-back airstrikes shook the city that has become a haven for an estimated 200,000 people who have had to flee their hometowns. Lviv had been largely spared since the invasion began, although missiles struck an aircraft repair facility near the main airport a week ago.\n\nIn the dim, crowded bomb shelter under an apartment block a short ways from the first blast site, Olana Ukrainets, a 34-year-old IT professional, said she couldn\u2019t believe she had to hide again after fleeing from the northeastern city of Kharkiv, one of the most bombarded cities of the war.\n\n\u201cWe were on one side of the street and saw it on the other side,\u201d she said. \u201cWe saw fire. I said to my friend, \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 Then we heard the sound of an explosion and glass breaking. We tried to hide between buildings. I don\u2019t know what the target was.\u201d\n\nTwo cities on opposite ends of the country are seeing some of the worst suffering at the moment, Chernihiv in the north \u2013 strategically located on the road from the Belarusian border to the capital, Kyiv \u2013 and Mariupol in the south, a key port city on the Sea of Azov.\n\nBoth are encircled by Russian forces, but still holding out.\n\nChernihiv has been under attack since the early days of the invasion and over the last week, Russia destroyed the main vehicular bridge leading out of the city and rendered a nearby pedestrian bridge impassable, cutting off the last route for civilians to flee, or for food and medicine to be brought in.\n\nChernihiv\u2019s remaining residents are terrified that each blast, bomb and body that lies uncollected on the streets ensnares them in the same macabre trap of unescapable killings and destruction.\n\n\u201cIn basements at night, everyone is talking about one thing: Chernihiv becoming (the) next Mariupol,\u201d said 38-year-old resident Ihar Kazmerchak, a linguistics scholar.\n\nHe spoke to The Associated Press by cellphone, amid incessant beeps signaling that his battery was dying. The city is without power, running water and heating. At pharmacies, the list of medicines no longer available grows longer by the day.\n\nKazmerchak starts his day in long lines for drinking water, rationed to 10 liters (2 1/2 gallons) per person. People come with empty bottles and buckets for filling when water-delivery trucks make their rounds.\n\n\u201cFood is running out, and shelling and bombing doesn\u2019t stop,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than half of the city\u2019s 280,000 inhabitants have already fled and hundreds who stayed have been killed, Mayor Vladyslav Atroshenko said.\n\nRussian forces have bombed residential areas from low altitude in \u201cabsolutely clear weather\u201d and \u201care deliberately destroying civilian infrastructure: schools, kindergartens, churches, residential buildings and even the local football stadium,\u201d Atroshenko told Ukrainian television.\n\nRefugees from Chernihiv who fled the encirclement and reached Poland this week spoke of broad and terrible destruction, with bombs flattening at least two schools in the city center and strikes also hitting the stadium, museums and many homes.\n\nThey said that with utilities knocked out, people are taking water from the Desna to drink and that strikes are killing people while they wait in line for food. Volodymyr Fedorovych, 77, said he narrowly escaped a bomb that fell on a bread line he had been standing in just moments earlier. He said the blast killed 16 people and injured dozens, blowing off arms and legs.\n\nSo intense is the siege that some of those trapped cannot even muster the strength to be afraid anymore, Kazmerchak said.\n\n\u201cRavaged houses, fires, corpses in the street, huge aircraft bombs that didn\u2019t explode in courtyards are not surprising anyone anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are simply tired of being scared and don\u2019t even always go down to the basements.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s defense ministry said Saturday that it doesn\u2019t expect a reprieve for citizens of Ukraine\u2019s bombarded cities anytime soon.\n\n\u201cRussia will continue to use its heavy firepower on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties,\u201d the U.K. ministry said.\n\nPrevious bombings of hospitals and other nonmilitary sites, including a theater in Mariupol where Ukrainian authorities said a Russian airstrike is believed to have killed 300 people last week, already have given rise to war crimes allegations.\n\nThe invasion has driven more than 10 million people from their homes, almost a quarter of Ukraine\u2019s population. Of those, more than 3.7 million have fled the country entirely, according to the United Nations. Thousands of civilians are believed to have died.",
