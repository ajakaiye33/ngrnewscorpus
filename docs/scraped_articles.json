Why is this patient\u2019s wound not dressed?\u201d She told him that it is the O and G doctors that do dress the wound.\n\n\u201cThese doctors earlier came around a few minutes ago for the dressing but the patient was in the dialysis unit, moreover the dressing pack was not available.\n\n\u201cDr. Atinko started shouting at her saying Madam come and do this patient\u2019s dressing now. Ukamaka Godwin\u2019s relative replied that the doctors in the O and G department said they will be doing the dressing.\n\n\u201cThe nurse added that it was the O and G doctors that dressed the wound the previous day, but if he insisted it should be documented.\n\n\u201cInstead of documentation he then went close to her and said Madam I said you should go now and do the dressing\u2019, but she told him that this is a medication trolley and besides dressing pack was not available.\n\n\u201cAtinko went ahead and accosted Marvis who was at the point of wheeling a medication trolley out of the ward. The next thing that followed can only be imagined for a horrendous scene in a horror film as he slapped her,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nThe chairman stated that the nurse asked the doctor what has she done to warrant the slap and that at that point, the nurse perceived the smell of alcohol from her attacker.\n\nYusuf, therefore, condemned the act of the doctor, describing such an act as a fundamental violation of medical professional ethics and a grave desecration of international principles.\n\nShe further said that the act breached some of the provisions of international conventions, protocols, and best medical practices.\n\nYusuf added that the act also violated many of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), especially the International Labour Organisation adopted Convention 190, held in June 2019, Against Violence and Harassment at the workplace.\n\nShe, therefore, urged the management of the hospital to do the needful by stepping into the matter and giving justice to the nurse through the application of civil service rules.\n\nAccording to the chairman, if doctor Atinko is found guilty of a physical and verbal assault on the nurse, he should be subjected to disciplinary action as contained in the condition of service of the hospital and extant the civil service rules.\n\nYusuf disclosed that Gender-Based Violence (GBV) in the workplace had been a recurring decimal, especially among some of the association members.\n\nOthers at the briefing who also condemned the act are Nurse Akpi Awujah, Chairman NANNM, National Hospital Branch, and Nurse Sadiya Garba, Chief Nursing Officer, female medical ward of the hospital.\n\nThe accused (Dr. Ikeya) and the management of the hospital are yet to react to the allegation and development, respectively.\n\n(NAN)",

Within five minutes, one is accredited, do the voting, unlike before you accredit, hours later you still queue to cast your vote,\u201d Afolayan said.\n\nHe also lauded the peaceful conducts of the electorate, saying that people conducted themselves peacefully without any bickering.\n\nNAN reports that Afolayan voted at Ward 4, Unit 4 at Efon-Alaaye in Efon Local Government area rea of Ekiti.\n\nHowever, some voters in Ifaki-Ekiti, raised alarm that the Bi-modal Voter Accreditation System (BIVAS) machines were not functioning well in many areas of the town.\n\nThey consequently called on INEC to intervene so that they do not miss out in electing candidates of their choice, in the exercise which they said would officially close at about 2.30p.m.\n\nNAN reports that at Omi-Oniyo Voting Unit, in Ifaki-Ekiti, the hometown of Segun Oni, the candidate of Social Democratic Party (SDP), out of the over 500 voters registered in the area, only two persons had been able to vote, as at about 9.30 a.m.\n\nAn elderly woman, who spoke on the development on condition of anonymity, said she had been on queue since about 7.09 a.m, but has yet to be accredited, not to talk of voting.\n\nNAN further reports that same scenario was playing out in some polling units in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Fidelix Nweke, the Coordinator, Women and Youths Pathfinders Initiative, Abuja, lauded the peaceful conduct of the electorate in Efon-Alaaye during the Saturday governorship election.\n\nNweke told NAN in Efon-Alaaye\n\nthat there has not been any report of violence in areas visited by the group.\n\nHe also lauded the massive turnout of voters for the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe are in Ekiti to observe the election process; we have being going round and in the areas visited so far, the turnout had been very impressive.\n\n\u201cWe wish it can continue like this; we have not seen any atom of violence anywhere.\n\n\u201cIt has been very peaceful; we also wish it can continue like this till the end of the election,\u201d Nweke said.\n\nHe called on the people to ensure that peaceful atmosphere being witnessed now was maintained.\n\nThe group coordinator said that before any election could be adjudged free, fair and credible, it must be peaceful.\n\nHe said, \u201cFrom what we have seen so far, if the election continues like this till the end of the exercise by remaining peaceful, this election can be adjudged as a peaceful election.\u201d\n\nAlso, Mrs Kemi Elebute-Halle, the Governorship candidate of the Action Democratic Party, (ADP), insisted that she was still in the race.\n\nElebute-Halle, addressing newsmen said: \u201c It is a lie concocted by those afraid of my rising profile.\n\n\u201cHaving come this far, it would be cowardly of me to back out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m set to win this election.

          "text": "A Federal High Court in Abuja has restrained the Federal Government from enforcing or giving effect to the controversial Customs Modernisation Project, otherwise known as e-Custom, allegedly executed by its agents on May 30, 2022.\n\nThe agents, who allegedly executed the disputed concession project are the Nigerian Custom Service, Trade Modernisation Project limited, Huawei Technologies Company Nigeria limited and African Finance Corporation.\n\nThe court also issued an order of interim injunction against the Federal government or its agents acting through the Federal Executive Council, FEC, from retrospectively ratifying the decisions to concession the Custom Modernisation Project also known as e-custom project to Trade Modernisation Project limited, Huawei Technologies Company limited and African Finance Corporation.\n\nThe restraining order issued by Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Abuja division of the court shall last till the hearing and the determination of a suit brought against the Federal Government by two aggrieved companies.\n\nAn enrol order issued by the court dated June 17, 2022, was signed by Justice Inyang Eden Ekwo and sighted by DAILY POST correspondent.\n\nThe two aggrieved companies are: E-Customs HC Project Limited and Bionica Technologies ( (West Africa) Limited, which jointly challenged the alleged unlawful and fraudulent concession of the e-custom project to African Finance Corporation\n\nCounsel to the two aggrieved companies, Mr Anone Usman had on behalf of the two plaintiffs argued an ex-parte application, in which he prayed the Federal High Court for interim orders against the defendants to protect the interest of his clients.\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo, while ruling on the ex-parte application granted the prayers of the plaintiffs having placed sufficient evidence of interest in the concession project.\n\nThe Judge also granted permission to the aggrieved companies to serve a Writ of Summons and all other processes on the African Finance Corporation at its head office, located at Ikoyi, Lagos, through DHL courier services.\n\nDefendants in the suit are the Federal government of Nigeria, Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Finance Minister, Infrastructure Regulatory Concession Commission, (IRCC) Nigeria Custom Service, Trade Modernization Project limited, Huawei Technologies limited, African Finance Corporation and Bergman Security Consultant and Supply limited as 1st to 9th defendants, respectively.\n\nJustice Ekwo subsequently fixed June 28 for hearing in the matter.\n\nThe two plaintiffs had in their statement of claims narrated how they proposed to carry out Custom Modernisation Project through several government officials for the benefits of the Nigerian Custom Service.\n\nThey claimed that after series of meetings and negotiations with some of the defendants, President Muhammudu Buhari granted anticipatory approval for the e-custom Project\n\nThey averred that on September 2 , 2020, the Minister of Finance presented a memo with number EC2020/153 to the Federal Executive Council, the highest decision making body of the federal government and secured approval for the two plaintiffs to be granted the award of the concession.\n\nThe Plaintiffs further claimed that trouble started when the Nigeria Custom Service unilaterally reviewed the Federal Executive Council approval and imposed other conditions, among which are shareholding formulae and governance structure on them.\n\nThey claimed that the power of the Nigeria Customs Service to unilaterally review FEC approval was protested and that the Comptroller General of the agency stood his ground.\n\nThe Plaintiff asserted that to their surprise, they read in the news that the Nigeria Custom Service had executed a concession agreement with the Trade Modernisation Project on May 30, 2022, with Huawei Technologies Company and African Finance Corporation in total breach of the Concession Agreement vetted by the AGF in conjunction with the Minister of Finance.\n\nThey averred that Tade Modernisation Project Limited was incorporated in April, 2022 at the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) with one Alhaji Saleh Ahmadu a close friend of the Comptroller General as the Chairman.\n\nPlaintiff asserted that the new company, having been just incorporated in April 2022 could not have obtained and did not obtain the full business case compliance certificate from the Infrastructure Regulatory Concession Commission IRCC and the approval of the Federal Executive Council to carry out e- custom project.\n\nThey asked the court to make declaration that the decisions of the Federal Government and its agent to enter into concession agreement with Trade Modernisation Project Limited, Huaewai Technologies Company and African Finance Corporation in respect of the e-customs project is illegal, null and void, having been made in gross violation of Section 2 of the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission Act 2005.\n\nThey also asked the court to declare that e-Customs HC Project limited is the approved and rightful concessionaire for the e-customs project as approved by Federal Executive Council at its meeting of September 2, 2020 and in line with Section 2 of the Infrastructure Regulatory Concession Commission Act.\n\nThey also applied for an order of the court directing the Federal Government, through AGF, Finance Minister, IRCC and Customs to consulate the e-custom project with the 1st plaintiff, (E-Customs Project Limited) as approved by FEC in its September 2020 meeting.\n\nBesides, the two plaintiffs asked the court to compel the defendants to pay them a sum of two hundred million naira (N200m) as cost of litigation.",

No new date has been fixed for the burial.\u201d\n\nRecently in the same Ihiala, some hoodlums set ablaze a mansion close to Aforigwe Market in Ubahuekwem village for allegedly inviting the police after the man had paid the gunmen to provide security for him during a ceremony in his compound.\n\nWhen contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, in a statement, said that it was a clash between two armed groups.\n\nIkenga said: \u201cThe Anambra State Police Command has reinforced Ihiala and its environs following a trending video of SUVs and Hilux vehicles carrying young men that are welding arms to a yet unidentified location.\n\n\u201cInformation from eyewitness account shows that violent clash ensued between two criminal gang and further details confirmed the killing of one Innocent Obieke aka Double Lion and three others.\n\n\u201cDouble Lion has been on the police wanted list and has featured in attacks on police formations, military locations and other government infrastructure.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, police have intensified patrol. It is ongoing and the situation is being monitored\u201d, the PPRO said in the statement.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

I am happy that there was no case of apathy. The security build up has also been impressive, so the process has been good and fine.\n\n\u201cI am coming with a change agenda and my manifesto is clear about the changes I am bringing\u201d, he said.\n\n10:44 am\n\nPDP candidate, Bisi Kolawole at Ward 8 unit 1, Efon Alaaye, casting his vote\n\n10:14 am\n\nVoters on Queue\n\n10:13am\n\nTight Security, Early Arrival of INEC Officials, Massive Turnout of Voters as Guber Election Holds in Ekiti\n\n\n\n*EFCC deploys operatives to prevent vote buying\n\n\n\nChuks Okocha in Ado Ekiti\n\n\n\nWith over 75 percent of voting materials and INEC officials arriving at the polling stations across the local governments of Ekiti state, voting for the next governor of the state have commenced in most of the areas visited by THISDAY .\n\nAs a preemptive measure against vote buying, officials of the EFCC were seen at the Police Command in their red reflective jackets.\n\nReports by Yiaga Africa said that out of the 250 polling units at 8.38 am, that 246 were already open for business, while the remaining four within the Ado Ekiti metropolis were awaiting arrival of INEC officials.\n\nLater at 9.30nam, Yiaga Africa posted from its situation room that at the 250 polling stations earlier visited accreditations and voting had commenced .\n\nSecurity was tight with vehicular movement partially restricted. There were operatives of security agencies like Policemen, Civil Defence officials seen in most of the polling centres visited.\n\nSamples of voting situations in places visited:\n\n*Voters not coordinated at this polling unit 017 ward 10 Bashiri, Security agents have ordered stoppage of exercise, pending when normalcy will be restored.\n\n*At Ward 13, unit 01, Itanla beside delight hotel, Ilawe road, Ado Ekiti there is confusion as to whether their polling unit has been moved. Prospective voters who claimed that they had been voting there could not see INEC officials or voting materials.\n\n* At the same polling 17 in ward 10 of the Ado local government, gunshots were fired to disperse the agitated crowd due to rowdy situation.\n\nMeanwhile, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has deployed its operatives in Ekiti state to monitor today\u2019s governorship election with a view to addressing the possibility of vote buying.\n\nSome of the operatives and armed police personnel attached to the commission were sighted in a convoy of vehicles within Ado Ekiti, the state capital.\n\n9:40am\n\nVoting Begins as Voters Lament Slow Accreditation\n\n\n\nVictor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nVoting has commenced in some polling units in today\u2019s governorship poll in Ekiti State, as voters have queued up in some units to exercise their voting rights.\n\nIn some units in Ado Ekiti, Ilawe, Igede and Iyin Ekiti, voters were being accredited with the aide of Bimodal Voter Authentication System(BVAS) and given the ballots to vote.\n\nThere was impressive turnout of voters in virtually all the polling units.\n\nAlso, despite the peaceful conduct of voters, there were complaints in some of the units that the BVAS was slow and keeping voters on the queue for too long.\n\nHowever, the presiding officers in areas where BVAS seemed to be slow have complained to the Independent National Electoral Commission for proper and swift action.\n\nMilitary personnel were also stationed at entering points between Ado and Iyin Ekiti and at border towns .\n\nOperatives of the Department of State Services were also seen moving around to ensure orderliness and peaceful conduct of the poll in all the towns.\n\nSome of the agents were also seen complaining about reported cases of vote buying and such complaints were being handled by security operatives.\n\n8:09am\n\nVoters Trek Long Distance to Polling Units\n\nVictor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nAs the Independent National Electoral Commission prepares to conduct the Governorship poll in Ekiti State today, it was observed that voters were resolute to cast their votes by trekking several kilometres to exercise their franchise.\n\nThe candidates of the All Progressives Congress, Biodun Oyebanji, People\u2019s Democratic Party, Bisi Kolawole and Social Democratic Party , Segun Oni, are the leading candidates in the impending electoral battle.\n\nThe election is billed to begin at 8am going by INEC time table .\n\nBut as early as 6am, those living along Federal Polytechnic road and Afe Babalola University areas, with a distance of about eight kilometres to the voting centres, were seen trooping out and trekking long distance to exercise their franchise in today\u2019s election.\n\nSome of them were compelled to go on foot owing to the 18-hour restriction placed on the state by the Inspector General of Police, Mr Usman Alkali Baba.\n\nOne of them, who identified himself as Ojo Adeniyi said he was trekking to his polling unit at Ori -Ekiti, which was about six kilometres to his residential area.\n\nWhen THISDAY visited some polling units at Odo Ado, Oke- Ori Omi, Okeyinmi, Irona and Oke- Ila areas in Ado- Ekiti, voters trooped out in large numbers to the extent that the polling units were becoming overcrowded.\n\nUnarmed Policemen were also deployed in all the polling units as early as 6am, while armed policemen were also noticed in some strategic areas to prevent violence.\n\n6:50am\n\nEkiti Decides: Oyebanji, Oni, Kolawole in Three-Horse Race\n\n*INEC promises free, fair poll, orders staff to resist unethical behaviour\n\n*Police impose 18-hour curfew, deploy 17,000; NSCDC 9,747\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Chuks Okocha and Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nThousands of voters will today file out in Ekiti State to elect a new governor that will succeed Kayode Fayemi who is at the tail end of his second four-year tenure.\n\n\n\nNo fewer than 16 political parties are fielding candidates for the election, but it is expected to be a fierce battle involving Biodun Oyebanji of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC); Segun Oni of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Bisi Kolawole of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n\n\nFor most of yesterday, tension remained very high across the state, with voters bitterly divided among the three leading candidates. Fear of violence was palpable.\n\n\n\nFor seamless conduct of today\u2019s election in Ekiti State, the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, yesterday ordered the restriction of vehicular movements along entry and exit points to the state from 12:00am on 18th June, 2022 to 6:00pm of the same day.\n\n\n\nThe police added: \u201cTo this end, operatives of the Nigeria Police Force and the military, as well as other security agencies have been deployed across the state borders to enforce the restriction order to the letter and ensure criminal minded individuals do not infiltrate the State.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Deputy Inspector General of Police, Johnson Kokumo had earlier disclosed that Ekiti State would be properly secured to avoid any breakdown of law and order during the poll.\n\n\n\nHe also revealed that a total of 17,000 personnel had been deployed for the poll.\n\nThe DIG added that soldiers would be at the borders of the communities to prevent any form of intrusion.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, all security operatives with VIPs should be withdrawn and returned to base for the purpose of the election. The DIG called on the people to be law abiding and to respect all the processes of the elections to be able to have a peaceful governorship election in the state.\n\n\n\nINEC Says it is Ready\n\nINEC spent most of yesterday moving sensitive voting materials to the wards, while assuring all that the election would be free and fair.\n\nThe electoral umpire had earlier revealed that 988,923 voters captured in the Commission\u2019s register would decide who becomes the new Ekiti State Governor.\n\nINEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu appealed to staff of the commission to be neutral and abide by the code of conduct signed by them.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cI appeal to you to uphold our Code of Conduct, display your usual sense of responsibility and professionalism; remain above board and firmly resist any unethical behaviour.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe further charged them to ensure that no political party or candidate was accorded any advantage over the other.\n\n\u201cWe must also always stick strictly to the oath of neutrality to which we have all subscribed and continually live up to the trust that Nigerians repose in us,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\n\n\nThe National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said 734,746 persons had collected their Permanent Voters Card for the election.\n\n\n\nOkoye assured electorates of the commission\u2019s readiness to conduct a free, fair and credible election.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is now a matter of common knowledge that we have 16 LGAs in Ekiti State and the election will be staged in 177 registration areas.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, yesterday said it would deploy 9,747 personnel drawn from FCT, Lagos, Ondo, Ogun, Osun, Oyo, Kogi, Kwara and Edo commands to provide security for the election.\n\nAddressing personnel at the Ekiti State Command headquarters of the NSCDC in Ado Ekiti, before they moved to their respective places of deployment, Acting Deputy Commandant General Operations, Lawal Haruna, disclosed that some flash points had already been identified and would be properly monitored.\n\n\n\nOni Alleges Intimidation\n\nThe SDP candidate yesterday alleged that some desperate politicians were already violating the peace accord signed this week before the Abdudalami Abubakar-led National Peace Commission.\n\nOni said rather than adhering to the tenets of democracy in the conduct of the June 18 Ekiti election, those he described as \u201coppressors\u201d, had allegedly been dehumanising and demobilising his supporters through unlawful arrests.\n\n\n\nOni, who addressed pressmen in Ado Ekiti, alerted INEC, international community, security agencies, observers and other stakeholders, saying \u201cfor this election to be acceptable, the REC must stamp and sign all forms EC8A, EC8B, EC8C and EC8D and not by any other agent or staff. Once the REC stamps and signs, nobody will be able to smuggle any form of fake results.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the imperative of peace for the election to be successful, Oni said: \u201cI will keep to the peace accord. But when you are kidnapping people, it renders every peace document invalid. Let us tell them not to set this state on fire.\n\n\u201cThose who had been going round to kidnap my supporters should be called to order now. They are testing the patience and tolerance of the people. They shouldn\u2019t set this state on fire.

Fear of violence was palpable.\n\n\n\nFor seamless conduct of today\u2019s election in Ekiti State, the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, yesterday ordered the restriction of vehicular movements along entry and exit points to the state from 12:00am on 18th June, 2022 to 6:00pm of the same day.\n\n\n\nThe police added: \u201cTo this end, operatives of the Nigeria Police Force and the military, as well as other security agencies have been deployed across the state borders to enforce the restriction order to the letter and ensure criminal minded individuals do not infiltrate the State.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Deputy Inspector General of Police, Johnson Kokumo had earlier disclosed that Ekiti State would be properly secured to avoid any breakdown of law and order during the poll.\n\n\n\nHe also revealed that a total of 17,000 personnel had been deployed for the poll.\n\nThe DIG added that soldiers would be at the borders of the communities to prevent any form of intrusion.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, all security operatives with VIPs should be withdrawn and returned to base for the purpose of the election. The DIG called on the people to be law abiding and to respect all the processes of the elections to be able to have a peaceful governorship election in the state.\n\n\n\nINEC Says it is Ready\n\nINEC spent most of yesterday moving sensitive voting materials to the wards, while assuring all that the election would be free and fair.\n\n\n\nThe electoral umpire had earlier revealed that 988,923 voters captured in the Commission\u2019s register would decide who becomes the new Ekiti State Governor.\n\nINEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu appealed to staff of the commission to be neutral and abide by the code of conduct signed by them.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cI appeal to you to uphold our Code of Conduct, display your usual sense of responsibility and professionalism; remain above board and firmly resist any unethical behaviour.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe further charged them to ensure that no political party or candidate was accorded any advantage over the other.\n\n\u201cWe must also always stick strictly to the oath of neutrality to which we have all subscribed and continually live up to the trust that Nigerians repose in us,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\n\n\nThe National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said 734,746 persons had collected their Permanent Voters Card for the election.\n\n\n\nOkoye assured electorates of the commission\u2019s readiness to conduct a free, fair and credible election.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is now a matter of common knowledge that we have 16 LGAs in Ekiti State and the election will be staged in 177 registration areas.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, yesterday said it would deploy 9,747 personnel drawn from FCT, Lagos, Ondo, Ogun, Osun, Oyo, Kogi, Kwara and Edo commands to provide security for the election.\n\nAddressing personnel at the Ekiti State Command headquarters of the NSCDC in Ado Ekiti, before they moved to their respective places of deployment, Acting Deputy Commandant General Operations, Lawal Haruna, disclosed that some flash points had already been identified and would be properly monitored.\n\n\n\nOni Alleges Intimidation\n\nThe SDP candidate yesterday alleged that some desperate politicians were already violating the peace accord signed this week before the Abdudalami Abubakar-led National Peace Commission.\n\nOni said rather than adhering to the tenets of democracy in the conduct of the June 18 Ekiti election, those he described as \u201coppressors\u201d, had allegedly been dehumanising and demobilising his supporters through unlawful arrests.\n\n\n\nOni, who addressed pressmen in Ado Ekiti, alerted INEC, international community, security agencies, observers and other stakeholders, saying \u201cfor this election to be acceptable, the REC must stamp and sign all forms EC8A, EC8B, EC8C and EC8D and not by any other agent or staff. Once the REC stamps and signs, nobody will be able to smuggle any form of fake results.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the imperative of peace for the election to be successful, Oni said: \u201cI will keep to the peace accord. But when you are kidnapping people, it renders every peace document invalid. Let us tell them not to set this state on fire.\n\n\u201cThose who had been going round to kidnap my supporters should be called to order now. They are testing the patience and tolerance of the people. They shouldn\u2019t set this state on fire. If anybody commits an offence and they think they are the authorities to go round and arrest people at night, then the peace accord becomes shattered immediately.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow the Battle will Be Fought\n\nThe APC looks good to win Ekiti South Senatorial District, comprising six local governments \u2013 Gbonyin, Ekiti East, Ikere, Ekiti Southwest, Emure and Ise/Orun.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nFidelis David in Akure\n\nGovernor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State yesterday blamed himself and government at all levels for failing to defend the victims of June 5 attack on St Francis Catholic Church, Owo, which claimed 40 lives.\n\n\n\nAkeredolu made the declaration during the funeral Mass for 18 of the victims, held at the Mydas Resort and Hotel, Owo.\n\n\n\nAkeredolu, who was at the event alongside his wife, Betty; former governor of the state, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko; Chairman of the state\u2019s chapter of the All Progressives Congress, Ade Adetimehin; and a chieftain of the APC, Chief Olusola Oke (SAN), stressed that evil will not triumph forever.\n\n\n\nAkeredolu, who wept during his speech, said the government failed to protect the victims of the terror attack.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cWe have failed to defend these people. Not because we have not tried, but because these forces on the other side are evil and they have support.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe noted that something must be done about security in the country, adding that the security architecture of the nation needs rejigging.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I see the sea of heads that are here, it speaks volumes. What has happened to us in Owo is indescribable. A lot of words are used to qualify it \u2013 dastardly, horrendous. But I still believe there are words to describe it but I am still short of those words.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have just 22 deceased in this hall. A few of them have been buried, because the relatives couldn\u2019t wait till today. But as at the last count, these animals came to the church and murdered 40 people.\u201d governor Akeredolu said.\n\n\n\nResponding, the Bishop of Ondo Catholic Diocese, Dr. Jude Arogundade declared that Akeredolu had not failed in protecting his people.\n\n\n\nBishop Arogundade said: \u201cYou didn\u2019t fail. You are a strong soldier. Your determination to protect those who voted you into power is unquestionable. This was done by cowards. You have tried your best.\u201d\n\nBishop Arogundade wondered why the people of the country need to beg for state police, despite the endless attack and killings, while thanking the governor for accepting to designate a memorial park in honour of the victims.\n\n\n\nHe stressed that those who created the situation that made the incident happen have blood on their hands.\n\nEarlier in his funeral Mass message, Catholic Bishop of Oyo Diocese, Most Rev Emmanuel Badejo called on relatives of the victims to allow God to fight their battle.\n\n\n\nBishop Badejo said: \u201cIt will not be an exaggeration at all to begin this funeral Mass with Psalm 22 where David said \u2018my God, my God, why have you forsaken me.\u2019 This is not a homily, I am not happy to preach at all, and it is not an occasion which any of you ever pray to witness in this side of the world or our country.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo doubt we all gather today in deep sorrow and mourning, for this funeral Mass for over 40 of our departed people who were brutally murdered, mindlessly massacred while at worship at St Francis Catholic Church, Owo, on Pentecost Sunday.\n\n\n\n\u201cIndeed, the event catapulted Ondo State, the Catholic Diocese of Ondo and Nigeria into the limelight of world attention, unfortunately, for the wrong reason. Since then, the world has condemned the crime perpetrated against humanity and against God in this state.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, there was no mass burial for the victims of the attack, as relatives individually took possession of the corpses and were seen taking them to their home of origin.\n\nSome of those who spoke with THISDAY said it was a taboo for an adult to be buried outside his or her home of origin.\n\n\n\nA mourner, Nwani Christopher Chudi said since the death of his brother who was the breadwinner of the family, had been a battle for survival.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cI lost somebody who was very dear to me, a senior brother, with the daughter; a promising child that we were hoping will be a person the family will depend on tomorrow. It was a tragic event on June 5 that somebody went to church and never came back.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has been a trauma because he is the breadwinner of the family. In my nuclear family, I\u2019m the only surviving son. I have only five girls that are my younger ones to attend to. He used to support us, although he was married. You know Igbo tradition, once you are married, you have a wife, your siblings, are on their own. He will face his own immediate family, even the son that survived, that they call Victor, he just miraculously survived. It was God\u2019s grace because he was inside the church while the shooting was going on but he survived. We thank God.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe wife\u2019s BP had already risen above normal; her BP was already 180/170, which is very abnormal. You know she visited the hospital the other day. On two occasions, we took her to the hospital, since then she\u2019s not eating well, she\u2019s not sleeping, the trauma is so much.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was born and brought up in Owo, I don\u2019t have a father, I don\u2019t have a mother.My daddy has died likewise my mother. My late brother has been my pillar. I\u2019m a graduate; I graduated from University of Jos in 1996, no white-collar job.\u201d\n\nTears flowed freely from relatives of the victims and sympathizers who thronged the venue of the funeral Mass.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

She had many grand and great grandchildren.\n\n\n\nGrowing up, late Princess Obaigbena was obsessed with the sight of nurses, especially their dress in immaculate white and finally had her dream when she was admitted into the school of nursing and midwifery in Ibadan and later, Benin.\n\n\n\nShe was a winner of many awards, including Best Academic Nurse in 1971 by the British High Commission and Best Practical Nurse in 1972 by the military Governor of the then Western Region.\n\nArmed with her training and adroit discharge of her duties, the late Princess rose to the position of Chief Nursing Officer in the defunct Bendel State and later transferred her services to Delta State when it was created in 1991.\n\nCondolence Messages Pour for THISDAY/Arise Chairman\n\nWithin minutes of the disclosure of Princess Obaigbena\u2019s passage, condolence messages poured in from across Nigeria for Prince Nduka Obaigbena.\n\nPresident Buhari, the Sultan of Sokoto, Sa\u2019ad Abubakar and United Nation\u2019s Deputy Secretary General, Amina Mohammed, led the way.\n\n\n\nThe list has fifteen state governors, including governors Abubakar Badaru (Jigawa); Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti State); Aminu Tambuwal (Sokoto); Atiku Bagudu (Kebbi); Babagana Zulum (Borno) and Nasir El-rufai (Kaduna).\n\nThere was also former governor of Kano State, Rabiu Kwankwaso, former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi and former Commonwealth secretary General, Emeka Anyaoku.\n\n\n\nAnyaoku wrote: \u201cDear Nduka I have just read while here in London of the passing of your mother.

We pray that her soul will rest in perfect peace.

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Like many kids who grew up with an elderly relative, Nana Ghartey was used to helping his grandmother out around the house. He was 9 years old, and they lived together in Winneba, a small town in Ghana about 65 kilometres east of the capital city of Accra. Ghartey told TechCabal that because his grandmother didn\u2019t have the best eyesight and had trouble walking around, he regularly had to support her in completing basic tasks and functions: turning the lights in her home on and off, operating the radio and TV, and dialling numbers on her mobile phone on her behalf, and helping her check her phone credit balance. Another reason Ghartey needed to assist his grandmother was that she primarily speaks Fante, a tonal language native to the Akan tribe in Ghana and had trouble understanding the Western languages predominantly used by tech devices.\n\nBut in addition to being a dutiful young boy, Ghartey was also a budding computer geek. His late mother was a programmer at Wang Computers, so even as a toddler, Ghartey was used to being surrounded by them. With time, he slowly began to teach himself how to operate them; once he learned how to type, he was able to help his mum out with small tasks on Microsoft Word.\n\nGhartey, who is now 32, told TechCabal that he credits the needs of his grandmother during his adolescence and his early exposure to computers through his mother\u2019s profession as the inspiration and catalyst, respectively, of the artificial intelligence products he created, initially to help his grandmother out, Kofi, and the one he made for the wider public, Abena. They are the first voice assistants offered in Fante and Twi, respectively.\n\nFor all the opportunities technology affords to customise experiences by catering to users\u2019 needs with hyper-specificity, millions of Africans like Ghartey\u2019s grandmother, who either don\u2019t speak English or other Westernised languages or simply prefer not to, are often excluded from these benefits. The linguistic dominance of Western languages also threatens indigenous African languages; as big, Western-based tech companies spread their influence across Africa, both as service and product providers, and as job creators, indigenous languages are often deprioritised and nudged into the background.\n\nThe invention of the first voice assistant in 1992, Radio Rex, marked an era where computers developed the ability to translate on-screen actions or words into text. By 2010, the wealthiest American tech companies had launched language technologies: Siri was released that year, Google Now in 2012, and Alexa in 2014. But these voice technologies support only Western languages and are unavailable in African languages because of the low-revenue opportunities in African markets.\n\nIt\u2019s not as though these behemoth tech companies lack the means to build products that support indigenous African languages. And, to be fair, some have made efforts to catch up, slowly but surely, like Google Translate\u2019s addition of 10 African languages to the platform last month. Some language experts argue that these companies are the only entities, along with robust AI labs (though often the two are linked), that can solve what they characterise as a \u201clow resources\u201d problem.\n\nGhartey has his own theories about that.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they can\u2019t build such systems for African languages. Surely they can,\u201d he told TechCabal from Accra, where he now lives. \u201cThey\u2019ve prioritised the languages that they want to focus on first.\u201d\n\nSo rather than wait for big tech to do all of the problem solving, he\u2019s been working towards a solution for nearly a decade\u2014with a much smaller team and significantly fewer resources\u2014and has already made headway.\n\n\u201cWorking on voice tech for African languages has been a completely different ball game. Data set out there are based on religious text, so you end up building a system that has a bias for biblical words.\u201d\n\nBy the time Ghartey reached his teenage years, he was consumed by a desire to learn as much about computers as he could. In high school, he was the designated tech guy, often helping his classmates do things like connect to the internet on their phones. (This was 2005 when such functions weren\u2019t yet second nature.) Sometimes, because he wasn\u2019t allowed to use the campus computer lab, he skipped class and sneaked off to internet caf\u00e9s just to spend more time tinkering with them, he recalled to TechCabal. After years spent assisting his grandmother, he had become accustomed to using his skills to help anyone who needed it.\n\nHe still graduated, though, and went on to study Information Technology at the Ghana Telecom University in Accra. But Ghartey taught himself mobile app development and built desktop applications, websites, and eventually mobile games, none of which were part of his school curriculum, by reading the programming textbooks which an uncle who came visiting from the US had left behind. By the time graduation came around, Ghartey graduated top of his class and secured a scholarship to do a master\u2019s in software development, in a partnership programme between his alma mater in Accra and Coventry University, UK.\n\nHis prolonged stay in Accra meant that he would not be able to go back home to continue helping his grandmother. For a while, his younger sister stepped in to assist her, but eventually she moved out, too. Even after Ghartey received his master\u2019s, he stay back in Accra and went on to build his mobile app development company, Mobobi LLC. But he knew he needed to come up with a solution to assist his grandmother in operating her tech devices and performing little chores, and quickly. After years of obsessive learning about computers, he knew the solution would be AI-driven, but at the time, he knew nothing about AI development.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. I remember the sleepless nights reading research papers and benchmarking frameworks and tools to find the right solution for my grandmother. I knew that if I intended to bootstrap and ship a production build to the masses, I\u2019d need to further hone my skills in AI, so I set on a mission to educate myself on what was required, \u201d Ghartey told TechCabal.\n\nFirst, he addressed the most immediate need: that of his grandmother. Using her voice and that of his sister\u2019s as data, he built Kofi, a voice assistant that supported Fante, his grandmother\u2019s preferred language and one spoken by 6 million Ghanaians. The product enabled her to use mobile apps without having to scroll through the home screen, which was difficult for her due to her impaired vision. All she had to do was tap the side of the button to launch the Kofi app, and she could instantly receive news updates, play music, stream radio programmes, and follow Twitter trends\u2014curated by the AI with human moderators to prevent misinformation\u2014without having a Twitter account\n\nGhartey said that when he introduced her to Kofi and asked her to try it out, she initially thought she was interacting with a real person and became frustrated at times when the voice assistant didn\u2019t comply with some of her commands. Ghartey had to explain to her some of Kofi\u2019s limitations, but that process helped him recognise how useful a native voice assistant could be for the wider public. In order to serve them, he would need to build a voice assistant in Ghana\u2019s most widely spoken language: Twi.\n\nThis would prove to be a much larger undertaking than Kofi. First of all, Ghartey didn\u2019t have nearly as much data to work with initially, and he already knew the next iteration would require a large data set so that he could offer the product in several different dialects in order to avoid bias toward certain intonations. Secondly, Twi, like many other languages in the south of the Sahara, is tonal; accent marks dictate tones and make a difference in communication, which demanded even more research.\n\nAnother important factor to consider was access. In Winneba, where he lived with his grandmother, internet connection was patchy and inconsistent. Ghartey didn\u2019t want his users to worry about constantly having to purchase data in order to use the app, which meant that Abena would need to function offline. (For context, with Apple\u2019s Siri, this offline feature is only available to users with iOS 15.) Abena\u2019s offline operation was also an effort to cut costs on his end; online operation would have required a server that processed thousands of user requests from users in real time, and thus enormous computing power from costly cloud servers.\n\nBut Ghartey knew his efforts would be worth it. He spent 6 years building Abena AI, and released it in the Google Play Store this April as a Mobobi product. (At that point, Mobobi had already gained some traction for Real Piano Teacher, a popular game that has amassed more than 20 million downloads and is the first Ghanaian-made game on Google Play Pass.) Just like the features offered on Kofi, users can check trending news on Twitter; follow weather reports; check, transfer, and recharge their airtime balances; and transfer money with their preferred mobile payment app, all using voice commands on Abena AI. The offline mode also supports an in-app community feature that allows users to send text messages, images, and videos with each other.\n\nThe reception was immediately enthusiastic. Just a few days after launching Abena AI, a health influencer shared a demo of the app on Twitter, which catapulted it to trending topic popularity and demonstrated the need of a voice assistant offered in a language that was the second most spoken in the country after English.\n\nSimilar to the way his grandmother benefitted from Kofi, Ghartey realised that in addition to being more linguistically inclusive, Abena AI also served people with visual impairments who speak or preferred to speak Twi, many of whom were elders. They became fast fans of Abena AI, he said, because it made it easier for them to check and recharge their credits from their phones, which otherwise required tech-savviness or Western language literacy.\n\nOnce Abena AI was out in the world, it was time to refine it, a task that turned out to be just as challenging as building the voice assistant in the first place. He couldn\u2019t afford to pay professional linguists to help him with the training data for Twi, so he crowdsourced translation data from users by using third-party pop-up apps that requested translations. That proved unsuccessful when he discovered that the responses users provided were either inaccurate, or complete diversions of the words he asked them to translate. He tried incentivising users by offering to pay 5 cedis ($0.6) per translation, which worked for a while, but eventually he ran out of money. He remained tenacious, though, and eventually hired religious translators who worked on church-related translations in Twi. Still, he said he is always on the lookout for more ways to gather information about the language.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a work in progress,\u201d he said, adding that he accounts for the context of every word and crowdsources information about dialects from Abena AI app users. \u201cYou need lots of data to build these models.\u201d\n\nLike Google Nest and Amazon Echo\u2014both hardware using their respective company\u2019s voice recognition software\u2014Abena also functions as a home automation system. Abena AI works with smart lights, smart plugs, and other smart home devices.\n\nIn the nearest future, Ghartey is looking to ship an update that will see Abena support 5 more Ghanaian languages and hire professional natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning engineers to speed up his work and help him ship updates to other African languages like Swahili, Kinyarwanda, Afrikaans, Sesotho, and isiZulu.\n\nGhartey works on Abena AI for 3 hours on workdays, while working full time at his company Mobobi, to allow him to keep bootstrapping it.\n\n\u201cThe feedback from a few people who tried Abena AI out before it was released kept us going. That smile on a 60-year-old\u2019s face as he listened to his airtime being read out without stress\u2014it was paving the way for people to perform tasks easily, tasks they\u2019d never been able to do in the past,\u201d Ghartey said.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This article was co-authored by Koromone Koroye, Hannatu Asheloge, and Ngozi Chukwu\n\nAfrica\u2019s technology ecosystem as we know it is thriving and primed for astronomical growth and success in this decade. Over the past 5 years, our ecosystem has celebrated several key milestones:\n\nExits and acquisitions in the millions.\n\nImpressive funding rounds ranging from seed to Series C.\n\nThe arrival of new angel investors and venture funds eager to serve African entrepreneurs.\n\nBusiness and product expansions into multiple regions within Africa.\n\nWhile these milestones are valid and deserve amplification, we cannot ignore the diversity elephant in our meeting rooms, tech conferences, pitch stages, and panel sessions. Funding received by female-owned startups is still significantly low compared to what their male counterparts receive from foreign and local investors. In this widely-read piece by Max Culliver and Africa: The Big Deal, they paint a gloomy picture of existing gender disparities within Africa\u2019s venture funding space. In 2021, 93% of the funding in Africa went to male-led startups \u2013 a pretty shocking figure by any standard.\n\nBut the news isn\u2019t all doom and gloom. This year alone, we\u2019ve seen more African female founders raise capital for their startups and get accepted into reputable accelerators like Techstars Toronto Accelerator (Techstars Toronto) and Y Combinator (YC). This article aims to recognize some African female founders making great strides across various industries and sectors on the continent.\n\nThis list comprises women who are mothers, advocates, readers, dancers, hikers, swimmers, entrepreneurs, founders, and so much more.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "At a time when central banks around the world are mounting desperate battles to contain inflation, in Nigeria it could be a case of the country\u2019s central bank fanning embers of spiralling inflation, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, EIU and economists at the World Bank.\n\nThe EIU in particular said the central bank might have been breaking the law which stipulates a limit beyond which it shall lend to government.\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank tightened monetary policy with a 150-basis point hike last month, supposedly to attain its 9% inflation target, but the same central bank has continued to directly finance government deficit in an unbridled manner, the economists say.\n\nWhen central banks around the world tighten monetary policy the primary goal is to curtail money supply, but there is a curious case in Nigeria where the central bank is tightening monetary policy and at the same time pumping more money into the system by deficit financing and by its development finance initiatives says the World Bank.\n\nAccording a report published Saturday by the EIU, \u201cthe CBN has continued to print money for the federal government, whose overdraft facility with the CBN reached N19trn (US$46bn) in April 2022, up from N17.4trn at end-2021. The CBN is also operating a range of direct lending schemes for the agricultural, manufacturing and energy sectors, currently totalling about N3.6trn (US$9bn).\u201d\n\nThe EIU said the ability of the CBN to tame Nigeria\u2019s inflation through raising rates is being undermined by its continued direct financing of the budget deficit. \u201cBuilding credibility in the target rate (of inflation) has not been a priority in recent years. The continued printing of money at the same time as tightening policy would prevent effective control of the price level,\u201d the EIU said.\n\nNigeria has rules that limit how much lending the central bank should offer the government and there are statutes that forbid the government from reckless borrowing, but the EIU inferred that these rules have been contravened repeatedly.\n\n\u201cAll prudential rules on the government borrowing through the (CBN\u2019s) overdraft facility have long been broken,\u201d the EIU said in its report.\n\nInflation is expected to continue to surge in Nigeria especially with elevated food prices rising by 19.5% year on year in May, but the EIU says the CBN\u2019s tolerance of high inflation over the years leading up to the rate hike in May has also made the task of resetting expectations far harder and. \u201cIt seems highly plausible that the CBN will continue financing a widening budget deficit through the overdraft facility,\u201d the EIU predicted, saying, \u201cif the overdraft gets larger, it would be a clear sign that the CBN is politically unable or unwilling to take a clear stance on inflation and the anchoring of expectations.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank on its part says the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s development finance intervention is fuelling inflation in the short term and weakening the ability of the apex bank to control inflation.\n\nIt argues that the CBN\u2019s continued provision of subsidised funding to certain sectors has to slow down as it is undermining the ability of commercial banks to lend on a risk-adjusted pricing basis. It added that the apex bank\u2019s disbursement in the private sector as its share of private sector credit rose from 6.5 per cent in 2019 to 10 per cent in 2021.\n\nIn a new report titled the \u2018Nigeria Development Update (June 2022): The Continuing Urgency of Business Unusual, the World Bank said, \u201cCBN disbursements are growing in funding the private sector, with the CBN\u2019s share of private sector credit rising from about 6.5 per cent at end-2019 to 10 per cent by end-2021.\n\nAlthough some of the COVID-related tools deployed by the CBN are being phased out (e.g., the moratorium on principal repayments on CBN-funded credits lapsed in March 2022), the Central Bank has introduced new intervention facilities without a publicly available evaluation of their impact.\u201d\n\nRead also: CBN, banks, NPA to fix export bottlenecks in 90 days\n\nOn Nigeria\u2019s lingering foreign exchange crisis, the EIU said, \u201cthe naira continues to weaken on the parallel market, which is an important indicator for inflation as the parallel market is widely used by businesses and individuals.\n\n\u201cForeign reserves have been relatively steady over the course of 2022, dropping by only 5%, but in terms of import cover are down considerably as a result of high international prices for food and fuel, especially. EIU projects import cover of 5.9 months in 2022, down from 7.2 months in 2021.\n\n\u201cThe CBN\u2019s inflexible currency regime and constrained ability to intervene have left it unable to meet the demand for hard currency on time or in full. Firms and individuals often have to turn to the parallel market, where the US dollar traded for N600:US$1 in early June, a 45% premium on the official NAFEX rate.\u201d",

          "title": "How to lead in a multicultural organisation",
          "text": "Leading any culturally diverse organisation or group requires cultural intelligence. But the problem is increased in large multinational organisations with subsidiaries in many countries. Typically, there are organisational requirements for central control and uniformity to ensure that the organisation remains stable and that subsidiaries work toward a common goal. But major problems emerge when such organisations attempt to manage their diverse communities of people uniformly.\n\nManaging diversity is a positive goal for multinationals, but the means of achieving it need to be locally specific and probably locally devised. In international organisations, a helpful guide for managing diversity is the simple notion of thinking and acting locally.\n\nAlso important in this case is the question, who is the leader?\n\nThere is a difference between formal leadership, that is, with a formally appointed leader who has an appropriate job title and informal leadership, in which someone has leadership status because of the respect of others.\n\nIn multicultural situations, it is probably best not to model your leadership behaviour after a leader in the follower\u2019s culture\n\nMeanwhile, informal leaders arise because their ideas or behaviour are well received by others and because of their good communication skills. Ideally, the formal and informal leaders are the same person. However, a formal leader from another culture may not be accepted in a multicultural situation because of cultural differences, particularly in expected leadership methods. An informal leader from the home culture representing the ideas of local employees may exercise countervailing influence. Formal leaders may therefore have to either exercise a leadership style that fits local expectations or be able to work with the informal leader.\n\nDifferent cultures also have different prototypes of what a leader should be like. A leader who can meet followers\u2019 expectations of a good leader can develop better trust and quality relationships.\n\nFrom the foregoing, it is evident that anyone in a group, and not just the formal boss, has the potential to be a leader. In most groups, leadership is at least partially shared. Further, the exercise of leadership implies a duty of followers to follow. Therefore, in multicultural groups and organisations, becoming culturally intelligent is an advantage to the follower as well as to the leader. Being able to read one\u2019s formal leader and colleagues, considering their national culture, is an advantage.\n\nMaking sense of leadership is difficult enough, even without the complication of cultural differences. While there is no universally effective prescription for leading culturally diverse followers, there are some things we can say for sure that culturally intelligent leaders know and do. They are as follows:\n\n1. Leadership is largely in the minds of followers. If followers perceive a person as a leader, they will gain the power, authority, and respect afforded a leader.\n\n2. Followers expect leaders to have\n\ni. a vision for the group or organisation,\n\nii. the ability to communicate this vision clearly and\n\niii. skill in organising followers toward the vision. However, some behaviours indicate that these characteristics differ among cultures.\n\n3. The leadership dimensions of task orientation and relationship exist in every culture, but the behaviours that indicate these orientations are specific to different cultures.\n\n4. Some followers need more leading along each of these dimensions than others. Factors such as organisational norms and the education levels of followers can act as substitutes for leadership. For example, a group of lawyers typically needs very little task orientation from their leader: they already know what to do.\n\n5. Trying to mimic the behaviours of a leader belonging to the followers\u2019 culture may lead to unintended consequences. Some adoption of these behaviours will gain a leader\u2019s acceptance by the followers, but too much may be interpreted as insincere or even offensive.\n\nRead also: Trustworthy leadership\n\n6. In essence, if you want to be a culturally astute leader, you will need to use knowledge and mindfulness to develop a repertoire of behaviours that can be adapted to specific situations. Doing so involves knowledge of the likely expectations of culturally diverse followers based on generalisations from cultural values such as individualism and collectivism. Through mindful observation, you will gradually refine these expectations. You will also need knowledge of your own preferred style of leadership. What balance of task and relationship feels normal to you? Will you work harder to be a relational leader if the situation calls for it?\n\nYou will also need knowledge of the relevant organisational norms. Trying to be a participative leader in a culture that does not value participation can be counter-productive. Here mindfulness includes paying attention to followers\u2019 reactions to particular leadership behaviours and adjusting as necessary.\n\nIn multicultural situations, it is probably best not to model your leadership behaviour after a leader in the follower\u2019s culture. You may look silly trying to behave and sound like Obama, especially if you are not American and may find that follower expectations of indigenous leaders may be very different from their expectations of you. Also, in multicultural groups, followers can have very different expectations. Therefore, a better role model is a leader like you, someone from your own culture, which has been particularly effective with these followers.\n\nThe needs of followers are critical in determining an individual\u2019s perceptions of leadership. A culturally astute leader can find a leadership style that strikes a balance between their typical style, the expectations of followers, and the demands of the situation. This balance may well be imperfect, a work in progress. As with surfing, skiing, or cycling, finding this balance is initially tricky but becomes easier and feels more natural over time.",

Justice I.E Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja over his abuse and disobedience to laid down rules and regulations guiding the conduct of judicial officers in the course of their duty is receiving attention by the Investigation Department of the Code of Conduct Bureau, Abuja.\n\nMr. Peter Omoruyi Igbinedion who in his petition titled: Monday Iyore Osagie & ORS.V PDP &ORS, Suit No. PHC/ABJ/CS/ 598/2022 addressed to the Chairman of the Code of Conduct Bureau, CCB, in Abuja stated that \u201che has suffered terrible pains in connection with Justice Ekwo\u2019s breach of the Code of Conduct for public officers anchored on his unlawful acquisition of monetary benefits while performing his official duties\u201d.\n\nHe noted that \u201cas a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, his right has been affected by Justice Ekwo\u2019s grant of frivolous exparte orders, which conflict with the provisions of the CCB and Tribunal Act, saying it is unheard of that different ex-parte orders will be given on the same issue just for justice to be allowed to suffer untold abuse for monetary benefits.\n\nAccording to the petitioner: \u201d I Mr. Peter Omoruyi Igbinedion, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ward 12, Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State write this petition against Hon. Justice l.E Ekwo, of the Federal High Court, Abuja. That Hon. Justice l. E Ekwo had through his relationship with the Governor of Rivers State, His Excellency Barr, Nyesom Wike created crisis and division in Edo State chapter of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe PDP\u201d) in preparation of the 2023 general elections via the grant of ex-parte orders in lieu of financial consideration.\n\n\u201d Governor Wike allies in Edo State led by one Chief Dan Orbih, the National Vice Chairman of the PDP South South, kept running to Hon. Justice Ekwo\u2019s Court to truncate the activities of Edo PDP in preparation for the 2023 general elections by faulting and frustrating the legitimate activities of the party and legalizing the illegitimate activities of Governor Wike\u2019s allies in Edo State through frivolous exparte orders. His Lordship conduct above in my opinion violates Rule 1.4 of the Code of Conduct which states;\n\n\u201cThat the judge must be sensitive to the need to avoid contacts that may lead people to speculate that there is a special relationship between him and someone whom the judge maybe tempted to favour in some way in the course of his judicial duties\u201d.\n\nIgbinedion noted that the conduct of Hon. Justice Ekwo has presently placed the fate of Edo PDP in confusion, as the National Working Committee of his party is in possession of 2 separate results emanating from the just concluded PDP ward, Local Government Delegate Congresses and primaries in Edo State.\n\n\u201d One result from the Edo State PDP supervised by the National office of the PDP and another result from Chief Dan Orbih faction backed by Barr. Nyesom Wike and endorsed by Justice Ekwo.\n\n\u201d The National office of the PDP is presently in confusion thanks to the conducts of Hon. Justice Ekwo, which is characterized by the frivolous ex-parte orders he was granting in favour of Chief Dan Orbih\u2019s faction against the PDP in respect of the conduct of PDP congresses and primaries, which is in violation of Rule 3.5 of the Code of Conduct, which States;\n\n\u201cA judicial officer must avoid the abuse of the power of issuing interim injunctions, ex-parte\u201d.\n\n\u201cAfter the conduct of the Party Ward Congresses across various Wards in Edo State, Chief Dan Orbih and his team being dissatisfied with the outcome of the congresses, instead of approaching the appeal panel set up by the National Working Committee of PDP, rushed to Hon. Justice Ekwo\u2019s Court to obtain a restraining order through ex-parte application against the PDP from recognizing and accepting its own results. Justice delivered violates the principles of judicial precedent and the provisions of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution, as amended and the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act\u201d, he said.\n\nThe following are the other allegations against him:\n\n\u201d That in the light of the foregoing, Hon. Justice Ekwo is believed to have received certain financial inducements, which was obtained through third parties but now forms part of his personal assets, contrary to the contents of his assets declaration form with the Bureau and therefore abused his Judicial office for financial gains.\n\n\u201d That contrary to the provisions of Paragraph II of Part 1 of the Fifth Schedule of the 1999 Nigeria Constitution, as amended, Hon. Justice Ekwo being a public officer failed, refused and/or neglected to properly declare both his real and personal assets within the last four years and failed to submit himself for asset verification\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cThat there is urgent need for the verification of the items in the asset declaration form of Hon. Justice I.E Ekwo, presently in the custody of the Bureau.\n\n\u201d That Hon. Justice I.E Ekwo of Court No. 5 of the Federal High Court, Abuja be investigated for all the above allegations and if found wanting, be consequently prosecuted before the Code of Conduct Tribunal.\n\n\u201d Ekwo hastily ordered PDP to use and recognize the list/ result prepared by Chief Dan Orbih and his allies. Even though there was an earlier order from the Edo State High Court validating the result of the PDP Ward congresses across the State. Vide Victor Enoghama & ors .v. PDP & ors, Suit No. B/408/2022.\n\n\u201d His Lordship Order was in contradiction to the earlier order of the Edo State High Court on the same subject matter and also operated as appeal against the earlier Order of the Edo State High Court\u201d, he said.\n\nHe reiterated that the subject matter and material facts contained in the earlier judgment of the Edo State High Court is on all fours with the suit before Hon. Justice Ekwo and it was the outcome of the judgment of the Benin High Court that paved way for the conduct of the various Party primaries in Edo State ranging from House of Assembly, House of Representatives and Senate.\n\n\u201d It was after the conduct of the said party primaries that Hon. Justice Ekwo delivered a contradictory judgment invalidating the Party primaries already conducted. He further validated the results of the parallel primaries of Chief Dan Orbih\u2019s faction. Again, His Lordship sat as an appellate court against the Judgment of Edo State High Court, which is contrary to Rule 5 of the Code of Conduct for judicial officers, thereby exposing the dignity of the judiciary to public ridicule and tarnishing the public confidence and impartiality of the judiciary.\n\n\u201d Rule 5 states inter alia; \u201ca judge shall always conduct himself in such manner as to preserve the dignity of the judicial office and the impartiality and independence of the judiciary.

Peter Efosa Osakue hailed the Judiciary and its use of soft copies during the filing process which he noted was a new innovation. He informed that by the use of CD\u2019s the process was more dynamic by causing less stress to judges. He nonetheless called lawyers to be computer literate to cut down on turning in blank documents CD\u2019s to judges.\n\nGoing further, he called on the executives arm of government to grant financial autonomy to the judiciary to make it independent. He also sued for increased salaries and allowances for Judges.\n\nNBA Chairman, Pius Oiwor while speaking on irregularities bedeviling the judiciary touched on the issue of financial autonomy, which he said was guaranteed by the constitution. He said it was a concept that was most welcome, also needed in the legislature to make for ease of carrying out their constitutional roles.\n\nBarr. Douglas Ogbankwa called on the judiciary to walk the talk. They should apply technology in the arbitration of justice especially in the use of teleconferencing. He posited that there was no reason why the courts couldn\u2019t have zoom trials for instance, in this time and age, where there is use of advanced technology. Making reference to the valedictory speech of Hon. Justice Esther Amenaghanwon Edigin, he quoted, \u201cLet the executive take the nail from the neck of the judiciary so that it can breath.\u201d\n\nHe said the judiciary should do more and stop ruling against itself when suits concerning the autonomy of the judiciary come up for hearing.\n\nIt is worthy of note that most lawyers unanimously sued for an amendment of the filing process, frowning at shouldering costs for filing of judicial processes, documentation (kilo) and added burden of mobilizing bailiffs adequately for optimal service delivery.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

That would be leading to further division.\u201d\n\nHe added that as a party craving to rebuild the nation, taking the right decisions that would foster unity of the nation was very important to the PDP.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about rebuilding this nation and our unity. So, to a very large extent, we have to take the right decisions, and having submitted myself to be a member of the PDP, I would have to submit myself to the decisions of the party and that is what has happened.\n\n\u201cThat does not mean a disrespect to the views of those leaders. They are leaders that I respect so much. But under this condition, they have to understand that I have committed myself to the PDP.\n\n\u201cI am a politician. If I am not, it may be different. So, I will have to play along to the collective decisions of the party and I want to appeal to them that they need to actually look at the issue as it is and be very cautious about the stands that we take.\n\n\u201cEvery statement we make, even while it is important that we make our decisions, it is important that we also realise that the unity of this nation is important and we need to move forward from whereever we are at the moment,\u201d Okowa said.\n\nOn adding strength to the presidential ticket of the PDP, he said that he was acceptable to the structures of the party across the nation having been in the party since inception and grown through political ranks.\n\n\u201cI am somebody who is a team-player which is very important for us, and we have various experiences in various elections before now.\n\n\u201cThough I am a governor, I have grown through the political ranks and I have played very critical roles in the party at some point in time.\n\n\u201cI believe that a combination of all these will enable me assist the presidential candidate of the party and the rest of the party leadership to be able to put up the right strategy for us to win the elections,\u201d he explained.\n\nOkowa said that he had a very clear understanding of what the issues in the polity were and how to navigate through them.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cI have a very clear understanding of the issues that have been put forth by our candidate and in terms of governance, I have been privileged to have started my politics at the grassroots.\n\n\u201cMy being in the Senate exposed me to national politics and issues of national development and I have been relating well with my colleagues as a governor in the last seven years, discussing what is best for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAll of these exposures are huge advantage, understanding grassroots and national politics and I think that will obviously enable me add strength to the ticket,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn unifying the party, Okowa said that he had started reaching out to his colleagues and other leaders of the party and that he was encouraged by the response so far.",

          "text": "Experts in the nations financial sector have identified gaps in the set objectives by the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, to significantly reduce the number and percentage of adult Nigerians who are excluded from the formal Financial System of the country.\n\nSpeaking at the inaugural conference of Oriental News Nigeria with theme \u201cEngaging with critical groups to develop effective financial inclusion initiative\u201d which held on Thursday at the Sheraton hotel Ikeja Lagos, Dr Uju Ogubunka, CEO Bank Customers Association of Nigeria, stated that the financial inclusion policy of the federal government which commenced in 2012 is geared towards ensuring that no Nigerian is short changed in its financial intermediations policies and economic development plans.\n\nOgubunka said that the government then out of the 84 percent financially excluded population, targeted to achieve 20 percent financial inclusion by year 2020.\n\n\u201cThe adult population has now increased above 84 percent and the un banked population has also increased remarkably. If the people are outside the financial system, the economy will not develop\u201d Ogubunka stated.\n\nHe explained that financial inclusion commences with opening bank account, which factors in the account holder towards benefiting from all forms of government\u2019s financial support as the account drives all other transactions of the account holder.\n\nAlso, to have insurance policy, investment accounts in the capital market, pension account and all forms of life and business enabling transactions driven only by the nation\u2019s financial system, you need to be financially included, he stressed.\n\n\u201cAs some of us will remember, the CBN initiated the National Financial Inclusion Programme in year 2012 that is, about a decade ago. The Programme is kind of a response to the discovery from a study in 2010 that about 39.2 million or 46.3% of the then 84.7 million adult population in the country were excluded from the formal Nigerian Financial System.\n\n\u201cThat meant that 45.5 million or 53.7% of the 84.7 million were included in the system. It was also noted that of the excluded 39.2 million adult Nigerians, about 21.3 million or 54.4% were females; meaning that about 17.9 million (i.e. 45.6%) were males. So, females accounted for a higher number and percentage of the excluded than males. On the other hand, males accounted for a higher number and percentage of those included in the Nigerian Financial System.\u201d he stated.\n\nOgubunka, pointed that the above situations were identified to have negative/adverse consequences/implications for the financial system and the economy, especially as almost half of the financial resources in the country were in the hands of people operating outside the formal financial system.\n\nHe said, \u201cConsequent on the foregoing, the CBN saw the need to redress it. Thus, it floated the Financial Inclusion programme and supported it with a Strategy Document tagged \u201dNational Financial Inclusion Strategy\u201d that encapsulated, among many othe\n\nthings, the Strategy Objectives, Strategy Stakeholders and their Interests, and Key Financial Inclusion Targets. The initiative targeted a reduction of the rate of the excluded from 46.3% to 20% come year 2020. ( i.e. a reduction of 26.3%), meaning that the percentage of the included would rise to 80% from 53.7% within the same period.\u201d\n\nHe said, Stanmeg Communication publishers of Oriental News, Nigeria, have provided this platform for the audience here gathered to brainstorm and contribute towards achieving total inclusion of all eligible adult Nigerians in the Financial System in order to drive and attain higher growth and development in both the Financial System and the National Economy, for the benefit of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI am impressed with this provided opportunity and therefore Congratulate the Organisers for their initiative which is worthy of emulation. By this, they have shown that they are concerned and serious minded stakeholders in the Nigerian Financial System and of colours, the economy.\u201d\n\nThe guest speaker, Mallam Garba Kurfi, Managing Director APT Securities and Fubds Limited buttressed that financial inclusion policy of the government helps to ensures that funds that could have been deployed for entrepreneurial initiatives don\u2019t end up in cupboards at homes.\n\nManaging Director; CEO Arms Securities Limited, Mr Rotimi Edu, representing Mallam Kufre, in his presentation said that the government is recording remarkable progress in the financial inclusion target, adding more hands are on deck to ensure that economic advantage of the country\u2019s large population translates to financial benefits to the people and institutions.\n\nThe government, he stated has designed financial support initiatives for rural women, artisans, petty traders, the financially disadvantaged, which can only be extended to only people who operates bank accounts.\n\nHe said that funds are aggregated through savings in banks, investments in capital market or taking policies in insurance companies, such funds are further deployed to catalize economic development through lending or for institutional growth.\n\nEarlier in her opening address, Editor Oriental News Nigeria , Mrs Yemisi Izuora said that the conference was conceived by Stanmeg Communications, publishers of Oriental News Nigeria after a pain staking study the progress and prospects of the financial inclusion policy in the country since inception in 2012.\n\n\u201c The conference is being organised given that the past couple of years , the federal government and stakeholders in the financial sector have had to deal with expanding financial services tp large community of underserved pupulation and dealing with resilience challenges brought about by confluence of events that have taken place\u201d Izuora stated.\n\nExecutive Director, Centre for Citizens with Disability (CCD) David O. Anyaele however called on the federal government as well as the Central bank of Nigeria (CBN) to expand the nation\u2019s financial inclusion policy to include provisioning for the disabled people in the society.\n\nHe bemoaned the sustained lack of considerations for the disabled in the Nigerian financial system through different kinds of neglect and rights denials.\n\nAnyaele stated that audit of bank branches across the country showed the total absence or lack of access and convenience facilities for the disabled.\n\nHe admonished prevailing attitudes of the financial systems against the disabled, describing it as major institutional barrier to financial inclusion",
          "summary": "\u201cAs some of us will remember, the CBN initiated the National Financial Inclusion Programme in year 2012 that is, about a decade ago.\nOgubunka, pointed that the above situations were identified to have negative/adverse consequences/implications for the financial system and the economy, especially as almost half of the financial resources in the country were in the hands of people operating outside the formal financial system.\nThus, it floated the Financial Inclusion programme and supported it with a Strategy Document tagged \u201dNational Financial Inclusion Strategy\u201d that encapsulated, among many othethings, the Strategy Objectives, Strategy Stakeholders and their Interests, and Key Financial Inclusion Targets.\nHe bemoaned the sustained lack of considerations for the disabled in the Nigerian financial system through different kinds of neglect and rights denials.\nHe admonished prevailing attitudes of the financial systems against the disabled, describing it as major institutional barrier to financial inclusion",

Babajide Sanwo-Olu and the political leaders of the State for believing in the private sector. What we are witnessing today attests to their beliefs in the private sector as a driver of development in the State\n\n\u201cFor the private sector to do well, the political leadership must create the right environment. Lagos has set the pace in this direction. This partnership is a celebration of dialogue and this makes Lagos remain the most hospitable environment for investors.\u201d\n\nBabajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, said the construction flag-off ended a decade-long discussion with the developer to revive the project and build iconic towers that would turn around the fallow land for the benefit of the public.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is a phenomenal project that will bring back the lost ambience of Ikoyi. When this partnership was initiated 10 years ago, I was the Managing Director of LSDPC. It is interesting to note that we\u2019ve all gone through arbitration but we didn\u2019t throw a wrong punch. We agreed this project must not be thrown away. Today we are making a transaction that is bigger and better than what was initially proposed 10 years ago.\n\n\u201cThis testifies to the uniqueness of public and private sectors in ensuring things can be made a lot better when we sit and agree. This is a clear example of what Public Private Partnership (PPP) model is out to achieve when partnerships and collaborations are pursued and implemented with seriousness. When we put our minds of possibilities to ideas, great things happen. This aptly describes the story of today\u2019s flag-off of construction of Falomo Towers.\u201d\n\nThe Governor added that the State Government would remain committed to ensuring the investors get full value for their investments while promising to continue to pursue business environment reforms, including automation of land and property records to scale up transparency and efficiency that catalyse sustainable investments.",

          "text": "As the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday Friday 17 June, 2022 shut down its candidate nomination portal for the 2023 general elections, there has been an uneasy calm in the nation following the failure of the Commission to announce the names of the nominated candidates for the polls.\n\nThe political parties themselves also made no attempt to present their vice presidential nominees, who are meant to help them win over voters in the presidential election, to the public.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe presidential candidate of the nation\u2019s major opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, has however shown to be the most organized naming a running after a rigorous process within the party and presenting him to the public in a campaign-style event.\n\nAtiku picked Delta State governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as his running mate.\n\nThe pressure from Northern stakeholders within the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) swayed the presidential running mate position in favour of the Delta State governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, LEADERSHIP Weekend gathered yesterday.\n\nIt was learnt that after an advisory committee on Tuesday, leaned in favour of Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, PDP presidential candidate, former vice president Atiku Abubakar, after a late night meeting with some stakeholders within the party, opted for Okowa.\n\nBesides Okowa and Wike, the Akwa Ibom State governor, Udom Emmanuel, was also in contention for the vice presidential ticket which was unofficial zoned to the South South.\n\nIt was learnt that the leaders preferred Okowa because he was considered more acceptable in the North. They also leveraged on his candidacy being appealing to the South East zone.\n\nA source told LEADERSHIP weekend that Wike had won over most of the advisory committee members who were more interested in the political sagacity of the Rivers State governor.\n\nHowever, for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and its presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, LEADERSHIP Weekend gathered that it has narrowed down the search for a vice presidential candidate to the North East geopolitical zone. However, the name of the vice presidential candidate of the APC is yet to be determined.\n\nTinubu has however submitted his duly completed nomination forms to the INEC, with Kabiru Masari\u2019s name as his running mate.\n\nHis campaign team confirmed yesterday that Tinubu returned the forms on Wednesday, June 15, two days ahead of schedule, in compliance with the Electoral Law and Guidelines.\n\n\u201cWe wish to reiterate that HE As\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa Tinubu now stands ready to contest the February 25, 2023 presidential election to deliver progressive good governance to our people\u201d, spokesman to Tinubu, Tunde Rahman stated.\n\nAs a chieftain of the APC from Katsina state, Alhaji Kabiru Faskari, also confirmed the name of Ibrahim Kabir Masari as the vice presidential candidate of the party.\n\nSpeaking on a Channels Television programme monitored yesterday, Faskari said, \u201cIbrahim Kabir Masari is our vice presidential nominee and he was the National Welfare Secretary of the APC under Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. He is a well known politician\u201d.\n\nOn whether Masari\u2019s name had been uploaded to the INEC candidates nomination portal, Faskari said, \u201cYes, his name has been submitted\u201d.\n\nRevealing Masari\u2019s identity, he said, \u201cWell, he qualifies as a veteran in terms of politics. He began as a member of the Peoples Democratic Party PDP. He is young and represents the youth. He is grounded in politics because he was even a national officer of the APC.\n\n\u201cHe is quiet close to the presidential candidate because because he has been with him for a long time and I believe it is a very informed decision to put out his name\u201d.\n\nFaskari further noted that the decision was entirely that of the presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu having consulted with President Muhammadu Buhari, state governors and the national leadership of the party.\n\nHe said though Masari may not have been very popular in the sense of being a state governor or cabinet minister, but that \u201che is very known to us in the APC\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Michael Kasarachi Enyinna has emerged as the running mate of Prince Malik Ado-Ibrahim. He will be the Vice Presidential Candidate of the Young Progressives Party in the 2023 Presidential election.\n\nThe nation\u2019s electoral body earlier warned political parties that its candidate nomination portal for the 2023 general elections would automatically shut down at 6:00 pm on June 17 for national elections and 6:00 pm on July 15 for state elections.\n\nThe INEC chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, who gave the warning at the commission\u2019s meeting with Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) added that \u201call political parties are required to upload the details of their candidates for each constituency to the INEC Candidate Nomination Portal (ICNP).\u201d\n\nPeter Obi picks Okupe as running mate to beat deadline\n\nApparently to beat the deadline set by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for political parties to submit names of their candidates for the 2023 General Elections, the Labour Party (LP) on Friday named veteran politician, Dr Doyin Okupe as its Vice Presidential candidate.\n\nSpeaking to Channels TV on Friday, Okupe who is the director-general of the Peter obi Campaign said: \u201cChoosing the vices presidential candidate is an electoral process and it does not stop until the process and schedule ends.\n\n\u201cINEC allows you to present a candidate and later on, if you want to substitute, you may do so, if necessary. But if it\u2019s not necessary, you may as well continue.\n\n\u201cSo the present situation is that we believe that this Labour party government that is essentially going to be about young Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThose of us who have been part and parcel of our sordid past must be prepared to pay the sacrifice, even the personal sacrifice, of allowing a situation we can lift our youths to positions of power and authority.\n\n\u201cI am willing to put down my back, so that young people can stand and come to the top.\u201d\n\nBut Okupe who explained the circumstances that threw him up to be the Vice Presidential candidate to the party\u2019s flag bearer Peter Obi, said he is holding the position in trust for the rightful owner.\n\nHe insisted that the party took this route to beat the Friday, June 17, 2022 deadline set by INEC for the submission of names of candidates.\n\nHe added that LP is open to the formation of a behemoth of political force to fight All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the upcoming presidential election.\n\nHowever, if Okupe\u2019s candidacy holds, he will run alongside Peter Obi in the 2023 presidential elections.\n\nBut the party had announced its Vice President will come from the North.",

The accreditation and voting were done simultaneously.\n\n\u201cThe process has been accelerated by this. There is an improvement by INEC.\n\n\u201cI am not saying there won\u2019t be manipulation, but the security is doing fine, so as of now we are having a peaceful process.\n\n\u201cMy fears are the general ones that people can become violent as reported in some cases in the past.

I am happy that there was no case of apathy. The security build up has also been impressive. So, the process has been good and fine.\n\n\u201cI am coming with a change agenda and my manifesto is clear about the changes I am bringing,\u201d Oyebanji stated.\n\nHe hailed the voters for enthusiastically trooping out en masse to cast their votes, saying there wasn\u2019t any case of apathy with the reports he had been getting across the 177 wards.\n\nAlso, the Commissioner for Local Government Affairs, Prof. Adio Folayan, who voted at ward 04, unit 004 in Efon Alaaye, praised INEC for the exercise.\n\n\u201cYou could see people exercising their voting rights unhindered.

We cannot afford to lose focus by being distracted about who Tinubu may decide to choose as his running mate.\n\n\u201cThe solution to the challenges confronting Nigeria does not rest on whether the running mate to Tinubu is Christain or Muslim.\n\n\u201cNigerians are not interested on who becomes running mate to any of the presidential candidates. What they need is good governance that would guarantee security, stable polity and social economic progress.\n\n\u201cNobody can carry a pass to the market on the basis of Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian tickets for Asiwaju or any other Presidential candidate and get food items free.\n\n\u201cThey only need a ticket that would guarantee the availability of products and economic empowerment to meet their needs.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to support and vote for Tinubu irrespective of who he chooses as his running mate and we will work to ensure that Nigerians do the same.\u201d",

The plaintiff alleged that they were denied fair hearing by the committee.\n\nWhile accusing the Bauchi State Government of embarking on a witch-hunt exercise aimed to tarnish their reputation, the plaintiffs, prayed the court to not only declare the committee as illegal, but to also invalidate its report that indicted them.\n\nAside from the Bauchi State Government, other defendants in the matter were the State Security Service (SSS), the Nigeria Police Force (NPF), the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) .\n\nMeanwhile, Bauchi State Government, through its Attorney-General, shunned the suit. Consequently, in his judgement, Justice Ekwo, who noted that Bauchi State Attorney-General failed to honour a subpoena the court issued to compel his attendance to the proceedings, further observed that the state did not also adduce any legal instrument it relied upon to set up the probe panel.\n\nThe court said there was nothing before it to establish that the panel was validly set up.\n\n\u201cWithout evidence of the executive instrument or order of the 5th defendant (Bauchi State Government) which established the said committee, it means that the 5th defendant has not effectively controverted the assertion of the plaintiffs.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, since the executive instrument is in the possession of the 5th defendant and it failed or refused to produce it in either their counter affidavit or further counter-affidavit, it in my opinion means that it is being withheld by the 5th defendant.\u201d",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn continued efforts to grow the economy through the mining sector, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite, Thursday, has wooed investors abroad with huge gold, lead-zinc, iron-ore and barite deposits in Nigeria.\n\nAdegbite made the revelations\n\nin his paper titled \u2018The Mechanisms of Transparency and Commitment in Mining Governance as Tool for Attracting Foreign Direct Investment to Nigeria\u2019 on the Nigerian Day at the \u20182022 Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada, PDAC, International Convention, Trade Show and Investors Exchange\u2019 in Toronto, Canada.\n\nHe also assured them of the Buhari-led administration\u2019s resolve to give the best of incentives never found anywhere in the world to interested and serious investors.\n\nHe made it clear that Nigeria\u2019s solid minerals are ranked among the best in quality and quantity as these minerals are rated highest in return on investment, because they are closer to surface and low cost in production.\n\nHe added that the Nigerian Government was seriously focusing on the solid minerals sector, which investors and investments bare top on its priority list as as far as policies are concerned which make the mining sector very business friendly because of mechanisms put in place to promote ease of doing business as this is built on strong policy and regulatory structure is very the years.\n\nMeanwhile, according to him, the robust structure, line by line, was the reason Nigeria has been seeking to attract investment into the sector.\n\nHowever, the Minister acknowledged the the fact that global economies have experienced unprecedented challenges since the break out of COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result the conference is holding in June.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria has been part of this event for several years because of our determination to see exponential growth of the mining sector\u2019s contribution to our GDP more than it has done in the past forty years.\n\n\u201cWe are here to collaborate and network with global leaders, professionals, investors, Chief Executives of junior, mid-tier and major mining companies. It is also on this premise that the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, in collaboration with industry stakeholders, vowed to pull resources and consolidate on the 2016 Roadmap for the Growth and Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry.\n\n\u201cIn pursuit of the goals set forth in the roadmap, the government initiated an ambitious reform regime in the sector, the flagship of which was the National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP, designed to rapidly generate bankable geoscientific data with the aim of de-risking the sector and attracting high caliber investments.\n\n\u201cTarget minerals under the first phase include Gold, Lead-Zinc, Iron Ore, and the Battery Minerals, among others. The contractors have executed and completed the exploration works on Gold, Platinum Group of Elements, PGEs, Lead-Zinc, Iron Ore and Barites.\n\n\u201cCurrently, there is an ongoing review of the Nigerian Minerals and Mining Act 2007, aimed at bringing legislation into conformity with global best practices, limiting the role of government to that of regulation, and creating the space for the private sector to maintain a more expansive presence in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe early evidence that our framework is on the right track is the inflow of notable investments.\n\n\u201cThese include Thor Exploration Limited\u2019s Segilola Gold Mine Project, in Osun State, which has an initial production capacity of 80,000 ounces of gold annually, representing the first large-scale Gold Mine in Nigeria.In June last year, we commissioned the Dukia Gold & Precious Metals Refinery, DGPMR, Project.\n\n\u201cThe company set out to be a foremost indigenous refiner and trader of gold and other precious metals. Its potential impact on the gold sector is nothing short of revolutionary.\n\n\u201cBy providing offtake opportunities through the establishment of Precious Metals Buying Centres, it serves as a spur for more small and medium scale mining investment, while its refinery symbolizes its focus on value addition in the gold and precious metals industry in Nigeria and West Africa.\n\n\u201cA similarly remarkable investment is the integrated Iron Ore Mining and Processing Plant set up by African Natural Resources and Mines Limited (ANRML) in Kaduna, which has an initial production capacity of 4.704 million tons of iron per annum and will scale up to 5.88 million tons per annum by 2025.\n\n\u201cIn line with the economic diversification plan of the Government, my Ministry has issued a Request for Qualifications for bidders interested in receiving concessions to begin the production of bitumen in Nigeria as the country possesses about 42 billion tons of proven reserves of bitumen, estimated to be the sixth largest in the world.\n\n\u201cThese blocks are located close to key ports for export purposes and import of mining equipment, and railways cutting across areas with bitumen deposits.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we seek for suitably qualified investors with pre-requisite experience, technological expertise and financial capacity for the development of bitumen resources in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAdegbite also made it known that, \u201cResults on Greenfields and Brownfields are on process to be declared for investment opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe have also commenced the process of retrieving Nigeria\u2019s colonial geological data from the United Kingdom by engaging the British Geological Survey, BGS, to build a national electronic geo-data archiving management system to be called the Nigerian Geo-Data Center at the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA.\n\n\u201cThis would provide easy access to geoscience data for prospective investors on potential areas to target for exploration and mining within and outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso, he made it known to that there are a lot of incentives enshrined in the Nigeria Minerals and Mining Act, 2007, which include:Customs and import duties waiver for plant, machinery and equipment imported for mining operations; Tax holidays of between three to five years as applicable;Free transferability of funds and permission to retain and use earned foreign exchange;Capital allowances of up to 95% of qualifying capital expenditure; Deductibility of Environmental Costs (money meant for environmental remediation will be tax free); and100% ownership of mineral properties.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, part of our modest efforts towards achieving the desired aim is repositioning the Mining Cadastre Office to promote transparency in mineral title administration.\n\n\u201cThe processes have been streamlined to enable investors to apply online and obtain licenses and leases within and outside Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFrom the revenue drive perspective, the Nigerian Mining Sector has demonstrated a marked improvement despite the challenges of the pandemic. The secret of the sudden jump can be attributed to the introduction of \u201cFirst Come, First Served\u201d and \u201cUse it or Lose it\u201d in the licensing administration,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe further stated that this has helped to re-organize, eliminate speculators, and led to the revocation of about 1,566 mineral titles, activated many dormant licenses and increased revenue inflow into the treasury.",

          "text": "Channels Television and Yiaga Africa have launched an Election Results Analysis Dashboard (ERAD) to promote transparency of election results.\n\nThe dashboard is based on official results uploaded on the INEC\u2019s Results Viewing Portal (IReV).\n\nIReV involves scanning or photographing Polling Unit result sheets (Form EC 8A) once they are completed and verified and subsequently uploading the pictures to a dedicated backend server.\n\nAt the front end, the portal allows members of the public to create personal accounts and log-in details with which they can gain access to all uploaded results stored as PDF files.\n\nThe real-time publishing of polling unit-level results and transmission of results using the IReV demonstrates INEC\u2019s commitment to transparency in results management. This commitment is backed by the Electoral Act 2022, which confers INEC with powers to transmit election results electronically.\n\nWhile the introduction of IReV has increased public confidence in results management, it offers wide-ranging opportunities for public information based on data directly sourced from INEC\u2019s portal and backed by informed analysis of the results.\n\nFor this reason, the ERAD is developed to support INEC by providing the public with access to election results from the polling unit in relative real-time. To achieve this goal, the Election Results Analysis Dashboard will be embedded within the election-day broadcast of Channels Television.\n\nIn addition, the ERAD will provide an independent audit and integrity test of INEC\u2019s election results management system by tracking results from the polling units based on Commission\u2019s own published results.\n\nThe business process of the ERAD entails download, extraction, and verification of results from the IReV, visualization of the data in diverse formats, scriptwriting, and expert analysis of the results.\n\nYiaga Africa and Channels Television recognize INEC\u2019s constitutional mandate to declare electoral outcomes; therefore, the ERAD will not declare any party or candidate winner of the election.\n\nThe ERAD will be limited to publicizing results released by INEC on its online portal. With this innovation, members of the public with limited internet access to the results viewing portal can obtain polling unit results through the ERAD.\n\nIt is important to note that Yiaga Africa is deploying the Parallel Vote Tabulation (PVT) for the Ekiti election. While the PVT is based on results declared by INEC officials from a random sample of polling units and transmitted by Yiaga Africa citizens observers to the Watching The Vote data center in Ado-Ekiti, the ERAD is strictly based on official results uploaded on the INEC results viewing portal. Both tools will play a complementary role in ensuring the Ekiti election pass the electoral integrity test.\n\nAs partners, we expect that the net effect of the ERAD will be improved public confidence in election results management and the broader electoral process.",

          "text": "Some asylum claimants who arrived in the UK in small boats or in the back of lorries could be electronically tagged under a new Home Office trial.\n\nA 12-month trial could affect adults due to be removed from the UK after arriving via what the government calls \u201cdangerous or unnecessary\u201d routes.\n\nThe first to be tagged will likely be people who successfully challenged their removal to Rwanda this week.\n\nCritics say the plan treats those fleeing persecution as criminals.\n\nThe pilot comes days after the first flight taking asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda was cancelled following a last-minute intervention by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).\n\nThe Home Office said the trial, which began on Thursday in England and Wales, would test whether tagging helps maintain regular contact with asylum claimants and progresses their claims more effectively. It will also collect data on how many people abscond.\n\nPeople who have been tagged may be subject to a curfew, and those who fail to comply with their conditions could be taken back to detention, or prosecuted.\n\nThe guidance says those who are informed that they are to be removed from the UK may be at an increased risk of absconding and and have less incentive to comply with immigration bail conditions.\n\nIt is unclear exactly how decisions will be made on who to tag, but Home Office guidance says it will not include children or pregnant women.\n\nCaseworkers must also consider whether the device would cause serious harm to the person\u2019s mental or physical health, or whether they have been a victim of torture or modern slavery.\n\nHowever, the guidance says these factors do not in themselves prohibit imposing a tag.\n\nThose with the location-tracking device will be required to regularly report in person to an immigration centre or police station.\n\nThe idea of tagging will, the government hopes, show it is serious in getting tough on those it believes are exploiting the asylum system.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear how many people will be tagged \u2013 or how keen immigration judges will be to introduce electronic monitoring as part of any bail conditions.\n\nAnd groups supporting refugees say once again government policy will lead to vulnerable people being demonised.\n\n2px presentational grey line\n\nEnver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \u201cIt\u2019s appalling that this government is intent on treating men, women and children who have fled war, bloodshed and persecution as criminals.\n\n\u201cThis draconian and punitive approach not only shows no compassion for very vulnerable people; it will also do nothing to deter those who are desperately seeking safety in the UK.\u201d\n\nBut a Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe government will not be deterred as we plan for the next flight to Rwanda.\n\n\u201cWe will keep as many people in detention as the law allows, but where a court orders that an individual due to be on Tuesday\u2019s flight should be released, we will tag them where appropriate.\u201d\n\nIt comes as Home Secretary Priti Patel said a decision by a European court which effectively grounded the first Rwanda-bound removal flight was \u201cabsolutely scandalous\u201d and politically motivated.\n\nJudges at the ECHR granted an injunction that left a chartered plane to Kigali unable to depart.\n\nMs Patel told the Daily Telegraph the court had been \u201copaque\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who the judges are, we don\u2019t know who the panel are, we haven\u2019t actually had a judgment \u2013 just a press release and a letter saying we can\u2019t move this person under rule 39,\u201d she said.\n\nThe ECHR protects civil and political rights established in the aftermath of World War Two. It is separate to the EU.\n\nThe Rwanda plan, announced by the government in April, intends to give some migrants who cross the Channel to the UK a one-way ticket to Rwanda to claim asylum there instead.\n\nThe government has said the scheme, which has come at an initial cost of \u00a3120m, would discourage others from crossing the Channel, although Home Office civil servants have not been able to precisely quantify the benefits of the policy.\n\nBBC",

Within the PDP, we felt that the time was rather too short with regard to zoning to a particular part of the country.

          "text": "Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State in Nigeria\u2019s southwest on Friday blamed himself and government at all levels for failing to defend the victims of June 5 attack on St Francis Catholic Church, Owo, which claimed 40 lives.\n\nAkeredolu made the declaration during the funeral Mass for 18 of the victims, held at the Mydas Resort and Hotel, Owo.\n\nAkeredolu, who was at the event alongside his wife, Betty; former governor of the state, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko; Chairman of the state\u2019s chapter of the All Progressives Congress, Ade Adetimehin; and a chieftain of the APC, Chief Olusola Oke (SAN), stressed that evil will not triumph forever.\n\nAkeredolu, who wept during his speech, said the government failed to protect the victims of the terror attack.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cWe have failed to defend these people. Not because we have not tried, but because these forces on the other side are evil and they have support.\u201d\n\nHe noted that something must be done about security in the country, adding that the security architecture of the nation needs rejigging.\n\n\u201cWhen I see the sea of heads that are here, it speaks volumes. What has happened to us in Owo is indescribable. A lot of words are used to qualify it \u2013 dastardly, horrendous. But I still believe there are words to describe it but I am still short of those words.\n\n\u201cWe have just 22 deceased in this hall. A few of them have been buried, because the relatives couldn\u2019t wait till today. But as at the last count, these animals came to the church and murdered 40 people.\u201d governor Akeredolu said.\n\nResponding, the Bishop of Ondo Catholic Diocese, Dr. Jude Arogundade declared that Akeredolu had not failed in protecting his people.\n\nBishop Arogundade said: \u201cYou didn\u2019t fail. You are a strong soldier. Your determination to protect those who voted you into power is unquestionable. This was done by cowards. You have tried your best.\u201d\n\nBishop Arogundade wondered why the people of the country need to beg for state police, despite the endless attack and killings, while thanking the governor for accepting to designate a memorial park in honour of the victims.\n\nHe stressed that those who created the situation that made the incident happen have blood on their hands.\n\nEarlier in his funeral Mass message, Catholic Bishop of Oyo Diocese, Most Rev Emmanuel Badejo called on relatives of the victims to allow God to fight their battle.\n\nBishop Badejo said: \u201cIt will not be an exaggeration at all to begin this funeral Mass with Psalm 22 where David said \u2018my God, my God, why have you forsaken me.\u2019 This is not a homily, I am not happy to preach at all, and it is not an occasion which any of you ever pray to witness in this side of the world or our country.\n\n\u201cNo doubt we all gather today in deep sorrow and mourning, for this funeral Mass for over 40 of our departed people who were brutally murdered, mindlessly massacred while at worship at St Francis Catholic Church, Owo, on Pentecost Sunday.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the event catapulted Ondo State, the Catholic Diocese of Ondo and Nigeria into the limelight of world attention, unfortunately, for the wrong reason. Since then, the world has condemned the crime perpetrated against humanity and against God in this state.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, there was no mass burial for the victims of the attack, as relatives individually took possession of the corpses and were seen taking them to their home of origin.\n\nSome of those who spoke with THISDAY said it was a taboo for an adult to be buried outside his or her home of origin.\n\nA mourner, Nwani Christopher Chudi said since the death of his brother who was the breadwinner of the family, had been a battle for survival.\n\nHe said: \u201cI lost somebody who was very dear to me, a senior brother, with the daughter; a promising child that we were hoping will be a person the family will depend on tomorrow. It was a tragic event on June 5 that somebody went to church and never came back.\n\n\u201cIt has been a trauma because he is the breadwinner of the family. In my nuclear family, I\u2019m the only surviving son. I have only five girls that are my younger ones to attend to. He used to support us, although he was married. You know Igbo tradition, once you are married, you have a wife, your siblings, are on their own. He will face his own immediate family, even the son that survived, that they call Victor, he just miraculously survived. It was God\u2019s grace because he was inside the church while the shooting was going on but he survived. We thank God.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe wife\u2019s BP had already risen above normal; her BP was already 180/170, which is very abnormal. You know she visited the hospital the other day. On two occasions, we took her to the hospital, since then she\u2019s not eating well, she\u2019s not sleeping, the trauma is so much.\n\n\u201cI was born and brought up in Owo, I don\u2019t have a father, I don\u2019t have a mother.My daddy has died likewise my mother. My late brother has been my pillar. I\u2019m a graduate; I graduated from University of Jos in 1996, no white-collar job.\u201d\n\nTears flowed freely from relatives of the victims and sympathizers who thronged the venue of the funeral Mass.\n\nFidelis David in Akure",

          "title": "Nigeria: Oyebanji, Oni, Kolawole in Three-Horse Race to Succeed Fayemi as Ekiti Governor",
          "text": "Thousands of voters will on Saturday file out in Ekiti State to elect a new governor that will succeed Kayode Fayemi who is at the tail end of his second four-year tenure.\n\nNo fewer than 16 political parties are fielding candidates for the election, but it is expected to be a fierce battle involving Biodun Oyebanji of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC); Segun Oni of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Bisi Kolawole of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nFor most of Friday, tension remained very high across the state, with voters bitterly divided among the three leading candidates. Fear of violence was palpable.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nFor seamless conduct of Saturday\u2019s election in Ekiti State, the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, on Friday ordered the restriction of vehicular movements along entry and exit points to the state from 12:00am on 18th June, 2022 to 6:00pm of the same day.\n\nThe police added: \u201cTo this end, operatives of the Nigeria Police Force and the military, as well as other security agencies have been deployed across the state borders to enforce the restriction order to the letter and ensure criminal minded individuals do not infiltrate the State.\u201d\n\nThe Deputy Inspector General of Police, Johnson Kokumo had earlier disclosed that Ekiti State would be properly secured to avoid any breakdown of law and order during the poll.\n\nHe also revealed that a total of 17,000 personnel had been deployed for the poll.\n\nThe DIG added that soldiers would be at the borders of the communities to prevent any form of intrusion.\n\nAccording to him, all security operatives with VIPs should be withdrawn and returned to base for the purpose of the election. The DIG called on the people to be law abiding and to respect all the processes of the elections to be able to have a peaceful governorship election in the state.\n\nINEC Says it is Ready\n\nINEC spent most of Friday moving sensitive voting materials to the wards, while assuring all that the election would be free and fair.\n\nThe electoral umpire had earlier revealed that 988,923 voters captured in the Commission\u2019s register would decide who becomes the new Ekiti State Governor.\n\nINEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu appealed to staff of the commission to be neutral and abide by the code of conduct signed by them.\n\nHe said: \u201cI appeal to you to uphold our Code of Conduct, display your usual sense of responsibility and professionalism; remain above board and firmly resist any unethical behaviour.\u201d\n\nHe further charged them to ensure that no political party or candidate was accorded any advantage over the other.\n\n\u201cWe must also always stick strictly to the oath of neutrality to which we have all subscribed and continually live up to the trust that Nigerians repose in us,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nThe National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said 734,746 persons had collected their Permanent Voters Card for the election.\n\nOkoye assured electorates of the commission\u2019s readiness to conduct a free, fair and credible election.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is now a matter of common knowledge that we have 16 LGAs in Ekiti State and the election will be staged in 177 registration areas.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, yesterday said it would deploy 9,747 personnel drawn from FCT, Lagos, Ondo, Ogun, Osun, Oyo, Kogi, Kwara and Edo commands to provide security for the election.\n\nAddressing personnel at the Ekiti State Command headquarters of the NSCDC in Ado Ekiti, before they moved to their respective places of deployment, Acting Deputy Commandant General Operations, Lawal Haruna, disclosed that some flash points had already been identified and would be properly monitored.\n\nOni Alleges Intimidation\n\nThe SDP candidate yesterday alleged that some desperate politicians were already violating the peace accord signed this week before the Abdudalami Abubakar-led National Peace Commission.\n\nOni said rather than adhering to the tenets of democracy in the conduct of the June 18 Ekiti election, those he described as \u201coppressors\u201d, had allegedly been dehumanising and demobilising his supporters through unlawful arrests.\n\nOni, who addressed pressmen in Ado Ekiti, alerted INEC, international community, security agencies, observers and other stakeholders, saying \u201cfor this election to be acceptable, the REC must stamp and sign all forms EC8A, EC8B, EC8C and EC8D and not by any other agent or staff. Once the REC stamps and signs, nobody will be able to smuggle any form of fake results.\u201d\n\nOn the imperative of peace for the election to be successful, Oni said: \u201cI will keep to the peace accord. But when you are kidnapping people, it renders every peace document invalid. Let us tell them not to set this state on fire.\n\n\u201cThose who had been going round to kidnap my supporters should be called to order now. They are testing the patience and tolerance of the people. They shouldn\u2019t set this state on fire. If anybody commits an offence and they think they are the authorities to go round and arrest people at night, then the peace accord becomes shattered immediately.\u201d\n\nHow the Battle will Be Fought\n\nThe APC looks good to win Ekiti South Senatorial District, comprising six local governments \u2013 Gbonyin, Ekiti East, Ikere, Ekiti Southwest, Emure and Ise/Orun. Oyebanji\u2019s running mate, Mrs Mojisola Afuye hails from Ikere. With the votes from Ikere and party chieftains in the area, APC may likely win the zone.\n\nIn Ekiti South, the APC boasts of bigwigs like the Speaker, Ekiti State House of Assembly, Hon Funminiyi Afuye; two members of House of Representatives \u2013 Hon Femi Bamisile and Yemi Adaramodu; the APC State Chairman, Paul Omotoso; former Minister, Dayo Adeyeye and Chief Afolabi Ojuawo. These big wigs that can make things happen for the APC.\n\nOyebanji and Kolawole are from Ekiti Central Senatorial District, comprising five local government areas \u2013 Ado, Irepodun/Ifelodun, Efon, Ijero and Ekiti West. This is going to be a battleground. Oyebanji is from Ekiti West while Kolawole is from Efon.\n\nIn the last election, APC won four local governments in the senatorial zone and may still retain at least three this time, with the exception of Efon and Ado Ekiti.\n\nThe PDP may spring surprise in Efon because Kolawole hails from the town.\n\nThe influence of Segun Oni\u2019s Deputy, Ladi Owolabi in Ado Ekiti is also enormous. The large concentration of pensioners and civil servants, who seem to be backing Oni may also help the SDP tremendously in Ekiti Central.\n\nIn Ekiti Central, the APC also parades political heavyweights like the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo; Deputy governor, Bisi Egbeyemi and Senator Opeyemi Bamidele; These people are capable of doing the magic for APC. Victory for APC Ekiti Central may be by a narrow margin.\n\nEkiti North Senatorial District has always been a natural habitat and stronghold of Oni since 2007. The district has five councils \u2013 Ido/Osi, Moba, Ilejemeje, Ikole and Oye local governments. Oni is from Ido/Osi.\n\nAPC won the five councils in Ekiti North in the last election, but Oni was still in the ruling party then. As strong as Oni is in Ekiti North, he will meet a match in Fayemi, who is from the area.\n\nThe Director General, Biodun Oyebanji campaign council, Cyril Fasuyi, is also from Ekiti North. But Segun Oni still has visible and electrifying presence in Ido/Osi, Moba and Ilejemeje\n\nAPC also has influential politicians in Ekiti North. Whichever way it goes, Oni may likely carry the day in Ekiti North.",
