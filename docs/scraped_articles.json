          "title": "Surrender of repentant insurgents: The law must take its course \u2014 Lawyers",
          "text": "By Innocent Anaba & Onozure Dania\n\nGovernor Babagana Zulum of Borno State, weekend, expressed concern that his state was in a very difficult situation over the ongoing surrender by repentant insurgents.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have to critically look between two extreme conditions and decide our future. We have to choose between an endless war or to cautiously accept the surrendered terrorists which is really painful and difficult for anyone that has lost loved ones, difficult for all of us and even for the military whose colleagues have died and for volunteers.\u201d\n\nVanguard Law and Human Rights, in this edition, sought the views of lawyers on the way out in the development.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nHe should proceed based on security assessment, intelligence \u2014Agbakoba, SAN\n\nMr Olisa Agbakoba, SAN, on the way out, said: \u201cGovernor Zulum is in an extremely difficult situation and he only can assess what works best for his security situation and we can only wish him the best and it is not in anyone\u2019s place to second guess whether the governor\u2019s decision is right or wrong.\n\n\u201cHow to proceed isn\u2019t an easy solution, so my recommendation is, he will proceed based on security assessment and intelligence and that may include discussions with the repentant fighters on what will assist to resolve the situation.\u201d\n\nWe need to be sure of their genuine repentance \u2014 Ubani\n\nMonday Ubani on his part, said: \u201cThe worst that can happen to Nigeria is to blindly accept these so-called repented terrorists and integrate them into the system without proper procedure and profiling. How are we sure of their true repentance and remorsefulness?\n\n\u201cWe need to be sure of their genuine repentance before we accept them back. These people need to be in custody pending proper profiling before we accept them back in a blanket manner.\u201d\n\nWe must avoid set-up by repentant insurgents \u2014 Omodele\n\nYemi Omodele, see the issue differently. He said: \u201cIt takes two to tangle. The insurgents who had sent innocent citizens of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to life beyond turned around to surrender like repentant sinners must be looked at from the legal perspective. Does the law allow that? If yes, what will be the benefits of the affected families and loved ones?\n\n\u201cIf no, will the government do the needful in ensuring that the insurgents face the wrath of the law? With due respect, our criminal justice system should be reviewed to accommodate compensation for victims of crimes particularly relating to the development of insurgents surrendering willingly. The system is weak and should be overhauled. I need to say that the affected states where the insurgents are surrendering should be careful to avoid a situation where it will amount to a set-up that the insurgents will use to overpower the areas.\n\nALSO READ: PIA: Sylva under fire over 3% equity, Buhari begs\n\n\u201cRepentant criminals are always dangerous. They needed to be studied properly before allowing them to mingle in the society at larger. The intelligent departments of the security agencies should be involved in this development.\u201d\n\nAn armed robber surrendering does not acquit him of liability \u2014 Awe\n\nBabatunde Awe, in his reaction, said: \u201cThe fight against terrorism is a perpetual one. This is because terrorism is in itself premised on the use of unconventional tactics to cause mass mayhem and fear. No one can accurately predict when or where an act of terrorism will next occur. \u201cFor this reason, the surrender of terrorists is actually a welcome idea. It may appear to be an insignificant number surrendering but every surrender is one less attacker of our gallant troops, one less potentially violent and fatal vessel of evil.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is whether the Nigerian forces and intelligence community have sufficient capacity to deradicalize these elements and convert their surrender to useful intelligence to achieve the objective of mitigating terrorist attacks. And of course, whether the system is structured to mete appropriate justice to such individuals. The fact that an armed robber has surrendered when surrounded by police does not acquit him of liability for his offence of robbery. In summary, surrendering terrorists should be received, processed, and punished.\u201d\n\nMotive behind surrender is the real question \u2014 Adeleke\n\nDebo Adeleke is suspicious of the whole thing. He said: \u201cThe question of the insurgents surrendering their weapons is not an issue too difficult to comprehend but the real question is the motive behind it. Is there any sincerity of purpose on the part of those insurgents that are surrendering or are pretending to be surrendering? Do they really mean to surrender and repent and turn a new leaf or they\u2019re just fooling the people? Are they ready to atone for the sins they\u2019ve committed against humanity or circumstances forced them to pretend as if they\u2019re surrendering?\n\n\u201cWe need to be sincere to ourselves here. Those insurgents that are claiming to be surrendering are just fooling the authorities, they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re doing either for pecuniary gain, so as to get more money to empower themselves and go back to their usual trade or they believe for now that there is no escape route for them and they\u2019re pretending to surrender as an escape route or an easy way out. Second, it might even be a way to understudy the strength of the military and how to counter the military actions against them.\n\n\u201cThree, some of us all along have been consistent in saying that it is morally irresponsible to be negotiating with the Boko Haram considering the magnitude of the havoc they\u2019ve wreaked on innocent Nigerians. Nigerians are dealing with people who are subhuman by the constitution, people who will invade the Government School where innocent children are trying to acquire Western Education but hold them captive under inhuman treatment. Yet, they will want to justify their actions by saying that little girls among the pupils arrested have no business in going to school but to go and marry.\n\n\u201cTell me, what kind of restitution could be paid or be atone for colossal destruction of the lives of those pupils. These are the children that have been taken away from the comfort of their homes and school environments to be leaving in the caves like endangered species. For example, of recent, a little girl with two children, said to have been one of the Chibok girls was said to have been released by Boko Haram with a man claiming to be her husband, what did they do to the man?\n\n\u201cThe authority looks the other way and pretended as if everything is normal. Nobody asked questions as to how they were released? How did the poor girl live in the past eight years? How did the man come about to be the father of the two children she\u2019s carrying in a sane society. Her release or rescue would have been a pointer to put an end to the criminal and insensitive activities of Boko Haram in the country.\n\n\u201cNigerians would have had firsthand information on how Chibok girls were captured, over 200 of them were captured from Government Schools and disappeared into thin air only to appear seven or eight years after with little children and the man who did not show remorse as the so-called father of those children. How do you want society in general and the parents of those children to feel? Should they be jubilating that the life of their daughter or daughters have been completely ruined? The bitter truth is that the Federal Government should live up to its responsibilities, especially the school children from being captured again in the history of our dear Motherland.\n\n\u201cThe so-called insurgents that claimed to have been surrendering should be a ready tool in the hand of the Federal Government not only in locating the hidden places by the insurgents but to tell their modus operandi by way of putting an end to their dastardly act. The idea of welcoming them back to society, no matter how you look at it is counterproductive. It will encourage people that are desperate to engage in such animalistic and criminal behaviour in future, thinking that at the end of the day, society will pardon them.\n\nALSO READ: NGX lists two additional FGN Savings Bonds\n\nThe victims and their relatives are not psychologically prepared to forgive the criminals, so wasting government resources in reabsorbing them into society is purely cosmetic and it will be counterproductive. The solution to the problem is for the government to be more proactive and live up to its responsibilities to the Nigerian citizens. Any insurgent caught and or pretended to have surrendered should be questioned and if possible tortured to lead the Nigerian soldiers to their operational base i.e their hideout and their mode of operation.\n\n\u201cThey should expose those that are aiding them and that are supplying them with weapons with which they\u2019re using to carry out their criminal and nefarious activities. I find it highly inconceivable that a little child who\u2019s pursuing his/her academic career in life will be held hostage against his or her wish and the future completely ruined, how will society forgive such crimes in the name of repentance which in the first instance is not genuine? It\u2019s just like a case of a hardened armed robber who had killed a lot of innocent and defenseless citizens, claiming to be born again and make him a custodian of the key to the Central Bank of Nigeria because he\u2019s now a born again citizen.\n\nTo me, it doesn\u2019t add up and it is logically absurd. What do you want us to say to those military men that need not die painful deaths in combating insurgents. The way out and for peace to reign is to continue to wage war against them until the military wipes them out of existence, any other way aside that will aggravate the fragile and tense situation.\n\nJustice must prevail \u2014 Adegborioye\n\nAdenerele Adegborioye, however, wants justice to prevail. He said: \u201cMy position is that the law must take its course. Every offender or lawbreaker must be made to face the music that is, must be charged to court. There must be no sacred cow whether they are terrorists or not. We must not lay down a dangerous precedent of setting free murderers, arsonists and rapists.\n\n\u201cEvery offender must be brought to book. We must not set double standards of punishing certain offenders and leaving other offenders. Otherwise, we have to go to all the prisons to free every prisoner. If we must grant pardon to terrorists, every criminal must be set free. Then it will be obvious to all that this administration has no respect for the rule of law.\u201d\n\nForgiving them without trial will encourage others to pick up arms \u2014Ochai\n\nEmmanuel Ochai appreciated the governor\u2019s dilemma. He said: \u201cI agree with Governor Zulum that\u2019s it\u2019s a very difficult call to make. These terrorists have committed very heinous crimes and ought to be held accountable for their crimes against humanity. Holding them accountable will surely serve as a deterrent to other aspiring criminals. But forgiving them without them facing the consequences of their actions will encourage others to pick up arms against the state.\n\n\u201cThe dilemma is that the state has not been able to confront these terrorists as it should be, so the state is now negotiating with terrorists. I believe they can be rehabilitated in prison where they belong.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Pam disclosed that Gov. Ugwuanyi is the only State Chief Executive in the South East and South South geo-political zones of the country who has so far sponsored candidates in the ongoing Easter pilgrimage to Jordan for 2021.\n\nThe NCPC Executive Secretary expressed delight that Gov.

Ugwuanyi urged them to be of good conduct and focus squarely on the spiritual aim of the exercise and pray fervently for their various states and Nigeria, throughout their stay in the Holy Land.\n\nRepresented by his deputy, Hon.

          "text": "The youth wing of apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youths Council Worldwide, on Thursday, cautioned against what it called deliberate blackmail of the Enugu State Government over the activities of unknown gunmen.\n\nDAILY POST reports that there has been a trending story of one Tochukwu Okeke, aka Owo, said to have been nabbed for his alleged involvement in the activities of unknown gunmen. The reports claimed that he is a Special Assistant to Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi on Security.\n\nThe Enugu State Government has since debunked the existence of such portfolio in the Gov. Ugwuanyi administration.\n\nAddressing a press briefing, the OYC President-General, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike blamed the trending report on hired blackmailers.\n\nHe said the OYC had uncovered those involved and would soon expose them.\n\nHe said, \u201cwe have followed trending reports about one Tochukwu Okeke, aka Owo, who was arrested by the Nigerian Army for his alleged involvement in the activities of Unknown Gunmen in Enugu State and beyond. We were more concerned when his name was mentioned as a Special Assistant on Security to the Enugu State Governor, Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, with some published reports on the matter by certain blogs being shared across social media platforms.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council did not take this lightly but has gone ahead to make some enquiries and we can confidently say that the Enugu State Governor has never appointed anyone as any form of Assistant on security, let alone the particular individual in focus.\n\n\u201cIt then beats our imagination the intention of the purveyors of that news, especially as Enugu State has remained the most peaceful State in Nigeria. We are all in Nigeria and witnesses to the security breaches in all other States here and now, but Enugu has remained peaceful owing to the calm disposition of the Governor, Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi. Security is not a matter to be played politics with and that is why we are concerned over the development.\n\n\u201cGovernor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi is a man known widely for his peaceful disposition, who has sacrificed a lot for the sake of peace and unity, and would not in any way support any one who would turn around to truncate the existing peace in the Coal City State.\n\nGroup decries plot to blackmail Buratai, other former service chiefs\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to call on all those behind this cheap blackmail to desist from such as it would not blow any one any good. Nothing good can come out of any society where there is no security of life and property and we should not use blackmail to push Enugu into such a category.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf an individual has committed a crime, the person should be charged to court. Making a desperate effort to link the person to the Governor is nothing but a cheap blackmail which has fallen as a pack of cards. We say enough of this deliberate blackmail of the Governor. Let us allow peace to continue to reign in Enugu State.\n\n\u201cWe shall soon expose those behind this cheap blackmail if they don\u2019t desist from their devilish activities,\u201d Okwu warned.\n\nThe OYC equally commended the Enugu House of Assembly over the anti-open grazing bill, cautioning other states in the region to do the needful.\n\n\u201cWe are angry with the other States of Ebonyi, Abia, Anambra and Imo States over their silence on the open-grazing bill. This is not a time for any form of political correctness but a time to key into the demands of the people. Governance and true leadership is about listening to the people and leading them accordingly.\n\n\u201cNo sane government will pretend and allow Fulani herdsmen to continue the mindless killings and raping of women under whatever pretext. We have no doubt had enough of such atrocities and the perpetrators do not seem to have any plan of changing their heart and approach.\n\n\u201cWe shall henceforth hold the governor accountable for any further killing by herdsmen. We cannot continue to pamper the killer herdsmen while they go on butchering our people without restraint. Like we said before, cattle rearing is a private business and should be treated as such.\u201d\n\nOn the IPOB suspension of sit-at-home order, Okwu hailed the leaders of the Biafra group, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, and apealled to all the IPOB members and supporters \u201cto obey the latest directive from Kanu to the effect that sit-at-home is now suspended except for the days he will be appearing in court. This is not a time to behave as though the IPOB no longer has a leader.\n\n\u201cOn our own part, we are not relenting but have continued our engagements with the top hierarchy both in Igboland and beyond to ensure that Kanu is released very soon, unconditionally.\u201d\n\nHe demanded the immediate review of the Petroleum Industry Act recently signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari, describing it as a call for crisis.\n\n\u201cThe Act as signed will set the country on fire because it is a package of injustice to the communities laying the golden egg,\u201d he cautioned.\n\nSouthern govs meet in Lagos, state of Nigeria tops agenda [Photo]",

The night of tributes will enable friends, associates, partners, comrades, human rights activists, pro-democracy, trade union and socialist groups to pay their tribute.\n\n\u201cIn the morning of Friday August 27, 2021, the remains of our brother would be interred at the Gani Fawehinmi family compound in Ondo Town after a brief funeral service.\n\n\u201cWe welcome those who will like to identify with us during these ceremonies but in view of the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic we would ideally appreciate if the crowd is limited.\u201d",

          "text": "By Wilfred Eya, Magnus Eze, Chinelo Obogo, Chukwudi Nweje, Noah Ebije Kaduna and Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration has come under scurrilous attack for allegedly failing to secure the lives and properties of the Nigerians.\n\nReacting to the Katsina Governor, Bello Masari\u2019s admonition to his people on Tuesday to acquire arms and defend themselves against bandits, the Ohanaeze, the Afenifere, the Middle Belt Forum (MBLF) and other prominent Nigerians, criticised the All Progressives Congress (APC) for failing to carry out its primary responsibility as a government. They agree that the security situation has reached a point where Nigerians must take their destiny in their own hands.\n\nThis is not the first time top government functionaries are calling for self-help over what they considered precarious situation. In February, Minister of Defense, Maj. Gen. Bashir Magashi (retd) had challenged Nigerians to show that they were not cowards by defending themselves.\n\n\u201cIn our younger days, we stand to fight any aggression coming for us. I don\u2019t know why people are running from minor things like that. They should stand and let these people know that even the villagers have the competency and capabilities to defend themselves,\u201d he said. In May, Governor Samuel Ortom had also enjoined residents to rise up and defend themselves against every form of attack.\n\nReacting yesterday, National publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Alex Ogbonnia said Masari\u2019s call was a dangerous trend that indicated the failure of government in its social contract to protect the people.\n\n\u201cNow, the instruments of violence are no longer the monopoly of government and the government now asking the people to arm and defend themselves is a dangerous trend. Arms have proliferated among the people and it is a sign of a failed state.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze calls on the government to work hard to avert the impending doom to Nigeria.\n\nAfenifere leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, said Nigeria was in a mess and the situation in Afghanistan was already playing out in the country. He regretted that Nigerians were living in denial, saying the nation was gradually cascading toward a totalitarian state.\n\nThe elder statesman stressed the need to change the 1999 constitution, cautioning that the 2023 election may not hold if the status quo remains.\n\nPublicity Secretary of MBLF, Dr. Dogo Isuwa, said the right to self-defence is constitutionally guaranteed, but that of providing defence that the Federal Government failed in should be vested in regional security outfits like Amotekun controlled by governments to prevent abuse.\n\nBut for the spokesman, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Emmanuel Yawe, governor as chief security officer has the constitutional powers to put in place security measures that would safeguard his state. He said other governors can emulate Masari if they feel that such measure would help their respective states.\n\n\u201cGovernor of Katsina, as provided in the 1999 Constitution, is the chief security officer of his state. He is, therefore, permitted by the constitution to introduce security measures within the boundaries of his state and his state alone. If other states in the country see that his measures are good and have helped in securing the state, there is no stopping them from emulating his policies. Anybody who lives in Nigeria knows how bad our situation is. You don\u2019t need to ask whether Nigerian citizens have a right to protect themselves.\u201d\n\nA group, Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), said Masari urging people to acquire arms and defend themselves was a sign of frustration with the Nigerian security services. Its spokesman, Abia Onyike, said the call on the citizenry to arm and defend themselves was a natural reaction given the circumstances they found themselves in Katsina and other states. However, the Igbo National Council (INC) urged Masari to take the first step of self-defence in his state even as it pointed out that Igbo would protect themselves from the killer herdsmen and other hoodlums terrorising the zone.\n\nIts National President, Chilos Godsent, in a statement, noted that it was a clear indication that President Buhari has failed to secure the lives of Nigerians and therefore called for his immediate resignation.\n\nBut Elder Statesman, Tanko Yakassai, said though the security situation is bad, it has not got to the stage where people would have to take up arms to defend themselves.\n\n\u201cMasari sounded like a pessimist by saying that. But don\u2019t forget that we have 36 governors and he is just one of them. If it was a meeting of governors and they took a decision along that line, then it can be enforced. Whether someone is a governor or not, he is an individual in Nigeria and his views are not law; he is just expressing his personal opinion. I don\u2019t see his statement as a positive development but I don\u2019t give it the value others are giving it because I know that Nigerians are going about their businesses. So, the point is that the situation in Nigeria is not good but it is not as bad as it is being painted and I do not pray that we should get to the stage where people would have to take up arms to defend themselves,\u201d Yakassai said.\n\nBut former lawmaker, Senator Rufai Hanga said Masari\u2019s statement was a vote of no confidence in the president who also hails from Katsina.\n\n\u201cThat also confirms what people have always said, that the security situation in the country is terrible and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any capacity from the government to defeat it. Masari has only proved the president\u2019s critics right.\u201d\n\n\u2022Director Army Public Relations, Brig. Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu reacts\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard of calls on citizens to pick up arms to defend themselves from other quarters, so it\u2019s not an isolated case.The governor is the chief security officer of the state, therefore, the zeal and passion for the protection and security of his people is what I see here. I believe that the call is to promote citizens engagement in tackling the menace, such as forming vigilante groups, similar to the Civilian JTF in the North East. However, in the demonstration of this, it is necessary to remind ourselves that possession of firearms is a subject under regulatory or statutory control. We must understand that the employment or deployment of the instrument of violence is a function of state power and anything contrary could orchestrate breakdown of law and order.\n\n\u201cThe Joint security forces are relentless and are working round the clock to ensure normalcy is restored in the troubled areas. Sadly, these criminals are taken advantage of the taciturn posture of the people, in not volunteering information to the security forces. Timely and actionable information is a major game changer in tackling this insecurity menace.\n\n\u201cWe urge well meaning members of the public, particularly in the concerned areas to support the security forces and collectively, we can defeat our common adversaries.\u201d",

Opalola said poison of carbon monoxide (generator fume) is suspected to be the cause, but the result of autopsy would confirm the cause of death.\n\nShe said a generator was found in the house and a report that the generator was used by the family the previous day gave suspicion to carbon monoxide poisoning. She said Investigation was ongoing to know the real cause of the deaths.\n\nShe said:\u201cOne person, a 14-year- old- girl, was found still alive,though unconscious, and she was rushed to the hospital where she is recuperating.\n\n\u201cThe remains of the other dead members of the family had also been taken to Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) Teaching Hospital, in Ile-Ife, where autopsy will be carried out on them to ascertain the cause of their death.\n\n\u201cThe dead persons were discovered by neighbours who believed they died in their sleep. Their bodies were reportedly taken to a private hospital in the community by sympathisers, but were rejected, before they were taken to OAU Teaching Hospital morgue.",

He said these groups of people have turned alms begging and hawking into a huge business by collecting returns from beggars and hawkers, who incidentally sleep under bridges, motor parks and uncompleted buildings. He said intelligence reports also revealed that some of the beggars went about with dangerous weapons, assaulting and robbing innocent residents.\n\n\u201cThe special team will tackle the menace frontally and would commence operation in the next few days,\u201d he said.\n\nThe commissioner said the task of the team was not only to sanitise the society, but also restore the dignity of hawkers and beggars.\n\nDawodu said beggars on streets and roads constituted considerable nuisance to law abiding citizens, who were entitled to go about their businesses without any fear or hindrance.\n\nHe said street begging was a social vice that government cannot afford to watch attain uncontrollable level in order not to affect the good plans and programmes to transform the state.",

          "title": "Igboho: Court extends restraining order on AGF, DSS",
          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nJustice Ladiran Akintola of Oyo State High Court, sitting in Ibadan, the state capital, yesterday extended the restraining order in favour of a Yoruba nation activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, against the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN), Department of State Security Service (DSS) and Director of SSS in the state.\n\nThe suit was instituted by Igboho, following the bloody raid on his house in Ibadan in the early hours of July 1, this year, by the DSS in collaboration with other security agencies. During the raid, two persons were killed and about 13 persons among Igboho\u2019s aides were arrested during the operation and were later paraded in the evening of the same July 1 by the DSS in Abuja.\n\nJustice Akintola also awarded a cost of N50,000 against the AGF over filing his response to the processes filed by Igboho out of time, though the legal team of Igboho had asked for a cost of N250,000. But the court granted the extension of time in the interest of justice.\n\nAt the resumed hearing yesterday, three Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs) appeared for Igboho. They are Yomi Alliyu, Adekola Olawoye, and Oladipo Olasope. However, Abdullahi Abubakar appeared for AGF, while T. A. Nurudeen, appeared for second and third respondents.\n\nThe court had on Wednesday August 4, this year, granted a restraining order against the DSS and AGF, from arresting, intimidating, harassing and freezing the bank accounts of Igboho.\n\nThe case with number M/435/2021, instituted by Igboho, against the trio of AGF as first respondent, DSS as second respondent, and Director of DSS in Oyo State as third respondent.\n\nIgboho\u2019s lead counsel, Chief Yomi Alliyu (SAN), who moved an ex-parte motion before the court on August 4, had on Friday, July 23, 2021, filed a notice of application for the enforcement of Igboho\u2019s fundamental human rights before the court.\n\nIn the main suit, Igboho is also praying the court to order the respondents jointly and separately to pay him N500billion as special damages for the damage done to his car and residence, as well as exemplary and/or aggravated damages for breaching his fundamental rights in the course of illegal and/or malicious invasion of his residence.\n\nGiving the injunctions, Justice Akintola directed that both the AGF and the national headquarters of SSS should be served with the injunctions in Abuja, while the Director of SSS in Oyo State should be served in Ibadan. The judge also gave the respondents 14 days to make appearance before the court, before adjourning the case to August 18, for further hearing.\n\nBut counsel to the first respondent, Abubakar prayed the court for an extension of time for AGF to file his response to the processes filed by Igboho. Nurudeen, counsel to the second and third respondents, also aligned with the position of Abubakar, as he never objected to it. But lead council to Igboho, Alliyu, vehemently opposed the extension, saying the response should have been filed within five days of the receipt of the court processes.\n\nBut Abubakar and Nurudeen filed an application on their preliminary objections to the case, asking the court to vacate the restraining order, and strike out or dismiss the suit. The court, however, adjourned the case to Monday August 30, this year, for decision on the application.\n\nIn the notice of preliminary objections by the AGF, he challenged the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the case, adding that Igboho\u2019s claim of unlawful killing, tort of trespass, assault and battery could not be brought under Fundamental Right (Enforcement Procedure) Rules 2009.\n\n\u201cThe claims for damages for invasion of house, unlawful killing, tort of trespass, assault, battery and allegation of discrimination and secessionist cannot be resolved by way of affidavit evidence without calling witnesses, tendering of documents and even a likely visit to \u2018locus in quo.\u201d\n\nOn the order not to freeze Igboho\u2019s bank account, the AGF said the blocking of Igboho\u2019s bank account \u201cis a complete action of the second and third respondents, which can only be challenged before the Federal High Court, pursuant to Section 251 (r) of the 1999 Constitution (As Amended).\u201d",

This is because the NGF had six days before the president signed the PIB into law, expressed concern about the structure of the legislation that was passed by the National Assembly, saying without considering the interest of the federating states it would be recipe for national disaster if signed into law.\n\nHowever, in a veiled response to concerns raised by the NGF, host communities as well as other stakeholders, President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, yesterday said pitfalls identified in the PIA could be brought back to the National Assembly for amendment.\n\nThis is just as the Chairman of Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Mr. Muhammad Nami has said the PIA would negatively impact government\u2019s revenue expected from petroleum profits tax next year.\n\nSpeaking at a ceremony to mark the passage of the PIA, which preceded the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the State House, Abuja, President Buhari gave the nine-man steering committee headed by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, which was constituted to oversee the implementation of the PIA 12 months to complete its assignment.\n\nThe president stressed that assenting to the PIB marked the end of decades of uncertainty and under-investment in the petroleum industry.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are all aware that past administrations have identified the need to further align the industry for global competitiveness, but there was lack of political will to actualise this needed transformation.\n\nThis lack of progress has stagnated the growth of the industry and the prosperity of our economy.\n\n\u201cThis administration believes that the timely passage of the PIB will help our country attract investments across the oil and gas value chain.\n\n\u201cIn view of the value our nation and investors will derive from a stable fiscal framework for the oil and gas industry, our administration found it necessary to work with the two Chambers of the National Assembly to ensure the passage of the PIB.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari noted that signing of the bill was part of the administration\u2019s commitment to building a competitive and resilient petroleum industry that would attract investment, improve the country\u2019s revenue base, create jobs and support our economic diversification agenda.\n\nThe president said as a, \u201cnation that depends on oil resources for the development of other sectors, Nigeria runs a petroleum industry that is governed largely by laws enacted over 50 years ago such as the principal legislation; the Petroleum Act of 1969 and other obsolete legislations.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said the Presidential assent of the bill to PIA 2021 marked the beginning of the journey towards a competitive and resilient petroleum industry that would attract investments to support the nation\u2019s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe PIA 2021 creates a regulatory environment that would ensure efficiency and accountability across the oil and gas value chain and reposition NNPC to a commercially driven National Petroleum Company that is accountable to the Federation.\n\n\u201cThe Act also provides for a direct benefit framework that will enable sustainable development of Host Communities. I appeal to the host communities to look carefully at the contents of the Bill which in the implementation will bring real and lasting benefits to them.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the Act provides for deliberate end to gas flaring which would facilitate the attainment of Nigeria\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions of the Paris Agreement through a funding mechanism to support gas flare out project in host communities.\u201d\n\nWhile directing immediate implementation of the framework for the PIA, he urged all relevant stakeholders to comply and reposition for full activation within 12 months.\n\nThe president said Sylva, would head the implementation team, urging all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDA) to adjust to the transition, designed to reposition the economy.\n\n\u201cTo consolidate the commitment of this administration to delivering the value proposition of this law, I have approved an implementation framework commencing immediately to ensure the industry envisaged in the new law begins to take shape.\n\n\u201cThe implementation process to be headed by the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources is hereby tasked with the completion of the implementation of this act within 12 months. I am therefore directing all relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government to fully cooperate in ensuring the successful and timely implementation of this law,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOther members of the steering committee are Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum Resources; Group Managing Director, NNPC; Executive Chairman, FIRS; Representative of the Ministry of Justice; Representative of the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning; Senior Special Assistant to the President on Natural Resources; Mr. Olufemi Lijadu as External Legal Adviser, while the Executive Secretary, Petroleum Technology Development Fund, will serve as Head of the Coordinating Secretariat and the Implementation Working Group.\n\nThe primary responsibility of the steering committee shall be to guide the effective and timely implementation of the PIA in the course of transition to the petroleum industry envisaged in the reform program, and ensure that the new institutions created have the full capability to deliver on their mandate under the new legislation.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by the Senate President, Dr. Ahmed Lawan; Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege; Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ahmed Idris Wase; members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) and Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mele Kyari.\n\nSylva: NNPC Will No Longer Handle Federation Crude Sales\n\nThe Minister of State for Petroleum Resources has said with the PIA, the NNPC will no longer handle the sale of crude oil that goes into the federation account.\n\nSpeaking on a national television, the minister noted that the function will henceforth be performed by the Upstream Regulatory Commission, which will sell the commodity and retire the funds to the account from which the federal, state and local governments share monies monthly.\n\nHe stated that because NNPC Limited will be a company that would be operating commercially , it would no longer be dependent on the government, while the corporation would stop being the custodian of the crude oil as currently obtains.\n\n\u201cThat will no longer happen because NNPC will be a commercial venture, completely decoupled from government and will be operating commercially. So, for the average Nigerian, he will be seeing a more serious NNPC and a more professional NNPC.\n\n\u201cMonies will still accrue to the federation account, but NNPC will now have to give the federation crude to the upstream regulatory commission, and NNPC will no longer be in charge of the federation crude, they will be in charge of their own crude.\n\n\u201cThe commission will sell that crude and pay to the federation account, so the federation of course will still get their crude, but it will no longer be through the NNPC,\u201d he said.\n\nSylva assured that no jobs would be lost as a result of the new Act, noting that rather, the benefits to the workers as a commercial entity may even be more, since they would henceforth operate under a largely more efficient organisation.\n\nHe further clarified why President Muhammadu Buhari gave the implementation committee more than six months, saying while the incorporation of the NNPC Limited would be done in six months as provided for in the law, the implementation of the whole piece of legislation would go beyond that period.\n\nAccording to the minister, with its incorporation , NNPC would need to sit up to meet stakeholders\u2019 expectations as it would no longer operate as an agency of government.\n\n\u201cNNPC today is more or less a parastatal of government, the NNPC of tomorrow will no longer be a parastatal of government. It will be a Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) company, operating commercially.\n\n\u201cThe shareholder of that company will then be the Ministry of Petroleum Incorporated and the Ministry of Finance Incorporated, but it will be registered as a company in Nigeria, and will operate according to the laws of companies and allied matters act.\n\n\u201cToday, for example, NNPC cannot be taken to court, NNPC is not operating under the CAMA. But now, it means they can be sued. And of course, because of that, you expect that there will be a lot more seriousness within the corporation,\u201d he stated.\n\nSylva added that if petroleum products are sold at deregulated prices, then there would be no need for the Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF) which would then be subsumed into the midstream and downstream sectors.\n\nOn labour unions not being carried along, he promised that they would be part of the implementation process which takes off today, but pointed out that there was no need to add them statutorily to the new document, since it\u2019s no longer a wholly public company.\n\nHe reiterated that frontier basins are not only found in the north, saying that they exist in the south-west, Anambra in the south-east and Cross River in the South-south.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows that we are at the last mile of the oil economy and there\u2019s a lot of places in Nigeria where we still have the possibility of finding crude but we have not.\n\n\u201cWe have those frontier territories. That is where we believe we can find oil that we have not found. We have them in the north, we have them in the southwest. You have the Anambra basin in the southeast, you have the Calabar basin,\u201d he explained.\n\nGovernors Pick Holes in New Law\n\nThe NGF had six days before President Muhammadu Buhari signed the PIB into law, expressed concern about the form that the legislation was passed by the National Assembly, saying without considering the interest of the federating states it would be recipe for national disaster if signed into law.\n\nThe NGF\u2019s warning was contained in a letter it addressed to the president dated August 10, 2021, which was titled, \u201cPetroleum Industry Bill 2021- Appeal to Mr. President to Withhold Assent,\u201d that was signed by its Chairman and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi.\n\nIn the letter, the 36 state governors in the country had expressed, \u201cgreat shock and displeasure that the interest of the sub-nationals were not put into consideration in the bill that was recently passed by both chambers of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nThey said the PIB as passed by the National Assembly without giving adequate consideration to all facets of Nigeria\u2019s federation could be, \u201ca recipe for disaster\u201d and \u201cwe respectfully pray Mr. President to withhold assent pending resolution of all the thorny issues.\u201d\n\nThe NGF were worried that the PIB conferred on the federal government alone the sole ownership of all the shares of the commercialised Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited and the sole beneficiary of the proceeds of the NNPC and totally excluded state governments from owning a stake or enjoying from the proceeds that would accrue from the business operations of the NNPC.\n\nAccording to the governors, none of the proceeds of the NNPC would be transferred to the Federation Account for onward sharing to all the tiers of governments in the country, adding that, \u201csetting aside of 30 per cent profit oil and gas as frontier exploration funds constitute further depletion of the fund that should ordinarily accrue to the Federation Account.\u201d\n\nThe NGF specifically had grudges with Section 53 of the PIB that provided for the incorporation of the NNPC Limited under the Companies and Allied Matters Act to carry out petroleum operations on a commercial basis.\n\nIt noted that the same Section 53(2) went on to provide for consultations between the Ministers of Petroleum and Finance on the number and nominal value of the shares to be allotted which, \u201cshall form the initial paid-up capital,\u201d of NNPC Limited and further added that the company shall subscribe and pay cash for the shares.\n\nHowever, the NGF observed that the wording of sub-section (3), \u201csuggested that only the federal government would have shares in this company and stated that all shares in the company shall be vested in the government and held by the Ministry of Finance as the sole custodian of the shares.\n\n\u201cWe then recommend that a framework that accommodates states be worked out and included in the allotment of shares and incorporation of the NNPC Limited.\n\n\u201cWe observed that excluding the states from this arrangement precluded them from having a voice in the running and administration of the company and exclude them from sharing in the distribution of dividends when they become due.\u201d\n\nThe governors lamented that, \u201cin the same vein, Section 53 (4) of the PIB provides that the Ministry of Finance incorporated in consultation with the government, may increase the equity capital of NNPC Limited.\n\n\u201cHere again, we note the non-inclusion of sub-nationals in the consideration of this very important provision and recommend that the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) and Central Bank of Nigeria in consultation with the Federation Governments and Federal Capital Territory, may from time to time increase the equity of NNPC Plc.\n\n\u201cThe removal of the requirement to transfer fiscal payments to the Federation Account is unconstitutional and of grave concern to Nigerians. NNPC Limited is an entity created from a national asset whose proceeds always went to the Federation Account for distribution amongst the tiers of government and we are at a loss as to the reason for excluding a necessary component of the Federation from owing stakes in a successor vehicle.\u201d\n\nThe NGF further observed that in Section 33, \u201cthe imposition of gas flare penalties arising out of midstream operations which penalty shall be paid into the Midstream and Downstream Gas Infrastructure Fund, an account within the control of the NNPC and one in which only the NNPC alone would have access to carry out any infrastructural projects, constitute significant loss of revenue to the federation account.\u201d\n\nAgain, the NGF noted that, \u201cSection 54 (1) and (2) of the bill empowered the Ministers of Petroleum and Finance to jointly determine assets, liabilities, and interests to be transferred to NNPC Limited.\n\n\u201cAgain, we recommended that the states ought to be consulted and involved in the process to determine the transfer of these assets, liabilities and interest of the new company.\n\n\u201cOur advice was predicated on the joint ownership of these assets, liabilities, and interests. We extended our opinion on this to the winding down process covered by Section 55 (1).\u201d\n\nThe NGF also disagreed with section 64 (b) that granted the NNPC an additional responsibility to act as state agent in all Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) and entitled to oil and gas profits.\n\nThey were worried that this provision has made the NNPC to appear, \u201cin every commercial arrangement making its status even less commercial oriented and more favoured than is obtainable today.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that rather than reforming and by extension the oil sector, the PIB as presently constituted makes NNPC Limited an even more powerful oil company.\u201d\n\nThe governors hoped that the President would understand their shocks as the version passed by the National Assembly did not consider the concerns of the NGF and the states.\n\nPIA Can Be Brought Back to NASS for Amendment, Says Lawan\n\nLawan has said issues identified in the PIA could be brought back to the National Assembly for amendment.\n\nLawan stated this while answering questions from journalists shortly after a brief ceremony at the Presidential Villa where the President announced the setting up of an implementation Committee for the new law.\n\nHe said it is when implementation starts that people would start to see where amendments are required.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSo this is something we all have to address with some optimism and hope that it would be okay. But because we are human beings, no act of human beings could be perfect. So when we are able to see issues, the National Assembly is there. Bring them for amendment. Even the most difficult issues can still be brought back to the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cIf it is worthwhile to do so. But I believe that there is no need for us to be emphasising the problems rather than the prospects.\u201d\n\nResponding to questions on the agitation for more funds for the host communities, Lawan described the host communities as winners as well.\n\nHe said, \u201cBut you know from zero to over $500 million and with time, such issues will be further addressed, but I want to also caution that it is not the $500 million that is more but how we are able to prudently and transparently deploy this $500 million in the host communities. This time around, there should be no excuses for anybody to tamper with this money. The host communities have suffered enough, even when NDDC was established, I\u2019m sure it was established because of the host communities\u2019 issues and yet the host communities did not get much attention.\n\n\u201cThis time, the host communities have been specifically mentioned and these funds should go there. We want to see people who will be appointed, taking this as trust and do what is right. Of course, there will be so much employment and jobs especially in the midstream of the value chain. This midstream has not been in existence so to speak. What we have is the upstream and then, the downstream. When our refineries will be better and more will be established, I\u2019m sure the value chain will have opportunity for more Nigerians to have jobs and so on.\u201d\n\nFIRS: New Law Will Affect Revenues in 2022\n\nMeanwhile, Nami has said the signing of the PIA would negatively impact government\u2019s revenue expected from petroleum profits tax next year.\n\nAccording to Nami, the agency had projected some N10.1 trillion revenue generation for the country in 2022, but reckoned the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) would now affect the projection.\n\nHowever, he said with certain investigations being carried out as well as an audit, he was certain that 2023 hold better fortunes for government in terms of revenue generation.\n\nNami made these disclosures, when he appeared before the House of Representatives Committee on Finance at its ongoing 2022-2024 Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper (MTEF & FSP) Interactive Session with MDAS at the National Assembly Complex, Abuja.\n\nHe noted that of the total amount projected, N2.053 trillion would be remitted to the federal government while the balance would go to the states and local governments of the federation.\n\nNami, who told the lawmakers that the agency generated N4.9 trillion revenues in 2020,which was about 98 per cent of its set target for the year, said there was the possibility of surpassing the set target for revenue generation in 2022.\n\nHe assured the lawmakers that after some investigations and audit, which would be carried out by the agency in 2022, government\u2019s revenue might increase significantly in 2023.\n\nHe also disclosed that the FIRS has taken cognisance of the coming into effect of the digital economy in the country and was taking advantage of it to increase revenue generation, adding that Twitter and other social media platforms were already registering with the service for the purpose of tax payment.\n\n\u201cWe expect that with the new Petroleum Industry Act, there are some reconciliations that will be carried out that might affect the projections for 2022. We expect that there are new expenditure that will be rolled over to the new regime.\n\n\u201cSo, what we are trying to do is to ensure that we adjust those expenses for the year 2022. We know that if we do that, it is going to affect our ability to collect more revenue in that area. There are currently some allowances they have been able to use; but they will use it because this will be a new regime.\n\n\u201cIt is not going to be the one that has investment tax allowance any more. It is going to be based on actual performance. But we are going to recognise whatever they have now as a cost before you arrive at the actual profit they are going to generate. So, what we have planned to do is to aggressively conduct audit and investigations in the year 2022. So, we are projecting that by 2023, the result of that audit will begin to manifest. That is why we have projected 2023 to be N6.2 trillion,\u201d Nami said.\n\nPIA Not Perfect, But Step in Right Direction, Says NEITI Boss\n\nThe Executive Secretary, Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), Dr. Orji Ogbonnaya Orji has said the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) may not be a perfect document to address all the challenges in the petroleum industry, describing it as a legislation in the right direction.\n\nHe stressed that the PIA would encourage unity and development of oil host communities.\n\nOrji who spoke yesterday on ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, said: \u201cNo law can be perfect, but the PIA law has a template that will bring about transparency and level playing ground to manage our oil asset.\n\n\u201cIt will go a long way to address challenges of insecurity, and weak resources and also address key issues like access to education, hospitals, and roads. The most important thing about the implementation of PIA law is that it will make Nigeria move forward.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the PIA law would allow for two standing independent regulatory authorities \u2013 one for the upstream sector and the other for the mainstream sector \u2013 adding that they would afford host communities a lot of benefits and opportunities.\n\nHe said accountability has been the challenge for oil host communities in the past, but explained that all of that have been addressed in the PIA.\n\nHe further explained that Act would accommodate the interest of host communities, because of the trust fund embedded in the document.\n\nHe said the situation where host communities ended up not getting the actual disbursement from oil companies and the situation where projects were designed outside of the needs of host communities, would be addressed in the PIA.\n\nA legal practitioner, Frank Tietie, who also spoke on ARISE NEWS Channels, about the steering committee put in place to guide the implementation of the PIA law, commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the speed in the passage of the PIA law and the speed with which he assembled the steering committee on PIA implementation.\n\nHe expressed the optimism that the document would address a whole lot of issues in the petroleum industry.\n\nCommenting on the three per cent set aside for oil host communities, Tietie said it would help in developing the host communities.\n\nHe, however, said the make-up of the steering committee, does not translate into a true representation of the oil communities.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThere are uncertainties that the steering committee needs to address. Before now oil companies disburse money to host communities in the manner that please them, which has generated crisis among host communities in the past.\n\n\u201cThe steering committee must ensure that the money from the minimum three per cent operational expenses of oil communities, is well disbursed among oil communities, and avoid all forms of manipulation.\u201d\n\nReacting to the position of state governors who have expressed their displeasure over the contents of the PIA law, Tietie said the governors were only selfish and do not have the interest of the masses at heart.\n\nPIA Reflects APC\u2019s Commitment to Restructure Nigerian Economy\n\nBut members of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), the umbrella body of the governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has said the signing of the PIB into law by Buhari presents a convincing credential of the commitment of APC to restructure the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe Chairman of the Forum and the Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, said with the PIA, Buhari has demonstrated unwavering commitment to change Nigeria democratically.\n\nThe Forum noted that the Act also created a Host Communities Development Trust to be managed by Board of Trustees as provided by the Act, adding that the three per cent of profit from the operations of oil and gas businesses would be used for the development of the host communities.\n\nIt added that it was noteworthy that this is in addition to the existing 13 per cent derivation to oil producing states and funds allocated to Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\nThe Forum said: \u201cAfter more than two decades of endless national debates and stalemate, there is today a new Petroleum Industry Act in the country, which has provided six months transition for the emergence of new institutional framework for the operations of oil and gas industry in the country.\u201d\n\nThe Forum added that with the NNPC now unbundled, and in its place three new structures \u2013 Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission, Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority and Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited \u2013 stronger accountability structures, each with a Board drawing representation from stakeholders in the oil and gas industry is instituted.\n\nIt noted that the monopoly status of the old NNPC, which vested it with both the powers of regulating the industry as well as extraction and sales of crude oil in both the upstream, midstream and downstream has been abolished.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that this is in addition to the existing 13 per cent derivation to oil producing states and funds allocated to Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), which Mr. President has continuously emphasised that all the resources must be put to judicious use for the benefits of the people in the oil producing areas.\u201d\n\nThe Forum pointed out that even critics APC and its governments cannot ignore the fact that the coming into law of the Petroleum Industry Act was an important democratic milestone.\n\nIt added that the development signposts the commitment of the party and the government to develop the oil and gas sector and resolve all the challenges associated with the operations of the sector.\n\nIt said with the new Act, there should be remarkable improvement in revenue collection from the oil and gas sector, noting that this is expectedly the \u2018Next Level\u2019 governance initiatives that APC promised Nigerians during the 2019 campaigns.\n\n\u201cThe new Petroleum Industry Act present a convincing credential of the commitment of our party, APC, to restructure Nigerian economy through democratic process in line with provisions of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution as amended. \u201cInspired by our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, we are confident that democratic engagements based on strategic considerations of legislative proposals in the National Assembly to make or review existing laws, the Nigerian economy will be fully restructured,\u201d it noted.\n\nOzekhome Says Its Robbing Peter to Pay Paul\n\nAlso yesterday, Human Rights activists and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chief Mike Ozekhome has condemned the Petroleum Industry Bill just assented to as an Act of Parliament by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nOzekhome, who described the Act as a mere ruse, carefully crafted, to actually do irretrievable violence to Nigeria\u2019s progress, said it constitutes a direct assault on age-long cherished principles of federalism and the doctrine of separation of powers.\n\n\u201cThe PIB Act seeks to frontally attack the provisions of section 162 of the 1999 Constitution, which state that all revenues accruing to the Federation shall be paid into a Federation account from which sharing shall be made amongst the three tiers of government \u2013 the federal, government, the 36 states and the 774 Local Government Areas of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNo expenditure can be made by the Federal Government outside the provisions of section 162. Nor can any monies be expended without going through an Appropriation Bill through submission of budgetary proposals\u201d, he said.\n\nHe added that to the extent that the Act seeks to redesign the provisions of the Constitution to that extent is the Act unconstitutional, and that it must therefore be struck down.\n\nIn further condemning the Act, the senior lawyer argued that the NNPC, ought to be totally unbundled , to make it more viable, productive, transparent and accountable to the Nigerian people.\n\nHe queried why the federal government alone should have shares in NNPC to the total exclusion of the other three tiers of government, major stakeholders, oil-bearing communities and the long-suffering people of the Niger Delta.\n\nAccording to him, the Act was never designed to reform the NNPC, nor passed to advance the principles of federalism or doctrine of separation of powers.\n\n\u201cThe 36 States Attorneys- General should immediately approach the Supreme Court and challenge this latest Federal Government\u2019s impunity and the outrageous acts of executive lawlessness and legislative rascality we are beholding , by invoking the Supreme Court\u2019s original jurisdiction under section 233(1) of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cThat is the way to go. Allowing the Act to stay will further cement the present misguided unitary system of government that Nigeria is currently operating, under our thinly garnished disguise of a pseudo-federalism\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Deji Elumoye\n\nThe Auditor General of the Federation (AuGF), Adolphus Aghughu, has painted an unpleasant picture of the audited accounts of federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies in 2019, saying unsubstantiated balances totalling the sum of N4.973trillion was observed by his office in the audit carried out on the consolidated financial statement for the fiscal year.\n\nHe also lamented that his office had been incapacitated in so many ways from functioning effectively and efficiently as far as the detection of mismanagement of public funds by the various MDAs was concerned.\n\nSpeaking yesterday while submitting the 2019 Audit report to the Clerk of the National Assembly (CNA), Ojo Amos Olatunde, the Auditor General revealed that, \u201cfrom the audit carried out on the 2019 Federal Government Consolidated Financial Statement, unsubstantiated balances amounting to N4.973 trillion were observed\n\n\u201cThe N4.973 trillion unsubstantiated balances are above the materiality level of N89.34 billion set for the Audit,\u201d he explained.\n\nIn auditing, materiality means not just a quantified amount, but the effect that amount would have in various contexts.\n\nDuring the auditing planning process, the auditor decides what the level of materiality will be, taking into account, the entirety of the financial statements to be audited.\n\nAccording to the AGF, auditing of consolidated financial statement of the federal government on yearly basis would be expeditiously carried out once made available by the office of the Accountant General of the Federation.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou will recall that on March 25th this year, Audit of Consolidated Financial Statement of the Federal Government for the 2018 was submitted to this office for the required investigation of queries raised in it by the National Assembly. Just five months after, we are here again to make submission of the 2019 Audit Report\u201d.\n\nThe Auditor General, however, lamented that his office was not performing optimally due to myriad of factors crippling its operations and invariably giving room for all forms of financial infractions across the various MDAs.\n\nHe explained that, \u201cOne of such problems is the absence of Federal Audit Service Law, which is a big challenge as far as effective and efficient public sector auditing are concerned. This is a law that is needed as basis of fiscal sustainability.\n\n\u201cAbsence of it at the federal level is very worrisome going by the fact that some of the states of the federation have the required law in place.\n\n\u201cAnother problem incapacitating optimal functionality of our mandate as far as thorough and appropriate auditing of financial statements of the MDAs are concerned, is gross underfunding, which is telling much on our efficiency.\n\n\u201cFor example, the office is understaffed but there is no money for recruitment. Imagine many of our state offices, having just two or three staff. Auditing is done by a team not by an individual.\n\n\u201cAccommodation is also part of the problem as our staff in Lagos are about to be evicted from their office due to litigations. These are aside problem of insecurity seriously affecting our scope of coverage.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, after receiving the Audit report, Deputy Clerk to the National Assembly, Bala Yabani, who stood in for the Clerk said the report would be submitted to the Clerk for onward submission to both the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Femi Gbajabiamila, for the required legislative consideration.\n\nAccording to him, all the complaints made by the AGF would be tabled before the leadership of the National Assembly for required actions and solutions.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Meet Regina Honu, a Ghanaian software developer teaching thousands of girls to code",
          "text": "Choosing the name of her company was the easiest aspect of Regina Honu\u2019s journey.\n\nIt only took her a few hours to connect the dots. She wanted her business to be unique; the word unique in Ghanaian language Twi translated to Soronko, so she named her company Soronko Academy \u2014 the first coding and human-centred design school for children and young adults in West Africa.\n\n\u201cSome people take days to pick their company name, I tell entrepreneurs that they\u2019re majoring in the minor. I say pick what you like and keep it moving, you can build a brand on it,\u201d she said over a call.\n\nAlmost ten years after she made that decision, Soronko Academy has trained over 20,000 young people in Ghana and Burkina Faso and connected about 5,000 of them to job opportunities. She\u2019s won multiple awards from brands such as Coca Cola and CNN for her contribution to tech in Ghana and Africa. She\u2019s also a Mandela Washington Fellow and an Ashoka Fellow.\n\nBut the road to starting Soronko Academy was paved with many obstacles and difficult decisions. She has worked at two major banks in Ghana as the only woman in the IT department, participated in a reality show and even almost joined Microsoft but turned back to pursue her dream of ensuring that young ladies have access to the same opportunities that she did while growing up.\n\nPlaying PAC-man, flying with rockets and ending up in the Kitchen\n\nHonu grew up in the 90s, a time where there were only a few reputable careers that people could explore. At the age of 12, she wanted to be a doctor until her father brought home a personal computer (PC). She mostly played PAC-man on it, which sparked her interest in computer science and inspired her to want to create her own game.\n\nA few months later, she watched a movie about a man being able to fly with a rocket strapped to his back. So she decided she was going to build her own rocket. To show how determined she was to make this a reality, she sketched a rocket and showed it to her teacher who quickly downplayed her ambition.\n\n\u201cHe said it\u2019s impossible, girls don\u2019t build rockets and I\u2019ll end up in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nThat experience made her shelve her ambition to build rockets and detest the fact that people always told her what she could do based on her gender. From then on she decided to become a computer scientist \u2014 the only one in her class with such ambition.\n\nFailure is not final\n\nIn her first year in senior secondary school, Honu had her first taste of failure during an Inter-school quiz competition. She missed a question in the final causing the school to not clinch the winning spot.\n\n\u201cI told myself I wasn\u2019t going to try anything again, I\u2019m a failure in life.\u201d\n\nThe experience left a sour taste in her mouth but being one of the brightest in her school meant that when another competition came along she was selected to represent her school. This time she was determined to go all out and win.\n\nIn order to impress the judges, she went as far as learning some Latin. Fortunately, she ended up winning the competition. This win was a huge confidence booster and a reminder that failure is not final.\n\nThe best part about winning the competition was that it gave her the opportunity to spend one year in Norway on a school exchange program.\n\nA year in Norway\n\nAt the age of 16, Honu had her first exposure to a different culture. She continued as a science student but quickly found out that things were different in Norway. The focus in her new school was more on comprehension but she was used to memorizing and regurgitating information without necessarily understanding it.\n\n\u201cI found out that I didn\u2019t understand anything. I could draw a very complex electrical circuit but if you give me two wires and a bulb to connect, I\u2019ll be lost.\u201d\n\nIn Norway the mode of training was different; students had access to formula books and calculators. All they had to do was understand how to apply the formula. She was initially lost but soon found her feet as she adapted to the more practical learning style.\n\nOutside of schooling, she learnt how to ride a bicycle, rollerblade and climb mountains. She even got a taste of activism by joining a protest. The experience taught her that she could do more than she thought she could.\n\n\u201cI think that Norwegian experience has shaped the way I am. People always ask me, were you born and raised in Ghana you seem different. I came back with a different way of thinking. \u201c\n\nGetting into University\n\nWhen it was time to choose where to get her first degree, there was some dispute between whether she should school abroad or remain in Ghana. Her mother opted for the former while she wanted the latter.\n\nFor Honu, she had lived abroad and wasn\u2019t fascinated by the idea. She was also concerned about the prospects of travelling out and not returning. She didn\u2019t want to be part of the brain drain phenomenon.\n\nHonu won the dispute but was faced with one more challenge. She wanted to study computer science but wasn\u2019t impressed by the fact that courses being taught in the universities in Ghana weren\u2019t evolving quickly.\n\n\n\nIt seemed like she\u2019ll have to concede to her mum until her dad spotted an advert in the newspaper for Ashesi University, a new school that was recruiting its first set of students. Asheshi promised its future students a world-class education with an up-to-date curriculum.\n\nConversation between Regina Honu and students of Ashesi University during a visit. Photo Credit: Ashesi Unversity\n\n\u201cI remember at that time, Ashesi was just a house at Labone. I walked in and saw that the university was a house but it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, she got into Ashesi to study computer science. At that time the total population of the school was 30 students, with 14 of them in the computer science program.\n\nAmerican futurist, Alvin Toffler is credited with saying that the illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn. Honu definitely agrees with this quote as she spent her first year at Ashesi unlearning many of the wrong ideas she had.\n\nGoing through University wasn\u2019t without its own struggles. In her second year, she found visual basics difficult to understand and considered switching to a business major.\n\nBut on her way to the dean\u2019s office she had a rethink.\n\n\u201cI asked myself, \u2018Is this how I\u2019m going to give up?\u2019 I decided to give it one more shot. I immersed myself in work. They\u2019ll give us group assignments and I will do it myself. I carried the load on my head, I was doing all the work and it became easy for me.\u201d\n\nIn her third year, she got her first internship at a software company. At this company, the stamina she had built for solving difficult problems came in handy, as Ashesi students were expected to go above and beyond.\n\n\u201cThere were times when my boss would give me tasks and I wouldn\u2019t understand it or know what to do but how would I say \u2018excuse me, sir, they didn\u2019t teach us that in class.\u2019 So I\u2019ll take out time to understand the question first before even trying to answer it, then go on to solve it.\u201d\n\nAfter the internship, she was retained by the company while still in school. This experience was her first taste of independence as she had moved on from relying on her dad who was giving her pocket money.\n\nWelcome to the Corporate world\n\nAfter school, she returned to work for the software company briefly before joining Zenith bank.\n\nTwo things attracted her to the bank: an increase in the pay and the expectation that because the bank closed to customers by 5 pm, the workers also closed at that time. But upon joining the bank she found out that the latter was not the case.\n\nShe quickly excelled on the job and became popular after she built an intranet system for the bank. She was responsible for re-engineering the bank\u2019s IT products used in Lagos for Ghana.\n\nBeing the only female in the IT department at the bank came with its own challenges. During meetings the men on the team tried to apportion the job of taking minutes or getting refreshments to her. She grew a thick skin to ward off such stereotypical remarks. She also had to learn to work with her male colleagues without bruising their egos.\n\n\u201cThe male ego is very interesting, if we\u2019re all working on a problem and I arrive at the solution first, I can\u2019t announce it because it\u2019ll come off as a show-off. I had to learn to bring everyone to my way of thinking and then have us arrive at the solution together.\u201d\n\nEveryone in the department got promoted\n\nHaving proved herself on the job, she decided to apply for an opening for the role of head of electronic banking \u2014 naturally, she expected to get the job. At the interview, she noticed something was off, the interviewer first verified she was in the right place and then went on to ask her non-work related questions.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t give me the benefit of doubt. He felt that I couldn\u2019t be the head of electronic banking. I was devastated.\u201d\n\nWhile sharing her awkward interview experience with a colleague, she mentioned her grade level at the bank. It was then she learnt that her colleagues were on higher grades than her and she was the lowest paid in the department.\n\n\u201cI was the lowest-paid not because I was female but because I didn\u2019t know how to negotiate. They don\u2019t tell women on the continent how to negotiate, you don\u2019t ask for more. While growing up, you take what you\u2019re given, smile and say thank you. There\u2019s nothing like asking for more. That\u2019s insolent behaviour.\u201d\n\nArmed with this information, she requested to be promoted to a particular grade or she\u2019ll resign. Her request was granted but ironically, her colleagues were also promoted to make it seem like a general department-wide promotion.\n\nThe Apprentice Africa\n\nIn the midst of all this, she took unpaid leave to participate in a reality TV show The Apprentice Africa; for her, it was an opportunity to get an MBA training. She didn\u2019t win the competition but it equipped her with a valuable understanding of business concepts and showed her a glimpse of how reality TV shows work.\n\n\u201cI was a resource person but I didn\u2019t assert myself, I was a bit shy. The thing with reality TV is that they create characters. They only edit it and show places of you behaving in a particular way. If you\u2019re loud, they show that, if you\u2019re quiet that\u2019s what they show.\u201d\n\nThe participants of The Apprentice Africa. Don\u2019t bother looking for Regina Honu, she\u2019s not in this picture.\n\nUpon leaving the show, she remembers that one of the crew persons walked up to her and said she\u2019ll be a great team player but not a leader.\n\n\u201cI was like hmm, maybe it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nShe got an offer to work for Bank PHB, headline sponsor of the show, but couldn\u2019t imagine living in the fast-paced Lagos, so she returned back to Ghana.\n\nSame experience at another bank and turning away from a job at Microsoft\n\nShe eventually left Zenith bank for Fidelity bank, a Ghanaian Bank. And it was the same experience all over again.\n\nIt was at this point that the idea to start her own company came but she shelved it at first.\n\n\u201cI always say I put a snooze button on my dream. I thought entrepreneurs are born but not trained. There are people who are born with charisma and are bold. I never saw myself that way.\u201d\n\nWhile at the bank, she got an opportunity to interview at Microsoft. She went through the process and got to travel to Seattle at Microsoft head office. While waiting for her turn, she made up her mind that she\u2019ll return to Ghana to build something.\n\nResigning from her Job\n\nThe morning of the day Honu resigned from her job, she didn\u2019t know it would happen. She was used to a certain comfortable life, earning a decent salary, but she wasn\u2019t happy.\n\n\u201cI told my friends that I wanted to resign and they were like no, it\u2019s a bad idea, don\u2019t be stupid. Bonus is coming. I just had that feeling that if I didn\u2019t do it that day. I won\u2019t have the courage to do that again.\u201d\n\nSo she took the jump, resigned, bought a computer and desktop to start training kids.\n\nShe also decided to move back to her parent\u2019s house to reduce costs and increase her runway. That was the start of Soronko Academy.\n\nRegina working with some students at Soronko Academy\n\nFinding the right kind of love\n\nAfter calling off a three-year-long relationship with a guy, who was putting up with her. Honu wasn\u2019t sure she might find the right man and was ready to make peace with that.\n\n\u201cHe felt that as soon as he put a ring on it, I\u2019ll start behaving like a typical Ghanaian woman. I remember attending a particular event where everyone kept coming to me and it was as if he was invisible. He was so angry. I started seeing that he couldn\u2019t deal with a woman who would outshine him.\u201d\n\nShe eventually met her husband on an interview set, a South African who was on holiday in Ghana. In 2015, they got married.\n\nRichard and Regina Honu on their wedding day. Photo Credit: Regina Honu\n\n\u201cI always advise women that who we marry is important, it makes a difference. The fact that my husband is supportive allows me to be different.\u201d\n\nThese days she spends her free time with her husband and daughter.\n\n10 years and counting\n\nIt\u2019s been almost 10 years since Honu started Soronko Academy, for her there\u2019s still so much more to do. She\u2019s looking to get a bigger space in order to accommodate more women and run a residential program.\n\nThese days her number one pet peeve is people asking her to do something else, that\u2019s she has done enough.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now doing some programs in the other Ghanaian regions and some women don\u2019t have an idea of what an email address is. So we still have a long way to go, we shouldn\u2019t count the minorities and privileged as progress.\u201d\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria has just frozen the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove and Chaka for the next six months.\n\nAccording to The Whistler, the Federal High Court in Abuja has granted an exparte motion which sought temporary freezing of bank accounts belonging to these online investment and trading platforms where Nigerians are transacting business online.\n\nThe motion was filed by Chief Micheal Kaase Aondoakaa, SAN, on behalf of the Central Bank Of Nigeria Governor for the purpose of probing the financial activities of these four fintech companies in Nigeria.\n\nThe CBN alleged that Rise Vest Technologies Limited, Bamboo Systems Technology Limited, Chaka Technologies Limited and Trove Technologies Limited were complicit in operating without license as asset management companies \u201cand utilizing FX sourced from the Nigerian FX market for purchasing foreign bonds/shares in contravention of the CBN circular referenced TED/FEM/FPC/GEN/01/012, dated July 01, 2015.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor told Justice Ahmed Mohammed that the foreign exchange deals done with the defendants were making the Naira weaker to the United States dollars, hence, the need to block 15 of their accounts for about 180 days.\n\nNotably, all four companies affected by this action have gotten licenses from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate as digital platforms for buying and selling stocks.\n\nIn response to this announcement, Risevest\u2019s CEO Eke Eleanya Urum and Bamboo have come out on Twitter (that\u2019s banned) to assure users of Risevest that trading activities will continue as usual and the issue will be sorted out with the regulators.\n\nHey guys, in respect to the most recent news regarding @Risevest and our FX dealings, rest assured all user investments and funds are safely managed, funding and withdrawals will continue to be processed as normal and all our US operations are intact. \u2014 Indaboski of Investing \ud83d\ude80 (@eldivyn) August 17, 2021\n\nHi everyone, we\u2019re aware of the recent reports about us.

This action comes on the back of the recent move by the CBN to stop the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country, and a restriction on these platforms for not being duly registered in April.\n\nAccording to a source from one of the affected companies, they lost a lot of users and deposits after the April announcement.

          "title": "Nigerian startup checks out of Afghanistan post Taliban takeover",
          "text": "Yesterday, a horrific video from Afghanistan broke the internet. Hundreds of Afghans, in a desperate bid to flee the country, were captured in the footage running after and clinging to the body of a US Air Force plane as it prepared to depart Kabul airport.\n\nOver the weekend, the Taliban hijacked the government and assumed total control of the capital city\u2014 it wasn\u2019t long before they had the whole country to themselves. The central government was disbanded; Ashraf Ghani, the president of Afghanistan fled the scene unannounced, leaving what remained of his administration in the mercy of the Taliban.\n\nAfghani citizens aren\u2019t the only ones affected by the current crisis. African entrepreneurs and skilled workers who run operations in Kabul are also dealing with the consequences of the Taliban\u2019s actions. How are they coping with this heat? Are they packing their loads and fleeing or are they staying put to see where the leaf drops?\n\nLast year Olumuyiwa Olowogboyega, former senior reporter, TechCabal, interviewed Vincent, a Nigeria Cybersecurity expatriate working out of Kabul, who described Afghanistan as a city on the edge, an unstable mountainous city with two presidents.\n\nMore recently, Chekkit, a Nigerian authentication and product tracking startup, expanded to Afghanistan after landing a partnership with the Afghanistan Ministry of Health to help in combating the endemic counterfeit medicine products in the country.\n\nIn a conversation with Tosin Adelowo, Chekkit CMO, I asked: why Afghanistan? Tosin disclosed that the country was urgently looking for a solution to the counterfeit market plaguing its cities and streets and \u201cChekkit has the perfect solution to the problem\u201d and that, alongside other brokering factors, is a major determinant of the expansion.\n\nAfter a successful pilot of Chekkit\u2019s drug verification solution in collaboration with their blockchain partner, Fantom Foundation (which was the major broker of the deal), the Afghanistan Ministry of Health announced the rollout of the service nationally on the 2nd of May 2021.\n\nNow, a little over three months later, Chekkit is pulling the plug on all its operations in Afghanistan. Their exit wasn\u2019t much of a decision as all their partners have been forced to exit the country.\n\n\u201cWe have discontinued our communication/operation in the region as our partners have also exited the region due to the civil unrest,\u201d Adelowo told TechCabal in an email. \u201dOur heart is with the people of Afghanistan and we pray for strength for them to withstand and surpass the current issues.\u201d\n\nChekkit\u2019s exit is just the beginning of a series of backward movements that are expected to happen in Afghanistan as a result of this unrest. And in the absence of Chekkit\u2019s solutions, and similar solutions in the market, there\u2019s a likelihood that counterfeit products will return with unchecked and unverified vengeance.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSince the takeover, different analyses have been released on the impact it will have on trade and economy of the country. According to Times Now, the Afghan economy has been reliant on international aid with a limited private sector. Nearly half (around 44%) of its workforce is in agriculture. Observers predict that with the Taliban in control, international trade will come to a standstill, leading to a surge in smuggling.\n\nThe prediction is already happening, we can see that international businesses and organisations are already closing shops and evacuating their people. Though after the capital takeover, the Taliban announced that the war is now over, can the dust settle that easily?\n\n\u201cToday is a great day for the Afghan people and the Mujahideen. They have witnessed the fruits of their efforts and their sacrifices for 20 years,\u201d Mohammad Naeem, the spokesman for the Taliban\u2019s political office, told Al Jazeera TV.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last year, the Nigerian tech industry has been the recipient of seemingly damaging policies, from the crypto ban to NIPOST\u2019s reversed regulations to the Lagos okada ban.\n\nA few days ago, rumours of an intended amendment to the National Information and Technology Development Agency (NITDA) Act 2007 circulated on social media.\n\nIt finally gained traction when a link to the leaked bill was released, and several screenshots of supposedly alarming provisions began to float all over social media.\n\nWhat is in the leaked bill, and how different is it from the subsisting Act? Does NITDA have new powers? Who does this affect? We took a fine-tooth comb through its hairs and found some surprising information.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho is NITDA?\n\nNITDA is the agency tasked with creating a framework for the planning, research, development, standardisation, application, coordination, monitoring, evaluation and regulation of Information Technology practices in Nigeria.\n\nThe Agency is currently under the purview of the Ministry of Information and Digital Economy. As part of its mandate, it provides regulations regarding data protection, registration of domination names, IT Clearance, among others.\n\nWhat powers does NITDA have?\n\nUnder the current Act, the Agency itself has no powers. On the other hand, NITDA\u2019s Board is clothed with five powers, none containing any hint of these new powers.\n\nWhat the Agency does have is a host of functions which increase from 14 to 24 in the leaked bill.\n\nIf this proposed bill is anything to go by, NITDA appears to be gearing up for a more active, albeit forceful reign.\n\nHas the bill been passed?\n\nNo, it has not. The National Assembly (NASS) has not received the bill as of yet.\n\nHowever, In March 2021, Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi, the Agency\u2019s DG, \u201cpresented a proposal for the realignment of \u2018NITDA Act 2007\u2019 with the tenets and ideals of Digital Economy Policy of the current administration, and indeed, the 4th Industrial Revolution before the relevant committees of both chambers of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nWho leaked the NITDA bill?\n\nThere is currently no accurate information as to who leaked the bill. It began circulating on social media, and conversations sprung up in dismay, anger, and disappointment. So far, attention has been paid to the provisions in Sections 6, 13, 20, and 27 as they seem to question the importance of ease of doing business to the government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2019, Nigeria ranked 131 out of 190 countries on the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business Index 2020 \u2014 measures the ease of doing business through a comparative assessment of regulatory environments.\n\nWhat does the new bill contain?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA first glance at the leaked bill reveals several new sections, one of which \u2014 Section 6 \u2014is proposing new powers be given to the Agency.\n\nAmong these worrying provisions is a new subsection which gives the Agency the power to \u201center premises, inspect, seize, seal, detain and impose administrative sanctions on erring persons and companies who contravene any provision of the Act subject to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nNITDA will also have the power to \u201cfix licencing and authorisation charges, collect fees and penalties as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions under this Act.\u201d\n\nThis bill would also introduce a new regime of licences and penalties.\n\nSection 20 would give NITDA power to issue regulations regarding licences and authorisations for operators in the information technology and digital economy sector \u2014 which the Agency is to determine.\n\nThese licences are classified into three categories: Product Licence, Service Provider Licence, and Platform Provider Licence.\n\nWith the number of licence regimes which Nigerian startups currently have to subscribe to, is there a possibility that there would be duplicity?\n\nAway from licences, we come to penalties.\n\nWhat are these penalties, and who do they affect?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by <a href=\u201dhttps://pixabay.com/users/Daniel_B_photos-2516277/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=1587300\u2033>Daniel Bone</a> from <a\n\nIf the leaked bill is to be believed, Section 13 says individuals found guilty of failing to comply with NITDA\u2019s rules would be fined not less than \u20a63 million ($7,283.82) or face one-year imprisonment, or both.\n\nOn the other hand, corporate bodies, if found guilty, would be liable to a fine of not less than \u20a630 million ($72,832.21). The \u2018principal officers\u2019 of the companies might also be imprisoned for two years or more.\n\nReferencing its proposed search powers, individuals or corporations that contravene the provision would be fined not less than \u20a63 million ($7,283.82) and \u20a630 million ($72,832.21), respectively. Prison terms range from a year to two for individuals and members within a corporate body.\n\nSurprisingly, there seems to be an error on offences with no penalties under the Act. In a preceding subsection, the leaked bill proposes a fine not exceeding \u20a630,000,000 ($72,832.21).\n\nOn the same subject, in a directly succeeding paragraph, it then provides for fines not exceeding \u20a63,000,000 ($7,283.82) and \u20a65,000,000 ($12,138.87) for first and subsequent offenders, respectively.\n\nWhat else is different in this bill?\n\nA good starting point is the penalties placed on offences. Under the current Act, first-time offenders are liable to at least one year imprisonment or a fine of \u20a6200,000 ($485.55), or both.\n\nFor subsequent offenders they are liable to at least two years imprisonment, a fine of \u20a6500,000 ($1,213.89), or both.\n\nThe leaked bill suggests an expansion of these penalties and no longer requires NITDA to collaborate with the Standards Organisation of Nigeria to enforce its regulations.\n\nOther new provisions include a broadened section on the functions of the Minister of Information and Digital Economy, new sections on administrative redress processes, rulemaking processes, and the establishment of a Digital Infrastructure and Service Provision Company \u2014 Galaxy Backbone\n\nWho is Galaxy Backbone?\n\nA look at the provision regarding the establishment of Galaxy Backbone reveals an interesting angle. One of the members of the Board is to be a representative of the Jigawa State Government.\n\nA look at Galaxy Backbone\u2019s website reveals no connection to the Jigawa State Government. It is an information technology and shared service provider wholly owned by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nAfter a more in-depth search, the name Galaxy Information Technology and Telecommunication (GITT) cropped up. The company, which provides a wide range of communication services, was founded by Ibrahim Saminu Turaki, former Governor of Jigawa State, in 2001.\n\nWhile the names are somewhat similar, there is seemingly no connection between the two companies.\n\nHowever, several tweets by different Twitter users suggest a relationship between the two companies.\n\nGalaxy Information Technology and Telecommunications Limited started as a Dutse-based ISP in 2001 and morphed into what is now Galaxy Backbone. The Federal Government and Jigawa State Government co-owned 51% while private stakeholders held 49%.\n\n\n\n*waltzes back to vacation mode* \u2014 'Gb\u00e9nga \u1e62\u1eb9\u0300san (@gbengasesan) August 16, 2021\n\nTech-wise, Jigawa state was ahead of its time. As far back as the early 2000s, Dutse, Hadejia and parts of Kazaure had metro Wifi.\n\n\n\nThey setup Galaxy Backbone, which OBJ was so impressed with that he told them they HAD to sell it to the FG (and in return, FG will host and use\u2026 \u2014 SuperSanusi (@supersanusi) August 17, 2021\n\nWhat is the National Information Technology Development Fund\n\n\n\n\n\n1st Image: Current Act, 2nd Image: Leaked Bill\n\nA major sticking point has been the NITDA fund as contained in the leaked bill.\n\nThe fund is to be financed in four specific ways. The first is a levy of 1% of the profit before tax of companies and enterprises contained in the Third Schedule of the bill with an annual turnover of \u20a6100,000,000 ($242,777.37) and above, which is tax-deductible.\n\nOther avenues include gifts, endowments, and grants-in-aid.\n\nIntriguingly, this is unchanged from the current Act. Several questions arise. Is NITDA implementing it currently? Are there issues with the current execution strategy? How does it plan to implement this?\n\nThe expanded powers of the Agency in Section 6 and the provision of penalties \u2014 not currently contained in the NITDA Act \u2014 suggest an answer.\n\nOther provisions such as the need for a pre-action notice, tax exemptions, and limitations to suits, uses of the fund remain unchanged\n\nWhich companies will pay the levy?\n\nUnder the current Act, the companies are:\n\nGSM Service Providers and all Telecommunications companies;\n\nCyber Companies and Internet Provider;\n\nPensions Managers and pension-related companies\n\nBanks and other Financial Institution\n\nInsurance Companies\n\nAs contained in the leaked bill, these companies are\n\nmobile and fixed telecommunications companies,\n\ninformation technology, e-commerce companies,\n\ndigital platform operators and providers,\n\nforeign digital platforms targeting the Nigerian market,\n\npensions managers and pension-related companies,\n\nbanks, financial institutions and companies providing financial services using information technology tools,\n\ninsurance companies, and\n\nsuch other companies and enterprises as determined by regulations from time to time by the Agency.\n\nEssentially, startups or companies in the above list will be affected if this bill is passed into law.\n\nThe way forward\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese draconian rules, if this exact bill is eventually submitted and passed into law by the National Assembly, could spell hard times for the Nigerian startup scene.\n\nThis is coming at a time when the Nigerian Startup Bill \u2014 a joint initiative by Nigeria\u2019s tech startup ecosystem and the Presidency to harness the potential of the digital economy through co-created regulations \u2014 is being prepared to be placed before NASS.\n\nAs contained on the website, \u201cThe Bill will ensure that Nigeria\u2019s laws and regulations are friendly, clear, planned and work for the tech ecosystem. This, we believe, will contribute to the creation of an enabling environment for growth, attraction and protection of investment in tech startups.\u201d\n\nIs there a possibility that the Nigerian Startup Bill might be declared dead on arrival if the leaked NITDA bill is published?\n\nIn July 2021, Flutterwave announced the appointment of a Regulatory and Government Relations Officer. Chances are, we may see this trend continue, with startups and companies taking pre-emptive steps to engage the government.",

However, in Nigeria, it gets tougher. From funding to power failure to low patronage of locally produced hardware, there are several challenges.\n\nTo improve hardware production in Nigeria, Tochukwu Clinton Chukwueke, Founder of Clintonel Innovation Centre (CIC), an engineering hub located in Aba, Abia State, Nigeria is hosting the Hardware Convention 2021 for hardware startups and entrepreneurs in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Chukwueke, the success seen in the software sector can be replicated in the hardware sector.\n\nSoftware applications in Nigeria have recorded a significant level of success, but they still need hardware to run. Chukwueke believes Nigeria will remain poor if it continues to import hardware.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s Chimgozirim Nwokoma gives details on the Chukwueke-hosted convention in this article: Everything you need to know about Hardware Convention 2021 holding in Aba\n\nMore companies will pay levies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks to a leaked bill, containing changes made to the National Information and Technology Development Agency (NITDA) Act 2007, have made the rounds on social media.\n\nHowever, the bill has not been presented to the National Assembly (NASS).\n\nIf presented and passed by the NASS, it gives NITDA the authority to add new licenses and stiffer penalties such as jail term for those who flout its rules.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the bill? It provides for the National Information Technology Development Fund which will be used for the \u201cadvancement of the country\u2019s digital economy objectives and related purposes.\u201d\n\nThe fund will be financed by a 1% levy on the profit before tax of companies with an annual turnover of \u20a6100,000,000 ($242,777.37), same as the current Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, companies paying the levy have increased.\n\nPer the leaked bill, the companies include, banks and financial institutions, mobile and fixed telecommunications companies, information technology companies, e-commerce companies, and insurance companies.\n\nOur reporter, Ogheneruemu Oneyibo, has taken a clean sweep through the leaked bill and will tell you all about it later today.\n\nNigerians and data privacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: <a href=\u201dhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/143601516@N03/29723649810/\u201d>Visual Content</a> Flickr via <a href=\u201dhttp://compfight.com\u201d>Compfight</a> <a href=\u201dhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\u201d>cc</a>\n\nSoko Lending Company, a Nigerian online lending platform has been slammed with a \u20a610 million ($24,277) fine by the National Information and Technology Development Agency (NITDA) for privacy invasion.\n\nAccording to NITDA, it received several complaints accusing the company of divulging important customer data and defamation of character.\n\nNITDA says on one occasion, the company sent \u201cprivacy invading messages\u201d to a defaulting customer\u2019s contacts when they did not pay back a loan. A scenario that is quite familiar to most Nigerians.\n\nAre Nigerians starting to care about privacy? A Twitter poll we conducted in January 2021, revealed that 118 \u2014 56.2% \u2014 of 210 people did not care about WhatsApp\u2019s privacy update.\n\nOver the years, Nigerians seem to have divulged their personal data with no thought to its protection.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nHUMAN RIGHTS WRITERS ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIA (HURIWA) has condemned the Plateau State governor for standing by and watching in an unbelievable way as Plateau State Christians are killed, stating that, this shows weakness on the part of the state governor, Simon Lalong.\n\n\u201cThe Plateau State governor Mr. Simon Lalong has indeed proven time without number to be a very weak leader of his people who have consistently come under persistent and vicious attacks against Plateau Christian native communities by armed Fulani herdsmen. The Christian communities were constantly attacked but Simon Lalong took no drastic security action not until unknown gunmen wickedly shot and killed scores of innocent Moslem travelers then he woke up from slumber exactly when the biased Presidency officials started barking like attack dogs, the Plateau State weak governor then declared a 24hours curfew but this measure did not stop the invasion of Plateau communities again for the umpteenth time by armed Fulani herdsmen who massacred many Christians.\u201d\n\nThe Rights group wondered how armed Fulani herdsmen beat the military curfew in Plateau state in the last twenty-four hours and killed many people just as the Prominent Civil Rights Advocacy group carpeted the General officer commanding 3rd division of the Nigerian Army, the Director of Department of state services, Commissioner of Police for doing nothing to prevent the renewed violence.\n\n\u201cThe Irigwe people who are hosts of the headquarters of 3rd Army division in Jos had alleged complicity between the Army Commander and the killer Fulani squads but the Federal and Plateau State administrations said nothing but the President only spoke out when some innocent Moslem travelers coming from Bauchi to Ondo were killed by unknown gunmen and this selective outrage by Federal government is despicable and reprehensible. President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s outrage against the dastardly act of terror against the scores of Moslem travellers by unknown gunmen becomes ludicrous when we realise that this same President and his officials said nothing when on many occasions armed Fulani herdsmen invaded Plateau State communities and killed natives.\n\nThey equally recalled that in 2018, the Plateau State Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association justified the massacre of over 100 native Christians in Plateau State because according to them, it was a retaliation for the theft of 100 cows but President Muhammadu Buhari never ordered the arrest of this supporter of mass murder but he woke up from slumber in 2021 when some terrorists attacked innocent Moslem travelers.\n\nIt\u2019s over 18 hours since it was reported that armed marauders invaded communities in Plateau State amidst the so called curfew but we are yet to hear one word of condemnation and action from President Muhammadu Buhari\u201d.\n\nAccording to HURIWA, despite the dusk-to-dawn curfew imposed on Bassa and other two Local Government Areas, suspected herdsmen on Tuesday night killed five persons in Chando-Zrrechi (Tafi-Gana) of Miango District in Bassa Plateau State. The gunmen reportedly stormed the communities, shooting sporadically. The community leader called on security operatives and government to put a stop to the killings.\n\nHURIWA therefore, is charging the Plateau State governor to stand up, speak out and take concrete action to stop the attacks on Christians by armed Fulani herdsmen and indeed stop all attacks on citizens irrespective of their Ethno-Religious affiliation. \u201cPlateau State governor by his lacklustre approach to the genocides in Plateau State since 2015 is showing that he is a failed Chief executive of Plateau State and history and posterity will judge him harshly\u201d.\n\n...",

What we need to do is to engender citizen participation and achieve inclusiveness. Today, the ratio of citizens who pay taxes relative to the population is very, very small and the burden is only on a few persons who pay tax.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody who has a source of income, by law, should pay money to the state. That is what we are trying to do by ensuring that everybody pays something directly to the state government\u2019s treasury,\u201d he said.\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cWe want to make sure that we re-energize the service. Right now, we are not meeting our budget in terms of revenue collection in the state. There are still lots of leaks. We believe that we can achieve better efficiency by restructuring the way revenue is collected in the state.\n\n\u201cThe meeting today is to meet with members of staff of EIRS, work with them and redesign the revenue collection system in the state. Before now, it was quite centralized. What we are looking at is to have a team with almost semi-independent offices across the 18 local government areas of the state that will be responsible for all the taxes that will be collected in that area.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other reform that we are looking at is to collaborate with the local government, so that we can consolidate both the taxes the local government is supposed to collect and the one accruable to the state. That way, we can reduce the burden on our citizens,\u201d he said.\n\n...",

          "text": "Women hold less than 25 percent of board positions in companies quoted on the Nigerian Exchange Limited\u2019s (NGX) top 20 quoted companies, a report on board gender diversity trends in Nigeria\u2019s corporate organisations has shown.\n\nAccording to the report, 56 seats (23.4 percent) out of 239 board seats available in the top 20 companies were held by women, while 183 seats (76.6 per cent) were held by men during the period under review.\n\nThis represented a marginal increase of 2.5 per cent, compared with the 20.9 per cent recorded the previous year.\n\nThe report titled, \u201cThe 2021 PWR NGX Top 20 Gender Diversity Scorecard,\u201d however, showed that the number of female board chairpersons decreased from three in 2020, to two in 2021, adding that none of the top 20 companies were led by a female CEO during the period under review.\n\nThe report was derived from a study by the PWR Advisory, a leadership, diversity and inclusion advisory and advocacy firm.\n\nIt also showed that female representation in Nigeria\u2019s corporate board was slightly better than Ghana\u2019s 23 per cent, but lower than South Africa\u2019s 29 per cent.\n\nThe PWR Advisory stated that the top 20 companies were selected based on the size of their market capitalisation on the NGX.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, 23.4 per cent of board directorships of the NGX\u2019s top 20 companies by market capitalisation are held by women. This is slightly up from 20.9 per cent in 2020,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cThe 25 per cent of the top 20 companies have at least 30 per cent female representation on their boards. Last year 30 per cent of the top 20 companies met these criteria.\n\n\u201cTen per cent of the companies have female board chairs against 15 per cent in 2020. These companies are all banks as was the case in 2020. Same as last year, none of the 20 companies on the list has a female CEO. Two companies on the list do not have any female representation on their boards. There was only one company in this category in 2020.\u201d\n\nThe five highest ranked performers were Lafarge Cement, Stanbic IBTC Holdings, Nigerian Breweries, Access Bank and Guaranty Trust Holdings Company.\n\nLafarge, IBTC and Nigerian Breweries earned four stars each, which signified 40 per cent or more of female representation, while Access Bank and Guaranty Trust got three stars each, indicating 30 per cent or more female board representation.\n\nSectoral breakdown of the figures further revealed that the financial sector is the most gender-friendly in terms of female representation in their boards with 29.67 per cent while the consumer goods sector was the least gender sensitive in their board compositions with 17.46 per cent.\n\nThe oil and gas scored 21.43 per cent while ICT and the industrial goods sectors earned 20 per cent each.\n\nThe report added: \u201cTwenty per cent of the banks in the NGX Top 20 have at least 30 per cent female board representation. (This does not include Holding companies with banking subsidiaries).\n\n\u201cThe Central Bank of Nigeria stipulates 30 per cent female representation on the boards of Nigerian commercial banks. In the financial services sector, 28.6 per cent of the boards in this list are chaired by women. Across the other sectors represented (consumer goods, industrial goods, ICT & oil/gas), none of the boards are chaired by women.\u201d\n\nThe Founder of the PWR Advisory, Ms. Ivana Osagie, who presented the gender diversity scorecard, said the 2021 report was meant to build on the momentum that was galvanised by the inaugural edition last year in corporate Nigeria, which raised awareness of the business case for gender diversity in boardrooms.\n\nOsagie noted that, \u201csince then there has been a slight increase in the number of appointments of women to boards, particularly as non-executive directors and as managing directors. This is not necessarily in listed companies.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that Nigerian businesses will greatly benefit from having a greater diversity of perspectives in boardrooms and on executive leadership teams. While some progress has been recorded, it is minimal and far from satisfactory. Much more needs to be done to accelerate the rate of change and unlock untapped value.\n\n\u201cBusinesses and communities in Nigeria and across the African continent will reap significant economic return by fully unleashing the potential of half the population. Corporate boards as custodians of economic prosperity have a key role to play in achieving this,\u201d noting that \u201cthere is safety in diversity\u201d because \u201cit\u2019s a win-win for all.\u201d",

          "text": "The Ogun State Police Command says it has arrested four members of a syndicate who specialise in robbing and killing Point of Sale (POS) operators and Uber drivers in the state.\n\nAbimbola Oyeyemi, the command\u2019s spokesperson who made the disclosure in a statement on Thursday, said the suspects narrated how they carry out their heinous crimes.\n\nAccording to Oyeyemi, the suspects: Kehinde Saliu Jelili, aka Oluomo, Abiodun Akinola, Johnson Fakeye, and Jamiu Akinola were arrested after officers acted on a report lodged at Onipanu divisional headquarters on April 18 by a POS attendant, Aanu Salaudeen.\n\nHe said Salaudeen told the police that her boss, Abiodun Odebunmi got missing after he went to meet a customer with a cash sum of N4, 000, 000 to be used for a POS transaction.\n\nAccording to her, they had done a transaction of N1.5 million with the person who invited his boss the previous day, and that it was the same person who called his boss to meet him at Ojuore for another POS transaction of N4 million.\n\nThe burnt corpse of the victim was, however, discovered in an uncompleted building at Arobieye area of Ota albeit with no trace of the assailants.\n\nThe police further launched an investigation which led to the arrest of one of the kidnap kingpins who said their chief victims are POS operators and Uber drivers. The other three suspects were arrested in connection with the crime.\n\nThe statement partly read, \u201cThe case was transferred to the homicide section of the state criminal investigation and intelligence department on the order of the commissioner of police, Edward Awolowo Ajogun, who mandated the homicide team to unravel the perpetrators of the dastardly act within the shortest possible period.\n\n\u201cThe CSP Femi Olabode-led homicide team, in compliance with the CP\u2019s directive, embarked on a technical and intelligence-based investigation, which led them to Otun Ekiti in Ekiti state where the suspect was discovered to be hibernating.\n\n\u201cOn getting to Ekiti, the suspect got wind of the presence of the detectives and quickly escaped to Offa in Kwara state. With determination to apprehend him, the team continued trailing him and they later got information that he was in Benin Republic, where he had gone to attend the court session of Chief Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, and that he would soon be coming to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHaving gotten the information about the day he would be returning to Nigeria, the team laid ambush for him and got him arrested at the boundary between Ogun and Lagos states. On interrogation, Kehinde Salihu Jeili, who claimed to be a native of Apomu in Osun state confessed to killing the victim.\n\n\u201cHe confessed further that he deliberately lured the victim to Ota where he and his gang members were waiting for him with the money he was asked to bring, having transacted a N1.5 million business with him the previous day, and that they macheted him to death after collecting the money from him. He stated further that they burnt the victim\u2019s body to cover their tracks.\n\n\u201cHe confessed further that their targeted victims are always Uber and POS operators. According to him, one of them will pretend as a passenger to the Uber driver and will lure such a driver to where his members were waiting, and as soon as he got to the place, the driver will be hacked to death and the car will be taken away to their receiver.\n\n\u201cAlso, the suspect stated further that he and his gang attacked another victim of their criminal act one Idowu Ademiluyi at Itori area and snatched his Toyota Corolla car, having macheted him to the point of death.\n\nThe arrest of Kehinde Salihu led the detectives to their receiver, Abiodun Akinola who is a standby buyer of all the proceeds of their crime.\n\n\u201cThe confessional statements of the duo led to the arrest of the other two suspects, Johnson Fakeye and Akinola Jamiu at Atan Ota and Owode Yewa respectively. One Toyota Camry, one Toyota Corolla, and one Toyota Rave 4, whose owners had been gruesomely murdered were recovered from the gang.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the commissioner of police, Ajogun, commended the team for the investigation which lasted for almost three months.\n\nHe, however, noted that it is not over until the last member of the gang is arrested. Ajogun, therefore, appealed to members of the public to always disclose their movements to a trusted person, whenever they have cause to keep an appointment with an unknown person.\n\nThe police boss has also directed that the suspects be charged to court as soon as the investigation is concluded.",

This gold in the 4\u00d7400m Mixed Relay event is for all Nigerians and this should serve as the perfect start the new board of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) needs to correct the ills of the immediate past and return Nigeria among the major athletics nations in the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI remember how dominant we were in the early years of the championship when we dominated the sprint and quarter mile events. I still vividly recall how Tina Iheagwan, Falilat Ogunkoya and Mary Onyali dominated the 100m and 200m events at the inaugural edition of the championship in Athens in 1986. I also remember we won the women\u2019s 400m in successive editions. Who will forget how Francis Obikwelu became the second sprinter to win the 100m and 200m in 1996 in Sydney, Australia?\u201d Dare asked.\n\nHe challenged the Okowa-led AFN to build on the successes it will record in Nairobi. \u201cI am calling on the AFN to ensure the athletes discovered here are monitored and given the necessary encouragement to make them follow in the footsteps of their predecessors like Falilat Ogunkoya, Mary Onyali, Ese Brume, Chioma Ajunwa and Blessing Okagbare who grew to become individual Olympic medalists for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the duo of Godson Oghenebrume and Praise Ofokwu also qualified for the 100m men and women\u2019s final scheduled for today, Thursday.\n\nOghenebrume ran a time of 10.22 seconds to win his semifinal heat, while Ofoku was also first in her semifinal heat, clocking 11.57.\n\nIn the men\u2019s javelin throw, Chinecherem Nnamdi threw a massive new personal best and Nigeria\u2019s U-20 record of 78.03 to qualify for the final. Nnamdi, the African Games bronze medalist added almost 5cm to his previous best of 73.24m to jump ahead of the queue as one of the favourites for the gold medal in the category.",

Consequently, the zone has been inundated with an unusually large number of ex-insurgents and former ISWAP fighters.\n\n\u201cThis has created a humanitarian responsibility for the state government. Consequently, the state governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum, yesterday appealed to both the Federal Government (FG) and the Nigerian Army to assist the state in resettling the surrendering fighters.\n\n\u201cMURIC joins the hardworking Governor Zulum in appealing to both FG and the Nigerian Army to do everything possible in assisting the state government in resettling and reintegrating. A governor who spends most of the day with troops at the war front and most of the night walking around the city, visiting hospitals and teaching in classrooms to ensure that all sectors are working needs to be supported.\n\n\u201cWe lay emphasis on the fact that peace-making is cheaper than fighting wars while meaningful development and growth can only occur in a peaceful environment. FG should therefore go all out in ensuring that its deradicalizing process is accompanied by stomach infrastructure and economic resettlement.\n\n\u201cBoko Haram insurgents and ISWAP fighters who are surrendering should be resettled and trained invocations that can enable them to cater for themselves and their families in future. Quick and meaningful resettlement will encourage the remaining insurgents and fighters to embrace peace.\n\n\u201cMURIC also appeals to the civilian population in Borno to manifest a spirit of accommodation and integration of remorseful insurgents and fighters. We warn against the stigmatization of any sort. Returning fighters should be treated like brothers newly found. What they need is our understanding, cooperation and kindness.\n\n\u201cAs we round off, we remind both FG and the Nigerian Army that it is more important to win the war than to win the battle. Battles are won in trenches, but the war can only be won in the minds of men. Only a swift, effective and meaningful resettlement of remorseful Boko Haram insurgents and ISWAP fighters can win the real war, the statement read.",

Chukwuma Umeoji and Chief Jude Okeke, who were both recognized by the Independent National Electoral Commission.\n\nThis comes after the High Court of Owerri today dismissed a new court action brought by Victor Oye to stop Chukwuma Umeoji and reaffirmed its earlier judgment declaring the Owerri Convention, which produced Jude Okeke as APGA Chairman, valid and ordering INEC to accept and continue to recognize and publish the name of Hon. Chukwuma Umeoji, who emerged as APGA Governors.\n\nThis decision came after Chief Victor Oye submitted an application for a stay of execution and leave to appeal, in which the court gave him leave to appeal but declined to grant him a stay of execution, instead opting to confirm its prior decision.\n\nThe court specifically stated that INEC cannot avoid its legal obligation to carry out, obey, and comply with the court\u2019s orders declaring Umeoji candidate, and that INEC has a legal obligation to continue to carry out, obey, and comply with the extant, valid, and subsisting judgment of this Court delivered on July 28, 2021, which declared Umeoji candidate and ordered INEC to continue to recognize him and Jude Okeke pending the outcome of the appeal.\n\nINEC is directly barred by today\u2019s judgement from seeking to delete Umeoji\u2019s name as an APGA candidate off its list, as it was rumored that it was under pressure to do so.\n\nOn August 10, 2021, the Court of Appeal Kano Division overturned another judgment of the Jigawa High Court, which held that Chief Jude Okeke is the National Chairman of the APGA and that only the governorship Congress held by him is valid, without making any orders as to who the party\u2019s candidate should be.\n\nThe Kano Appeal Court did not go into detail about who should be the party\u2019s candidate, between Prof. Charles Soludo and Hon. Chukwuma Umeoji, in a contentious decision that reversed their earlier ruling that the appeal was statute-barred because it was filed before the election, but still declared the judgment null and void for lack of fair hearing and jurisdiction without making any consequential decisions.",

The N4.973 trillion unsubstantiated balances are above the materiality level of N89.34 billion set for the Audit.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cIn auditing, materiality means not just a quantified amount, but the effect that amount will have in various contexts. During the auditing planning process, the auditor decides what the level of materiality will be, taking into account the entirety of the financial statements to be audited.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the auditor-general said required queries were issued against agencies found to be involved in the infractions.\n\nHe told the CAN, who was represented by Deputy Clerk to the National Assembly (DCNA) Bala Yabani that auditing of consolidated financial statement of the federal government on yearly basis, would be expeditiously carried out as made available by the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that on the 25th of March this year, Audit of Consolidated Financial Statement of the Federal Government for the 2018 was submitted to this office for the required investigation of queries raised in it by the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cJust five months after, we are here again to make submission of the 2019 Audit Report,\u201d Aghughu also said.\n\nHe, however, lamented that his office was not working the way it should due to myriad of factors crippling its operations, thus giving room for all forms of financial infractions across the various MDAs.\n\n\u201cOne of such problems is the absence of Federal Audit Service Law which is a big challenge as far as effective and efficient public sector auditing is concerned.\n\n\u201cThis is a law that is needed as basis of fiscal sustainability. Absence of it at the federal level is very worrisome going by the fact that some of the states of the Federation have the required law in place.\n\n\u201cAnother problem incapacitating optimal functionality of our mandate as far as thorough and appropriate auditing of financial statements of the MDAs are concerned, is gross underfunding which is telling much on our efficiency.\n\n\u201cFor example, the office is understaffed but there is no money for recruitment. Imagine many of our state offices, having just two or three staff. Auditing is done by a team not by an individual.\n\n\u201cAccommodation is also part of the problem as our staff in Lagos are about to be evicted from their office due to litigations.\n\n\u201cThese are aside problem of insecurity seriously affecting our scope of coverage,\u201d he lamented.\n\nReceiving the report, DCNA Yabani said the report would be submitted to the CNA for onward submission to both Senate President Ahmad Lawan and Speaker House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila for the required legislative consideration.\n\nHe added that all the complaints made by the AGF would be tabled before the leadership of the National Assembly for required actions and solutions.\n\n\u201cYour complaints are very germane. They will surely be conveyed to the appropriate quarters that will surely do the needful on them because the people heading the quarters have listening ears,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Following the uncertainty that for long surrounded the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) and the consequent lack of progress and stagnation in the industry, Nigeria lost an estimated $50 billion worth of investments in 10 years, President Muhammadu Buhari has said.\n\nBuhari spoke Wednesday at a brief ceremony to celebrate the signing of the Bill into an Act shortly before the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting in Abuja.\n\nHe said the stagnation stunted the nation\u2019s economic growth and its prosperity.\n\nThe president cited lack of political will on the part of past administrations to actualise the needed transformation.\n\nWith the Act, Buhari said, the decades of uncertainty and under-investment in the petroleum industry were gone.\n\n\u201cWe are all aware that past Administrations have identified the need to further align the industry for global competitiveness, but there was lack of political will to actualise this needed transformation.\n\n\u201cThis lack of progress has stagnated the growth of the industry and the prosperity of our economy. In the past ten years, Nigeria has lost an estimated US$50 billion worth of investments due to uncertainty created by the non-passage of the PIB.\n\n\u201cThis administration believes that the timely passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill will help our country attract investments across the oil and gas value chain.\n\n\u201cIn view of the value our Nation and investors will derive from a stable fiscal framework for the oil and gas industry, our Administration has found it necessary to work with the two Chambers of the National Assembly to ensure the passage of the PIB,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari further said signing the bill was part of the administration\u2019s commitment to building a competitive and resilient petroleum industry that would attract investment, improve our revenue base, create jobs and support our economic diversification agenda.\n\nHe said as a \u201cnation that depends on oil resources for the development of other sectors, Nigeria runs a Petroleum Industry that is governed largely by laws enacted over 50 years ago such as the principal legislation; the Petroleum Act of 1969 and other obsolete legislations.\u201d\n\nBuhari further said the transition of the bill to \u201cPetroleum Industry Act 2021\u201d marked the beginning of the journey towards a competitive and resilient petroleum industry that would attract investments to support the nation\u2019s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.\n\n\u201cThe Petroleum Industry Act 2021 creates a regulatory environment that would ensure efficiency and accountability across the oil and gas value chain and reposition NNPC to a commercially driven National Petroleum Company that is accountable to the Federation.\n\n\u201cThe Act also provides for a direct benefit framework that will enable sustainable development of Host Communities. I appeal to the host communities to look carefully at the contents of the Bill which in the implementation will bring real and lasting benefits to them.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the Act provides for deliberate end to gas flaring which would facilitate the attainment of Nigeria\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions of the Paris Agreement through a funding mechanism to support gas flare out project in host communities,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari said the administration believes that the timely passage of the PIB \u201cwill help our country attract investments across the oil and gas value chain.\u201d\n\nDirects implementation\n\nWhile directing immediate implementation of the framework for the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the president urged all relevant stakeholders to comply and reposition for full activation within 12 months.\n\nPresident Buhari said the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, would head the implementation team, urging all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDA) to adjust to the transition, designed to reposition the economy.\n\n\u201cTo consolidate the commitment of this administration to delivering the value proposition of this law, I have approved an implementation framework commencing immediately to ensure the industry envisaged in the new law begins to take shape.\n\n\u201cThe implementation process to be headed by the Hon Minister of State, Petroleum Resources is hereby tasked with the completion of the implementation of this act within 12 months. I am therefore directing all relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government to fully cooperate in ensuring the successful and timely implementation of this law,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president commended the leadership of the 9th Assembly for their continued pursuit of national aspiration and demonstration of mutual harmony with the Executive in the pursuit of patriotic outcome in passage of PIB.\n\n\u201cI also commend the entire team in the executive that worked tirelessly to ensure the delivery of this strategic legislation for our country. I thank Nigerians and other industry stakeholders for their contributions and support in achieving this historic landmark,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by Senate President Dr. Ahmed Lawan, Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege, Deputy Speaker House of Representatives Ahmed Idris Wase and other lawmakers, members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) and NNPC Group Managing Director Mele Kyari.\n\nNames implementation committee\n\nMeanwhile, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, has announced members of the steering committee to be headed by Mr Sylva.\n\nOther members are: Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Group Managing Director, NNPC, Executive Chairman, FIRS, Representative of the Ministry of Justice, Representative of the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Natural Resources, Olufemi Lijadu as External Legal Adviser, while the Executive Secretary, Petroleum Technology Development Fund serves as Head of the Coordinating Secretariat and the Implementation Working Group.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cThe primary responsibility of the steering committee shall be to guide the effective and timely implementation of the PIA in the course of transition to the petroleum industry envisaged in the reform program, and ensure that the new institutions created have the full capability to deliver on their mandate under the new legislation.\u201d\n\nThe committee has 12-month duration for the assignment during which periodic updates would be given to Mr President, Adesina stated.\n\n\u20183% to host communities recipe for crises\u2019\n\nBut Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike has said the provision for direct disbursement of 3 percent to host communities in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) is a recipe for sustained communal conflicts which would eventually negate whatever good the federal government had intended to achieve with the provision.\n\nThe governor also said without a legal machinery to manage both the identification of host communities and disbursement and distribution of funds due to the beneficiaries, they would be thrown into unnecessary wrangling.\n\nWhile acknowledging the courage of the 9th National Assembly to eventually pass the PIB and the consequent presidential assent, the governor however picked holes in the Act.\n\nHe said the failure to establish a legal machinery to manage the funds would set the stage for untoward controversies among the communities and the International Oil Companies (IOCs).\n\nSpeaking on Channels Television programme (Politics Today) Tuesday evening, the governor said the IOCs would exploit the loopholes to deny the host communities their entitlements as prescribed by the Act.\n\nWike said by the Act, the IOCs have the powers to define who gets what and also administer the funds to those they were willing to identify.\n\n\u201cThe 3 percent will be paid directly to the host communities to manage. Besides, the government and the operators (IOCs) will identify the host communities. Now, who defines who a host community is? The operator. How can a businessman define who his host community is? I believe that is wrong.\n\n\u201cThis could pose a problem because I have seen IOCs deliberately put the heads of two communities together to create crises in order not to meet its Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed with the communities and turned up to argue that because the communities are at loggerheads they can\u2019t do what they signed in the MoU with the community.\n\n\u201cEven in terms of managing this fund, it will create a problem knowing the acts of these IOCs. They will sponsor factions in the community to make sure they don\u2019t pay 3 percent to the community; make some go to court for all sorts of frivolities and turn round to say \u2018we have court injunction not to release the money\u2019. As a council chairman and now state governor, I know the antecedents of the IOCs in this regard.\n\n\u201cIn fact, in some cases the IOCs have sponsored chieftaincy tussles in order not to carry out their responsibilities to the communities. I was thinking that the government would have a hand in order to monitor the spending of such funds,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor further said \u201cpaying the money directly to any host community and leaving it alone to manage the fund will cause a lot of crises. There should be something to checkmate the communities. A provision for a board to monitor the disbursement of the fund would have been adequate.\u201d\n\nHe further said the president ought to have consulted widely before assenting to the bill, saying such consultation would have enabled him identify the loopholes as well as address the inadequacy of the 3 percent provided.\n\n\u201cThe House of Representatives passed 5 percent and the Senate 3 percent. I thought the president should have seen that the amount is not enough to tackle the issue of environmental pollution. How do you reconcile this, you are giving the host communities 3 percent and giving frontier states 30 percent for the exploration of crude oil?\n\n\u201cYou have explored and got oil in an environment and in doing that they have environmental crises and you make provision for 3 percent to the host communities and then you allocate 30 percent from the purse of the NNPC to the frontier states to go explore for oil, how do you balance it?\u201d the governor queried.\n\nHe said a careful consideration of the plight of the people of Niger Delta could have engendered a statesmanship in him, and not playing politics with such sensitive issue.",

          "text": "Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, has highlighted that like in other sectors, the challenge of poor and non-proactive leadership has reduced the impact of Trade Unions across sectors in the country.\n\nThis, he said has contributed to a lack of trust by members and wrong strategies by union leaders in addressing the myriads of issues that regularly call for attention.\n\nThe minister who made this assertion on Wednesday at a two-day Strategic Workshop on Industrial Harmony by the Joint Aviation Trade Unions Forum in Owerri, Imo State, thus noted that the solution is to ensure that only \u201cqualified, tested, and trusted leaders who are true workers should be voted into leadership positions at the local, state, and national level\u201d.\n\nSirika who was represented by James Odaoudu, Director Public Affairs of the Ministry, harped that it is only leaders with integrity that will have the courage to face employers objectively and call their members to order when things go wrong.\n\n\u201cIn addition, union leaders should be properly trained and educated to know the basic labour laws to plan their actions within the confine of the laws to avoid pursuing shadows while leaving the substance, especially during collective bargaining and conflict resolution engagements.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we will continue to support the involvement of union leaders and workers in our policy and decision-making processes. This is because, when issues arise at the workplace between managers and the employee, union representatives remain the channels to secure \u201cwin-win\u201d situations in which both sides feel as if they each attained something from the deal,\u201d he added.\n\nSirika advised that it has become imperative for unionists, especially in the aviation sector to firm up, given the fact that the sector has \u201centered the critical stage of the implementation of our aviation sector development roadmap, we need all hands on deck to ensure its success. Only an environment of industrial harmony can guarantee that\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the Nigerian aviation sector, I dare say that the various labour unions have tried to play this role effectively. This role enables labour unions to ensure that cordial and good understanding between employers and employees could be established in the workplace and leads to a harmonious and conducive working environment. It is such an environment that results in higher organizational and individual productivity,\u201d Sirika added.",

The Inspector-General of Police can facilitate admission of Sierra Leone youths into the police training schools in the country.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Sierra Leone Minister of Interior revealed that the President of his country has flagged off his star project in the area of human capital development which necessitated the idea of sending some Police officers to attend the \u201cStrategic Leadership Training Course\u201d at the Nigerian Institute of Police Studies, adding that the President endorsed their attendance of the graduation ceremony coming up today (Thursday).\n\nPanda-Noah stressed the urgent need for African countries to unite, synergize and collaborate in order to combat transnational challenges.\n\nHe said: \u201cAfrica has their own unique problems which only Africans can solve. Supporting one another is key to tackling the challenges which have bedeviled Africa and the world at large. The collaboration is very important to us and would enable our officers to have a seamless understanding of how to curb crimes in the region.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the people of Sierra Leone would never forget the help rendered by Nigeria about two decades ago to overcome the civil war in his country.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday in Abuja said Nigeria lost an estimated $50billion worth of investments in 10 years.\n\nThis, according to him, was a result of the uncertainty of the non-passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), lack of progress and stagnation in the petroleum industry.\n\nIn his remarks at a ceremony on passage of the PIA, which preceded the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, the President said the stagnation affected the growth of the economy, citing lack of political will on the part of past administrations to actualize the needed transformation.\n\nPresident Buhari said assent of the Petroleum Industry Bill on August 16, 2021, marked the end of decades of uncertainty and under-investment in the petroleum industry.\n\n\u201cWe are all aware that past administrations have identified the need to further align the industry for global competitiveness, but there was a lack of political will to actualize this needed transformation.\n\n\u201cThis lack of progress has stagnated the growth of the industry and the prosperity of our economy. In the past ten years, Nigeria has lost an estimated US$50billion worth of investments due to uncertainty created by the non-passage of the PIB.\n\n\u201cThis administration believes that the timely passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill will help our country attract investments across the oil and gas value chain.\n\n\u201cIn view of the value our Nation and investors will derive from a stable fiscal framework for the oil and gas industry, our Administration has found it necessary to work with the two chambers of the National Assembly to ensure the passage of the PIB,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAccording to a statement by his special media aide, Femi Adesina, the President noted that the signing of the bill was part of the administration\u2019s commitment to building a competitive and resilient petroleum industry that will attract investment, improve the country\u2019s revenue base, create jobs and support the economic diversification agenda.\n\nRead Also: Buhari Approves Committee To Implement Petroleum Industry Act Immediately\n\nPresident Buhari said as a \u201cnation that depends on oil resources for the development of other sectors, Nigeria runs a Petroleum Industry that is governed largely by laws enacted over 50 years ago such as the principal legislation; the Petroleum Act of 1969 and other obsolete legislations.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to him, the Presidential assent of the bill to \u201cPetroleum Industry Act 2021\u201d marked the beginning of the journey towards a competitive and resilient petroleum industry that will attract investments to support the nation\u2019s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Petroleum Industry Act 2021\u2019 creates a regulatory environment that would ensure efficiency and accountability across the oil and gas value chain and reposition NNPC to a commercially driven National Petroleum Company that is accountable to the Federation.\n\n\u201cThe Act also provides for a direct benefit framework that will enable sustainable development of host communities. I appeal to the host communities to look carefully at the contents of the Bill which in the implementation will bring real and lasting benefits to them.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the Act provides for deliberate end to gas flaring which would facilitate the attainment of Nigeria\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions of the Paris Agreement through a funding mechanism to support gas flare out project in host communities,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nPresident Buhari said the administration believes that the timely passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill will help the country attract investments across the oil and gas value chain.\n\nWhile directing immediate implementation of the framework for the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), he urged all relevant stakeholders to comply and reposition for full activation within 12 months.\n\nThe President said the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, will head the implementation team, urging all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDA) to adjust to the transition, designed to reposition the economy.\n\n\u201cTo consolidate the commitment of this administration to delivering the value proposition of this law, I have approved an implementation framework commencing immediately to ensure the industry envisaged in the new law begins to take shape.\n\n\u201cThe implementation process to be headed by the Hon Minister of State, Petroleum Resources is hereby tasked with the completion of the implementation of this act within 12 months. I am, therefore, directing all relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government to fully cooperate in ensuring the successful and timely implementation of this law,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari commended the leadership of the 9th Assembly for what he described as their continued pursuit of national aspiration and demonstration of mutual harmony with the executive in the pursuit of patriotic outcome in the passage of the PIB.\n\n\u201cI also commend the entire team in the executive that worked tirelessly to ensure the delivery of this strategic legislation for our country. I thank Nigerians and other industry stakeholders for their contributions and support in achieving this historic landmark,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by the Senate President, Dr. Ahmed Lawan, Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, Deputy Speaker Hon. Ahmed Idris Wase and other lawmakers, members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) and Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mele Kyari.",

          "text": "Arguably the world\u2019s largest producer of opium with as much as 16% or more of Afghanistan\u2019s economy dependent on the cultivation and sale of opium, There has been a boom in heroin production in recent years, which has helped fund the Taliban.\n\nDespite their promise to wean themselves off the profitable trade, experts say they will struggle in keeping the economy afloat.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday at a first press conference since taking power, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid promised that the new government would not turn the world\u2019s leading producer of opium into a fully-fledged narco-state.\n\n\u201cWe are assuring our countrymen and women and the international community, we will not have any narcotics produced,\u201d Mujahid told reporters in Kabul.\n\n\u201cFrom now on, nobody\u2019s going to get involved (in the heroin trade), nobody can be involved in drug smuggling.\u201d\n\nBut the anti-heroin rhetoric \u2014 like similar pledges to respect human rights and media freedom \u2014 are seen by analysts as part of efforts by the new Taliban leaders to show a more moderate face in order to secure international backing.\n\nThe vast majority of the world\u2019s opium and heroin comes from Afghanistan, with production and exports centred in areas controlled by the Taliban, which has taxed the drugs heavily during their 20-year insurgency.\n\nIt has become a key resource for the group and they could struggle to ban it, said Jonathan Goodhand, an expert in the international drugs trade at SOAS University of London.\n\n\u201cDrugs will bring out a set of tensions in the movement,\u201d he predicted.\n\nOn one hand, \u201cthey want to create this image of themselves as more moderate and more open to engagement with the West and they realise drugs is one of way of doing this,\u201d he said.\n\nBut on the other, any repression would hit farmers in the Taliban political heartlands of Helmand and Kandahar provinces in particular.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to struggle to take a very aggressive approach to drugs,\u201d he added.\n\nNear-monopoly\n\nIn his premier press conference, Mujahid pleaded for \u201cinternational assistance\u201d to provide farmers with alternative crops to poppies, the source of sap that is refined into morphine and heroin.\n\nThe appeal for international aid might prompt hollow laughs from people who worked in the coalition of NATO forces, NGOs, and UN workers over the last 10 years that tried in vain to break Afghanistan\u2019s reliance on poppy farming.\n\nThe United States spent around $8.6 billion (7.4 billion euros) from 2002 to 2017 in its doomed effort to combat the drugs trade, according to a 2018 report from the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan (SIGAR).\n\nThose efforts included paying farmers to grow wheat or saffron, investing in transport links, as well as spraying defoliants on crops and bombing refining facilities.\n\nAt each step, they found themselves thwarted by Taliban fighters who controlled the main poppy-growing regions and derived hundreds of millions of dollars from the industry, according to US and Afghan government estimates.\n\nFarmers in Taliban-controlled areas would often come under pressure to plant poppies from local warlords and fighters, investigations have found.\n\nAs a result, the country has a near-monopoly on opium and heroin, accounting for 80 to 90 percent of global output, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).\n\nThe amount of land planted with poppies hit a record high in 2017 and has averaged around 250,000 hectares in the last four years, roughly four times the level of the mid-1990s, UN figures show.\n\n\u2018Too tied up\u2019\n\nThe narcotics policy of the new government will affect global heroin prices, with repercussions for Western countries and their addicts, as well as Russia, Iran, Pakistan and China \u2014 all major smuggling routes but also huge markets for Afghan drugs.\n\nIn recent years, traffickers have also discovered that a plant commonly found in Afghanistan called ephedra can be used to create a key component of methamphetamine, better known as \u201ccrystal meth\u201d.\n\nStill, spokesman Mujahid vowed Afghanistan would be a \u201cnarcotics-free country\u201d moving forward.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the fundamentalist group has vowed to outlaw the trade. Production was banned in 2000, just before the group was overthrown by US-led forces.\n\nGretchen Peters, the American author of the book \u201cSeeds of Terror: How Heroin Is Bankrolling the Taliban and Al-Qaeda\u201d, said the Taliban\u2019s previous ban on poppy cultivation was tactical.\n\n\u201cThey were under immense international pressure,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a ploy because they had so much stored up. They made a huge amount of money once the price shot up by 10 times.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are not going to get rid of the drug trade because they are too tied up with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfghanistan cannot survive without opium. It is simultaneously killing Afghanistan while also keeping a huge number of people alive,\u201d she said, referring to the income the industry provides to poor farmers.\n\nBeing in control of the country will offer the Taliban access to airlines, the state bureaucracy and banks which could be used to facilitate drug smuggling and money laundering, she explained.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt they will exploit it.\u201d",

A hasty retreat, a civilian evacuation\u2026 with the Taliban watching on.\n\nAs every day passes this relief operation gets more and more urgent and desperate, as the British military tries to move thousands of people out of Afghanistan in just days.\n\nIt\u2019s a humanitarian mission in what feels like a war zone.\n\nA makeshift barricade is all that separates two armies who have fought for 20 years.\n\nThe Taliban are just one metre away from the British soldiers \u2013 it\u2019s a picture I never thought I would see.\n\nWe\u2019ve watched as thousands converged on this base threatening to overwhelm the whole evacuation operation.\n\nThe Taliban have assisted in this. Up the road they are controlling the crowds of people trying to reach the British position.\n\nSometimes they fire into the air, making people stop.\n\nThey are a menacing presence.\n\nDay and night families \u2013 often with tiny children \u2013 have risked their lives, ducking past gunfire at the gates of the civilian side of the airport; passing aggressive Taliban fighters, who occasionally beat and harass them.\n\nIn the night, the paratroopers blockaded the road with cars and razor wire.\n\nA senior officer told me they had no choice because the situation was out of control, but said the blockade will live with some of his soldiers for the rest of their lives.\n\n\u201cIt was terrible, women were throwing their babies over the razor wire, asking the soldiers to take them, some got caught in the wire,\u201d he told me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried for my men, I\u2019m counselling some, everyone cried last night.\u201d\n\nIt looks like chaos but there is a method, the soldiers call out for interpreters as different nationalities arrive at the barricade, including Afghans with a valid asylum case.\n\nPassports and paperwork are then checked.\n\nIf they pass muster they\u2019re directed to the entry gate to be processed. Some make it, others don\u2019t.\n\nThe soldiers hate this but without the right paperwork they have to turn people away.\n\nTerrified families \u2013 men, women and large numbers of children \u2013 are sent back through the barbed wire.\n\nWe watched as one little girl, her parents and brothers were sent back.\n\nBack into Afghanistan, back towards the Taliban.\n\nIt was heartbreaking.\n\nFatima, not her real name, made it through the barricade clutching her daughter\u2019s hand. She thinks she might have a case but doesn\u2019t know who to speak to.\n\nShe is terrified, and in tears. Her husband joined the Taliban and took to beating her.\n\nShe and her four-year-old have nothing but a UN letter identifying them as victims.\n\n\u201cAfghanistan is Taliban. Taliban is terrorist. My husband is a terrorist Talib,\u201d she explained to me.\n\nShe starts listing countries: \u201cAmerica, Canada, France, me and just my daughter\u2026\u201d\n\nI asked if they\u2019ll go anywhere. \u201cAnywhere! Any country,\u201d she said.\n\nWe mentioned her story to the officer in charge outside.\n\nThe soldiers have a reasonable degree of latitude in their decision making, and Major Steve White decided to enter her into the system.\n\n\u201cI can put her into the system, but I don\u2019t know if the system will spit her out, but I can do that at least,\u201d he told me.\n\nHe walked over to Fatima and, through another journalist who could translate, explained to her what he was going to do. She seemed confused, but we told her to follow him.\n\nAnd he took her to the queue.\n\nIt was quite simply an act of human kindness in all this mayhem.\n\nFatima did make it inside. Major White may well have saved their lives, he\u2019s certainly given them a chance of a better one.\n\nBut there are many sad stories as well.\n\nWe met a doctor from Herat with her sister and her mother, and it would appear they had absolutely no rights to get through the gates.\n\nThey fled the Taliban and are now stuck.\n\nThey have hope but it seems hopeless.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have brother, we don\u2019t have father, you know that living in here is very difficult for us,\u201d she told me.\n\nShe explained they were living in Herat but escaped to Kabul. Her uncle was part of the Taliban.\n\nShe said: \u201cThey want to obligate us into forced marriage. I am a doctor and my sister was working with women\u2019s rights, she studied, and my mother is a teacher, my mother was a teacher\u2026\u201d\n\nI asked if they\u2019re running away from certain danger.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, we are scared, we are scared,\u201d she said in tears.\n\nI\u2019ve reported on the Afghan war since it started. I\u2019ve been on countless embeds with British and American soldiers, I\u2019ve met with the Taliban, and I\u2019ve seen pain and grief in Afghanistan for two decades.\n\nThe Taliban has won.\n\nWatching on as soldiers carried babies towards the gates of the compound, I can\u2019t help but think what a waste this has been.\n\nAnd once again a small contingent of soldiers are dealing with the mess.\n\nStuart Ramsay for Sky.com",

          "text": "US health officials Wednesday announced plans to dispense Covid-19 booster shots to all Americans to shore up their protection amid the surging delta variant and signs that the vaccines\u2019 effectiveness is slipping.\n\nThe plan, as outlined by the chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other top health authorities, calls for an extra dose eight months after people get their second shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. The doses could begin the week of Sept. 20.\n\n\u201cOur plan is to protect the American people, to stay ahead of this virus,\u201d CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said as the agency cited a raft of studies suggesting that the vaccines are losing ground while the highly contagious variant spreads.\n\nPeople who received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine will also probably need extra shots, health officials said. But they said they are waiting for more data.\n\nOfficials said that before any booster program starts up, the Food and Drug Administration and a CDC advisory panel would need to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an extra dose.\n\n\u201cWe have a responsibility to give the maximum amount of protection,\u201d President Joe Biden said at the White House. He added that extra doses are also \u201cthe best way to protect ourselves from new variants that could arise.\u201d\n\nThe announcement came the same day the Biden administration said it would require nursing homes to mandate vaccinations for staffers in order to continue receiving federal funds.\n\nHundreds of thousands of nursing home workers remain unvaccinated, despite the heightened risk of fatal infections among elderly residents.\n\nOfficials said it is \u201cvery clear\u201d that the vaccines\u2019 protection against infections wanes over time, and they noted the worsening picture in Israel, which has seen a rise in severe cases, many of them in people already inoculated.\n\nThey said the US needs to get out ahead of the problem before it takes a more lethal turn and starts leading to increasing hospitalizations and deaths among the vaccinated.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s foremost expert on Covid-19, said one of the key lessons of the coronavirus is that it\u2019s better to \u201cstay ahead of it than chasing after it.\u201d\n\nThe first boosters would go to people in high-priority groups that received the initial US vaccinations: nursing home residents, health workers and those with underlying health conditions.\n\nHealth officials are likely to recommend that the booster be the same brand of vaccine that people received initially.\n\nDr. Mark Mulligan of NYU\u2019s Langone Health center welcomed the announcement, saying: \u201cPart of leadership is being able to see around the corner and make hard decisions without having all the data. It seems to me that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing here.\u201d\n\nTop scientists at the World Health Organization bitterly objected to the US plan, noting that poor countries are not getting enough vaccine for their initial rounds of shots.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re planning to hand out extra life jackets to people who already have life jackets, while we\u2019re leaving other people to drown without a single life jacket,\u201d said Dr. Michael Ryan, the WHO\u2019s emergencies chief.\n\nThe organization\u2019s top scientist, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, said the evidence does not show boosters are needed for everyone, and she warned that leaving billions of people in the developing world unvaccinated could foster the emergence of new variants and result in \u201ceven more dire situations.\u201d\n\nUS Surgeon General Vivek Murthy rejected the notion that the US must choose between \u201cAmerica and the world,\u201d saying: \u201cWe clearly see our responsibility to both.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials noted that the US has donated 115 million doses to 80 countries, more than all other nations combined. They said the US has plenty of vaccine to dispense boosters to its own population.\n\nIsrael is already offering booster shots to people over 50. And European regulators are looking into the idea.\n\nLast week, US health officials recommended a third shot for some people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients and organ transplant recipients.\n\nOffering boosters to all Americans would be a major expansion of what is already the biggest vaccination campaign in US history.\n\nNearly 200 million Americans have received at least one shot.\n\nSome experts have expressed concern that calling for boosters would undermine the public health message \u2014 and reinforce opposition to the vaccine \u2014 by raising more doubts in the minds of people already skeptical about the shots\u2019 effectiveness.\n\nAs for why the vaccines appear to be less effective over time at stopping infections, there are indications that the body\u2019s immune response to the shots fades, as it does with other inoculations.\n\nBut also, the vaccines simply may not protect against the delta variant as well as they do against the original virus. Scientists are still trying to answer the question.\n\nOfficials said the eight-month timeframe was a judgment call about when vaccine protection against severe illness might fall, based on the direction of the current data.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing magical about this number,\u201d the surgeon general said.\n\nNearly 20 months into the outbreak, the scourge has killed 620,000 Americans. Just weeks after the president declared the country\u2019s \u201cindependence\u201d from Covid-19 on July Fourth, emergency rooms in parts of the South and West are overloaded again, and cases are averaging nearly 140,000 per day, quadrupling in just a month.\n\nIn making its announcement, the CDC released a number of studies conducted during the delta surge that suggest that the vaccines remain highly effective at keeping Americans out of the hospital but that their ability to prevent infection is dropping markedly.\n\nOne of the studies looked at reported Covid-19 infections in residents of nearly 15,000 nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.\n\nIt found that the effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines against infection fell from about 74% in March, April and early May to 53% in June and July.\n\nThe study examined all Covid-19 infections, with or without symptoms. The researchers said more work is needed to determine if there was a higher incidence of infections that resulted in severe illness.\n\nAnother study was a look at 21 hospitals. It found that the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness in preventing Covid-19-associated hospitalizations was 86% at two to 12 weeks after the second dose, and 84% at 13 to 24 weeks after. The difference was not considered significant.\n\nA third study, conducted in New York state, found that protection against hospitalizations stayed steady at about 95% over the nearly three months examined.\n\nBut vaccine effectiveness against new laboratory-confirmed infections declined from about 92% in early May to about 80% in late July.\n\nAlso, the CDC released Mayo Clinic patient data from Minnesota that showed that in July, when the delta variant was prevalent, Moderna\u2019s vaccine was 76% effective against infection and Pfizer\u2019s 42%.\n\nSome scientists had been looking for signs that hospitalizations or deaths are increasing, as a necessary indicator that boosters might be needed.\n\nTo some leading scientists, the new studies \u201cwould not be sufficient, in and of themselves, to make the case for a booster,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious-diseases expert at Vanderbilt University and liaison to an expert advisory panel that helps the CDC form its vaccination recommendations.\n\nAP",
