          "title": "How corporate tenants shun Lagos high-rise office spaces amid harsh economy",
          "text": "It is no longer business as usual for prime office space owners in the high-brow areas of Lagos. A paradigm shift occasioned by post-Covid-19 work culture, coupled with inflationary pressure on the economy, has led to a dramatic decline in demand for a once booming real estate market, writes EDIDIONG IKPOTO\n\nOne of the consequences of rapid urbanisation of Lagos State is the consistent rise in the prices of real estate. With over 20 million people squeezed inside its 1,171 km\u00b2, coupled with an aggressive surge of industrialisation, the resulting increase in demand amid finite supply of landed property has made acquisition of real estate in the state an exclusive preserve of the wealthy.\n\nThis, perhaps, explains why Lagos has effortlessly recorded significant developments in several parts of the state.\n\nLong before its creation by Decree No. 14 of 1967, which restructured Nigeria\u2019s Federation into 12 states, Eko, a long-time pseudonym of Nigeria\u2019s Centre of Excellence, had positioned itself as a trade hub and one of Africa\u2019s most boisterous cities. This was captured in the hit track \u201cEko O Gba Gbere\u201d by the veteran highlife musician, Pa Chris Ajilo, released in 1968.\n\nDespite losing its place as Nigeria\u2019s capital city on December 12, 1991, Lagos has continued its consistent path of industrial growth and has undoubtedly eclipsed every other state with regard to commercial viability and all the indices that promote commerce and industry.\n\nRecently, while reacting to the recent ban of commercial motorcycle riders in the state, the Lagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso, described Lagos state as \u201ca victim of its own success.\u201d When viewed through the prism of the real estate sector, the commissioner\u2019s comments would imply that the successes recorded in the corporate sector over the past few decades have inevitably led to an \u201cexpansionist tendency\u201d by most corporate organisations. This, again, explains why almost every major corporate firm is headquartered in Lagos State.\n\nBut how will they all fit in? By geographical delineation, Lagos is the smallest state in Nigeria, with a landmass that is 21 times smaller than the largest, Niger. How will all these organisations who want to domicile their base of operations in Lagos find the space to operate? This creates, to a considerable degree, a paradox of \u201cso much for very little.\u201d\n\nMany households and organisations have extended their search for greener pastures to a place that was intended to accommodate only 40 per cent of its population.\n\nOver the last couple of decades, the cost of renting an office space in Lagos, particularly around the highbrow areas of its Island, has been relatively high. In 2021, it was reported that the average cost of renting an office space in Lagos Island stood at N3.6m per annum.\n\nThis has led to lower demand due to the declining purchasing power of several corporate organisations which are facing economic downturn and revenue crunch\n\nAccording to a recent report, prime office segment of the Nigerian real estate market recorded its worst performance in five years with the vacancy rate remaining unchanged as of the second half of 2021.\n\nThe report described 2021 as the office market\u2019s less than desirable period when the performance of key metrics such as take-up was at its lowest.\n\nOn the other hand, a 2014 report by Quartz Africa noted that Lagos was one of the highest office rent rates in the world, higher than New York, Johannesburg and only $5 per sq ft less than rates obtainable in London.\n\nAccording to the report, high land prices, construction and financing costs stood tall among the most prominent factors behind Lagos\u2019 high rentals. Other underlying drivers \u2014 like double-digit interest rates, inadequate supply of suitable development sites and the need to import materials for construction \u2014 have kept development related costs very high.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the lack of reliable power, which means generators are a must-have. This becomes a quarterly or annual service charge, an additional cost that can be as high as 25 per cent of rent annually. Similar charges in other developed markets can be 10 per cent lower,\u201d the report read in part.\n\nRentals for prime office space in Lagos (Ikoyi) had skyrocketed as at 2004 to $90 per sq. ft per annum, above those seen in Midtown Manhattan in New York where rents were closer to $76 per sq. ft per annum. They were also trailing the $96 per sq. ft rents seen in the City of London and more than four times higher than prime office rents in Illovo, Johannesburg.\n\nFor yield-seeking real estate investors, the Lagos opportunity might appear attractive at first glance. But the factors behind the numbers are worth digging into.\n\nGross inadequacy of real estate supply has acted as a major driver to high rents in the past decade. Less than 650,000 sq. ft. (60,000 sq. meters) of prime office space in fewer than 10 high-rise office buildings in Victoria Island and Ikoyi existed in Lagos prior to 2010. Other office towers did exist in the old Central Business District, but their glory days are gone.\n\nAs age and congestion began to set in and landlords refused to refurbish, corporates relocated to residential office conversions in Victoria Island. Consequently, demand began to outstrip supply, allowing the few owners of prime office space to get away with seemingly ridiculous rentals.\n\nThe historically low supply and opportunity to demonstrate what real prime grade quality office space is like has created interest from global and domestic institutional real estate investors in recent years.\n\nThe obvious question at this point is, what changed? How did the once boisterous office space market in Lagos decline so rapidly in a few years? In answering the question, experts have cited factors such as Nigeria\u2019s depressed economy as well as a post-COVID-19 paradigm shift that changed the way firms now work. With a significant degree of personnel now working from home, most corporate organisations do not need as much space as they used to.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer of Global PFI, Mr MKO Balogun, who weighed in his thoughts in a chat with our correspondent, described the decline in demand for office spaces as an emerging trend that was not only obtainable in Lagos, but other parts of the world.\n\nHe said, \u201cTwo things have happened. Before COVID-19, people hadn\u2019t started thinking about shared spaces, working from home, but COVID-19 came and forced people to adjust. One, they were on full shut-down. Then, after that, people found out they could work from home and still deliver and save cost. I had conversations with a lot of companies, some of who were the clients we managed. They are reducing their footprints in the offices, even globally, not only in Lagos.\u201d\n\nAccording to the real estate expert, corporate organisations operated based on cost-effective methods and had now adopted a system that would allow them procure smaller office spaces for a small fraction of their workforce.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect that it continues to be empty. We can still have some semblance of full office operations, but we are going to see a trend where most companies are either downsizing or returning or maintaining the Covid-era arrangement where people work in the office. Immediately after COVID-19 subsided, about six major companies in the US divided their employees into three categories. Twenty-five per cent were those who had permanent stay in the office. Another 40 per cent would come to the office to work when they wanted to work, basically twice a week. Then 35 per cent were to work from home. So, that had an impact on the spaces.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are familiar with the US and the UK. There are people who are turning office spaces into other uses. It\u2019s not a local trend, it\u2019s a global trend.\u201d\n\nManaging Director of MDS Properties, David Mbah, also corroborated Balogun\u2019s sentiments.\n\nMbah said, \u201cThere are several factors that are spearheading this. Number one is the whole COVID-19 outbreak that disrupted the way we worked. It made people have a rethink. So, when the COVID-19 lockdown was in place, people worked from home, but when the lockdown restrictions were lifted, people had a rethink. They thought they could work from home and still deliver results. That is the way workplace culture is shifting.\n\n\u201cThey looked at it and asked themselves why they had to maintain those 1,000 square metres of office space when everybody could work from home. They could reduce the size of space from many 1,000 to, maybe, 200 square metres. That way, they cut cost by over 80 per cent. You can see that the incentives are so many. From a cost perspective, it makes sense for the employer. From a result perspective and from a flexibility perspective, it makes sense for the employee because they can work from home, they can be in their comfort zones and still be able to deliver results.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mbah, there was an over-supply of prime office space in places like Victoria Island, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic which put a heavy strain on the financial strength of most corporate entities. This, he said, had played a contributory role in shrinking demand for prime office spaces in the high-brow areas of Lagos State.\n\nHe added, \u201cOf course, you know that those who own those buildings have already done their numbers to be able to recoup their investments. So, they can\u2019t go below a certain rental threshold. When you are unable to meet up with paying that kind of rent, the building is going to be empty. When people can\u2019t afford it, your building will be empty. It\u2019s multifaceted, and these are just some of the issues responsible for that situation.\u201d\n\nA realtor, Kingsley Osalume, believes that inflationary pressure and its resultant effect on the economy were primarily responsible for the decline in demand for prime office spaces.\n\nAccording to him, most landlords, particularly those embarking on frequent property improvements, had been forced to increase rental rates to counteract the impact of expenses incurred on those improvements.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe all know what the economy has looked like this year. With this inflation, everything is very expensive. The economic outlook determines a lot. People can\u2019t spend money they don\u2019t have. It\u2019s also difficult to spend effectively when so much money gets you very little.\u201d",

          "text": "No fewer than 48 million Nigerians still practice open defecation, according to the newly released 2021 Water, Sanitation and Hygiene National Outcome Routine Mapping (WASH-NORM) III Report.\n\nThis is the thrust at the inauguration of the 2021 WASH-NORM III Report in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nThe Minister of Water Resources, Mr Suleiman Adamu, said slow progress being made in improving water and sanitation services was due to population expansion, low commitments from states and impact of COVID-19.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the WASH-NORM is an annual national assessment of the status of water, sanitation and hygiene services aimed at covering the data gaps in the sector.\n\nIts primary objective is to provide data on WASH indicators to meet the needs of policy makers for better planning.\n\nQuoting the report, the minister said poorest households were 48 times more likely to practice open defecation than the richest households.\n\n\u201cFirst, the report presents encouraging news about the WASH targets in Nigeria, though with mixed bag of trends that calls for deep introspection.\n\n\u201cThe results show clearly that access to basic water supply services is available to 67 per cent of the population, at 92 per cent access levels, the richest households are twice more likely to use, basic water supply services than the poorest households with 46 per cent.\n\n\u201cDisparities also exist between urban areas and rural areas, the most common sources of drinking water recorded by households were boreholes/tubewells, and only 11 per cent of the household population use pipe-borne water.\n\n\u201cAbout a quarter of the population still depend on unimproved and surface water supply for their daily water needs, access to sanitation indicators across the country shows a slight improvement, though open defecation is still prevalent.\n\n\u201cEvidently, 23 per cent of the population (48 million people) still defecate in the open. People in rural areas (31 per cent) are four times more likely to practice open defecation than those living in urban areas.\u201d\n\nThe minister said states must continue to complement the efforts of the Federal Government as it cannot be business as usual.\n\nHe said instances could be drawn to how the national government had made huge investment in the water and sanitation sector with reports of vandalism and poor operation and maintenance by the states.\n\nHe said the entire WASH sector might not be able to meet the sustainable development goals without a concerted effort by the states to commensurate with the efforts made at the federal level.\n\n\u201cSo what we are trying to do now, also we have changed our strategy a little bit, using the FCT as a model, and to make it more advocacy-based.\n\n\u201cBut we have two states that are coming and working as seriously towards ending open defecation, I will like to really celebrate them when that happens.\u201d\n\nMs. Jane Bevan, the UNICEF Chief of WASH, said the survey had re-empahsised the challenges and gaps between current levels of access to WASH services and the goals set out in the National Open defecation-free road map.\n\n\u201cWASHNORM findings showed that only 16 out of the 28 state urban water utilities are fully functional, while only eight per cent of urban water utility consumers are metered at the time of the survey.\n\n\u201cOpen defecation remains a challenge in the country with data from the WASHNORM 2021 survey showing that as many as 48 million Nigerians practise open defecation, representing 23 per cent of the population.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the efforts by government and partners at ending open defecation, the rapidly growing population is dwarfing the gains made so far, the outbreak of COVID-19 was an opportunity for increased effort in hygiene promotion\u2019\u2019.\n\nBevan said achievement of results at scale would make significant difference in the WASH sector and move the country towards achieving SDG six.\n\nShe however commended efforts of the ministry in scaling up access to WASH, calling for sustainability of current strategies and ensure functionality of all WASH schemes.\n\nThe Statistician-General of the Federation, Mr Semiu Adeniran said the inauguration of the report was an important milestone in the National Bureau of Statistics\u2019 statistical production strategy.\n\nHe said this was geared towards meeting the needs of policy and decision makers, development partners, researchers and the wider public.\n\n\u201cWASH is an integral part of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda which seeks to end extreme poverty in all its forms. Safe WASH is crucial to human health and well-being.\n\n\u201cIt is not only a prerequisite to health, but contributes to the attainment of better livelihoods, school attendance and human dignity, and also, helps to create healthy environments for communities.\n\nAdeniran noted that the report which was the third in the series of national assessments of the status of WASH Services with the first edition launched in 2018, gave reliable, comprehensive, and up-to-date WASH data to inform strategic decision-making and address critical gaps in the sector.\n\nHe said the vast amount of data collected under the survey would be used for strategic and efficient allocation of resources, as well as for developing and implementing well-targeted policies and programs.\n\nNAN recalls that the WASH-NORM is a collaborative effort between the National Bureau of Statistics, Federal Ministry of Water Resources and the UNICEF (NAN)",

Yet, all the two are broken down into items.\n\nRead Also: CJN throws open Supreme Court Justice job to lawyers\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government releases the budget based on the budget components, and it is an offence to spend the money meant for one item for another.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the Supreme Court budgeted this year to re-roof and rehabilitate its complex built over 30 years ago, and that is being done.\n\n\u201cThe work on the extension of the complex is near completion; the aesthetic lawns and the perimeters are being well kept. Also, security and water supply are adequately provided in offices and residences of all Justices.\n\n\u201cDuring the pandemic, a profound and extra-care was maintained to avoid causalities among the court\u2019s Justices and staff generally. It would have amounted to an act of irresponsibility to divert money meant for the above for otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe accusation so far, in summary is that more or all ought to have been done and not that nothing has been done; which is utopian in the contemporary condition of our country.\n\n\u201cBefore eight new Justices were appointed in 2020 to the apex court\u2019s bench, there was no additional budget to provide new chambers with equipped library, legal assistance, residential accommodations and logistics for them.\n\n\u201cThe apex court has to make do with the resources at its disposal to meet their needs over time.\n\n\u201cEvery Justice of this court has, at least, legal assistance, and some have opted for more. One of the CJN\u2019s legal assistants (now Justice Aina) was appointed to Abuja FCT High Court last month, while another (Barr Ramatu) died three months back.\n\n\u201cGenerally, the Judiciary is looking up to the recruitment of more legal assistance and other supporting staff this year.\n\n\u201cBesides, two Supreme Court Justices died, while four retired within the period under consideration. Both the four retirees and the two departed cost the court some funds in the forms of gratuities and allowances.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks ago, eight Supreme Court Justices were nominated for a workshop in London as the court cannot take all of them there at once otherwise the job would suffer. They would be going in batches.\n\n\u201cAccommodations are being gradually provided for the few that are yet to get. There is none of the apex court Justices without SUV and back up cars. If any of them were purchased but refurbished, the external and internal auditors are here in the court to take those that bought them up over it.\n\n\u201cThe high cost of electricity tariff and diesel are national problem. The Chief Registrar might have budgeted for N300 per litre but diesel is now selling for over N700 per litre and therefore has to find a way around it without even bringing it to the attention of the CJN. But there is no way the generator would be put off if the court is sitting.\n\n\u201cThe amendment of court rules is on the process, it has to be critically reviewed to avoid conflict with the Constitution and other extant laws. Not all the CJN has reviewed the rules in the past.\n\n\u201cWithin the three years his brother Justices mentioned came the pandemic and the judiciary workers\u2019 strike.\n\n\u201cThe internet services have been restored to Justices\u2019 residences and chambers, just as some allowances have been paid to them.\n\n\u201cThe CJN held a meeting with his brother Justices last Thursday and another one is due to hold this week.\n\n\u201cThe general public should be rest assured that there\u2019s no hostility or adverse feelings amongst the Justices of the Supreme Court, as everyone is going about his normal duty.\u201d",

          "text": "Sixty-one years after Belgian authorities have finally returned a tooth belonging to freedom fighter, Patrice Lumumba, who was murdered gruesomely by separatists and Belgian mercenaries in 1961, as an anti-colonial hero.\n\nBelow are 15 things to know about assassinated Congolese independence hero, Patrice Lumumba.\n\n\u00b7 Patrice Lumumba was born on July 3, 1925 to Julienne Wamato Lomendja and her husband, Fran\u00e7ois Tolenga Otetshima, a farmer, in Onalua, in the Katakokombe region of the Kasai province of the Belgian Congo.\n\n\u00b7 He was known for being a vocal, precocious young man, regularly pointing out the errors of his teachers before peers, often to their chagrin. His outspoken nature would come to define his life and career.\n\n\u00b7 Lumumba spoke Tetela, French, Lingala, Swahili and Tshiluba.\n\n\u00b7 In 1960, Lumumba led Congo, now the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), to independence from Belgium and became the country\u2019s first democratically elected Prime Minister. He also became a hero and the face of the struggle against colonialism in Africa.\n\n\u00b7 A fiery critic of Belgium\u2019s rapacious rule, became his country\u2019s first Prime Minister but fell out with the former colonial power and the United States. He was ousted in a coup a few months after taking office.\n\n\u00b7 After Mobutu\u2019s military coup, Lumumba attempted to escape to Stanleyville to join his supporters who had established a new anti-Mobutu rival state called the Free Republic of the Congo but was captured and imprisoned en route by state authorities under Mobutu.\n\n\u00b7 He was handed over to Katangan authorities and executed in the presence of Katangan and Belgian officials and officers.\n\n\u00b7 The execution is thought to have taken place on 17 January 1961 between 21:40 and 21:43 (according to the Belgian report). The bodies were thrown into a shallow grave. The following morning, on orders of Katangan Interior Minister Godefroid Munongo who wanted to make the bodies disappear and thereby prevent a burial site from being created, Belgian Gendarmerie officer Gerard Soete and his team dug up and dismembered the corpses, and dissolved them in sulfuric acid while the bones were grounded and scattered.\n\n\u00b7 But the tooth, gold-capped was kept as a trophy by the Belgian Gendarmerie officer Gerard Soete.\n\n\u00b7 The tooth was eventually seized from the daughter of the policeman, Gerard Soete by Belgian authorities in 2016 after Lumumba\u2019s family filed a complaint.\n\n\u00b7 Belgium, on Monday, handed over the last remains of the slain Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba, a tooth, to his family, turning a page on a grim chapter in its colonial past.\n\n\u00b7 Chief prosecutor, Frederic Van Leeuw gave the relatives a small, bright blue box containing the tooth in a televised ceremony, and said the legal action they had taken to receive the relic had delivered \u201cjustice\u201d.\n\n\u00b7 The tooth was placed in a casket that was then draped in the flag of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which celebrates Lumumba, who was murdered.\n\n\u00b7 The casket containing the tooth is set to be flown back to the DRC where it will be officially laid to rest at a memorial site.\n\n\u00b7 The country is set to hold three days of \u201cnational mourning\u201d from 27 to 30 June to mark the burial ceremony on its 62nd anniversary of independence.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has reacted for the first time to Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele\u2019s presidential ambition, saying his fate would be determined by the apex bank\u2019s board of directors on whether his actions have fallen foul of the laws.\n\nClamour for Emefiele\u2019s resignation had mounted when news broke that N100 million presidential nomination and expression of interest form of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party had been procured for him.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nA Nigerian court sitting in Abuja had dismissed his request to not be prevented from contesting for the presidential ticket of any political party in the February 2023 elections.\n\nThe suit was seeking to restrain the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the country\u2019s attorney general from disqualifying him from pursuing his presidential ambition.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, asked if he he was concerned about the debate around the central bank\u2019s independence following Emefiele\u2019s interest in running for president, Buhari replied: \u201cThe CBN governor is appointed by the president. But this appointment is subject to confirmation by the Senate. Ultimately, it will be for the CBN\u2019s board of directors to determine whether the CBN governor\u2019s actions have fallen foul of the laws in place to ensure he can most effectively carry out his duties.\u201d\n\nThe President spokeon the performane of CBN Governor \u201cbut there is a subtext to the accusations. Because the governor follows a model outside of the economic orthodoxy, he is labelled political. But the orthodoxy has proved wrong time and again. Instead, the governor is following an alternative economic model that puts people at the heart of policy. Nigeria should be free to choose its development model and how to construct our economy, so it functions for Nigerians.\u201d\n\nOn why his administration was not heeding the call by IMF, World Bank and many leading economists to remove the fuel subsidy and unify the exchange rate, Buhari said subsidy removal was becoming increasingly untenable.\n\n\u201cMost western countries are today implementing fuel subsidies. Why would we remove ours now? What is good for the goose is good for the gander. What our western allies are learning the hard way is what looks good on paper and the human consequences are two different things. My government set in motion plans to remove the subsidy late last year. After further consultation with stakeholders, and as events unfolded this year, such a move became increasingly untenable.\n\n\u201cBoosting internal production for refined products shall also helps. Capacity is due to step up markedly later this year and next, as private players and modular refineries (Dangote Refinery, BUA Group Refinery, Waltersmith Refinery) come on board.\n\n\u201cThe exchange rate is still susceptible to external shocks that can suddenly and severely affect Nigerian citizens. As we step up domestic production \u2013 both in fuel (enabled by PIA) and food (agricultural policies) \u2013 the inflationary threat shall diminish, and we can move toward unification.\u201d\n\nWhy western allies must tag IPOB terror group\n\nPresident Buhari also gave reason why Western allies must designate the Indigenous People\u2019s of Biafra (IPOB) as terror group.\n\nIn his written responses to questions posed by Bloomberg News, he said: \u201cIn 2015, Boko Haram held territory the size of Belgium within the borders of Nigeria. Today, they are close to extinction as a military force. The leader of ISWAP was eliminated by a Nigerian Airforce airstrike in March. The jets acquired from the US and intelligence shared by British were not provided to previous administrations and stand as testament to renewed trust re-built between Nigeria and our traditional western allies under my government.\n\n\u201cWe urge those same international partners to take additional steps costing them nothing, by proscribing another group \u2013 IPOB \u2013 as a terrorist organisation. Their leadership enjoys safe haven in the West, broadcasting hate speech into Nigeria from London, spending millions lobbying members of the US Congress, and freely using international financial networks to arm agitators on the ground. This must stop.\n\n\u201cMy administration is the only in Nigeria\u2019s history to implement a solution to decades-long herder-farmer conflicts, exacerbated by desertification and demographic growth. The National Livestock Transformation Plan, putting ranching at its core, is the only way to deplete the competition for resources at the core of the clashes. Governors from some individual states have sought to play politics where ranches have been established; but where they have been disputes have dramatically reduced.\u201d\n\nHe also spoke on Bola Tinubu being his preferred successor. Asked if he plan to endorse a candidate for president? If so, who? He replied: \u201cYes. I will endorse the APC candidate for president.\u201d\n\nAsked if he was concerned that people accused of blasphemy still get stoned to death on the streets in northern Nigeria, Buhari said: \u201cNo person has the right to take the law into his or her own hands. Christianity and Islam, our two great faiths and their great books have far more in common than they have apart. Nigeria has a long tradition of tolerance that we must draw on, and we must strive to find common ground. \u201cWhat comes out of this tragedy is to cherish what we share, while at the same time respect our differences.\u201d\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nAbubakar said the practice of vote-buying undermined the values which underpinned the democratic life of the country.\n\n\u201cWe strongly decry the incidence of vote-buying recorded during the election and urge the security agencies to ensure investigations are conducted, that all perpetrators of this anti-democratic act are prosecuted and brought to justice with the provisions in the electoral law.\n\n\u201cThe practice of vote-buying undermines the values which underpin our democratic life. It reduces the privileged selection of those who steward our commonwealth through our electoral processes, as being transactional. We must hold to account all who would muddy the springs from which we as a people seek to drink from collectively by such actions of bribery, both the giver and receiver.\u201d\n\nAbubakar, however, said with the official announcement of the results in the Ekiti State off-cycle governorship elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the NPC congratulates the good people of Ekiti State on their peaceful conduct during the election.\n\n\u201cWe want to particularly thank the people of Ekiti for the turnout recorded during the election, despite recent increasing levels of insecurity. Your commitment to fulfilling your civic responsibilities by casting your votes in a peaceful and orderly manner, sets an example for your compatriots in the upcoming Osun State governorship election and Nigeria as we move towards the general election in 2023.\n\n\u201cWhile the elections were not devoid of hitches, we commend the efforts of all stakeholders who have tirelessly worked either as ombudsmen or observers or participants to ensure the elections were conducted according to the rules. These include INEC and security agencies for facilitating an electoral process, where people were not disenfranchised because of their party affiliation, gender, religious or ethnic affiliations and/or disability.\n\n\u201cThe media, civil society organisations, and international development partners for their tireless efforts in monitoring and reporting on the process in a transparent and unbiased manner. We commend the political parties and their respective candidates for yielding to the call for a peaceful election in Ekiti State by respecting the provisions of the Electoral Act as well as cooperating with the various institutions of state saddled with their implementation,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nThe NPC urged winner of the election, Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji, of the All Progressives Congress to be magnanimous in victory by collaborating with the citizens of Ekiti State, especially his co-contestants, in the governance process of the state for the benefit of Ekiti\u2019s sons and daughters, both home and abroad.\n\n\u201cWe call on him and his political party to eschew triumphalism that may make peace-building quite difficult after what at sometimes was a fractiously fought election, because the values and goals of democratic governance are not a zero-sum game, but the continued development of an egalitarian society. In the same way, we urge those who may be disappointed by the outcome of the exercise, to use the available constitutional channels to express their grievances, ensuring the rule of law dictates our collective actions as a people,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

Today they are close to extinct as a military force. The leader of ISWAP was eliminated by a Nigerian Airforce airstrike in March. The jets acquired from the US and intelligence shared by British were not provided to previous administrations and stand as testament to renewed trust re-built between Nigeria and our traditional western allies under my government.\u201dWe urge those same international partners to take additional steps costing them nothing, by proscribing another group \u2013 IPOB \u2013 as a terrorist organisation. Their leadership enjoys safe haven in the West, broadcasting hate speech into Nigeria from London, spending millions lobbying members of the US Congress, and freely using international financial networks to arm agitators on the ground. This must stop\u201d, he said.\u201dMy administration is the only in Nigeria\u2019s history to implement a solution to decades-long herder-farmer conflicts, exacerbated by desertification and demographic growth.

Government is also mindful of efforts of some patriotic and influential persons and institutions that are helping in securing the safe release of the hostages.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari welcomes the return of the recently released passengers back to their families and loved ones, while expressing his solemn commitment to the families of those still in captivity, assuring that there will be no let-up until they are reunited with their families in the shortest time possible.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s clear directive on the issue is that the hostages must be brought home alive. The country\u2019s military and security agencies are aware of their duty to the nation and are determined to give effect to the President\u2019s charge with increased urgency\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Ben Igbakpa representing Ethiope federal constituency of Delta State, had at the plenary last week raised a constitutional point of order, citing section 58 (8) of the 1999 constitution which empowered the national assembly to enact laws and also override the President with two third majority of the members\u2019 vote.\n\nThe Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila who affirmed that Mr. President was in breach of the 30 days provided to communicate his decision to withhold assent, urged Hon. Igbakpa to formally present a motion in that regard.\n\nHowever, after presenting the motion at the resumption of plenary Tuesday, the Deputy Speaker, Wase who presided over the session said a motion cannot be used to override a Bill.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t come with a motion to override a bill.

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Healthtracka raises money to expand at-home lab testing",
          "text": "Healthtracka, a Nigerian startup that offers convenient at-home lab tests, has raised $1.5 million in pre-seed funding, according to a statement shared with TechCabal today. This round is led by venture capital investors Ingressive Capital and Hustle Fund, with participation from angel investors: Alunmi Angels Alliance and Flying Doctors.\n\nThis round of funding is coming after Healthtracka participated in the Techstars Toronto accelerator programme between October 2021 and January 2022.\n\nFounded in May 2021 by Ifeoluwa Dare-Johnson and Victor Amusan in Lagos, Healthtracka allows users to book tests on its website, have their samples collected at their homes and access their results on their email addresses. Healthtracka partners with medical laboratories\u20143 at the moment: vCare Diagnostics, Lancet Laboratories, and Afriglobal Medicare\u2014who provide them with phlebotomists who go down to patients\u2019 houses to collect samples, analyse the samples and return results in 2 days.\n\nWhile Dare-Johnson\u2019s background in biochemistry and working at a lab before meant she knew the importance of regular medical diagnostics, she didn\u2019t think of creating a diagnostic solution until her fit and healthy-looking father suddenly slumped and was fighting for his life. This prompted her to delve deeper into Africa\u2019s healthcare system, and she discovered that there are a lot of undiagnosed Africans living with unknown pre-existing conditions. This is exacerbated by a weak healthcare system battling an infrastructure deficit and shortage of medical workers, all of which make accessing healthcare a hassle on the continent.\n\nAnother inspiration for Healthtracka was Dare-Johnson\u2019s role as a marketing lead at SynLab, a multinational medical diagnostic, which made her realise that providing medical tests in a seamless and accessible manner is important for better healthcare outcomes. This is because doctor consultations, even virtual ones, end with patients being required to take a lab test at a hospital. These tests are important because they make up 70% of the clinical decision making process. But this diagnostics requirement turns out to be a problem. Upon consultation, because of inconvenience, many patients are reluctant to leave their homes and make a trip to the hospital to take these important tests.\n\nDare-Johnson\u2019s co-founder, Amusan, comes from a family of medical doctors who have firsthand experience of the negative effects of late diagnoses, and that has shaped how Healthtracka approach this late diagnoses problem.\n\nDare-Johnson said that telemedicine platforms would previously offer only consultation services while referring patients to the hospital for diagnostics. Now they can now order lab tests for the patient using Healthtracka\u2019s API.\n\nUsers can go on Healthtracka\u2019s website and book lab tests ranging from fertility and STD tests to full blood count and COVID tests. Healthtracka also offers specialist consultation after patients have received their results.\n\nDare-Johnson explained that the pandemic was crucial to Healthtracka\u2019s growth, during the pandemic, Healthtracka started offering COVID-19 tests. \u201cIt was a trying time where people needed the comfort and the assurance that they could access healthcare remotely and safely,\u201d she told TechCabal.\n\nHealthtracka co-founder Ifeoluwa Dare-Johnson\n\nDare-Johnson also said that privacy is one of the reasons its users patronise them as they shield clients from the societal stigma that comes with going to the hospital for tests such as the ones for sexually transmitted diseases (STD).\n\nHealthtracka currently has 50 different medical tests, which it has offered 7,000 times to 5,000 users at home, using a network of 700 phlebotomists, across 7 Nigerian cities\u2014Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Benin, Kaduna, Ilorin, and Ibadan.\n\n\u201cIfeoluwa is hungry and very bright. Not only did we anonymously use Healthtracka\u2019s services in diligence and had a 10/10 experience, we recognised truly what this could become across the continent, even from just interacting with her team for tests,\u201d Ingressive Capital\u2019s founder, Maya Horgan Famodu, said in a statement. \u201cThe product is high-quality, on time, affordable, and unlocking the door for a healthier Africa.\u201d\n\nHealthtracka\u2019s funding will also power its growth plans, which include introducing new product features and expanding its at-home lab testing services into Kenya and Ghana in the coming months. It also wants to expand its offering by launching an API that will allow both telemedicine services and traditional healthcare providers to offer at-home lab testing.\n\n\u201cWe have realised, especially in the countries we are expanding to, that the infrastructure deficit problem is the same. Our experience in offering diagnostics in Nigeria gives us confidence that we can tackle this problem in other markets as well,\u201d she told TechCabal. \u201cWe are reshaping culture to make lab testing as seamless as ordering a dress online. I think that we are able to scale this across Africa, especially in the places that need it the most.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Amazon Prime Video's first Nollywood film production deal",
          "text": "On Tuesday, Nollywood production house, Nemsia Films, announced that it closed an exclusive slate deal for 3 commissioned feature films with American streaming giant, Amazon Prime Video, which made its foray into Nollywood in December last year.\n\nIn theory, a slate deal in filmmaking is when one party (in this case, Amazon Prime Video) has agreed to either co-finance or solely finance multiple films of a particular film studio (in this case, Nemsia Films). In practice, Amazon is reserving the IP rights of the 3 films on the slate deal, and will cover their production costs. They would likely be called Amazon originals.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited to collaborate with Nemsia Films on this pioneering slate deal, which will complement our growing lineup of local Nollywood content for Prime Video customers,\u201d Ayanna Lonian, Director of Content Acquisition and Head of Worldwide Major Studio Licensing Strategy at Prime Video, said in a statement sent to TechCabal. \u201cThis slate deal supports our goal to showcase Nollywood at its best, by telling authentic home-grown stories in a range of genres to Prime Video customers around the world.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNemsia was originally founded in 2009 as an advertising agency by Derin Adeyokunnu (Managing Partner) and BB Sasore (Creative Director). But after creating a couple of TV commercials, the founders realised they could do great work in feature filmmaking. So in 2013, they added that to their suite of offerings. Nemsia\u2019s first production, Before 30, a television drama series, was produced in 2014 and started airing on Africa Magic in 2015 before getting listed on Netflix in 2020.\n\nGod Calling (2018) produced by Nemsia\n\nThe company has gone on to produce more films including God Calling (2018) and Journey of an African Colony (2019), a docuseries based on books by lawyer and author, Olasupo Shasore. According to Adeyokunnu and Sasore, these titles, available on Netflix, have all become Netflix most viewed at some point.\n\n\u201cAt Nemsia Films, it is our belief in \u2018no gravity for the mind\u2019 that has led us to work with Prime Video, one of the leading streaming services worldwide, capable of delivering our stories further than we ever imagined,\u201d said Adeyokunnu said in a statement sent to TechCabal. \u201cWe are tremendously excited about the collaboration and what the future holds for Nollywood.\u201d\n\nEverybody is welcome\n\nAccording to Adeyokunnu, the journey to this slate deal started last year in June when Amazon Prime Video reached out to Sasore on LinkedIn for possible collaboration.\n\n\u201cWe shared what we\u2019ve got, and they loved it. After giving our work some light touch and creative guidance, they were good to go,\u201d Adeyokunnu told TechCabal\n\nSasore, who\u2019s the writer and director of most of the company\u2019s production, thinks Amazon is doing something right, which is leaving room for more emerging operators to play. \u201cThey\u2019re really keen on the story and are ready to source from the best guys, regardless of their status,\u201d he told TechCabal over a call.\n\nWhen entering a new market, it\u2019s usual practice for big platforms to reach out to already-established contacts in the industries of interest for business. So it\u2019s quite commendable when a big platform is keen on also reaching out to independent and emerging creators, like Amazon is currently doing.\n\nSasore thinks Amazon is different, and he has good reason to think so. Besides the fact that the streaming giant, with over 200 million global viewers, reached out to him on LinkedIn, it gave Nemsia the freedom to recommend more interesting production outfits.\n\n\u201cWe gave them some names, but they trusted us to make a choice, so we went for Loup Garou Films,\u201d said Sasore. Amazon loved the recommendation and folded them into the deal. Loup Garou is a small production company focused mostly on music video production. The company has shot videos for artists like Ladipoe and Ayra Starr.\n\nGod Calling (2018) produced by Nemsia\n\nThe deal Amazon signed with Nemsia was originally for 2 films, but now that Loup Garou is involved, Amazon has made room for 1 more film. This means, Loup Garou will be producing their own film independently but under Nemsia Films.\n\nThe first feature film from this deal will be Breath of Life, written and directed by Sasore and produced by actor Eku Edewor, who recently joined Nemsia as producer.\n\nSasore said the slated film will not be a production featuring an amalgamation of stars. \u201cThe story speaks for itself. It requires top talents and not necessarily the established stars,\u201d he said while talking about how they are casting for the slated films.\n\nMore skin in the game\n\nIt\u2019s no more news that Amazon Prime Video is not only keen on entering the second biggest film industry in the world, Nollywood, but wants to build a formidable local content bank. The streaming platform has already begun to follow the textbook strategy of capturing both local and diaspora audiences of any frontier market: getting in bed with the locals through licensing agreements.\n\nLast year when it announced its entry into Nollywood, it went into a licensing partnership with Inkblot Productions, a Nigerian film production company, to stream most of its titles that have already aired in cinemas. It also went into a similar partnership with Anthill Studios, an animation production company.\n\nLicensing agreements can be considered low-hanging fruits since they mostly require buying the rights to display already-made products\u2014films, in this case. But, through this deal, Amazon is demonstrating that it wants to put its back to work and have more skin in the game as it will be financing local films from scratch.\n\nSasore said even though the deal is signed and delivered and casting for the first film concluded, production will start in July and stretch through the third and fourth quarters of the year. He also said that Breath of Life should hit the screen by the first quarter of next year.\n\nThe streaming wars keep getting interesting. Netflix set up its Nigerian office. Since then, the streaming giant\u2019s offerings have enjoyed a mixed run with the Nigerian audience. YouTube, on its end, is serving as an outlet for indie filmmakers to distribute their work. Would Amazon Prime Video\u2019s entry into Nigeria intensify the competition, and would it dominate the market?\n\nSasore agreed that the competition will be more intense, which he says is good for the market. But he believes the road to dominance for any platform is still far. \u201cIt\u2019s a big market and, interestingly, an open one. There\u2019s no market leader yet, so there\u2019s still room to play. We are still in the early days of our greatness, and anybody in the film industry ecosystem right now is contributing to the groundwork.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

The time for disagreement is over. It is time to come together to work for the success of our great party at the polls.\n\n\u201cThe unity of our party is very important at this time, so I appeal to everyone to put whatever differences aside and come together for the task ahead.\u201d",

It is on this note that I want to remind the student matriculating today that they are our ambassador and hope of an innovative Nigeria. You can\u2019t maintain the status quo. You must wake up daily and stand strong from today to challenge it. Here, we don\u2019t want to imitate, we want to innovate. We believe in you.\n\n\u201cAs an institution, we are willing to listen and support you. We have done our best in making sure you have a conducive learning environment. We will continue to do our best in that regard.\n\n\u201cLet me assure you that we will keep our promise on granting employment to all our outstanding students. We are already initiating partnership with major countries across the world, especially their embassies in Nigeria to expose you to global opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe will focus on brain recirculation and ensure that we provide practical and skill-based learning. We are determined to produce market ready students who will assist Africa in adding value to its resources instead of exporting raw materials,\u201d Eromosele said.\n\nFor his part, Vice Chancellor Izevbigie said although he had his education in the United States, he did not enjoy most of the facilities Muidame University currently parade, adding that instead of immediate gains, the school was focused on offering quality service and value.\n\nHe stated that the institution was on its way to becoming one of the world-leading institutions for technological innovation that addresses challenges in agriculture and food safety, energy, health, manufacturing, oil and gas, security, and transportation on a regional and global levels.\n\n\u201cThe Mission or reason(s) for our existence is to contribute to the sustainable welfare of society with expertise in science, technology, and business, and through teaching, research, and community service.\n\n\u201cThe vision bearer of MUI, Prof. S.E. Eromosele, an astute visionary who has helped to redefine the frontiers of the Oil and Gas industry in Nigeria and beyond by the incorporation of standards and calibration measures that affect the bottom-line and operations of the industry, a man who has enjoyed the platform of the prestigious Oxford University, U.K, to impart knowledge,\u201d the VC said.\n\nWhile urging the students to focus on their studies and make the best of the opportunities they have, Izevbigie told them that they were not too young to innovate solutions to the challenges facing the country.\n\nIzevbigie, who noted that the state-of-the-art laboratories, classrooms, hostels, and digitised infrastructure of the university positioned it for conducive learning environment, noted that the school remained the first University in the world to offer the Employment Guaranty Policy (EGP) for all first-class-honours graduates effective with the first graduation class.\n\nAlso speaking, the acting Registrar of the school, Olusegun Johnson, said the school presented a new beginning, standard, orientations, outlooks, philosophies and value.\n\nHe added that the institution represents a departure from devalued education to a standard education, indefinite days in schools to specific and well monitored University calendar with date as well as a departure from dullness of graduates, to creating mind of innovation into graduates.\n\nJohnson added that the university also created a shift from the state of un-employability of graduates to a realm of uniquely breaded employable graduates.",

          "text": "The Senate has identified terrorists\u2019 enclaves in communities within three local government areas of Kwara and Niger States, respectively.\n\nAccordingly, the red chamber, on Tuesday, urged the Military to carry out a comprehensive onslaught against bandits and criminal elements within Kainji Lake National Park and the identified communities in both States.\n\nThe names of communities given by the chamber include Kaiama, Karonzi-Yashikira in Baruten local government of Kwara State, and Wawa and Babanna areas in Niger State.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe call on the Military to act was part of the resolutions reached by the Senate after it considered a motion on the \u201cworsening insecurity in Kainji Lake National Park and existential threat to communities in Kaima, Baruten and Borgu Local Government in Kwara and Miger States.\u201d\n\nThe motion was sponsored by Senator Sadiq Sulieman Umar (Kwara North), and co-sponsored by the Deputy Whip, Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi (Niger North).\n\nIn his presentation, Senator Umar noted that, \u201ckidnapping and other forms of criminality is becoming a recurrent decimal in communities close to Kainji Lake National Park particularly Nanu. Nuku, Woro, Kale in Kaiama and Yashikira in Baruten local Government of Kwara State and some part of Borgu Local Government in Niger State.\n\n\u201cThis has led to people living in perpetual fear of either being kidnapped and or Killed by kidnappers suspected to be armed bandits.\n\n\u201cFurther notes that Kainji Lake National Park covers an area of about 5,341km square with deep forest Vegetation. This park which is reserved for tourism is becoming fort-filed in harboring bandits and other forms of criminals;\n\n\u201cAlso notes that park rangers meant to man this park could no longer protect the forest reserve as they have lost control of the park to terrorist.\n\n\u201cWorried that people living in these communities are predominantly farmers and their means of livelihood is threatened by the activities of these criminals as many are leaving their villages and farms to seek refuge in the towns that will soon be threatened as well if nothing is done about this insecurity situation. In fact, some communities have started paying the criminals some sort of tax to be allowed to stay safe.\n\n\u201cAware that the first incident occurred in year 2008 which led to the death of several Local Vigilante group members in an attempt to dislodge these criminals from the Kainji Lake National Park;\n\n\u201cAlso aware that there is a Forward Operating Base (FOB) established immediately after the first attacks and subsequent approval for the establishment of Military barrack in the local government, but these attacks keeps on happening with reckless abandon; and\n\n\u201cCognizant that in this year 2022 alone, several cases of kidnapping were reported in villages like Nanu, Nuku, Woro, and so on with several people reported dead. Others who returned were released after the payment of millions of Naira.\u201d\n\nThe Senate, in its resolutions, mandated the Committees on Defence; Finance and National Planning to jointly inter-face with the Ministry of Defence to determine status of the establishment and funding of Army Barrack in Kaiama and Forward Operation Base (FOB) in Babanna in Kwara and Niger States, respectively.\n\nIt urged the military authorities to carry out a comprehensive onslaught on bandits and other criminal elements within Kainji Lake National Park, especially Kaiama, Karonzi -Yashikira in Baruten local government, and Wawa and Babanna areas in Niger State.\n\nThe chamber also urged the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to send relief materials to victims in the affected communities.",

The need for an instrument that ensures our unity is not exploited for pecuniary gains, while guaranteeing freedom of speech and expression as enshrined in the Nigerian Constitution, is incumbent on all patriotic citizens.\n\n\u201cBehaviours that increase tension along ethnic biases, interreligious incitements, blasphemy and even secessionist tendencies that threaten security and lead to violence and wanton attacks thrive in an unregulated media space.\u201d\n\nLawal pointed out that while the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) regulates broadcast stations, the Nigerian Press Council (NPC) ensures the maintenance of the highest ethical professional standards in the print media.\n\n\u201cWhy should the online platforms, especially social media, be free from the regulatory scrutiny?\u201d, the coordinator asked, explaining hat other countries have taken stricter measures to curtail excesses on online platforms.\n\nNADIR recalled that on June 16, Meta (Facebook), Google, Twitter and Microsoft agreed to take a tougher line against disinformation, deep fakes and fake accounts, under an updated European Union (EU) Code of Practice or face hefty fines.\n\nLawal said more than 30 signatories including advertising bodies have signed up for the updated code on disinformation as disclosed by the European Commission.\n\n\u201cEven the United States Government \u2013 the self-righteous custodians of free speech \u2013 has announced that it was establishing an interagency task force to fight harassment and abuse online.\u201d\n\nOn the socio-economic benefits of the code of practice, Lawal said with the digital space contributing about 18% to Nigeria\u2019s GDP, compelling big techs to abide by local laws and pay the requisite tax would increase government revenue.\n\n\u201cRegulations will promote more local content, create jobs and breed more corporate and law-abiding citizens who are mindful of our collective sensitivities and unity.\n\n\u201cWhile NITDA has clarified that the code is a draft and subject to inputs, we urge stakeholders to contribute appropriately in order to achieve a mutually accepted code of regulations without recourse to the fear of tackling freedom of speech\u201d, he added.",

          "text": "*says pensioners must be able to do verification exercises from comfort of their homes\n\nBy Michael Oche\n\nDr Chioma Ejikeme, the Executive Secretary of the Pensions Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD) on Tuesday said the Directorate has in place measures that will ensure that pensioners will be able to do their verification exercises from the comfort of their homes, or at the very least, within close proximity to their residences.\n\nDr Ejikeme said this will put an end to the tedious, challenging and expensive field verification exercises of the past embarked by pensioners under the Defined Benefit Scheme.\n\nSpeaking in Abuja on Tuesday during a training programme for Union executives and pension Desk Officers, the PTAD executive Secretary said the application known as \u201cI am Alive\u201d will also enable the senior citizens to resolve their complaints without unnecessary stress.\n\nShe said already, the following the launch of the project last October, 50,000 pensioners were enrolled for the Pilot phase, adding that the solution is now ready for deployment across the nation.\n\nShe said the training of the union executives and pension desk officers on the use of the Application is a critical step towards preparing the pensioners to be fully conversant with the use of the application.\n\nFurthermore, she said, \u201cThe training programme taking place this week is therefore for this primary purpose \u2014 to ensure that our Union Executives and Pension Desk Officers\n\ncan use this \u201c! AM ALIVE\u201d Confirmation solution without any difficulty; that they can assist our pensioners in understanding how to use the application, and that they can respond to basic inquiries and questions about the confirmation process.\n\n\u201cThe training has been organised to first give an understanding of why we are deploying \u201cI AM ALIVE\u201d, what we expect as the impact and benefits to be derived, and what we see as likely challenges. We will also explain the role we believe that Union Executives and Pension Desk Officers should play. In addition, we will demonstrate the entire \u201cI AM ALIVE\u201d Confirmation process again and show you a live demonstration.\n\n\u201cBefore I conclude my address, I would like to make this categorical declaration. Over the years, PTAD has worked assiduously to change the narrative of pension administration in Nigeria, especially under the Defined Benefits Scheme, and we are proud to see that the hard work is yielding positive results.\n\n\u201cThe \u201cI AM ALIVE\u201d Confirmation Solution is the crucial next step that we have to make in our journey to ensuring that all our esteemed pensioners, senior citizens who have served this country, can enjoy their hard-earned pensions without the hardships of the past.\n\n\u201cThe tedious, challenging and expensive field verification exercises of the past must end. Pensioners must be able to confirm their aliveness from the comfort of their homes, or at the very least, within close proximity to their residences. They should also be able to resolve their complaints without unnecessary stress.\n\n\u201cWe want them to be able to contact PTAD with ease, and to be treated with respect and dignity. This project, and all others we have implemented in the past, have been designed towards this end goal.\u201d",

          "text": "Tens of thousands of the UK\u2019s railway workers began the network\u2019s biggest strike action in more than 30 years, leaving commuters facing chaos.\n\nAbout 40,000 cleaners, signalers, maintenance workers and station staff were holding a 24-hour strike on Tuesday, with two more planned for Thursday and Saturday.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe dispute centres on pay, working conditions and job security as the UK\u2019s railways struggle to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThere were almost 1 billion train journeys in the UK in the year to March. But that is well below pre-COVID-19 levels, and train companies, which were kept afloat with government support during the past two years, are seeking to cut costs and staffing.\n\nLast-minute talks on Monday failed to make a breakthrough. The Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT) says it will not accept rail firms\u2019 offer of a 3 percent raise, which is far below the rate of inflation, currently running at 9 percent.\n\nThe union accuses the Conservative government of refusing to give rail firms enough flexibility to offer a substantial pay increase.\n\nThe government says it is not involved in the talks, but has warned that big raises will spark a wage-price spiral driving inflation even higher.\n\nMajor stations were largely deserted on Tuesday morning, with only about 20 percent of passenger trains scheduled to run, forcing people to either work from home or find alternative routes into the office.\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said he \u201cdeplored\u201d the strikes, which he said evoked the \u201cbad old days of the 1970s\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe people that are hurting are people who physically need to turn up for work, maybe on lower pay, perhaps the cleaners in hospitals,\u201d he told Sky News broadcaster. \u201cI absolutely deplore what they\u2019re doing today and there is no excuse for taking people out on strike.\u201d\n\nBut Mick Lynch, RMT\u2019s general-secretary, described as \u201cunacceptable\u201d offers of below-inflation pay rises by both overground train operators and London Underground that runs the Tube in the capital.\n\nThe walkouts \u2013 also on Thursday and Saturday \u2013 risk causing significant disruption to major events including the Glastonbury music festival.\n\nSchools are warning that thousands of teenagers taking national exams will also be affected.\n\nThe strikes are the biggest dispute on the UK\u2019s railway network since 1989, according to the RMT.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Paul Brennan reported from the UK\u2019s biggest and busiest station Waterloo, saying \u201cextraordinary sight compared to normal\u201d day. Only 45 percent of the whole network will be operating, and with that number of services cut to one fifth compared with a regular day.\n\nUK public is divided on their support for strikes.\n\n\u201cSome people do have sympathy with the striking workers, it\u2019s not just train drivers and guards, these are railway staff across a lot of professions\u201d, Brennan said, adding: \u201cPeople say look the cost of living is such as going up at such a rate that people are entitled to a pay rise\u201d.\n\nBut other commuters are frustrated with the disruptions.\n\nInflation in the UK surged in May to its highest annual rate in 40 years, official data showed, piling pressure on the government to step up assistance for households facing a worsening cost-of-living crisis.\n\nReuters",

          "title": "Russia Threatens Retaliation Against Lithuania Following EU Rail \u2018Blockade\u2019",
          "text": "Moscow has threatened to retaliate against Lithuania after the Baltic state halted the rail transport of Russian goods under EU sanctions to the exclave of Kaliningrad. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry summoned Lithuania\u2019s charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Moscow on Monday to \u201cdemand an immediate cancellation of the restrictions\u201d or face \u201cactions to defend [Russia\u2019s] national interests\u201d, it said in a statement. Grigory Karasin, a former senior diplomat who chairs the foreign affairs committee in Russia\u2019s upper house of parliament, said the d\u00e9marche was \u201charsh\u201d and warned any response would be \u201cquite decisive\u201d, according to the Russian news agency, Interfax.\n\nLithuania, which controls the only overland rail route linking Kaliningrad with mainland Russia, at the weekend began limiting the export of goods covered by EU sanctions in retaliation for president Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The restrictions affected iron and steel, luxury goods and some other goods, banned in earlier sanctions packages, that amount to a quarter of total Russian rail supplies to Kaliningrad, the ministry said.\n\nJosep Borrell, the EU\u2019s chief diplomat, gave a full-throated defence of Lithuania\u2019s actions on Monday, saying that while he was \u201calways worried about Russian retaliation\u201d, Lithuania was \u201cnot guilty\u201d. \u201cLithuania has not taken any unilateral national restrictions and only applies EU sanctions,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cLithuania is doing nothing else but implementing the guidelines of the commission.\u201d Sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland, Kaliningrad has been a source of tension between Russia and Europe since the Baltic states declared independence from the USSR in 1991, leaving it without a direct overland route to Moscow. Russia\u2019s Baltic fleet, which has almost 80 warships and submarines, is headquartered there. Moscow has also deployed nuclear-capable Iskander ballistic missiles in the region, though it has not said whether they carry nuclear warheads.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia\u2019s security council, warned in April that it would be impossible for the region to remain \u201cnon-nuclear\u201d if Finland and Sweden joined Nato, suggesting the possible nuclear deployment could be made official. The EU sanctions have isolated Kaliningrad further, forcing Russian planes to make a detour over the Baltic Sea because of a ban on using the bloc\u2019s airspace. Lithuania rejected Russian accusations it had acted unilaterally and said its move was in compliance with the EU measures, which contain different winding down periods after which the goods in question can no longer be shipped to Russia. \u201cIt\u2019s not Lithuania doing anything. It\u2019s the EU sanctions,\u201d said Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania\u2019s foreign minister. \u201cIt is done with consultations with the European Commission and under the European Commission guidelines.\u201d\n\nLandsbergis, speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday, played down the threat of a Russian response. Lithuania also said the overland rail route would remain open for passengers and non-sanctioned goods. The Kremlin likened the restrictions to a \u201cblockade\u201d and said it would assess the situation before deciding whether and how to respond, Interfax reported. Anton Alikhanov, Kaliningrad\u2019s governor, said the province could ship the sanctioned goods through the Baltic but said the extra cost would make transit economically unviable, according to state newswire Ria Novosti. Russia could take \u201cfairly obvious\u201d measures in response that would be \u201cextremely painful\u201d for Lithuania, he added.\n\nFT",
