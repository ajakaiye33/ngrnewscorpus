          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria says the e-naira which is set to be launched on October 1 is a legal tender equal to the value of the naira and thus must be accepted as a form of payment by all merchants and business outlets.\n\nThe CBN Director, Payment System Management, Mr. Musa Jimoh, said this during an interview on the \u2018Business Morning\u2019 programme on Channels Television on Monday.\n\nJimoh said, \u201cToday, anywhere you present naira to pay, compulsorily it must be accepted because that is our fiat currency. So, the same way naira is accepted that you can\u2019t reject it, is the same way e-naira must be accepted. Anywhere in this country where e-naira is presented, it must be accepted. So, merchants must accept e-naira as a means of payment.\u201d\n\nHe advised Nigerians to open e-naira wallets which could be downloaded on their phones from October 1, adding that CBN bears all liabilities.\n\n\u201cThe liability of the e-naira money is directly on CBN which is similar to the cash you hold. The liability of the cash you hold today rests with the CBN. So, it gives Nigerians the opportunity to bank with CBN,\u201d Jimoh said.\n\nOn whether Nigeria was ripe for the e-naira due to the technological challenges in the country, Jimoh said he didn\u2019t expect it to be a major problem.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "THE Paramount Ruler of Atyap Chiefdom, also known as \u2018Agwatyap\u2019, Sir Dominic Yahaya, has raised the alarm over sustained Fulani attacks which have claimed over 50 lives of villagers under his domain which include Zango-Kataf in Southern Kaduna within a month.\n\nThe killings, the monarch said, included heavily pregnant women and children, claiming also that 254 houses and seven churches were destroyed by the herdsmen during the sustained attacks.\n\nYahaya stated these while addressing a press conference in Kaduna, the state capital, on Monday.\n\nWhile expressing grave concern over the killings, the Agwatyap maintained that his domain is now under siege, warning that the attacks had reached \u201can extreme height of provocation almost beyond control.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the attacks have forced the natives who are predominantly farmers out of their land and can no longer go to farm.\n\nYahaya added that no fewer than 15,000 natives were now at the internally displaced camps in the area, and called on both the state and federal governments to come to the aide of the displaced villagers.\n\nHe also appealed to security operatives to adopt extreme measures toward containing the unwarranted and unprovoked attacks across the Atyap chiefdom.\n\nThis was just as he called on the Federal Government to accord traditional rulers constitutional roles aimed at checking the frequent attacks in their domains across the country.\n\nThe monarch said, \u201cSaturday, September 11 was another black day in Atyap Chiefdom when gunmen struck again, killing Reverend Silas Ali within the vicinity of Zango Urban settlement in Atyap Chiefdom of Zangon-Kataf LGA of Kaduna State.\n\n\u201cAnd the following day, Sunday, September 12, suspected herdsmen invaded the community of Apyiah Ajiim, few hundred metres from the spot of Saturday\u2019s attack, killing 12 people in another round of recurring attacks on the Atyap community. The victims include six women (two were heavily pregnant), three men and three children.\n\n\u201cI wish to passionately appeal to the federal and state governments to come to the aid of these homeless peasants whom, not fewer than 15,000 of them are now in Internally Displaced Persons camps, by providing succour particularly in the area of building materials to enable them re-erect structures to return to their communities.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Joining APC\u2019ll diminish your political stature \u2014 PGF DG warns Jonathan",
          "text": ".\n\n.On FFK, says APC members mustn\u2019t be more catholic than the Pope\n\nBy Omeiza Ajayi, Abuja\n\nDirector-General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum PGF, Salihu Moh. Lukman has cautioned ex-President Goodluck Jonathan against leaving his current Peoples Democratic Party PDP for the ruling All Progressives Congress APC, saying any such move would only serve to diminish his political stature as an elder statesman.\n\nLukman made the caution in a statement titled, \u201cAPC\u2019s High-Profile Membership Recruitment and Issues for 2023\u201d issued Sunday in Abuja.\n\nHe also faulted the \u2018red-carpet\u2019 reception offered a former critic of the current administration, Chief Femi Fani Kayode, who last week defected to the APC, but advised aggrieved party members against protesting the gesture saying if President Muhammadu Buhari and party leaders have accepted Mr Kayode, then party members should not be more catholic than the Pope.\n\nLukman said; \u201cPart of the reason why high-profile membership recruitments by political parties in Nigeria attracts a lot of debate, attention, and controversy, is that it hardly comes without any ambition to contest the election by those joining the party. Although in the case of Mr Fani-Kayode, no one can associate it with the ambition to contest the election, which is why many questioned his electoral value, with 2023 elections less than two years away, and with the APC leadership efficiently succeeding to win so many high-profile leaders joining the party, there has been lots of speculation in terms of what all the high-profile membership recruitment into APC represents.\n\n\u201cPartly because President Buhari will be completing his 2nd term and therefore ineligible to contest, the question of who will emerge as the Presidential candidate of the APC for 2023 is quite open.\n\n\u201cTwo of the Governors who recently joined the APC from the PDP are speculated to have done so because of ambition for 2023. And since the 2019 Bayelsa State Governorship election, when APC leaders met former President Goodluck Jonathan to lobby support for APC candidate, Mr David Lyon, there have been speculations that he (former President Jonathan) will also be joining the APC.\n\nAlso Read:\n\n\u201cSome have even alleged that as part of the negotiations, former President Jonathan has already been offered the APC Presidential ticket for 2023. Amid the controversy around Mr Fani-Kayode, the Secretary of the APC Caretaker Committee, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe, is reported to have confirmed that anyone who joins the party will be free to contest.\n\nHowever, it is important that the issue of high-profile membership recruitment by APC is clarified beyond the narrow expectations of the electoral contests.\n\nWhy should the objective of recruiting high-profile members be reduced to the issue of contesting elections? Assuming someone like former President Jonathan agrees to join the APC and he fails to emerge as the Presidential Candidate of the party for the 2023 election, what will happen to him?\n\n\u201cAs Nigerians, we must begin to take steps to protect our leaders. As APC members, we have campaigned against former President Jonathan in 2015.\n\n\u201d As President, former President Jonathan made every effort to block the emergence of APC in 2013. But those should not be the reference point.\n\n\u201cThe reference point should be the historic decision of former President Jonathan to concede defeat in 2015 even before the final votes were counted.\n\n\u201cWith that, former President Jonathan ranked himself as one of those who fought and defended Nigeria\u2019s democracy. On no account, therefore, should any political party be allowed to push former President Jonathan to diminish his stature, either as an aspirant or a candidate for any office. Doing so will mean that we want him to gamble away all his legendary achievements.\n\n\u201cIt is sad enough that PDP leaders, being who they are, don\u2019t recognise and respect former President Jonathan\u2019s deservedly political stature. No doubt, every speculation about the possibility of former President Jonathan joining the APC has to do with the reality of being unappreciated by PDP leadership.\n\n\u201cNegotiating to bring him into APC should not be based on aspiring for any office. It must be recognised that former President Jonathan, and indeed every former President, is beyond holding any office in the land. Bringing former Presidents to that level will amount to diminishing their political stature.\n\n\u201cAlready, President Buhari is doing excellently well by delegating some high-profile diplomatic responsibilities to former President Jonathan. One of the failures of PDP is the inability to create responsibilities that can match the statures of former Presidents. Inability to create responsibilities for former Presidents is perhaps what accounts for the overbearing restlessness of former President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\n\u201cWith President Buhari scheduled to end his tenure in 2023, less than two years away, negotiations to recruit former President Jonathan into APC must be used to settle the question of the roles of former Presidents within the APC.\n\n\u201cAPC must not allow the situation to emerge whereby party leaders and members-only respect elected and appointed functionaries.\n\n\u201cPart of the lessons from the challenges created under the last National Working Committee led by Comrade Adams Oshiomhole had to do with the absence of Board of Trustees.\n\n\u201cIs it possible therefore to organise the APC Board of Trustees\u2019 and get former Presidents to provide the needed moral leadership that can serve as a check to both party leaders and elected functionaries of the party?\n\n\u201cHaving former Presidents discharging persuasive moral responsibilities as leaders of Board of Trustees would strengthen the capacity of party leaders and members to influence decisions of elected functionaries. Just imagine two former serving Presidents of the standings of President Buhari and former President Jonathan working in harmony towards a common political goal. It will take a rascally elected functionary at whatever level to ignore their recommendations. On the other hand, the big risk is when they are unable to work in harmony.\n\n\u201cThat will tear the party apart and may potentially destroy the party. There is the need, therefore, to broaden consultations and agree on everything required to ensure that the framework of operations of the APC Board of Trustees guarantees that former serving Presidents can work in harmony\u201d, he stated.\n\nOn My Fani Kayode, the PGF DG said; \u201cAlmost every member of APC is angry that our leaders have brought someone like Mr Fani-Kayode into our party. This is made worse by the red-carpet reception given to him, which he doesn\u2019t deserve. But since it has happened, there is no need to cry over spilt milk.\n\n\u201cWhat is very clear is that our leaders, especially President Buhari have forgiven Mr Fani-Kayode and embrace him as one of us. As members of APC, our anger with Mr Fani-Kayode is that he has abused both the APC, President Buhari and virtually every leader of the party.\n\n\u201cFor instance, he claimed that the \u2018emergence of Buhari in 2015 annihilated Nigeria and plunged her into darkness, death and destruction. He came to steal, kill and destroy and for the last disastrous 5 years that is all he has done.\u2019 More than this, he has said unprintable things against the APC and all its leaders.\n\n\u201cAt this point, therefore, if with all these, our leaders can accept Mr Fani-Kayode into the party, APC members should not be more Catholic than the Pope. Why should APC members be sad that our leaders are magnanimous? Perhaps, because of the red-carpet reception, which many committed APC members cannot even dream of, it should be legitimate to feel unappreciated like Mr Joe Igbokwe had cried out.\n\n\u201cBut as APC members, especially those who have been in the party since its formation in 2013 and have endured all the challenges of being loyal members, we must always be reminded that our commitment is to contribute in whatever way and manner possible to change Nigeria for the better.\n\n\u201cIf therefore, someone like Mr Fani-Kayode, who is considered unreliable and therefore not qualified to be a member, would seek for forgiveness from our leaders, based on which they extended their arms to him, members of the APC should also show understanding\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Whether we are President or Vice President, we will lead Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have the majority of the votes and the democracy says vote whom you want. Why should we accept a second class position when we know we can buy forms and contest for first class and we will win?\n\n\u201cWhy does anybody need to threaten us and intimidate us? We will get that power, but be humble because power comes from God. We inherited leadership, being honest is not being stupid.\n\n\u201cThere are Nigerians who believed that because the economy of the North has already been crumbled; we are running away from insecurity. We are politically vulnerable, they think they can buy us for 2023. They are making a mistake.\n\n\u201cWe are not for sale. We are in the process of rebuilding the North and we will rebuild the North from 2023.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhether the North holds power in 2023 or not, anybody who wants to break up in this country will say so. They are just looking for excuses.\n\n\u201cThis is democracy. If they don\u2019t like what Nigeria is, they will say they want to break up from this country. We don\u2019t pay attention to those people. We are focused on the fact that we are running a democratic system.\n\n\u201cIf the majority of Nigerian voters vote for a candidate from the North and he becomes the President and somebody doesn\u2019t want to live under Nigeria President, the person can leave.\n\n\u201cWe inherited the North that determined where Nigeria went. We dropped the ball and we are leaving you to pick it.\n\n\u201cThe North is not for sale, our legacy is not for sale; if there are Nigerians who are thinking that in 2023 we will line up because they will give us money, they are making a terrible mistake because the North is not for sale; our future is not for sale, we have learnt from our mistakes and we will not repeat those mistakes.\u201d\n\nBut, Okupe, in a piece, disagreed with Buba-Ahmed, saying that zoning and power shift are imperative.\n\nHe maintained that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) may lose the 2023 presidential election if it picks its flagbearer from the North.\n\nOkupe said the resolution of the Southern governors, including PDP governours, that the presidency should be zoned to the South should not be ignored.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt will be folly, reckless and insensitive for any political party to ignore the position of the Southern governors.\u201d\n\nOkupe said: \u201cThere is a strong indication that the party is erroneously tilting towards zoning the presidency to the North.\n\n\u201cZoning is a veritable instrument that ensures equity and balance in the nation, gives hope and confidence and support to our national unity.\n\n\u201cThe zoning arrangement which the PDP started in 1998 was based on the assumption that the party will be in power consistently but the moment it lost power in 2015, automatically the arrangement has to be reviewed in view of the development\n\n\u201cWhen the PDP lost power, there was a southern president in power. If the party didn\u2019t lose power and completed in 2019, zoning would kick in and power would have shifted to the North. However, the party that won the election presented a northern candidate who by 2023 would have ruled for eight years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe still carried on as if the former arrangement was still in place in 2019 and it was justifiable within the PDP at that time for us to put forward a northern candidate.\n\n\u201cBut in 2023, with APC having ruled for eight years with a northern candidate, it will be preposterous, unjust, uncaring and blatant for the PDP to zone the presidential ticket to the North because the arrangement expired the moment our party lost power in 2019.\n\n\u201cThere should be a reset of the zoning arrangement in 2023. It does not make sense to replace a northern government of eight years with another northern government.\u201d",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nFormer vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Peter Obi, has said it was not likely that the emergence of its national chairman would determine where the party would zone the presidency in 2023.\n\nSpeaking on Arise TV, yesterday, over speculations that the chairmanship of the party would go the South during its October national convention and the presidential ticket would go to north, the former governor of Anambra State said 2023 would be different because the party knows it has to get it right in 2023 or else it would be bad for the country.\n\n\u201cI cannot speak on what the zoning committee is going to do but let me assure you that even in the discussions that we have had in various meetings, I do not see the zoning of the chairmanship as a determinant that the other zone would produce the presidential candidate. Everybody today knows that things are not what they should be in Nigeria and we have to get it right in 2023. If we get it wrong in 2023, it would be very bad for the country, so, we have to get it right.\n\n\u201cWe must look for competence and someone who has capacity in the knowledge of what it means to serve or lead this country. We are on the wrong road and we cannot continue this journey on this road. So, if the chairman comes from one zone, it would not stop people from the other zone from contesting. We are dealing with something that can be moved from one zone to the other. I can tell you that 2023 would be totally different because everybody is struggling to make sure that we do not get it wrong. I cannot determine where the zoning would go but we would wait and see, then we would look into it.\n\n\u201cIn the event that the PDP zones to the north, I cannot speak for any state in the South East on how they would vote but I know that the southern governors have said the presidency should go to the South and that includes the South East. The South East as a zone has said it wants inclusion in Nigeria to show that it is part of it. The demand of the South East is genuine and compelling but we would have to watch what would happen. We have to consult, negotiate and make people understand what the issues are.\u201d\n\nObi who was governor on the platform of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) for eight years and defected to the PDP at the end of his tenure, denied reports that while he was governor, he vowed not to join the then ruling party and accused it of being a curse to the South East.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want someone to show me a tape where I said that I will never join PDP because it is a curse to the South East. That statement is something that was orchestrated for a purpose. I was the chairman of South East Governors Forum for eight years, we were supposed to rotate it yearly but every other governor told me to continue. Don\u2019t forget that the other four governors were PDP governors, so there is no way I would have made such a statement and they would still keep me as chairman of the forum.\n\n\u201cThere was no governor that was closer to former president, Goodluck Jonathan, than me. While I was in APGA, I was in his economic management team, so, how would I have said that about the PDP and he will still keep me? There was a time the late Ojukwu was worried about my closeness to PDP but I promised that I would always be with him. When he fell sick, I ensured that he was taken abroad for treatment and I made provision for everything that he needed.\u201d\n\nHe asked President Muhammadu Buhari to stop taking pictures with \u201cheartless, valueless\u201d politicians switching political parties.\n\nObi said the trend \u201cis sending the wrong signal that you can be anything and be elevated into something.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me tell you what I found worrisome about the defection of today. What I found worrisome is people, weekly and daily, being led to go and take photoshoots with the president, I\u2019m worried about it. I want to see the president taking pictures at the funeral of our falling soldiers, police, or their family,\u201d the former vice-presidential candidate said.\n\n\u201cI want to see him taking pictures with young people who are doing innovative things in the tech industry. I want to see him taking pictures with people who are making a lot of impact; not pictures with those of us, I\u2019m generalising politicians, who are heartless, valueless. It is very worrisome. Those pictures are not helping our country. The perception is sending the wrong signal that you can be anything and be elevated into something.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "From Tony John, Port Harcourt\n\nGovernor Nyesom Wike has accused the Federal Government of treating Rivers State as if it was not part of Nigeria.\n\nHe said it was an injustice to exclude the state from those to benefit from the proposed World Bank loan. He described it as hatred against a major state servicing the national economy.\n\n\u201cLook at the hatred; that you collect money from World Bank and Rivers State is excluded. If fiscal federalism does not start today, it will start tomorrow. That is not essence of governance. Give me what belongs to my state to develop my state.\u201d\n\nThe governor said he was baffled by the way things are done in Nigeria, condemning politicisation of government\u2019s good policies.\n\nOn the controversial collection of Valued Added Tax (VAT) by states, Governor Wike said he had no objection being a \u201cbrother\u2019s keeper\u201d so long as things were done legally.\n\n\u201cLet me say clearly, it is unfortunate what we have in this country today. Ordinarily, I shouldn\u2019t have said this. But, what I don\u2019t understand is how everything is being politicised to ethnicity and religion.\n\n\u201cI have not seen a country that will never come out to say this is the right thing we are doing and this is the wrong thing we are doing, we need to correct it.\n\n\u201cWhen you raise an issue everybody knows is wrong, instead of people to see it from that perspective that this is wrong, we see it from the perspective of ethnicity. We see it from the perspective of religion.\n\n\u201cI have never seen a country like this in my life where something that is black and white, we begin to look at it well\u2026are you sure it does not look like dark, blue\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even need to be a lawyer to know that VAT is not in item 58 or 59 on second schedule of the 1999 Constitution. Everybody knows that. It is not even in the Concurrent List. Therefore, it falls under Residual List. It is not arguable.\u201d\n\nHe called on the Federal Government to encourage states to develop their areas instead of depending on the monthly federal allocation.\n\n\u201cNigeria should encourage states to be strong enough to have resources to develop their states. We are in a federal system where we are practising unitary system. Everybody at the end of the month would rush to Abuja to share money. Nobody comes back to the state to think how do develop his state.\n\n\u201cThe issue of VAT did not start from Rivers State alone. It started in Lagos State; Lagos challenged it in the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, Supreme Court said, look, you wouldn\u2019t have sued the Federal Government, what you should have done was to sue the agency.\n\nWe (Rivers) came up to sue the agency that you are not entitled to VAT. And it looks like we are doing something to cause crisis in the country, shamelessly, to some states, who believe that they would only at the end of the month go to Abuja to collect whatever is in the federal pool. Shamelessly.\n\n\u201cSome people say, be your brother\u2019s keeper. I have no problem being my brother\u2019s keeper. But, I will not be my brother\u2019s keeper when I know that my brother is an armed robber. I can\u2019t do that. Why not come out to say look, let\u2019s tell ourselves the simple truth\u2026 You cannot expect me to be my brother\u2019s keeper when you are doing an illegal thing. Somebody is joining FIRS to do illegal thing and you are saying I should be my brother\u2019s keeper; and you are doing what the law say you should not do. I won\u2019t do it. I will be a brother\u2019s keeper when you are doing the right thing.\n\n\u201cSo, if as a state, you have difficulty, I have said it before that there is no place in the world where states are equal. Every state has its own advantages and disadvantages. It is the ability to be creative, to know how to turn your own disadvantage to something that will help your people. We are using the instrument of the law to say what you are doing is wrong. And instead of them to encourage us, they are using religion, ethnicity.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

When they ask security guards on duty, they were told that Lecturers are on strike.\n\n\u201cStudents were not properly inform about the strike and when the examination was suspended, they decided to expressed their displeasure through a peaceful protest.\n\n\u201cIn the process, troops of the Operation SAFE HAVEN came to dispatch the students who were blocking road, they teargas the students and shot several on the air where one of the students was hit by the bullet on the head and another shot on stomach that led to the death of one student.\n\n\u201cWe are not happy over this unhealthy development because we have over stayed in the institution due to COVID-19. Government must learn to respect any agreement signed with the academic union in the institution.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue to be victims of their disagreement, the right thing should be done to enable us return to school soon to continue with our examination.\u201d He stated.\n\nPresident Public Administration Students Association (PASA), Peter Bisat lamented the untold hardship the strike will caused the students.\n\nHe said the final year students are worse hit by the unhealthy development as they have been held in the school beyond the during for which they are supposed to complete their students.\n\nBisat said the lecturers has done their utmost best as they have completed their lectures scheme and ready to conduct examination only for the state government to decline the agreement earlier reach with academic union on disparity with the salary table.\n\n\u201cWe have been hearing rumor of this strike right from when we resumed this semester, the lecturers have been working to resolve the issues while lectures were going on.\n\n\u201cAt some point, I was told that the reach an agreement with the Head of Service but Government is yet to implement the agreement. The are human being and we plead with government to as a matter of urgency commence the implementation of that agreement to enable us return to school.\u201d\n\nChairman of Joint Union of the Academic Staff of Plateau State Owned Tertiary Institutions, Comrade Lumye Innocent Simji had declared indefinite strike action with effect from Friday 17 September, 2022 following government in ability to honour the agreement earlier signed on salary table for lecturers and illegal deductions.\n\nHe said, \u201cFirst of all was the issue of our salary consolidation. Sometimes in October last year we wake up and discovered that they deconsolidated our salaries and this is a salary table that we had an agreement with government signed and they have been paying us with.\u201d\n\nHe also lamented how the Plateau State Healthcare Contributory Management Agency commenced deduction from the salaries of his members without adhering to the agreement reached on the issue of the health contributory scheme signed into law by the Executive Governor, Simon Lalong.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "A backstory to the tussle between CBN and popular website abokiFX",
          "text": "abokiFX, a popular mobile and web-based platform that collates the black market foreign exchange rates in Nigeria, on Friday announced it will temporarily suspend the publishing of rates on all its platforms, hours after receiving threats from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThe apex bank had said it would shut down the platform, which Governor Godwin Emefiele described as \u201cillegal and criminal\u201d and accused of carrying out an \u201cillegal activity that undermines the economy\u201d.\n\nAfter the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s two-day meeting in Abuja, Emefiele confirmed that the apex bank was also planning to prosecute abokiFX\u2019s supposed owner, Olusegun Adedotun Oniwinde, for \u201cillegal forex trading\u201d and \u201ceconomic sabotage\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have given instructions to our experts to go after his website and let it be clear that we will go after him because we can\u2019t allow this to continue,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that the CBN does not recognize any foreign exchange market window apart from the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window.\n\nWhy Nigeria has different exchange rates\n\nNigeria is Africa\u2019s largest producer of oil, a commodity that brings in more than 90% of the country\u2019s foreign exchange earnings. Between 2014 to 2016, a plunge in global oil prices caused a dollar crunch that resulted in an economic recession.\n\nBut rather than an outright devaluation of the naira, the CBN adopted a multiple exchange-rate regime. This involved keeping a stronger rate pegged to the U.S. dollar for official transactions and a weaker floating rate for investors and exporters, known as the NAFEX window.\n\nOther rates were introduced for travelers and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) while there\u2019s also the parallel or black market, where foreign currencies are traded unofficially and the naira is often valued less than the NAFEX rate.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA historic plunge in oil prices triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic last year caused a more severe scarcity of hard currency in Nigeria. The CBN was forced to devalue the naira twice last year, amid other measures meant to stabilise the exchange rate such as limiting forex deposits and withdrawals over the counter and banning the sale of forex to exchange bureaus.\n\nIn March, the apex bank also replaced the exchange rate at the official window, set at \u20a6379/$1, with the NAFEX rate of \u20a6410.25/$1, as part of efforts to ditch the multiple exchange rate system that\u2019s been said to distort the market and frustrate foreign investors, in favor of a single-rate system. That left Nigeria with only two rates \u2013 the NAFEX rate and the parallel market rate \u2013 from almost five different rates as of early 2020.\n\nWhere abokiFX comes in\n\nBefore abokiFX, Nigerians wanting to change currencies in the unofficial black/parallel market could only obtain information on rates manually, such as through phone calls to money changers.\n\nHowever, the platform, which was launched in 2014 has gained popularity as a go-to source for information on the value of the naira against the major foreign currencies in the black market. It is used by market operators for trading and news organisations for reporting.\n\nIn recent weeks, and particularly after the CBN stopped forex sales to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators a month ago, the value of the naira has plummeted sharply, with the gap further widening between the parallel and NAFEX rates.\n\nBefore the ban, the local unit traded at around \u20a6520/$1 but fell to \u20a6570/$1 on Friday. A day before, the naira recorded its biggest single-day plunge in the parallel market in several months, a \u20a68.00 or 1.42% decline from \u20a6562/$1 on Wednesday to \u20a6570/$1, per abokiFX data.\n\nMeanwhile, data on the FMDQ securities exchange window, where forex is traded officially, showed that naira closed at \u20a6412.88/$1 on Friday. Currency speculators profit from this difference between the black market and official rates through round-tripping and other forms of currency manipulation practices that negatively affect the value of the local currency.\n\nAllegations of economic sabotage\n\nAccording to the CBN Governor, Oniwinde, who is based in the United Kingdom, publishes arbitrary rates without contacting BDCs and uses his website for forex manipulations and speculations, making profits from the significant disparity in rates quoted on abokiFX and the official exchange rate.\n\nEmefiele added that the apex bank had been studying the activities of the platform in the last two years. \u201cThere was a time we asked our colleagues to call the abokiFX to ask how he conducts the rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CBN act section 2, does make it clear that only the Central Bank can determine the value of the naira, and yet a single individual living in England continues to manipulate the exchange rate and make a huge profit which he withdraws through an ATM in London.\n\nA screenshot of the abokiFX website.\n\n\u201cIt is economic sabotage and we will pursue him, wherever he is, we will report him to international security agencies, we will track him, Mr. Oniwinde, we will find you, because we cannot allow you to continue to conduct an illegal activity that kills our economy,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\nThe CBN head also alleged that Oniwinde was an illegal forex dealer with over 20 bank accounts in eight banks that are filled with money from speculative activities and he\u2019s sold \u201ctens of millions of forex\u201d to several Nigerian companies, violating the country\u2019s foreign exchange laws.\n\nabokiFX debunks claims\n\nabokiFX in a statement released on Friday debunked the CBN\u2019s claims and said all allegations towards its director were not confirmed.\n\n\u201cAll allegations against our director are yet to be confirmed but we at abokiFX DO NOT trade FX nor do we manipulate parallel market rates,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cOutside the media allegation, we have not received any communication from any government body and our accounts are not closed as stipulated in the media.\u201d\n\nThe company has, however, temporarily suspended rate updates on all its platforms to \u201cget better clarity of the situation\u201d, adding that it \u201csincerely hopes the suspension will lead to the Naira appreciation from next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinal rates have been posted this evening but the abokiFX news section and the crypto rates section will still be active,\u201d the statement adds. \u201cWith our decision to temporarily suspend online rates publication, we are aware that there will be limited visibility of parallel rates information which will impact decision making for many.\u201d\n\nThe abokiFX statement.

The remaining 10% is split between three or four other nationwide operators including Africell and Uganda Telecom.\n\nSouth Africa-based MTN Group, Africa\u2019s largest telecoms operator, entered Uganda in 1998 and has since established dominance in the market; largely due to first-mover advantage and significant investments the business has made in Uganda.\n\nAirtel, which launched 12 years later, has mainly relied on acquisitions to scale its market position. After entering Uganda through the purchase of Zain\u2019s operations, the company, in 2013, fully acquired Warid Telecom for $100 million; the first-ever in-country acquisition in the sector that increased Airtel\u2019s subscriber base by over 50%.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWith operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), The Gambia, and Sierra Leone, Africell launched in Uganda in 2014 after buying the local operations of French telecom giant, Orange.\n\nAt the time of the acquisition, 8 operators were serving a population of around 36 million Ugandan residents, with total subscriptions estimated at less than 20 million. It appeared Africell was entering an untapped market and the company bet on data services to eat into the market share of incumbents.\n\n\u201cWhen entering new markets, Africell\u2019s objective is always to introduce competition in a manner that benefits local consumers and communities,\u201d Sam Williams, the firm\u2019s communications director told TechCabal. \u201cIn Uganda, our goal was to provide an appealing alternative to the incumbent duopoly, by focusing (among other things) on fast and reliable data services.\u201d\n\nAfricell is reputed for its affordable internet service packages and relative network stability in Uganda, which saw it gain the trust of a substantial number of subscribers. But like its predecessors, the company struggled to make a notable impact in a mobile market reputedly hostile to new entrants.\n\nThe perils of playing third fiddle\n\nThe economics of being number three on the telecoms players list in a relatively small and saturated market makes little commercial sense for Africell or any potential entrant.\n\nUganda has over 24 million mobile subscribers with MTN controlling 50% of the market while Airtel Uganda accounts for 43%. This means newcomers are forced to share in a limited pool of subscribers left over by the leaders.\n\nFor instance, other telecom players in South Africa apart from MTN and Vodacom have struggled to make consistent profits. MTN also decided against reapplying for a license in Ethiopia, to avoid trailing behind Ethio Telecom and Safaricom.\n\nAccording to Williams, Africell \u201cbuilt a strong position\u201d in Ugandan urban centers already dominated by its competitors. However, a wider rollout to underserved areas would have required a significant longer-term investment that would have been difficult to recover given the size of Africell\u2019s market share.\n\n\u201cIn a market where two incumbents control that much market share already, it\u2019s definitely going to be very challenging for other operators to break in,\u201d Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer, told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cTelecommunications is capital intensive. Masts, towers, fibre, and data centres do not come cheap. Without a significant number of subscribers, it\u2019s going to be hard to recoup returns on investment.\u201d\n\nAn Africell Shop in Uganda. Image credit: Techjaja\n\nOrange invested significantly in new technologies before deciding to cut short its losses. Since it entered Uganda via a shareholding agreement with HiTS Telecom in 2009, the French firm was only able to get around 700,000 subscribers \u2013 roughly 3.3% of the market share at the time.\n\nAfricell claims to have grown the inherited number of subscribers to about 2.3 million within seven years, becoming the country\u2019s third-largest player, according to data available on the firm\u2019s website.\n\nHowever, data from Omdia shows that figure is closer to 1.6 million, some way off the pace compared to almost 15 million subscribers for MTN and 12.8 million for Airtel. It\u2019s also reportedly been losing its share of the market slowly, which fell from about 7% at the end of 2019 to 5% at the end of June 2021.\n\n\u201cWe decided to end operations following a careful analysis of how the Uganda business fits into our overall Africell Group strategy,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s a recognition of the fact that \u2013 in our view \u2013 investment in our other markets is a more sustainable route to our goal of advancing the African telecoms sector.\u201d\n\nA flurry of exits\n\nAfricell hasn\u2019t been the only victim of MTN and Airtel Uganda\u2019s dominance. Before Africell\u2019s decision to pack, at least four other players have either exited or been bought out by bigger players after failing to break into the inner circle of the market.\n\nIn addition to the acquisition of Warid, which at the time was the third-largest player and had offered the biggest threat to the MTN-Airtel duopoly, K2 Telecom\u2019s operation was absorbed by Airtel in 2018.\n\nSmart Telecom exited the market in August of this year; and Vodafone, with all its solid financial backing, could only challenge for three years before it eventually quit.\n\nWith Africell\u2019s exit, only three major network providers currently operate in Uganda, a landlocked country with a population of over 44 million people.\n\nWhat next for Africell?\n\nWhile it struggled to grow its market share, Africell also grappled with high operating costs and debt burden, part of which was inherited from Orange. In 2019, the company\u2019s losses reportedly rose to over Ksh1.5 trillion ($400 million), with the bulk of its debt due to cell tower operators.\n\nPart of the conditions set by the sector\u2019s regulator, the Uganda Communication Commission (UCC), before Africell formally winds up operations is the payments of its creditors. Without giving out specific details, Williams disclosed that discussions are currently ongoing between the relevant parties.\n\nIn 2019, Africell signed a financing agreement worth $100 million with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a U.S. government funding agency. The investment is expected to be deployed across Africell\u2019s remaining markets while it\u2019s also planning to launch operations in Angola by the end of this year.\n\nAfricell\u2019s exit from Uganda will come as good news to the likes of MTN, which is gearing up to sell 20% of its shares to the public via an IPO, in line with a government directive issued last year.\n\nCurrent Africell subscribers in the country must close their accounts and switch to alternative mobile providers by October 7, with the company saying it will provide support and guidance during the migration process.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Africell will return mobile sites to third-party owners while network technology equipment will be transferred to other units within the Africell Group. The operator\u2019s mobile frequency and spectrum holdings will be returned to the UCC and it claims to have notified GSMA of the termination of roaming partner agreements.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa",
          "text": "After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple has released the iPhone 13 series.\n\nDuring a virtual event on Tuesday, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 will come in four new models: the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about the iPhone 13 series?\n\nWell, it looks very much like the iPhone 12 but two notable main updates were made to the phone\u2019s display and camera. The new phones will also run on the latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS 15. They also come with larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 Terabyte storage), a new A15 Bionic processor, a smaller notch and new camera features.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe iPhone 13 starts at $829 for 128GB, which is twice the storage the iPhone 12 started with; while the iPhone 13 Mini starts at $729 for 128GB of storage. The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max start at $999 and $1,099 respectively, for 128GB storage.\n\nIPHONE 13 SERIES US PRICES AND STORAGE\n\nPhone 128GB storage 256GB storage 512GB storage 1TB storage iPhone 13 Mini $729 $829 $1,029 NA iPhone 13 $829 $929 $1,129 NA iPhone 13 Pro $999 $1,099 $1,299 $1,499 iPhone 13 Pro Max $1,099 $1,199 $1,399 $1,599\n\nWhy the iPhone 13 series are more expensive in African countries\n\nOver the years, there\u2019s been a noticeable price difference for Apple products in African countries. So, TechCabal reached out to iPhone retailers in different African countries to find out when the iPhone 13 will be available and how much it\u2019ll cost.\n\nNigeria\n\n\u201cOf course, you can expect that since the iPhone will be available on September 24, we\u2019ll have it in Nigeria on or before October 1.\u201d Emmanuel Osho, CEO of Bodds IT and Apple certified technician told TechCabal. \u201cThe price will be about 30% higher because it\u2019s new and there\u2019s a lot of hype around it.\u201d\n\nDespite the increased margin on the iPhone, Osho expects that the new iPhones will still sell out fast. A positive effect of the people purchasing the new iPhone 13 is that they\u2019ll most times trade in their older iPhones, making room for other people to buy them at a more affordable price.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Nigeria, at an exchange rate of $1/\u20a6550, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about \u20a6593,000.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, the iPhone 13 will reportedly be available from October 8 according to iStoreZA, an Apple premium reseller. Although the store hasn\u2019t revealed the prices, the iPhone 13 Pro 128GB is expected to go for around R23,499 ($1,640), while the iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB could retail for around R25,999 ($1,815). This is a high price margin of over 50%, most likely influenced by the fact that an iPhone or iPod attracts 7% duties and 15% VAT in South Africa per Business Insider.\n\nYou can expect that the price of iPhones from other retailers to be around the same price range as the majority of Apple products sold in South Africa come through a sole distributor, Core Computer Group.\n\nKenya\n\nIn Kenya, TechCabal spoke to a Salute iWorld, an authorized Apple product retailer at Yaya Center, Nairobi.\n\nA representative of the retailer told us that they expect to have the iPhone 13 in their stores within the next two weeks.\n\nWhile he couldn\u2019t comment on how much it\u2019ll cost he mentioned that in general Apple products are charged a 16% import fee with an additional 6% added on for Value Added Tax (VAT). This is aside from the transportation cost and the profit margin that the retailer will add to arrive at a final price for the public.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Kenya, at an exchange rate of $1/KSh110, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about KSh119,000.\n\nThe iPhone 13 looks like it offers a bit over its predecessor. But not so much that it\u2019ll compel many to upgrade. In the context of Africa, it brings up the question of whether the minor upgrades are worth paying at least an additional 30% \u2013 50% to get the new iPhone 13 in Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa.\n\nAlexandria Williams contributed to this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly.

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W.

          "title": "I want more women to become angel investors \u2014 Yemi Keri on angel investing and building Rising Tide",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii.

Other initiatives that will help manufacturers, processors and businessmen to survive and do business in our state have been put in place.\n\n\u201cThe Edo State Government knows that access to funding is a challenge. That is why we are partnering with financial institutions, including the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Bank of Industry (BOI) in order to make funds available.

          "text": "While the seven-month old strike by members of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) is yet to be resolved, nurses and midwives in Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital city, Lagos, may on Tuesday commence indefinite strike to press home their demands for improved welfare conditions, and particularly the unpaid \u2018uniform allowance.\u2019\n\nBut the state government has foreclosed the idea of industrial action by the nurses, describing the cause of disagreement as a minor issue.\n\nUltima tum\n\nThe nurses, under the umbrella of the National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives (NANNM), Lagos State chapter, on 30 August, gave a 21-day ultimatum to the government, threatening to down tools should it fail to pay the allowances or put in place concrete steps to commence the processes.\n\nThe letter, which conveyed the ultimatum and addressed to the office of the state\u2019s head of service, Hakeem Muri-Okunola, and referenced; NANNM/LS/HOS/01/VOL.1/11, was titled; \u201cUrgent Reminder and Ultimatum on the Central Payment of Nurses\u2019 Uniform Allowance.\u201d\n\nThe union accused the government of sectarianism, saying while those working under the state\u2019s health service commission are unpaid, their counterparts at the primary health care board and the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) have either received their payment or are in the process of receiving it.\n\nThe letter reads in part: \u201cAs of now, the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) and the Lagos State Primary Health Care Board have commenced the payment of the allowance to Nurses and Midwives. Payment at the Ministry of Health would commence soon. The Health Service Commission where a large percentage of nurses and midwives in the state are domiciled is yet to commence payment and has informed us it made no provision for the payment of the allowance\n\n\u201cWe would want to make it unequivocal that a situation where the Health Service Commission Nurses and Midwives would not be paid the uniform allowance for this year cannot be contemplated and would not be tolerated at all. We ask that you take this letter as both a reminder and an ultimatum for possible commencement of industrial action. If we do not have concrete assurances in terms of the approval of the Governor and steps for the commencement of the payment within the next 21days, the council would be left with no other choice than to take industrial action to press home our request.\u201d\n\nUltimatum expiration\n\nOn Tuesday, when the ultimatum expires, members of the union have promised to make real their threat, describing the government\u2019s response to the ultimatum as lukewarm.\n\nThe union has also fixed a press briefing for the day to make public its next line of action over the matter.\n\nSpeaking with our reporter on the phone, the union\u2019s secretary in the state, Toba Odumosu, said the briefing would be held at its state secretariat.\n\n\u201cSituation under control\u201d\n\nIn a telephone interview with our reporter on Monday, the permanent secretary, ministry of health in the state, Olusegun Ogboye, said the matter would be resolved amicably.\n\nHe said the subject of contention is a minor case that would not be allowed to degenerate into a full blown crisis.\n\n\u201cThere is no cause for alarm. The state is addressing that. We can assure the public of that. The issue at hand is a minor one, and it is being addressed,\u201d Mr Ogboye said.\n\nMore demands\n\nMeanwhile, the union also on 10 September wrote Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, seeking an audience over what it described as pertinent issues that it claimed might lead to a \u201cserious dispute with the state government.\u201d\n\nThe union highlighted 14 issues in the letter, which included the acute shortage of workforce at the state and local levels, high attrition rate and the need for retention allowance, stagnation of nurses, retrospective approval and regularisation for nurses, among others.\n\nThe union also noted that due to heavy workload, many of its members are suffering from various health challenges, and that the state\u2019s health insurance policy does not adequately cater for its members.\n\nNARD Strike\n\nOn Monday, the industrial action by members of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) entered its seventh week with no end in sight.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe government had last week secured an order of the National Industrial Court sitting in Abuja, asking the striking doctors to resume work immediately.\n\nHowever, the striking medical personnel said they would not obey the order of the court over what they described as an unfair treatment by the presiding judge.",

Rivers State had led the battle against the FIRS, seeking the court of law to bar the federal tax collector from collecting VAT, a call that is being supported by many states in the country.\n\nIn an interview with LEADERSHIP, the President of CITN, Mr. Adesina Adedayo, who said the institute will be working in line with the law of the land, said its members have been advised to maintain status quo.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn what could be the implications of not filing returns due to the disagreement between the states and the FIRS, Adedayo said \u201cas an Institute and based on the ruling by the Court of Appeal, we have advised our members to maintain the status quo and keep filing VAT returns with the Federal Inland Revenue Service pending the outcome of the appeal process.\u201d\n\nOn the remote and immediate effect of the VAT war between the federal government and the states, he said \u201cI hope we will not end up having the \u2018cobra effect\u2019, which technically means we may have intended and unintended consequences of our actions and we, therefore, need to manage this issue, in terms of the fallout.

          "text": "The power rotation battle ahead of the 2023 general election continued yesterday as leaders of the North and South insisted on producing the next president.\n\nIn the build-up to the 2023 polls, there have been clamours for power rotation by Southern leaders, including governors from the zone. The tussle, however, took a fresh twist as the Northern Elders\u2019 Forum (NEF) yesterday declared that the North would not play second fiddle in the 2023 general elections because it had the advantage of numbers in terms of voting strength.\n\nNEF spokesman, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, made the remarks at the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, on Saturday during the inaugural Ambassador Maitama Sule Leadership Lecture Series by the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG), Students Wing.\n\nHis comments are a reaction to the southern governors\u2019 recent position that power must shift to the South.\n\nHowever, the major socio-political groups in the South, namely, Afenifere, Ohanaeze Ndigbo and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), yesterday dismissed the claim by NEF, insisting that power must shift to the South.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe CNG, however, has backed NEF\u2019s position, insisting that the northern region will use its voter superiority to retain political power at the centre beyond 2023.\n\nIt\u2019s Igbo presidency or nothing, says Ohanaeze\n\nThe apex Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, said it would amount to injustice to the Igbo race if the region is not supported to produce the next president.\n\nThe organisation insisted that there is no way Nigeria will move forward when a group of people have been set apart, noting that what is happening today in Nigeria is the consequences of injustice.\n\nThe national publicity secretary of Ohanaeze, Alex Ogbonnia, told LEADERSHIP that those still promoting injustice do not want Nigeria to grow.\n\nReferring to NEF\u2019s comments on the North\u2019s numerical strength, Ogbonnia said \u201cpopulation or no population, it is not important.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that what is important is that the idea of religion is to promote consciousness in mankind.\n\nThe Ohanaeze spokesman noted that what is happening in Nigeria today is a result of the marginalisation of a group of people, saying it is unfortunate that no Igbo man is part of the service chiefs.\n\n\u201cNigeria comprises two categories of people, those that have conscience and those that do not have conscience; those that want corporate existence of Nigeria and those that do not want it.\n\n\u201cLook at your fingernails, if something happens to your fingernails, the whole body will have the consciousness that something is happening to the body,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn the 2023 presidential election, he insisted that it was the turn of the Igbo to produce the president of the country.\n\nGoing down memory lane, the Ohanaeze image maker said in 1998, it was agreed that there will be a power shift from the North to the South.\n\nHe noted that the person who spoke for the Igbo was the late Senate President Chuba Okadigbo, while the person who spoke for the North was the late Abubakar Rimi, adding that Alex Ekwueme and Bola Ige were present at the meeting.\n\nHe reasoned that since the South West and South South had produced the president, justice demands that the South East should produce the president after the eight-year tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cIf it does not happen that way, it is injustice and will continue to boomerang and have negative effect on the entire country.\n\n\u201cIt is even to the advantage of Nigeria that an Igbo man becomes president of Nigeria. There is a place where all Nigerians have a consensus and that is the resourcefulness, tenacity and ingenuity of the Igbo,\u201d he stated.\n\nAlso, the pan Yoruba social political group, Afenifere, has picked holes in NEF\u2019s declaration that the North won\u2019t play yield the presidency in the 2023 general elections because of its acclaimed voter superiority.\n\nActing Afenifere leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, said,\u2019\u2019 We have been clamouring for a constitution we will all agree on, they refused. The argument that the North has the highest population is fake; they claimed they had the highest population, but when we visited the North, the population they claimed did not exist.\n\n\u2018\u2019The population they lay claim to defied the geography we all learnt. Geography states that the nearer the desert, the fewer the population; it is only in Nigeria that it is different. They have arid areas and you threaten us with that. They should let us have a constitution, different from the imposed one. Why argue over population, let a proper census be conducted. I am tired of this argument of the North laying claim to having more population than the South.\n\n\u2018\u2019Nobody is willing to play second fiddle in the country, that is why we are saying let us come together, have a new constitution and agree on the terms on which we live together.\u201d\n\nOn its part, the Pan Niger Delta Forum\u2019s publicity secretary, Ken Robinson, said the population figure the North is making reference to is false and does not exist.\n\n\u2019They have been using that to deceive Nigerians and using it to influence election results in their favour; why can\u2019t they translate that into tax generation. We are working at challenging that over-bloated population.\n\n\u2018\u2019We shall soon send for an independent body to conduct a census for the country. I am happy the southern elders are United in finding a solution to this problem. That statement that the North has highest population is a senseless statement.\u2019\u2019\n\nSpeaking on the issue, the leader of PANDEF, Chief Edwin Clarke, said, \u201cI listened to Ahmed on television and he was talking rubbish. He was talking about majority. Majority to eat whose money? We have the resources and you have the population.\n\n\u201cI can use my resources without population but you can\u2019t use your population without resources. So we must work together if we want to have a fair and just country. We have to create a country where everyone will be equal and entitled to more.\u201d\n\nNiger Delta Activists Back Southern Governors\n\nNiger Delta activist, Comrade Israel Joe, has faulted NEF\u2019s position and backed the southern governors for 2023.\n\nJoe, in statement released yesterday, said that the youths of Southern Nigeria read with disapproval the statement credited to Hakeem Baba-Ahmed who is the director of publicity and advocacy of the NEF.\n\nHe said, \u201cParaphrasing his statement, he revealed that the North must continue to rule Nigeria due to their numbers and whoever doesn\u2019t like it could leave Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe spokesperson has also seen Northerners as the owners of Nigeria while placing discontentment on the position of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum for declaring that Southern Nigeria should produce the next president \u2013 by saying the North are first class citizens and would not accept the second.\n\n\u201cThe youths of the South wish to state categorically that such statements speak so poorly of a highly placed Northern elder as Hakeem Baba-Ahmed.\n\n\u201cWe stand to back the position of the Southern governors that the South should produce the next president. What election can the North win alone without the input of any Southern region? It is important to state that Southern Nigeria would never also play a second fiddle in the next election.\n\n\u201cWhile we wish to allay the defects of a federal system in terms of majority domination, the North should be conscious also that Southern Nigeria also has a monopoly of the Nigerian economy and once the North is tired of the marriage done by Lord Lugard in 1914, it can ask for a referendum and national conference to determine the fate of the union.\u201d\n\nNo, North Must Retain Power, Northern Coalition Vows\n\nBut the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) has thrown its weight behind the remarks by the Northern Elders Forum spokesman, Baba Ahmed, hinting that the northern region would use its voter superiority to retain political power at the centre beyond 2023.\n\nThe CNG, in apparent reaction to the responses of Ohanaeze, Afenifere and the Middle Belt Forum, MBF, to Baba-Ahmed, noted that the North would no longer submit to threats and blackmail which southern politicians feel is their only path to the presidency.\n\nCNG\u2019s reaction was contained in a statement by its spokesperson Abdul-Azeez Suleiman and made available to LEADERSHIP yesterday in Abuja/\n\nIt noted that the claim for an agreement to rotate power in some parties has long been proved to be a lie and impracticable by the southern politicians themselves.\n\n\u201cThe consciousness must be eluding the Afenifere, Ohanaeze and MBF that presidential aspirants mostly from the South have several times rubbished whatever rotation agreement there might have been by contesting whenever it was the turn of the North since 2027.\n\n\u201cWe also find it ridiculous, unstatesmanlike, and loss of sportsmanship for the Southern governors to resort to threats and blackmail rather than persuasion in the wild dream of enforcing a regional agenda on an entire community of people that is in a clear majority and politically more savvy,\u201d Suleiman said.\n\nTalking about equity, justice and fairness, CNG noted that the North, which has held the presidency for only eight years since the return of democracy in 1999, is more entitled to a fair deal in order to achieve a balance.\n\nOsinbajo Sellable In 2023 \u2013 Governor Sule\n\nMeanwhile, governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State has entered the presidency debate, throwing his weight behind Vice President Yemi Osinbajo for the nation\u2019s top job.\n\nThe Nasarawa governor told the Progressive Consolidation Group (PCG) that Osinbajo is a sellable presidential aspirant if he chooses to contest the forthcoming presidential elections in 2023.\n\nSule stated this during a courtesy call paid on him by members of the political group at Government House, Lafia, yesterday.\n\nHe thanked the group for the visit and for intimating him of their advocacy for the presidential candidature of Osinbajo and their desire for him to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023, to consolidate on the administration\u2019s achievements.\n\nSule told them they had nothing to worry about if the Vice President chooses to contest the 2023 presidential election because he was a sellable candidate for the party whose antecedent as an astute politician speaks volumes.\n\nAccording to him, since the formation of the party, it has been built around one man in the person of President Buhari and the concern of progressive governors of the party was how to move the party forward after Buhari\u2019s two tenure as president.\n\n\u201cOur concern is how do we sustain the party beyond one man. So if you come up with ideas, you know you will not only get my attention but the attention of every serious progressive governor in the country.\n\n\u201cSo if you are going about to sell this man, I want you to know that not every product is sellable but Osinbajo is sellable. I pray that all the work you are doing now will not be in vain. It will be good for our party and the progress of this country,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking earlier, Dr Aliyu Kurfi, chairman of the PCG, said they came on their own without the consent of the VP, because they were convinced to start making the advocacy for Osinbajo to succeed Buhari because of his impressive vision for the country.\n\n\u201cWe are here, sir, on a very serious business, the serious business of political succession. We are on our own mission but engineered by the vision of one of our elder statesmen, Vice President of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo.\n\n\u201cWe have gone through the various records of activities, life history and, of course, the trends of events in politics and we have agreed as an association to work towards the promotion of his candidature.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s unity is unshakable \u2013 FG\n\nAmidst all the talk of political positioning ahead of 2023, the federal government has said Nigeria\u2019s resolve to remain as one indivisible entity is unshakable, in spite of the various challenges facing the nation.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, made the remarks in Abuja yesterday at the opening of \u2018Nigeria at 60 Photo Exhibition\u2019 with the theme \u201c60 Years of Our Togetherness.\u201d\n\nHe said the theme of the photo exhibition had been carefully couched to reflect on the unity of the country in the past 60 years, despite its diverse cultures, traditions, practices, languages and challenges.\n\n\u201cLike other countries in the world, it is an incontrovertible fact that Nigeria, over the years, has gone through challenging times, but we must not miss the fact that its resolve to remain as one indivisible entity has remained unshaken,\u201d he said.\n\nAlhaji Mohammed said the Ministry was using the opportunity provided by the Independence Anniversary celebration to organise a photo exhibition that will deliver information and educate Nigerians, especially the youth, who need a re-awakening voyage into the historical and unique heritage of the country and the secrets behind its unity in diversity.\n\n\u201cThis photo exhibition, therefore, is organised to serve as a poignant reminder of significant events in the annals of this great country and how they have shaped the country, ensured peaceful coexistence, patriotism and determination, culminating in our greatness and development.\n\n\u201cFor those who did not witness Nigeria\u2019s Independence in 1960, particularly the students, they can at least look at the photos of pre-independent Nigeria; the independence proper; post-independence era; leaders who fought for our independence and have an idea of the struggle for freedom from colonialism and a mental picture of how the situation was then, which gives hope that whatever challenges we may be facing even at this time, we will surmount them and have a strong, united, peaceful and prosperous country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe exhibition, which will run for three days at the National Press Centre, Radio House, Abuja, was declared open by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha.\n\nGroup Warns S\u2019South Politicians Against Trading 2023 Presidency\n\nA group of political stalwarts from the six states of the south south geo-political zone has warned political stakeholders in the zone not to trade the presidential position for personal gain or be ready to contend with the group.\n\nA communique signed by the group\u2019s protem chairman, Chief Diekivie Ikiogha, a member of the group from Cross River State, Ekpeyong Iyamba, and eight others, urged Nigerians of the South South extraction not to disenfranchise themselves in the forthcoming 2023 presidential elections by failing to participate in the ongoing voter registration exercise.\n\nThey urged Nigerians to concede the 2023 presidency to the South South ahead of the 2023 rather than thinking of zoning the presidency to other geo-political zones of the nation.\n\nThe communique issued after the third meeting of the south south presidency 2023 group in Asaba and made available to LEADERSHIP in Calabar at weekend called on Nigerians from the south to participate in the ongoing voter registration exercise so that they can as well participate in all the political process in the nation.\n\n2023: APC Has No Basis To Zone Presidency To North \u2013 Okorocha\n\nMeanwhile, the immediate past governor of Imo State and Senator representing Imo West Senatorial District, Sen Rochas Okorocha, has said the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has no basis to zone the 2023 presidency to the north.\n\nOkorocha, who disclosed this at the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ-FCT) Secretariat, Abuja, during a conversation ushering in his 59th birthday, said the South West also does not deserve the presidency in 2023 based on the principle of rotation.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThere is no justifiable reason for APC to zone presidency away from the South, not even South West because there has been this culture of rotation, unwritten, but what you call a mutual understanding.\n\n\u201cPower went first to the south there, you have President Olusegun Obasanjo; then it came back to the North, we had the late President Umaru Yar\u2019adua and back to the South, former President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\n\u201cThen it came back to the North, the incumbent president, Muhammadu Buhari. I think it is just fair, in what is called understanding \u2013 it is not a right \u2013 but for equity and justice, that this understanding is not broken; it should go back to the South.\u201d\n\nHe also dismissed the statement credited to the governor of Imo State, Senator, Hope Uzodima that the South East does not need the Presidency.\n\nOkoracha said, \u201cWhich governor? I don\u2019t think you heard him right because in the normal sense he can\u2019t say that. He can\u2019t say that. Something is wrong, I think something is wrong. I don\u2019t think he said that. That Igbo will not need the president?\n\n\u201cThe argument Igbos should make: let him that has something upstairs govern because tribe will not put food on the table of the common man.\n\n\u201cThe Yoruba man has governed Nigeria, the Hausa man has governed Nigeria, the South South has governed Nigeria. Let\u2019s try an Igbo man to see how it would be. That kind of statement will sound more ideally. If you put this way, it would be soft than when you said it is Igbo; it is our turn.\u201d",

          "text": "By GBENGA ADEOLA\n\nCOVID-19: Sanwo-Olu charges world leaders on vaccine equity\n\nFree access to Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines is one of the strategies designed by the United Nations (UN) to kickstart global recovery, especially in cities that are signatories to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework. How is Lagos State, the most populous mega city in Africa, faring in its recovery plan?\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Saturday, gave detailed explanation on how the State Government had expanded access to vaccines since the vaccination programme began in March and the State\u2019s projection to protect its residents and environment.\n\nThe Governor spoke at the 2021 Global Citizen Live Concert held at Fela\u2019s Afrika Shrine in Ikeja. Audiences in 11 cities across the world, including Paris, Seoul, London, Sidney, New York and Los Angeles, witnessed the live event held in honour of frontline and essential workers in the battle against the global pandemic.\n\nGlobal Citizen Live is a 24-hour global event initiated in six continents to unite the world in defending the planet against diseases and defeating poverty.\n\nA-list Nigerian musical artistes that performed live during the international concert included Femi Kuti, Davido, Tiwa Savage and Made Kuti, among others.\n\nAs the epicentre of the pandemic outbreak, Sanwo-Olu said Lagos had pursued a radical vaccination programmes, which led to the administration of 16,000 jabs of vaccines daily. This, the Governor said, is a far cry from what was projected in achieving herd immunity.\n\nSanwo-Olu disclosed that 405,000 residents had received first doses of AstraZeneca, while 289,000 persons returned for their second doses. The State, he said, administered 230,000 first shots of Moderna to raise the vaccinated population to about 1.2 per cent within five months.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur vaccination rate is far below the minimum target of 60 per cent recommended by the World Health Organisation (W.H.O) per city population. At the current rate, it would take about three years to achieve our herd immunity target. We cannot continue at this speed if we seriously want to beat this virus.\n\n\u201cTo safely achieve herd immunity against COVID-19, a substantial proportion of our population would need to be vaccinated to lower the overall amount of virus able to spread in the whole population. One of the objectives of attaining herd immunity is to prevent mutations from emerging leading to more aggressive strains. It is important that Lagos achieves herd immunity at the same time with all countries together.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu noted the situation of unequal distribution of vaccines in which richer nations secured more doses than the size of their populations and are preparing to roll out booster shots, while poorer countries struggled to administer first doses, threatening the global efforts to end the pandemic.\n\nHe said vaccine equity remained the only path to toe by world leaders to end the pandemic. To do this, the Governor said the world must ensure that vaccines were available to all, especially poorer countries that had struggled with supply.\n\nOn how Lagos is creating access and ramping up vaccination, Sanwo-Olu said the Government was leveraging the private sector funding, capacity and infrastructure to scale up availability and distribution.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur proposal to the private sector is to reserve and administer 50 per cent of the vaccines procured in partnership with the private sector to be made available free of charge at Government health centres. We propose to deploy a proven system where those who can pay for vaccines subsidise the cost of vaccination for those who cannot.\n\n\u201cGiven the fact that we expect COVID-19 vaccinations to be annual going forward, this is the only sustainable path towards achieving herd immunity and making Lagos free of the virus. With our approach, we expect to vaccinate 30 per cent of the population of Lagos within one year. This will put us on a better and more sustainable path towards herd immunity. We expect COVID-19 vaccinations to be an annual programme, going forward, as this is the only way to making Lagos free of the virus.\u201d\n\nThe Governor urged Nigerians to continue to be law-abiding and comply with the travel guidelines stipulated by the Presidential Steering Committee to prevent the importation of new variants. He reiterated that observation of social distancing and personal hygiene would break the cycle of community transmission of the virus.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

According to the report, the Nigerian did not break any of the social networking platform\u2019s rules.\n\nHushpuppi, whose actual name is Ramon Abbas, lived a life of luxury in Dubai, where he ran a multi-million dollar money laundering operation and proudly flaunted his lavish lifestyle on Instagram.\n\nHe flaunted his wealth on Instagram, posting photographs of lavish shopping trips, luxurious automobiles, clothes, and watches.\n\nAn international police inquiry turned up over $41 million in cash and 13 automobiles worth $6.8 million.\n\nMore than 100,000 bogus files and the email addresses of nearly two million potential victims were discovered in phone and computer records.\n\nHushpuppi had a luxury car collection that included Bentleys, Ferraris, Lamborghinis, and Maybachs.\n\nOn Instagram, the Nigerian fraudster has over 2.5 million followers. Since June 2020, when he was arrested by Dubai Police, he has not posted anything on his account.\n\nHuspuppi, on the other hand, will be able to use Instagram until law enforcement in the US, where he is facing trial, orders otherwise.\n\nFor convicts who use social media, the American social media business claimed it is implementing a regulation on inmate takedown requests. Abbas does not fit within any of the categories that would justify account deletion.\n\nAccording to Instagram, accounts are typically closed only if they are associated with hazardous organizations or persons.\n\nThe 37-year-old Nigerian fraudster admitted to actions that resulted in $24 million in earnings for his victims.\n\nHushpuppi was implicated in a school funding fraud, as well as multiple other cyber and commercial email compromise schemes that resulted in more than $24 million in losses, according to court records filed in July 2021.\n\nHushpuppi is accused of defrauding a Qatari school by impersonating bank officials and building a fraudulent website in a scam that included bribing a foreign official to keep the sophisticated ruse continuing after the victim was alerted.",

          "text": "Sunday Dare, the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, awarded Value-Added Service contracts to himself, Bola Tinubu, the APC National Leader and former Lagos State Governor, and others.\n\nNEWS DIRECT learnt that others who benefited from the dubious contracts include the late Isa Funtua, a long-time political associate of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAn investigation by SaharaReporters showed further that Dare awarded the contracts when he was the Executive Commissioner (Stakeholder Management) of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).\n\nDare, a former spokesman for Tinubu, was appointed by Buhari as the South-West executive commissioner of the NCC in 2016.\n\nHe was however replaced with Adeleke Moronfolu Adewolu in 2019 as the President named him Minister of Sports and Youth Development.\n\nValue-Added Service (VAS) is a term used in telecommunications to describe non-core features, which traditionally are non-voice functions such as video, data and so on.\n\nOthers awarded the multi-billion naira contracts by Dare included Umar Danbatta, Executive Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the NCC; Naomi Adenuga; Senator Ifeanyi Ararume.\n\nA top source said, \u201cThe current Minister of Sports, Sunday Dare single-handedly gave some corrupt Nigerians the NCC licenses when he was the Executive Commissioner.\n\n\u201cHe gave himself a slot and also gave Naomi Adenuga for Globacom. He gave Bola Tinubu a slot and also Umar Danbatta, Executive Vice-Chairman of the NCC a slot. He also gave Senator Ifeanyi Ararume.\u201d\n\nArarume was on Sunday appointed Chairman of the Board of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) after Buhari, in his capacity as Minister of Petroleum Resources, directed the incorporation of the company.\n\nAccording to the top source, others are \u201cIsa Funtua (who died in July 2020), Abdurahman Ado Musa and his brother, Abdulsalami Abubakar.\n\n\u201cThey were all awarded the Value-Added Service contracts for the NCC. This includes the use of USSD code; they generate at least N25 billion per month from that. The use of USSD code brings a lot of money,\u201d the source added.\n\nAbdulrahman Ado is a director with telecom operator, 9mobile.\n\nFuntua was a Federal Minister in the Second Nigerian Republic. After leaving the government job, he went into business and was a personal friend and close associate of Buhari. Until his death, he was known to be very influential in Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nUSSD means Unstructured Supplementary Service Data which allows people without smartphones or data or internet connection to use mobile banking through the use of codes, but at a charge.\n\n\u201cThrough the Value Added Service, they generate at least N25 billion naira per month. The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami is also badly involved. They are very close to Malami and (Isa) Pantami as well.\u201d\n\nPantami is the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy. Before then, he was the Director-General and CEO of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) between September 2016 and August 2019.\n\nAlso called Sheikh Pantami, the minister\u2019s past call to Jihad and unalloyed support for murderous groups like the Taliban and Al-Qaeda portray him as a dyed-in-the-wool Islamic fundamentalist.\n\nSharing the details of how the contracts were dubiously awarded, another source said, \u201cThe telecommunications companies were taking 90%, leaving the content provider with 10%. Sunday Dare then promised to give contracts to five companies and about 400 companies put in their bids with a deposit of N500,000 each. Upon qualifying, you will remit another N9.5 million to them.\n\n\u201cThe goal was to water down the profit of the Telcos. Sunday Dare singlehandedly gave Ado, himself and seven others the contract. No governor is richer than any executive in NCC.\u201d",

          "text": "Miners\u2019 Association of Nigeria , MAN, has decried the rising trend of foreign nationals invading mining communities in the country also stating that rich miners in the country were not members of the association.\n\nThis is following the just concluded hearing on the investigation of the loss of $9 billion annually due to illegal mining and smuggling of gold in the country by the Senate, the President, Miners Association of Nigeria, MAN, Alhaji Kabiru Kankara during a parley with journalist in Abuja advocated that a regulatory framework to monitor mining activities in the country was much needed.\n\nKankara explained that for Nigeria to be able to explore the mining sector adequately, the government must put in place proper regulations to make sure everything in the sector was being checked.\n\nHe expressed dissatisfaction with the influx of foreign nationals especially from Asian countries into mining communities in the country adding that illegal mining in these sites were monitored and carried out with the connivance of security operatives and rich Nigerians.\n\nHe said that a low level of technology, inadequate manpower, and invasion of mining communities has led to the increasing loss of revenue in the sector.\n\n\u201cThere must be an improved funding for the mines and steel ministry as well as a regulatory framework to monitor foreigners. In the nation\u2019s law no one can be a miner without registering with the Miners\u2019 Association of Nigeria but yet many foreigners are engaged in illegal mining in Nigeria and no one is talking action on that.\n\n\u201cIf you go to the mining sites you will see them all over the place taking advantage of of our artisanal miners and that has to stop,\u201d Kankara stressed.\n\nHe emphasized that there\u2019s no country in the world that was endowed with minerals resources like Nigeria while expressing regret that the nation losses billions of dollars annually to smuggling due to improper channeling of the minerals.\n\nHe explained that by the nation\u2019s law no one can be a miner without registering with the Miners Association of Nigeria yet many foreigners were engaged in illegal mining activities in the country.\n\nThe Miners\u2019 association president further explained that ninety-nine percent of rich miners in the country were not members of the Association.\n\nHe attributed the challenges of curbing illegal mining to connivance of illegal miners with security officers, lack of adequate manpower, low level technology and invasion of mining communities.\n\nAccording to Kankara Nigeria has minerals that can\u2019t showcase itself hence the need for provision of adequate logistics, equipment for fieldwork, training and retraining of mining engineers and resuscitation of the revenue generation committee of the ministry of Mines and Steel Development.\n\nHe noted that following the destruction that goes on in Mining communities across the country, there are four Bills before the National Assembly for consideration.\n\nThese bills are the Nigerian Minerals Development Corporation Establishment Bill 2021, Solid Minerals Producing Areas Development Commission Establishment Bill 2021, Institute of Bitumen Management Establishment Bill 2021, and the Explosive Act 1964 Repeal and Re-enactment Bill 2021.\n\nHe emphasized that these Bills when passed into law would encourage people in communities to go into mining while mineral producing states would be well taken care of.\n\nThe Senate had in December 2020, mandated a panel to probe the loss of N9 billion annually as reported by the Nigerian Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative, NEITI.\n\nThe mandate was sequel to a motion on illegal mining and smuggling of gold in the country brought by Senator Orji Uzor Kalu.",

A simple internet search would have availed Mr. Whoriskey of the judgment of the case and the present state of affairs. Further, questions 2-5 were directly extracted from untested allegations contained in a first amended verified complaint filed before the United States District Court, Southern District of Texas, Houston Division\u201d the groups alleged.\n\nThey called on media houses not to yield their platforms to people whose objectives were not noble as such would encourage unhealthy business rivalry. \u201cThere is a plethora of questions which The Washington Post rather has to answer and which directly calls to question its genuineness in permitting this to happen. It will be damning to the long-held image of The Washington Post that its staff have yielded the platform of the medium to the use for a global smear campaign and unhealthy business rivalry\u201d Mr. Tochukwu Ohazuruike who addressed the press was quoted as saying.\n\nIn answering the allegations against Mr. Peters, the groups claimed that \u201cMr. Peters has stated severally that he has never received any favour by way of facilitation or otherwise from Dieziani Alison-Madueke, and there was therefore nothing to be grateful for. He has severally denounced any such attempt to link the purchase of his property with Dieziani under such premises. His purchase of the furniture was in furtherance of his desire to furnish a property that belonged to him, and those furniture can be found, even today, at his said property at 58 Harley House. No furniture that belonged to him can be found at any other place other than in his property. The furniture found at the UK address of Dieziani Alison-Madueke does not belong to him, and certainly could not have been the same found in his said property at 58 Harley House.\u201d\n\nThey insist that the answers they provided should discourage future smear campaigns as this is not the first time it was happening saying \u201cwe hope that with these answers we would have satisfied Mr. Whoriskey and got him to alert his sponsors that the plot is dead on arrival and cannot be revived. We also say to all such persons who would in the future want to regurgitate these issues that the answers are already available in the public space as there is nothing hidden and there is nothing any media house can unearth again so no need taking any jobs from the sponsors of this smear campaign.\u201d",

Represented by the Head of Service, Pastor John Adeyemi, he said his administration thought it expedient to revamp and reintroduce feedlots, which was a variant of ranching with support of FAO.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu added that it was another milestone geared towards creating jobs, ensuring food security and promoting peaceful co-existence among inhabitants of the state via eradication of farmers/herders clashes.",

          "text": "Shares of Evergrande on Monday plunged to over 11-year lows, extending losses as executives try to salvage its business prospects and as default fears grow over a looming deadline for payment obligations this week.\n\nEvergrande has been scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders, suppliers and investors, with regulators warning that its $305 billion of liabilities could spark broader risks to the country\u2019s financial system if not stabilised.\n\nAs of 0740GMT, the stock was off 12.2% to HK$2.23, after earlier plummeting 19% to its weakest level since May 2010.\n\nThe company\u2019s property management unit dropped 12%, while its electrics car unit declined 2%. Movie streaming company Hengten Net, majority-owned by Evergrande, plummeted 11.2%.\n\n\u201cThe stock will continue to fall, because there\u2019s not yet a solution that appears to be helping the company to ease its liquidity stress, and there are still so many uncertainties about what the company will do in case of a restructuring,\u201d said Kington Lin, managing director of Asset Management Department at Canfield Securities Limited.\n\nLin said Evergrande\u2019s share price could fall to below HK$1 if the company is forced to sell most of its assets in a restructuring.\n\nOne of Evergrande\u2019s main lenders has made provisions for losses on a portion of its loans to the embattled developer, while some creditors are planning to give it more time to repay, four bank executives told Reuters.\n\nThe developer said on Sunday it has begun repaying investors in its wealth management products with real estate.\n\nPolicymakers are telling Evergrande\u2019s major lenders to extend interest payments or rollover loans, and market watchers are largely of the view that a direct bailout from the government is unlikely.\n\nEvergrande is due to pay $83.5 million interest on Sept 23 for its March 2022 bond. It has another $47.5 million interest payment due on Sept 29 for the March 2024 notes. Both bonds would default if Evergrande fails to settle the interest within 30 days of the scheduled payment dates.\n\nIn any default scenario, Evergrande will need to restructure the bonds but analysts expect a low recovery ratio for investors. Trading of the company\u2019s bonds underscored just how dramatically investor expectations of its prospects have deteriorated this year.\n\nThe 8.25% March 2022 dollar bond was traded at 29.156 on Monday afternoon, yielding over 500%, compared to around 13.7% at the beginning of year. The 9.5% March 2024 bond was at 26.4, yielding over 80%, compared to 14.6% at the start of 2021.\n\nGoldman Sachs said last week that because Evergrande has dollar bonds issued by both the parent company and a special purpose vehicle, recoveries in a potential restructuring could differ between the two sets of bonds, and any potential restructuring process may be prolonged.",
