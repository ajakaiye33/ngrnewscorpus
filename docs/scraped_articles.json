          "text": "Jennifer, one of the wives of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, has claimed that her life was threatened after requesting to divorce her husband.\n\nShe noted the threat made her leave Nigeria, adding that she had to exit her law firm and sell assets in Nigeria.\n\nJeninifer, who made this known in a statement, also confirmed her divorce to the former presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party.\n\nAccording to the lawyer, her phone calls were also monitored by suspected aides of the former VP.\n\nShe said, \u201cSince this incident, I fear for my safety and that of my kids. His Excellency\u2019s security operatives especially Ibro and others have been making threats and calling my relatives, friends, and staff and searching for my assets to seize and monitoring my phone calls and those of friends and relatives. For that reason, I have exited my law firm and sold all my assets, and moved abroad until peace reigns.\n\n\u201cI have done nothing wrong except to ask for a divorce and it pains me that I have to use this medium to address thorny issues but fear that at this point, I would have to put my side of the story on record. It is obvious that a campaign of calumny to total discredit and put me in bad light has begun.\n\n\u201cDespite all that has happened, I reiterate that I asked for a quiet divorce which had if it had been granted, we would not be where we are today. Divorce is never an easy process for both parties. I reiterate that I hope we can settle our issues privately and I would remain at His Excellency\u2019s service should he need my help, anytime.\u201d\n\nJennifer explained that \u201cthe core reason for the divorce was disagreement over my continued stay in the United Kingdom\u201d among other \u201clong-standing issues\u201d.\n\nShe also claimed that Atiku has requested to collect an asset previously given to her, adding that the property in Dubai is a subject of litigation.\n\nAtiku has yet to make any public statement on the issue as of the time of filing this report.\n\nAlso, efforts to get his aides to react to the claims made by Jennifer failed.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Since the second term of President Muhammadu Buhari, Senator George Akume has been the Minister of Special Duties and Inter Governmental Affairs, a position for which he was screened and cleared by the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, before assuming office.\n\n\u201cOver the span of more than 23 years, Senator George Akume has never been invited for questioning by any anti corruption agency. In any case, the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria allows even an accused person to be presumed innocent until found guilty, how much more of Senator George Akume who has not even been accused of any offense.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that since our Principal started the race for National Chairmanship of APC, everything has been done by his opponents to find faults with him, but to no avail. This is because it has become very clear that Senator George Akume is the candidate to beat in the race for the National Chairmanship of our great party, APC\u201d.\n\nChief Shango also welcomed what he described as the growing nation-wide consensus steadily building up in favour of Sen. Akume.\n\n\u201cThere is the endorsement of Senator George Akume by the Northern APC National Front as signed by its Convener and Spokesperson Mallam Ayuba Hassan. Other vital endorsements are by the Igbo Youth Assembly signed by its National Chairman, Mr Nwaudunna; the Igbo Youth Assembly Worldwide, signed by its National Secretary Casmir Irekanba and the National Publicity Secretary, Comrade Chidi Chilo. Other endorsements came from General Lawrence Anebi Onoja (rtd) former Military Governor of Katsina and Plateau States and the Benue Amazon Prime, a women group of the All Progressives Congress in Benue State.\n\n\u201cWe are elated and encouraged by these endorsements. We urge our party members and leaders across Nigeria to embrace the aspiration of Senator George Akume by supporting his aspiration to become the National Chairmanship of our great party, APC. It is a well known fact based on research and investigation by the Senator George\u201d, he stated.",

          "text": "\u00b7 As volatility rate declines\n\nBy Emeka Anaeto, Business Editor\n\nA close monitor of the trajectories in Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange market has shown some positive turns in the retail end of the inter-bank market, which may have also accounted for similar development in the parallel market in the first 14 days of this year, ending last weekend.\n\nThe key driver of the change is linked to the most recent policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, which allows individuals to apply for forex online, and get their supply. The new policy involves deployment of an electronic Form \u2018A\u2019 to expedite applications for Personal/ Basic Travel Allowance (PTA/BTA), medicals, education, and other remittances.\n\nREAD ALSO:Killings, kidnappings: Reps ask IGP to establish station in Gombe community\n\nVanguard findings reveal that as at last weekend, while exchange rate recorded minor uptick, volatility rate has recorded a decline at 0.13% on a 30-day moving average, down from 0.16% on a 90-day average.\n\nThe 30-day average coincides with the period the new Form A policy has run so far. The introduction of the e-Form A is just another of several initiatives of the CBN to ensure the easy accessibility of forex and related services to Nigerian bank customers.\n\nThis development was coming against the backdrop of the usually massive uptick in both exchange rate and volatility rate in the retail space especially on PTA/BTA transactions as students based outside the country begin returning to their schools.\n\nSo far So Good This Year\n\nThe Naira gained average of 1.58 percent or N7.56 against the United States Dollar at the official forex market in the first week of this year.\n\nThe local currency closed the first business day of the year at N423.56 to a US Dollar before improving in value to N416 against the greenback the next day where it hovered till end of the week.\n\nThe improvement in Naira value was after the market had digested the CBN\u2019s currency adjustment. The apex bank had adjusted the Naira to Dollar exchange rate by N2 from N411 to N413 on the last business day of 2021, Friday December 31, leading to devaluation outcry across Africa\u2019s largest economy, with the local currency plunging to as low as N435 against the United States Dollar at the official forex trading market and N575 at the unregulated parallel market, popularly known as the black market, before moderating to N416.\n\nLast week was also fairly good for the local currency with relative stability in exchange rate.\n\nBut most important aspect of the new \u2018Form A\u2019 policy was the relative ease in accessing forex by individuals, a development which may have been responsible for the exchange rate stability in the 30-day moving average.\n\nThis development, according to traders, may have also reduced pressure on the parallel market channel which in turn moderated rate to about N565/$1.\n\nThough most observers believe that the positive turn in the market is still too early to be conclusive on the effectiveness of the policy but it is also show the determination of the apex bank to sustain the fight against bottlenecks that have bedeviled many public policies in Nigeria, creating windows for corruption and arbitraging, especially in the financial markets.\n\nThe Policy\n\nIn a circular titled, \u201cAutomation of Form \u2018A\u2019 on the Trade Monitoring System\u201d and signed by Dr Ozoemena Nnaji, Director Trade and Exchange Department, the CBN states that all hard copies of Forms \u2018A\u2019 created on or before November 2, 2021 (before the start of the e-Form \u2018A\u2019) must be used within 15 working days of the Form\u2019s creation.\n\nWhat is Form A?\n\n\u2018Form A\u2019 is an application form designed by the Central Bank of Nigeria to pay for service transactions (invisible trade).\n\nThe form allows customers to purchase forex at the CBN or interbank rate to make payments for eligible services as predetermined by the foreign exchange manual.\n\nThe e-Form \u2018A\u2019 is meant to replace its hardcopy from November 30, 2021. The Bank also noted that customers would pay a charge of N5,000 as fee per declaration of e-Form \u2018A\u2019.\n\nThe circular reads: \u201cThis is to inform all authorized dealers and the general public of the deployment of e-Form \u2018A\u2019.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the e-Form \u2018A\u2019 shall replace the hard copy of Form \u2018A\u2019 for invincible transactions [PTA/BTA, medicals, education, other remittances etc.]with effect from November 30, 2021.\n\n\u201cConsequently, all authorized dealers are required to ensure that the processing of Form \u2019A\u2019 shall only be done electronically on the Trade Monitoring System accessible at www.tradesystem.gov.ng.\n\n\u201cThe general public is required to obtain a valid Bank Verification Number (BVN) from their authorized dealer Banks. The BVN is a prerequisite for customers to access the Trade System for e-Form \u2018A\u2019 application.\n\n\u201cThe e-Form \u2018A\u2019 is web-based and allows the general public to initiate the Form from their offices/homes and submit same to the authorized dealer bank.\n\n\u201cA charge of N5,000 (Five Thousand Naira) as fee per declaration of e-Form \u2018A\u2019 is applicable with effect from November 30, 2021, and henceforth. There will be a direct debit from the processing bank\u2019s current account for each declaration which should be recovered the charge on the customer by the bank. However, customers for the e-Form \u2018A\u2019 should be separated from other bank charges.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll hard copies of Forms \u2018A\u2019 established on or before November 2 2021 (prior to the commencement of the e-Form \u2018A\u2019) shall be utilized within 15 working days of the establishment of the Form.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, all established hard copies of Forms \u2018A\u2019 for which disbursement had not been made within the transition period of 15 working days shall be deemed cancelled.\n\n\u201cAll authority dealer banks are enjoined to inform their customers of the development for compliance.\u201d\n\nBanks responded\n\nNigerian banks in adherence to the directive issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) have informed their customers that forex requests can be processed online.\n\nThe banks can now process forex requests online with CBN automated Forms A & NCX for invisible and non-commercial export transactions, according to emails sent to consumers.\n\nStanbic IBTC Bank informed its customers in an email, stating, \u201cWe wish to bring to your notice that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has deployed the automated Forms A and NCX for invisible and non-commercial export transactions (in addition to commercial export already on the platform) on the Trade Monitoring System (TRMS) platform.\u201d\n\nThis, according to the bank, is to take advantage of digital technology to streamline the request process so that applicants can submit requests from the comfort of their own homes, as well as to unify the processes involved in completing these transactions and for global monitoring and reporting purposes.\n\nIt added: \u201cIt has therefore become imperative for every individual (Current and potential customer for invisible transactions such as tuition fees, upkeep, medical fees, personal travel allowance (PTA), business travel allowance (BTA), subscription, professional exams, and certification fees and other related requests) to immediately sign up on the Trade Monitoring System (TRMS) platform preparatory to cut over to the new system by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\u201d\n\nFSDH Merchant Bank Limited also sent a notice to its customers informing them of the CBN\u2019s initiative to automate the processes of obtaining Forms A and NCX via online means.\n\nThe notice read, \u201cDear valued customer, we wish to bring to your notice that CBN has deployed the automated Forms A & NCX for invisible and non-commercial export transactions (in addition to commercial export already on the platform) on the TRMS platform.\n\n\u201cHence, it has become imperative for every individual (Current and Potential customers for invisible transactions e.g., for tuition fee, upkeep, medical fee, BTA/PTA, subscription, professional exams/certification fee, etc.) to immediately sign up on the TRMS platform preparatory to cut over to the new system by the CBN.\u201d",

We can demonstrate a kind of energy that we can do as well as the USA does.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Africa today, Nigeria is the largest democracy and we must be the shining example of others. APC today is the largest political party in Africa and we must have coherent leadership, leadership that has cohesion, that will give Nigerians the best quality of governance,\u201d he stressed.\n\nThe chairmanship hopeful said he was not disturbed by the array of contestants.

          "text": "\u2022Emefiele: New FX policy underway\n\n\u2022FG, stakeholders laud apex bank\u2019s drive to boost economy\n\nJames Emejo\n\n\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has disbursed a total of N23.20 billion to 28 companies whose projects were selected for funding in the maiden batch of its newly introduced \u201c100 for 100 Policy for Production and Productivity (PPP)\u201d initiative.\n\nCBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, who disclosed this yesterday in Abuja, also said the apex bank would soon introduce a new foreign exchange (FX) bidding regime.\n\nEmefiele spoke at the formal launch of the 100 for 100 PPP scheme. He explained that the primary objective of the CBN in introducing the initiative was to ensure that priority was accorded to companies that displayed verifiable progress in the bank\u2019s import substitution and job creation drive.\n\nEmefiele said the funds disbursed to beneficiaries of the 100 for 100 policy, which he stressed were loans, followed due screening of the applications received. He said the projects, valued at N23.20 billion, comprised 14 in the manufacturing sector, 12 in the agricultural sector, and two in the healthcare sector.\n\nHe assured all current and prospective operators in the industrial sector that the CBN was ready to continue to provide the needed support, financial and otherwise, to fast-track the development of the sector.\n\nEmefiele said the central bank would continue to provide all the needed support for the importation of plants and equipment to actualise investments in new greenfield or existing brownfield projects.\n\nHe said for this first cycle of the 100 for 100 policy, which ended yesterday, 243 applications valued at N321.06 billion, spread over key sectors, including agriculture, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, and services sectors, were submitted on the portal.\n\nEmefiele said after much engagement, 79 applications valued at N121.87 billion, were received from banks for projects in six sectors, namely agriculture, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, mining, and services sectors. He said the requests were carefully screened and scrutinised against a set-out selection criteria, and were categorised into production efficiency and scalability; local content capacity; job creation and human capital development; operating sector relevance; and potential contribution to economic growth.\n\nBut only 28 companies with projects that clearly articulated their proposals were selected for funding, he said, adding that the CBN intended to revisit the applications that were declined with a view to understanding areas of their shortcomings and enabling more companies to benefit from the initiative meant to stimulate manufacturing output in the country.\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cWith the significant opportunities in the real sector, there remained sufficient room for additional investments in the various sub-sectors and I would like to urge potential investors to take advantage of the various CBN intervention programmes and schemes, as well as other financing options out there, to invest in key sectors of our economy given the potential gains that could be generated from them.\u201d\n\nStakeholders, including Deposit Money Banks (DMBs), Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) and the beneficiary companies, all commended the apex bank and expressed confidence in the ability of its initiatives to boost domestic production as well as diversify the economy.\n\nEmefiele also said the initiative was designed to stimulate investments in Nigeria\u2019s priority sectors with the core objective of boosting production and productivity, which will aid efforts to stimulate greater growth of the economy and create employment opportunities.\n\nHe said, \u201cUnder this initiative, every 100 days, manufacturers in critical sectors that seek to engage in greenfield projects or in expanding their existing facilities will have access to cheaper forms of credit at single digit rates, as well as foreign exchange to procure plants and machineries.\u201d\n\nHe said the programme had the potential to significantly accelerate manufacturing output, promote further diversification of the economy, and facilitate faster growth of non-oil exports.\n\nEssentially, he said the PPP would help to reduce the country\u2019s over-reliance on imports, and stimulate productivity in agriculture, healthcare, manufacturing, extractive industries, logistics services, trade-related infrastructure, and renewable energy.\n\nHe added, \u201cThis launch also fulfils the commitment we made during the unveiling of the first central bank digital currency (CBDC), the eNaira, by His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR, on the 25th of October, 2021, when we announced that the CBN will introduce a 100 for 100 \u2013 Policy on Production and Productivity (PPP), under which eligible companies in priority sectors will be screened and 100 companies will be selected to receive funding from the CBN every 100 days, beginning from 1st November 2021.\n\n\u201cThe selection of subsequent beneficiaries will be rolled over every 100 days with new sets of 100 companies and details of these companies will be published in the major national dailies.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s launch of the 100 for 100 Policy for Production and Productivity (PPP) initiative and cheque presentation to selected companies, is a culmination of our engagements with critical stakeholders in the manufacturing sector and financial institutions, as we have here today pioneer beneficiaries of the initiative and the participating financial institutions.\u201d\n\nHe said over the past seven years, the Buhari government had made significant effort to reduce over-reliance on imports for food and industrial raw materials, towards one that was self-sufficient and self-reliant, with strong commitment towards ensuring that Nigerians produce what they eat and eat what they produce.\n\nThe CBN governor added that in line with the administration\u2019s policy focus to stimulate domestic production and productivity, the central bank had continued to introduce various policy measures, in the form of interventions, to stimulate low-cost and sustainable financing to priority sectors and segments of the economy.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe 100 for 100 Policy for Production and Productivity (PPP) is one of such interventions designed to fast track productive activities in priority sectors. Under this programme, eligible applicants will be required to submit their applications to their banks, after which, a notification is submitted on a dedicated portal \u2013 https://100for100ppp.ng, which has been created to ensure transparency and allow applicants track the status of their applications.\u201d\n\nCommenting further on the new FX policy being worked on, he said, \u201cIt is being worked on and I can tell. But what we are saying in essence is that you would find a situation where those who will benefit from FX or who would be accorded priority \u2013 everybody will benefit \u2013 but those who would be accorded priority in FX allocation will be those who will embrace our interventions that will help to grow the economy; intervention that will create jobs for our people, not just people who just want to import and export everything- anything they do is import.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe want to see to it that you are conducting business activities that reduce our imports and reduce your level of import, reduces your reliance on raw materials imports. But rather, there would be plants, equipment, spares priority and also ensure that by the time you are in business, the level of import you need will be very minimal, if not entirely zero.\n\n\u201cThose will be the kinds of companies we will accord priority in FX allocation going forward.\u201d\n\nHe said the new framework being fine-tuned would be market-driven and would support companies that accord utmost priority for local production and job creation drive.\n\nThe central bank also said it was working to stimulate non-oil export to boost foreign exchange earnings in the country.\n\nThe CBN governor said though details of the proposed FX policy were still being worked on, FX supply would be mostly allotted for the importation of spares, plants and equipment needed to increase production capacities of local companies.\n\nMeanwhile, the CBN\u2019s real sector intervention drive continued to receive accolades from the federal government.\n\nSecretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha, while commending Emefiele, described the policy initiative as well thought out, adding that it would significantly impact the economy if well implemented.\n\nMinister for Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, lauded the CBN for spurring economic activities through its various intervention programmes. Ngige noted that while productivity remained crucial for economic growth, the apex bank\u2019s interventions had been key in achieving Buhari\u2019s aspiration to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty.\n\nNgige said the country must take advantage of its growing population to boost the economy. He warned that the country might be sitting on a keg of gunpowder if nothing was done to address youth restiveness through employment generation.\n\nStressing that the Nigerian economy was still not properly diversified, he said without the various CBN interventions, the economy might collapse.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Nigeria facing historic transition, says Obaigbena\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday disclosed that by the time he leaves office on May 29, 2023, he would have bequeathed a home-grown economy, stable democracy as well as revamped security forces to Nigeria.\n\nThis was just as the Chairman of THISDAY/ARISE Media Group, Prince Nduka Obaigbena, said the nation was currently facing unrivalled transition towards the 2023 general polls.\n\nThe president, who spoke at a dinner in honour of the 2022 Committee of Business, Political, Media and Civil Society Leaders, held at the State House, Abuja, pledged his commitment to hand over a strong, repositioned, agriculture-led, diversified, home-grown economy, a stable democracy and revamped armed and security forces to the next administration.\n\nThe president, according to a statement by his Media Adviser, Femi Adesina, said he was looking forward to completing his tenure in 2023, leaving a legacy for a united, peaceful, and prosperous Nigeria with 24 years of uninterrupted democracy.\n\nWhile assuring Nigerians that his administration would finish strong in the last lap of his tenure, the president said: \u201dI am gradually entering my final year in office. It is a period I intend to spend not only on consolidating on the achievements of the past seven years but also to leave a legacy for a united, peaceful, and prosperous Nigeria.\n\n\u201dI take this initiative to mean that you all intend to collaborate with this administration in that direction.\n\n\u201dFor those among you who are politicians, you must look beyond gaining power to how you can leverage public positions in the process of societal change. To the businessmen and women among you, there is great glory in public service.\n\n\u201dThe question that should be uppermost always is: How do we leverage our business endowment for the greater good of our country?\n\n\u201dI am delighted that members of the Nigerian elite have woken up to the fact that the task of changing this society is a task for all of us, whether we are in the private or public sector. Knowing that, we have enormous challenges as a nation, but they are not beyond our capacity to overcome if we embrace a new approach.\n\n\u201dWe cannot retreat to our ethnic cocoons, nor can we continue to seek solace in our past. We must champion the idea of a Nigeria where every citizen would be proud to call their own. That is the charge before you.\u201d\n\nExpressing delight on the new consciousness by the Nigerian elites to work together with the political class and civil society in order to build a better Nigeria, Buhari noted that building consensus around issues of the economy, national security, governance, and such other critical areas of national life is a sure path to the future we seek to build.\n\n\u201dAs we all know, I have been very critical of the Nigerian elites, essentially because some of us have not always demonstrated that we can rise above personal gain, political partisanship as well as ethnic and religious differences when the situation demands that we all speak and or act as one in the interest of our country.\n\n\u201dThere are also many among our elites for whom profit remains the only motivation for any and every enterprise.\n\n\u201dBut now, I feel heartened that a more collaborative social enterprise model for resolving our common challenges is being forged.\n\n\u201dI must commend this initiative and its conveners. This is the kind of spirit I have always advocated because it is what we need at this time as we seek to build our society for peace, security and prosperity through dialogue while narrowing the gap between rich and poor,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the activities of the Committee, the president acknowledged that he was aware that attendance at their inaugural meeting on Sunday cut across a broad section of the society in the public, private sectors, civil society, and the youth.\n\nBuhari, therefore, lauded the group for rising above all ethnic and religious divides for the common good, describing the feat as \u2018\u2018fantastic\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe president, who said he had wished the group had convened earlier, advised them to try and accommodate a few more interests in their next meeting as they take a, \u201ddeeper dive into our national challenges and proffer workable and sustainable solutions for the near, medium, and long term.\u201d\n\n\u201dIt is our desire to finish strong in the next 16 months and ensure all hands are on deck for the last lap. We are doubling our efforts against all forms of insecurity, equipping our armed forces and strengthening the police.\n\n\u201dWe are determined to continue the war against corruption and fight poverty, we remain focused on building an all-inclusive economic opportunity for all citizens,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president told the meeting that despite the enormous problems inherited when he assumed office almost seven years ago, he could look back with satisfaction that this administration has kept faith with the people and has done well even amid dwindling resources for reasons that are well beyond our control.\n\n\u201dBut we probably would have fared even better if we secured the support of most of you that are here today, know that while government comes and goes, the country must remain and thrive.\u201d\n\nBuhari used the occasion to wish politicians, at the dinner, interested in elective positions in the 2023 polls the best, advising that, \u201dthere is nothing better than experience in leadership.\u201d\n\nResponding to concerns raised by Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State on the resurgence of military takeovers in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso in August 2020, September 2021 and January 2022, respectively, the president said he strongly believed that, \u201cNigeria has passed through that stage for good.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn the political situation in some West African countries, Fayemi said: \u201dWe believe Nigeria has a manifest destiny to protect democracy not just in Nigeria but also in our region. But in doing that we must ensure that our politicians adhere strictly to constitutional principles and I am happy that our President\u2019s position on leaders seeking third term is well known.\u201d\n\nGiving further insight on the workings of the Committee, Fayemi said Nigerians who benefitted from the country in good time, serving in different capacities, have a duty to support the country.\n\n\u201cWhat the Committee has tried to do is to develop an elite consensus on security and economy, \u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the Committee would take advantage of the president\u2019s consistent leadership, relentless passion and patriotism to ensure a seamless transition, while ensuring that the achievements of this administration are sustained and followed through for the benefit of the country.\n\n\u201cHere we have PDP and APC chieftains and we hope by the time we finish this work, what we will present to the President is void of partisan colorations. It is from people who want Nigerians to succeed,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso speaking, Convener of the Group, Obaigbena said with Nigeria facing a \u201dhistoric transition like no other\u201d, and with crisis across Africa and at home, the 2022 Committee emerged to \u201ddefend the national interest.\u201d\n\nAccording to him: \u201dThe 2022 Committee was put together to defend Nigeria in a time of crisis and in a time of transition, we must defend the national interest,\u2019\u2019 he said, noting that membership of the group were carefully selected from the business community, investors, governors, security sector and elder statesmen.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Begins training of engineers, forecasts 11,000 jobs\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nThe federal government yesterday said its electricity deal with Siemens was on course, stating that the first phase of the programme under the Presidential Power Initiative (PPI) would increase power supply to about 40 million Nigerians.\n\nIn addition, the contract which would see the eventual ramp up of the country\u2019s generation capacity to 25,000 megawatts, the government stated, would create at least 11,000 direct and indirect jobs.\n\nSpeaking at the commencement of the PPI training on network development studies, by FGN Power Company, the firm overseeing the Siemens power project, in Abuja, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr. Zainab Ahmed, said the unveiling of the training session was a milestone under the initiative.\n\nAhmed assured that the collaborative effort with the implementing partner, Siemens, on the PPI was on track to bring positive change to the power sector.\n\nThe training aspect of the PPI, she said, was to empower engineers with tools and training on network modelling and system development studies.\n\nAccording to her, the FGN had been driving the process by coordinating key stakeholders\u2019 input and working with the ministry of finance to secure financing and to enter into efficient commercial and contractual arrangements to deliver the PPI.\n\nThe flag-off of the training, she noted, was intended to deliver capacity development for engineers in network development, using proprietary simulation software by Siemens.\n\n\u201cThe first phase of the PPI will provide over 40 million people with more reliable electricity supply, create 11,000 direct and indirect jobs for Nigerians from power system engineers to electricians and contractors.\n\n\u201cThis will in turn improve the standard of living while providing homes and businesses with constant, reliable and affordable electricity supply,\u201d the minister said.\n\nWhile lauding President Muhammadu Buhari, \u201cfor his tireless effort in supporting the efforts of sector improvements, in particular the PPI,\u201d Ahmed explained that the first phase would witness the immediate rise in generation by 2,000 megawatts.\n\nThe minister is the chairperson of the board of FGN Power Co, while members are the ministers of power, works and housing as well as the minister of justice, the Director General of the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) and president of the Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE).\n\nIn his remarks, the Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, who was represented by the Minister of State, Power, Mr. Goddy Jedy-Agba, reiterated that in 18 months, the Siemens project would add 2,000 megawatts to the national grid, raising it to about 7,000 megawatts.\n\n\u201cThe objective of the PPI is to increase the end-to-end grid operational capacity of the power system in Nigeria to 25 gigawatts, but the focus in the next 18 months is to deliver the first additional 2,000 megawatts.\n\n\u201cThis will create a rapid transformation in the on-grid electricity value chain, spur economic growth, create jobs and opportunities for Nigerian youth and enterprises,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe pointed out that the government was prepared to solve the problems of epileptic power supply in Nigeria once and for all, stressing that it is the reason the federal government launched the programme.\n\nAccording to him, the initiative would help to achieve commercial autonomy by facilitating investments in critical infrastructure for power delivery and service to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThis project is expected to modernise, rehabilitate and expand the national grid by investing in the electricity value chain (generation, transmission, and distribution systems) of the power sector.\n\n\u201cOur implementing partner, Siemens will assist with world-class experience in power system reforms like they have done recently in Egypt,\u201d he noted.\n\nAlso speaking, the Managing Director of FGN Power, Kenny Anuwe, said the training was the first Power System Simulation Software (PSS) session under the Power Technology International (PTI) from Germany.\n\nHe noted that the training would cut across the power sector value chain comprising the generation, transmission and distribution to be handled by the National Power Training Institute of Nigeria (NAPTIN).\n\nAccording to him, the training will happen over the next four years on different levels to ramp up the competency of those that will be involved in handling the project.\n\nAnuwe assured that the project will resolve the existing bottlenecks in transmission and distribution networks, which will increase electricity access across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is important to stress that the benefits of constant and reliable electricity will boost economic activities; improve the lives of small, medium and micro enterprises across and deliver the much-needed power supply across the country.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that FGN Power Company will do its best to deliver on this project to ensure greater success and sustainability,\u201d he stated.\n\nCommenting, the Project Director, Siemens Energy, Nigeria, Sean Manley, said Siemens had brought in trainers from Germany, explaining that the company would not relent until the different phases were executed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "President Donald J. Trump\u2019s Concession Speech, By Rudolf Okonkwo",
          "text": "Fellow Americans,\n\nNobody knows the joy of winning better than I do, believe me. I have always been a winner for as long as I can remember. Okay? Nobody knows the beauty of fighting to win better than I do. I am always a fighter and when I fight, I win. Everybody knows that.\n\nI have reached the very top. Absolutely. And I reached the top at a very tremendous speed. You all know it. The first time I ran for office, I ran for president. It was beautiful. Right? What usually takes great men three attempts before they get a win, I won in a landslide the very first time I ran. I heard that it has never been done anywhere else in the world.\n\nIn the last four years, I have accomplished for America things that presidents that were in office for twelve years did not accomplish. It is not even close. I made America a big-league winner again. I put billions and billions of dollars into your pockets through my amazing tax cuts. I have shown you that everything is possible if you have the right man to do the right job. Everybody is saying so.\n\nAll over the world, there is huge respect for America again, in some cases, even massive fear. Bigly! Which is good. I made it happen. Nobody messes with America because I highly insisted on it. I placed America first, which is fair. I stopped those out of control dope and overrated countries that get away with murder at the expense of America. It didn\u2019t happen again. Not on my watch! I was tough so that America would be triumphant.\n\nThe world had never seen anything like that before.\n\nBecause of me, the next generation of Americans will grow up knowing that America is the greatest nation on earth, full of courageous men like me. Thanks to me, they will grow up knowing that ours is a Christian nation where it is allowed to say Merry Christmas. Our children and grandchildren will grow up knowing that the whole world is out there for them to dominate and not bow to the sissies who think that we must worship the environment at the expense of the staggering economy that I built.\n\nFrankly, I have done everything that I set out to do \u2013 most of which were things that have never been done before. I have in place the greatest military that humans ever assembled for our incredible men and women in uniform. I assembled it in just four years by rebuilding our powerful military that they destroyed due to neglect and incompetence. I secured America from coast to coast with walls and wires, cages and visa bans. I took care of it, just as I promised I would do. I returned America under God. Before I came, they had taken America to the shrines of the devil.\n\nAmericans love me because of these outstanding accomplishments. I have seen it on the faces of fabulous Americans while I travelled around the country in the last few weeks.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I could stay around and fight. And it is a fight that I know that I will win. But I have decided not to. There is no point.\n\nI believe that I have nothing else left to prove. My achievements will be around till the end of time. I won\u2019t be surprised if, by January 20, 2021, my face would go up on Mount Rushmore to join other presidents of my calibre. It won\u2019t surprise me one bit. People think it is going to happen.\n\nTo all my special supporters, I say thank you for the unbelievable fantastic ride. Don\u2019t despair, for I will send you a brilliant comforter. Those stupid little lightweights on the other side who have no clue may taunt you. When those clowns do, remind the goofy and crooked losers that I made America great again. Tell those terrible lowlifes that they have proved themselves unworthy of Donald Trump\u2019s genius and have opted to reduce America to a Second Class nation in the world. Total Disaster!\n\nSo, my fellow American, I bide you all farewell. May God bless you, and my God bless the United States of America.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump\n\nThe 45th President of the United States.",

          "title": "The Teflon President With Nine Lives Is On His Way Out By Dr. Wumi Akintide",
          "text": "You probably know who I am talking about. The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump. Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives?\n\nNot by a long shot. The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.\n\nYou would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.\n\nWhat is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that. America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God\u2019s own country.\n\nIn cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.\n\nEven though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a \u201cdump.\u201d\n\nThe guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education. Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the \u201cC\u201d average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything. He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world. Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today. His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America\u2019s traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nDonald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined. He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House.\n\nThe one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin. He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years. He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen.\n\nThe Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House.\n\nEven though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.\n\nMy point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.\n\nIi is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year.\n\nIf Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life.\n\nI seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up. Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness. Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud. Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source.\n\nGerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.\n\nGeorge Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his \u201cread my lips\u201d pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.\n\nI gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America. Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America. Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by \u201cgrabbing their pussies\u201d because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder. He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan. Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again. Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years.\n\nRepublicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years.\n\nThey elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI. Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman\u2019s mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea.\n\nRepublicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin. He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way. Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders. They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East. Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor.\n\nThe list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less. Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as \u201cfake news\u201d disseminators.\n\nHe has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few.\n\nWhat atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed? The list is inexhaustible. The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do. Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it.\n\nIt is a complete outrage and totally incredible!\n\nI rest my case.\n\nDr. Wumi Akintide",

Our resolve is to upgrade the quality of communications as well as its frequency to keep Agropartners intimated on our progress. We will be ramping up our capacity in the areas of customer communication channels, personnel and communications technology,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSeveral factors including global supply chain challenges and processing machinery breakdowns have contributed to our operational downtimes.\n\n\u201cWe are working hard to strengthen our processes, upgrade our technology, and have brought experts onboard to drive this new phase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur next virtual meeting with the Co-CEOs will be on Friday, February 18, 2022. We hope to update you on progress made and address any further concerns you may have.\u201d\n\nThis is not new to the agritech environment in Nigeria as they faced numerous challenges such as insecurity, COVID-19 induced supply chain disruption, mismanagement and lack of transparency from founders.

          "text": "Globally, cryptocurrency industry funding has been growing increasingly fast in the past couple of years. Last year alone, crypto startups raised over $27 billion in venture capital in 2021 \u2014slightly higher than the past 10 years combined. And just last month, despite a dip in the price of cryptocurrencies, American VC, Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s crypto arm launched a $2.2 billion fund, one of its biggest efforts to fund crypto startups. The firm is reaffirming its commitment to crypto with its third and largest industry specific fund, after investing $850 million last year between 2 rounds of investments. This shows that institutional investors are getting more comfortable in putting their money in crypto\u2014an entirely different experience 4 or 5 years ago.\n\nIn Africa, Web3\u2014powered by crypto, is becoming a large industry, and it is not surprising because Africa is the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency in the world, consequently, investors are pumping money into the industry on the continent.\n\nOn a mission to further deepen crypto adoption in Africa is Nigerian crypto startup Nestcoin which is building out Web3 products. Today, Nestcoin announced that it raised a $6.5 million pre-seed round. Since launching last year, in November, with a promise to \u201chelp Nigerians first, then other Africans, exit the status quo by offering them access to wealth using crypto technology or elements of web 3.0 like NFT, DAOs and DeFi,\u201d Nestcoin has made tremendous progress.\n\nFounded by former Binance director Yele Bademosi and former Bundle Africa CTO, Taiwo Orilogbon, Nestcoin has made good on its promise to create crypto-native products beyond trading and investments, with a focus on driving the adoption of crypto in Africa.\n\nLast year, it launched Breach, a media arm to simplify complex crypto topics to a global audience. It later launched one of Africa\u2019s earliest play-to-earn crypto games, Metaverse Magna (MVM), which it says will allow members of its gaming community to earn as much as $1,000 monthly. It has invested in Lazerpay, a crypto startup that allows businesses to accept payment in crypto, and collaborated with fintech, Bitsika and its music superstar partner Davido to launch the Echoke social token. Nescoin has hinted that it is developing several other products to \u201cprovide compelling use cases for crypto\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are excited that our investors are backing this ambitious plan to create a future where billions of people in frontier markets have access to the opportunities that crypto brings. With this financing, we will continue to grow our diverse team, which already spans 9 countries, expand our product offerings, and invest in more ventures aligned with our vision,\u201d says Nestcoin\u2019s CEO, Yele Bademosi, in a statement.\n\nThe company, which boasts of a global network of investors, had its round led by Distributed Global, Alter Global, Serena Ventures, Alameda Research, and A&T Capital. Other institutional investors include MSA Capital, 4DX Ventures, Raba Capital, Goat.vc, Old Fashion Research, CMT Digital, Electric Capital, Social Capital, CoinFund, gumi Cryptos Capital, DeFi Alliance, among others.\n\nNestcoin, in a statement, says that the new funding will enable it to expand its global operations and invest in building products that will help accelerate crypto adoption and financial freedom for people in frontier markets.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "On Wednesday, a Nigerian Twitter user Joshua Nwogo tweeted that Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange that processes 76 billion worth of transactions daily, had permanently blocked his account for 6 months. Accompanying the tweet were screenshots of his account balance, conversations he\u2019d had with a Binance customer representative, and four hashtags\u2014#boycottbinance #binancestopstealingcrypto #binancestopscamming #stoptradingonbinance\u2014calling the exchange giant a scam and urging other customers to stop using the platform.\n\nThe tweet picked up momentum due to how the supposed Binance representative handled the situation\u2014with cluelessness and threats. Within a few minutes, other disgruntled users had started reporting their own similar experiences with the platform. By Thursday, the matter had escalated and two of the hashtags were sitting on top of the Nigerian Twitter trends table.\n\nSince there was no response yet from Binance throughout Wednesday, people began to conjure different reasons as to why accounts are getting blocked. Some people said the platform is anti-African and is trying to shut the continent out of the cryptocurrency economy; others said the platform is stealing coins from Nigerians because it\u2019s aware the users are helpless as their government won\u2019t intervene.\n\nOn Thursday, Binance, through its Africa operation, made a Twitter thread apologising for inconveniences, assuring users of their commitment, and asking them to fill out a form that would help in tracking and resolving the issues quickly. A few hours later, they announced a YouTube ask-me-anything (AMA) session for the Nigerian community to address the concerns of users regarding account restrictions, user safety, and Binance peer-to-peer (P2P).\n\nAt 11 a.m. on Friday, the session, hosted by Dami Odufuwa, head of public relations at Binance Africa, alongside the Binance Africa community manager Nsikan Benjamin and the company\u2019s Africa Director Emmanuel Babalola, started and lasted for about an hour.\n\nAccording to Babalola, there are 2 reasons an account can be blocked: uncompleted know-your-customer (KYC) registration and detection of fraudulent activities, which he referred to as \u201claw enforcement agencies related issues\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have recorded over 200 cases of blocked accounts and counting, and 30% of them are fraud-related while the rest are a case of [incomplete] KYC,\u201d said Babalola. \u201cWe have started resolving these issues and also sent notifications to those whose cases are law enforcement-related.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKYC means users have to provide some means of identification before they can access some Binance products; their account could be blocked if they continue or try to access these products without completing their KYC.\n\nBut what exactly is a fraudulent activity? How can Binance tell if a transaction is fraudulent after coins have been exchanged across different addresses? And why are they allowing law enforcers into their backend? After all, it\u2019s the big ole crypto, popularly known as a means to escape the inconsistency and prying eyes of centralised financial institutions and their regulator buddies.\n\nThe backstory\n\nTo answer these questions, a little context will suffice. Throughout last year, Binance faced its biggest test: the platform came under aggressive scrutiny from an increasing number of regulators worldwide\u2014from the UK to the US, the Netherlands, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Germany, Cayman Islands, Lithuania, and Hong Kong.\n\nThis was a result of countless concerns over the use of crypto to launder money and how Binance is an unchecked instrument of this activity. While several countries have started investigations into Binance and reduced its activities, others have banned anything that has to do with crypto completely.\n\nNot just countries, banks are also restricting access for crypto exchange as well. In June and July, several banks or payment processors in Europe and the UK, including Barclays, Nationwide, HSBC, and Santander, have subsequently cut off Binance\u2019s access or announced reviews of their approach to crypto at large. Same happened in Nigeria after the central bank ordered banks and financial institutions to stop facilitating crypto transactions in February.\n\nEven though Binance has been making moves to incorporate anti-money laundering (AML) systems into its product since 2019, it seems little success has been achieved. As of today, there are still bad actors scamming and laundering money on the platform.\n\nFor instance, in December last year, Turkey\u2019s financial regulator fined Binance\u2019s Turkish arm $750,000 for non-compliance with AML requirements. Two weeks ago, Pakistan\u2019s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) opened an investigation into a scam that defrauded investors out of over $100 million after hackers redirected the stolen money into 26 wallets registered on Binance.\n\nAll of these and more were reported to be the reason why Binance has chosen to double down its AML compliance and champion the cause of crypto regulation across the world full frontally. Last year it published Why Crypto Needs Regulation: Knowing Your 10 Fundamental Rights and followed it up with an opinion piece by Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder and CEO of Binance, to further explain why regulation is important at this stage of crypto adoption. This is the first time the exchange is openly seeking regulation rather than running away from it or accepting it.\n\nTo answer the question of how Binance can tell if a transaction is fraudulent after coins have been exchanged across different addresses: Binance, like many other big exchanges, now works with different regulators and law enforcement agencies globally to protect users and curb money laundering. Any account trading stolen coins will be instantly flagged for either review or outright blocking. And this explains what happened with the 30% of African users\u2019 accounts\u2014especially Nigerians\u2019\u2014that were blocked. It shows the platform is not only publishing articles but also taking action.\n\n\u201cCentralised exchanges have AML built-in to identify bad coins. Transaction monitoring tools are used and there are a number of companies that provide these tools including CipherTrace, Chainanalysis, and QLUE. Transactions can also be tracked on the blockchain by collaborating and discussing with other centralised exchanges,\u201d Binance Africa told TechCabal.\n\nIt\u2019s now regulatory compliance for centralised exchange to integrate blockchain analytics and monitoring tools that visually track, trace, and monitor illicit crypto activities on their platform. For example, following Binance 2019\u2019s partnership deal with Ciphertrace, the world\u2019s leading provider of cryptocurrency intelligence and blockchain security, to enhance the exchange\u2019s robust AML compliance program, Binance became the first exchange to deploy Traveler, the first commercial product created to help Virtual Asset Services Providers comply with global \u201ctravel rule\u201d regulations, in July 2021.\n\nGlobally, what makes a set of people love the blockchain and crypto concept is exactly what scares and creates distrust in a larger population who haven\u2019t adopted crypto yet: decentralisation and untraceability. Now that centralised exchanges are changing the narrative of the core concept of crypto, will this eliminate distrust, create some level of assurance, and then accelerate adoption or will this push more people away into full-on decentralised wallets and exchanges like MetaMask or a total rejection of crypto?\n\nWe don\u2019t know, as of the time of publication, the exact reason for blocking Joshua Nwogo\u2014one of the persons who started the campaign against the crypto giant and jolted others from their slumber\u2014but, according to the Binance Africa team, it can\u2019t be outside the 2 reasons which are incomplete KYC and detection of fraudulent transaction. But we are monitoring the story closely and will be reporting any new developments.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Tiger Global and Greycroft lead $15m Series A round in Nigeria\u2019s Bamboo",
          "text": "Bamboo, an investment platform that allows Nigerians buy and trade US stocks in real-time from their mobile phones or computers, has raised $15 million in a Series A funding round led by American venture capital firms Greycroft and Tiger Global. Motley Fool Ventures, Saison Capital, Chrysalis Capital, and Y-Combinator\u2019s Michael Seibel also participated in the round, the company said.\n\nLaunched in January 2020 by CEO Richmond Bassey and COO Yanmo Omorogbe, Bamboo has rapidly grown in popularity with retail investors, claiming over 300,000 accounts in Nigeria. Its users can access all equities available on the US stock exchanges, that is, the stocks of roughly 6,000 companies.\n\n\u201cOur goal is simple: we want to give Africans and their asset managers easy, fast and secure access to global investment options that will allow them to earn real returns,\u201d Bassey said in a statement released Monday.\n\nWith the new funding, Bamboo plans to further accelerate its growth, doubling down on unlocking new markets and launching more products, it said while Bassey told TechCabal in an emailed response that Bamboo will be providing more asset classes and investment opportunities for its users.\n\n\u201cBamboo is enabling Africans to build wealth by creating an investing platform that is helpful to both experienced investors and to those new to the stock market. We are thrilled to support the innovative, user-first approach the Bamboo team is bringing to market,\u201d Greycroft Partner Alison Lange Engel said on the investment.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLast year, the company launched Powered by Bamboo, its API solution that allows asset managers, fintech companies, and other financial institutions to plug into Bamboo\u2019s API to provide their customers access to global securities. The company has been testing the product with a small group of companies and expects to onboard more this year.\n\n\u201cEveryone building for African investors is welcome. We plan to add other products and tools that offer greater access and make global investing simpler from Africa,\u201d Bassey said. \u201cWe\u2019re building the technology infrastructure powering financial services in Africa.\u201d\n\nIn April 2021, Bamboo announced plans to launch in Ghana and has since seen more than 50,000 Ghanaians join the waitlist, according to the company. In the near future, Bamboo plans to expand into more markets such as Kenya and South Africa, Bassey said.\n\nCompared to developed markets such as the United States, investing in stocks is relatively new in Nigeria, and Africa at large. For instance, nearly 75% of Bamboo users have never traded stocks before.\n\nThus, the company has had to put significant effort into educating its users on how to invest and become better investors, using a mix of regular educational content published on its social media, a stock market course, an investment bootcamp, newsletters with investing tips and exclusive value-added services from top investment advisors like The Motley Fool and MyWallSt.\n\nThese efforts appear to pay off, going by Bamboo\u2019s figures. In 2021, repeat depositors made up 85% of deposits on the platform, an indication that Bamboo users are rapidly gaining confidence in trading US stocks.\n\nBut with the US equities market experiencing its worst January in well over a decade\u2014since 2009\u2014how are Bamboo users reacting to the downturn?\n\n\u201cEven though they are new to stock investing, Bamboo users tend to handle their emotions like more seasoned investors,\u201d Bassey said. \u201cWe saw this during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic crash and we\u2019re seeing it again now.\u201d\n\nBamboo allows Nigerians buy and trade US stocks in real-time from their mobile phones or computers.\n\nAfrica\u2019s wealth management market remains largely underdeveloped but holds high potential. According to data cited by Bamboo, Africans account for over 16% of the world\u2019s population, yet they own less than 1% of global wealth.\n\nBut that is expected to change over the next decade, with private wealth in the continent expected to increase by 30% to reach $2.6 trillion by 2030, according to AfrAsia Bank.\n\nBassey is upbeat platforms like Bamboo will play a major role in realising the projected growth, by helping to develop an investing culture among Africans.\n\n\u201cWe think investing in stocks has a bright future in Nigeria. Nigerians are hungry to earn a return on their investments and build wealth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are bullish on platforms such as ours in bringing more Nigerians into the world of investing.\u201d\n\nWithout revealing many details, Bamboo says in the statement it plans to make it seamless for African investors in the diaspora to discover the best investment opportunities on the continent.\n\nIn August, Nigeria\u2019s central bank received court approval to freeze the bank accounts of Bamboo and other similar Nigerian fintech platforms for a six-month period. However, Bassey confirmed the company received a court order unfreezing its accounts. \u201cAll have been unfrozen now,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?",
          "text": "Do you need a guide for all the big tech terms people are throwing about on the internet? What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?\n\nOver the past couple of years, there\u2019s been an influx of words that explain certain tech concepts. Some of them like crypto, or even NFTs, have been around for a while. In fact, NFT\u2014as a word\u2014was first used in 2014 and now, 7 years later, it\u2019s still a concept that escapes a lot of us. Others like DeFi or DAOs are fairly new, but they\u2019re still getting thrown around a lot.\n\nWhether you\u2019re new or old to tech, reading about concepts can feel like learning a new language. So TechCabal is creating a guide\u2014short explainers\u2014for common tech terms. In this, you\u2019re sure to find simple short explanations that can help you understand NiFTy concepts.\n\n1. Blockchain\n\nA few of the concepts we\u2019ll explain here are based on blockchain so it\u2019s important this goes first.\n\nBlockchain is a record-keeping tech that\u2019s designed to make it impossible to hack the system or forge the data stored on it.\n\nHow it works: Standard databases store data in rows, columns and files, but blockchain stores data in blocks that are chained together. The data on the blocks are continuously updated, encrypted, and stored on several computers so there\u2019s no single computer to hack or control the data from.\n\nIn explaining blockchain, Buchi Okoro\u2014CEO and co-founder of African cryptocurrency exchange Quidax\u2014said: \u201cImagine a book where you write down everything you spend money on each day. Each page is similar to a block, and the entire book, a group of pages, is a blockchain. With a blockchain, everyone who uses a cryptocurrency has their own copy of this book to create a unified transaction record. The software logs each new transaction as it happens, and every copy of the blockchain is updated simultaneously with the new information, keeping all records identical and accurate.\u201d\n\n2. Cryptocurrency\n\nImage source: Aceris Law\n\nWe all know what currencies are\u2014dollars, pounds, shillings. Well, cryptocurrencies are digital currencies. You can\u2019t hold it the way you\u2019d hold fiat currencies like CFA coins or naira notes, but you can still spend it on things you love.\n\nHow it works: Cryptos are digital currencies created on blockchain technology. If you got a sense of what blockchains are, then you\u2019ll understand what we mean when we say that cryptocurrencies are decentralised; no one person or government controls them. They are created by algorithms and used to award engineers\u2014called miners\u2014who carry out maintenance on the blockchain.\n\nUnlike fiat currencies which derive their value and validity from states, cryptocurrencies derive their value and validity from the blockchain.\n\n3. Non-fungible token (NFT)\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by its mushroom-sounding title, NFTs are in fact inedible, even the NFT flavours. NFTs are unique digital assets created on a blockchain.\n\nHow it works: To put it simply, NFTs are digital works that exist on blockchain. They can be images, sounds, game skins, or even clothes for your digital avatars. These digital works are impossible to duplicate or forge; they\u2019re one of a kind and that makes them valuable. If you\u2019re asking yourself why a screenshot of an NFT isn\u2019t as valuable, it\u2019s because NFTs have been embedded with code which is what makes them exist on the blockchain.\n\nThink of it this way, when you go to a museum and take photos of artefacts, what you have is just a photo which isn\u2019t quite valuable. The museum still has the original valuable artefact.\n\nIt\u2019s similar with NFTs. We can take screenshots of Niyi Okeowo\u2019s $2,800 Indigo Child (below) but it doesn\u2019t mean we own the asset. The original copy\u2014the property rights and certificate of authenticity\u2014belong to the buyer.\n\nNiyi Okeowo\u2019s \u201cIndigo Child\u201d\n\n4. Web3\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen tech bros throw the word \u201cWeb3\u201d around a lot. It\u2019s the answer experts give to questions from \u201cWhat is the future of the internet?\u201d to \u201cWhat does Spiderman navigate the internet with?\u201d\n\nBut what exactly is Web3? To put it simply, Web3 is taking democracy to the internet.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at Web3\u2019s ancestors, Web1 and Web2, so we can understand what it\u2019s all about.\n\nWeb1 was the earliest version of the internet, which existed between the 1900s and the early 2000s. In this version, content was delivered via texts and graphics to users who could only consume the content but not interact with it.\n\nWeb2 is what we have now, an interactive and social web where companies can build revolutionary apps that allow users to become creators. It\u2019s centralised, i.e. controlled by companies or governments who can decide when websites, apps or content can be taken down with little input from users.\n\nOn Web2, apps are only available for as long as the company that owns them decides. Streaming sites can shut down, online games can upload patches users don\u2019t like (yes, I\u2019m looking at you Riot Games), and traditional banks can freeze bank accounts when the government demands it.\n\nHow Web3 works: Web3 will be built on the blockchain working independently from different parts of the world.\n\nOn Web3, decisions regarding the design and operation of products and funds\u2014including crypto\u2014will be made by communities of people called Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), and not governments or companies. So if you find an app or product you like, you can join the DAO of that product, buy shares and vote on which changes should be made.\n\nFor example, if you joined TechCabal\u2019s DAO, you\u2019ll get to decide how we upgrade or downgrade depending on how much shares you have in the DAO.\n\n5. Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)\n\nDAOs or Decentralised Autonomous Organisations are social communities that will create rules and regulations which will be embedded in programming codes.\n\nHow it works: Unlike conventional organisations like TechCabal, which have managers and boards of directors that govern it, DAOs are governed by communities\u2014who don\u2019t have to be developers of the product. DAOs are created by developers who decide on a set of rules and embed it in\u2014digital contracts on blockchain that are executed when certain conditions are met.\n\nThe communities decide what happens to the products attached to that DAO, what upgrades to make and when to make it. Each DAO will have its own token which will be sold to its community members, and the more tokens you have, the heavier your stake and voting rights.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVenture capital activity in the global Web3, crypto, and blockchain space last year was massive. While interest in the space has increased steadily since 2012, 2021 holds the record for biggest investments to date.\n\nAccording to a Galaxy Digital Report, VCs invested more in crypto startups in 2021 than in the last seven years combined. Investments were estimated to be $33 billion, 67% of which were in rounds larger than $100 million.\n\nThe largest portion of the funding \u2014 41.83% \u2014 went to crypto startups offering trading, investing, and exchange services. Web3, NFT, and metaverse-related startups were a distant second with 17% of the funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Investments in crypto-related startups in 2021. Source: Galaxy Digital\n\nThis year could be a big year for Web3 startups, especially in Africa, with the announcement of Nestcoin\u2019s $6.45 million pre-seed round. The startup, focused on creating and investing in Web3 and crypto-focused products, announced the raise today, February 1, 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPan African venture capital firm 4DX Ventures backed the funding round with participation from Serena Ventures, launched by world-renowned American athlete, Serena Williams, among other investors.\n\nThere was also an array of crypto and blockchain-focused VCs such as New York-headquartered CoinFund, which has investments in the popular NFT marketplace, Rarible, and Polkadot, one of the biggest blockchain networks. Blockchain and cryptographic asset fund, gumi Cryptos Capital, also invested in Nestcoin\u2019s pre-seed.\n\nThis pre-seed funding comes three months after Nestcoin\u2019s official launch in November 2021. The investment will be used to accelerate its mission of driving adoption and helping Africans create wealth through crypto.\n\nFounded by Yele Bademosi (CEO) and Taiwo Orilogbon (CTO), Nestcoin is the duo\u2019s latest venture after they exited crypto and cash payments startup, Bundle Africa, in July 2021.\n\nBademosi wrote in a blog post that he was taking a step back to \u201cexplore other areas that need more support in the African crypto community beyond traditional buy-and-sell currency trading.\u201d\n\nBademosi told Techpoint Africa that the idea for Nestcoin had been brewing as far back as 2017, even before the launch of Bundle. He had always been fascinated by blockchain and wanted more Africans to understand the tech and the several ways they could benefit from it.\n\nBreach and Metaverse Magna record growth\n\nNestcoin launched Breach \u2014 its first product \u2014 in November 2021. Breach is a media platform focusing on simplifying crypto and blockchain concepts for a global audience. According to Bademosi, almost 6,000 people have subscribed to Breach\u2019s newsletter since November.\n\nThe launch of Breach was followed by Metaverse Magna (MVM), a platform that provides anyone with the right skill set to make money with play-to-earn games on the metaverse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt provides assets for Axie Infinity, one of the most popular metaverse gaming platforms. Players on the platform can earn over $1,000 monthly. However, the assets required to play on the platform are expensive.\n\nMVM provides these assets for free while a percentage of the players\u2019 earnings is deducted. It currently has 400 active players and a community of almost 10,000 people.\n\nIn the time Nestcoin has been operational, it has been fulfilling its mission to improve lives with crypto and Web3.\n\nBedemosi told Techpoint Africa that apart from the growing number of users and participants, an \u201cimportant measure of the impact of Breach and MVM is the comments we get from our community every day. People tell us all the time that they wish they\u2019d encountered our products earlier in their crypto journey.\u201d\n\nThe argument about Web3\n\nWhile Nestcoin plans to improve lives with Web3, some people like Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, believe the idea of a third-generation Internet is just another marketing buzzword that helps VCs make money.\n\nWeb3, which means the third generation of the Internet, promises a decentralised system of ownership on the Internet. Instead of big corporations like Meta and Google owning a large percentage of data (and money), ownership will be shared with everyone on Web3. However, Jack Dorsey, ex-Twitter CEO, and Musk believe it\u2019s just a concept created by VCs to own more of the Internet.\n\nYou don\u2019t own \u201cweb3.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe VCs and their LPs do. It will never escape their incentives. It\u2019s ultimately a centralized entity with a different label.\n\n\n\nKnow what you\u2019re getting into\u2026 \u2014 jack\u26a1\ufe0f (@jack) December 21, 2021\n\nVCs such as Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) have invested up to $3 billion in the space, including NFT marketplace OpenSea, where inside trading activities by some executives were uncovered last year.\n\nBademosi, however, maintains that Web3 has the potential to create a more equitable world.\n\n\u201cWe believe that Web3 technology will create access to more economic opportunities for people in frontier markets.\u201d\n\nHe added that the challenge Nestcoin has faced so far with Web3 is deciding which opportunities to explore as there are so many within the space. Aside from creating Breach and MVM, Nestcoin has also invested in crypto payments startups, Lazerpay, and, recently, AltSchool.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done all these in such a short time. Imagine how much more we\u2019ll do in the coming months and years,\u201d Bademosi says.\n\nDecentralised finance (DeFi) and a digital art platform could be the next products for Nestcoin. But Bademosi hints that crypto-native solutions in the payments and social spaces are in the works while they improve on current products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "title": "AltSchool Africa bags $1m to plug Africa\u2019s shortage of entry-level talent",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past few years, the focus on tech talent development in Africa has shifted from training entry-level talent to training senior talent. Also, the inability of the local education system to provide competent engineering talent has led to a gap in the market for entry-level talent. AltSchool Africa understands this and has raised $1 million in pre-seed funding for this purpose.\n\nThe round has Nigerian entertainer, Folarin Falana (Falz); Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga GB Agboola; Paystack Founder Shola Akinlade; Nigerian musician and rapper, Akitoye Balogun (Ajebutter); Pledges, Nestcoin, and ODBA VC, as investors.\n\nAltSchool launched in October 2021 with a simple mission to provide an education that equips students with skills and a certificate, all within a year. This led to a partnership with the Michael and Cecilia Ibru University. Under this partnership, graduates of the programme get a diploma certificate at the end. To achieve this, AltSchool tutors participants for nine months, followed by a three-month internship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigerian entertainer, Folarin Falana (Falz) (middle) was one of the startup\u2019s investors\n\nIts launch was met with significant support and excitement from the local tech ecosystem, with several individuals paying the application fee for interested participants. That support has resulted in over 8,000 enrollments from over 20 countries, including Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda, and Botswana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike most startups focused on providing tech skills, it adopts an income-sharing model where students do not have to pay for the tuition until they get a job. However, they have to pay an application fee of \u20a610,000 ($20).\n\nFollowing this fresh injection of capital, the startup will focus on content, growth, and building its technology, starting with its learning management system (LMS). Adewale Yusuf (CEO) discloses that the startup will launch its Schools of Product, Data, and Blockchain in Q2 2022.\n\nWhen these schools launch, they will offer courses in product design, product management, and product marketing, amongst others. AltSchool\u2019s School of Engineering currently runs three courses: frontend engineering, backend engineering, and cloud engineering.\n\nGraduates will need to work on real-world projects to gain practical experience, and AltSchool offers an internship to its students. Yusuf reveals that AltSchool already has startups willing to take on AltSchool graduates as interns, although he declined to mention them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve signed up some of the best startups on the market, and that\u2019s one of the most exciting things about what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigerian musician and rapper Ajebutter (seated) with CEO Adewale Yusuf\n\nAs African startups have witnessed massive growth in the past few years, the demand for competent software engineers has risen. However, from an initial focus on building a pipeline of technical talents, much of the conversation now borders on how to get more senior talents.\n\nA side effect of this is that less attention is paid to entry-level talent. Consequently, startups on the continent have a hard time finding entry-level talent. Fortunately, startups like AltSchool, Gebeya, and Decagon ensure a somewhat steady supply of talent for the ecosystem.\n\nIn 2014, Andela, arguably the pioneer for software engineering training, was launched. In addition to training participants, it also placed them in jobs with partner companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe model looked to be paying off, but a demand for more senior engineering talents caused the company to re-evaluate its business model. In the process, it gradually laid off junior developers on its payroll before transitioning to a talent outsourcing company.\n\nSo, why is AltSchool working on training entry-level talent when more established players are focusing on senior engineers? As Yusuf rightly points out, you can\u2019t have senior engineers without junior engineers.\n\nAs more companies are founded in Africa, and the competition for talent increasingly gets global, more engineering talent will be needed. However, to keep up with demand, more startups like AltSchool will be needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nWelcome to a new month! A month some people regard as the month of love. I\u2019m seeing Valentine\u2019s Day packs with prices that are a healthy mix of fair and cutthroat, people ready to splurge their life\u2019s savings on romance, and hilarious memes that foreshadow the dark days beyond February 14.\n\nWhat am I thinking of? How to create romantic experiences for couples in the METAVERSE at a fair price and romantic NFTs I can mint and sell at a premium. Well, I\u2019m only finding a way to reap in these \u2018dark\u2019 times.\n\nMeanwhile, this month is my birth month. Feel free to send gifts my way on February 13. But that\u2019s not why I\u2019m here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nWhat 2022 will look like for investment platforms\n\nSidebrief\u2019s plan for continental expansion\n\nThe rise of a high growth VC funds\n\nInvestment tech platforms in 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral discussions with my Dad revealed how he missed out on investing in companies like Nestle in the 80s and 90s. The stock market sounded so distant and looked like land only the initiated would dare approach. Imagine what foreign exchanges would feel like if the local stock market was out of reach for the average Nigerian\n\nNo, this did not get better with time. Only a relatively minute percentage of Nigerians invested in the local stock market in 2020, but a group of technology-enabled platforms began springing up. Chaka, Bamboo, Trove and Risevest created platforms to help Nigerians invest in local and global stock markets.\n\nTake a minute: Why Nigeria\u2019s stock market may need more than technology to thrive.\n\nA few years later, these platforms have gained popularity and regulatory attention.\n\nOn January 31, 2022, Bamboo announced that it raised $15 million co-led by the seemingly tireless US-based investors Tiger Global and Greycroft to aid its ambition to make stock investments easy for Nigerians.\n\nThe numbers: Bamboo says it has gained more than 300,000 users in over two years of operations, with 75% having never traded in the stock market before. The company plans to expand to Ghana and Kenya and use part of its funding to scale its tech infrastructure.\n\nThe elephant in the room: Seemingly out of the blues, between 2020 and 2021, two of Nigeria\u2019s regulators, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), came up with orders that affected players in the country\u2019s investment tech space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn December 2020, the SEC issued a memo to restrict Chaka from selling or advertising stocks. In April 2021, it declared the activities of investment tech platforms illegal, and by July, Chaka bagged the commission\u2019s first digital stock trading licence.\n\nA sign of regulatory progress, it seemed, but in August 2021, the CBN\u2019s accused these platforms of sourcing for foreign exchange illegally, and a federal high court issued an order to freeze their accounts for six months. The accounts were promptly unfrozen following another court session, but skies did not seem clear.\n\nWhy we\u2019re discussing this? As Nigeria\u2019s digital native population increases, the stock market could become an attractive proposition for thousands of Nigerians, if not Africans. Provided our pockets survive February, that is.\n\nSidebrief for continental expansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSidebrief team. Source: Supplied\n\nOperating in more than one jurisdiction is no small feat, even for multinationals and large business entities. This involves everything from fitting into the new market and not infringing on any legal requirements. In simple terms, not even the thinnest line should be crossed when talking about business compliance in any market. This sounds like a lot of work, right?\n\nIn 2019, three professionals \u2014 Eunice Olopade, Usman Sotunde, and Abdulwaheed Yusuf \u2014 teamed up to address this challenge by building a platform \u2014 Sidebrief \u2014 where African startups can seamlessly expand into any of the 54 countries without having to interface with multiple lawyers, multiple advisors, or multiple regulatory bodies.\n\nRemember this? The hurdles of building a pan-African tech product.\n\nOluwanifemi spoke with Eunice Olopade(CEO, SIdebrief) to find out how the startup simplifies all these tasks while maintaining competitive costs.\n\nRead more: How Sidebrief is making continental and global expansion a breeze for African startups\n\nThe rise of high growth VC funds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion, way more than the previous two years combined. However, if you followed the news closely, you\u2019d observe that a large number of these deals were early-stage deals with relatively smaller deal sizes.\n\nAnother trend you would observe is that most of the biggest checks were written by foreign investors. Names like Tiger Global, Greycroft, SoftBank, and Sequoia Capital begin to feature prominently. While these investors come with large checks, they lack the knowledge of the African market to help high growth startups scale across Africa.\n\nInterestingly, Niklas Adalberth\u2019s Norrsken Foundation wants to plug the gap for an investor with the right blend of huge checks and local knowledge, and it has raised $200 million to that effect.\n\nAccording to her, Norrsken22 intends to be that growth-stage local-based firm that will enable startups to unlock significant partnerships to grow revenue, find the best talent and facilitate expansion plans across Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa.\n\nThe plan? Team up with thirty unicorn founders globally, including Flutterwave CEO Gbenga \u2018GB\u2019 Agboola, who contributed up to $65 to its fund.\n\nNorrksen\u2019s value proposition opens up room for exciting conversations on the future of startup investment, the role of local and foreign investors, and, of course, regulations.\n\nRead more: Norrsken, VCs and 30 unicorn founders set up $200M fund to back growth-stage startups in Africa.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nFirst, Microsoft bought Activision, makers of Call of Duty; now Sony wants to buy Bungie, makers of Halo and Destiny.

          "text": "The Series 1 offer for sale of 575 million shares held by the MTN Group in MTN Nigeria (the Offer) to Nigerian investors has been successfully completed. The Offer was implemented by way of a bookbuild to qualified institutional investors and a fixed price offer to retail investors.\n\nThe Offer was 139.47percent oversubscribed, activating the allocation of an additional 86.25 million shares. Retail shareholders received full allotment despite over-subscription.\n\nInstitutional shareholders under the Bookbuild were pro-rated as a result of the over-subscription. 114,938 new Central Securities Clearing System (CSCS) accounts were created representing new market participants. Approximately 76percent of successful applicants via digital platform are women, and 85percent are under age 40.\n\nThe Offer was oversubscribed with valid applications for a total of 801.97 million units, leading to the activation of the approved 15percent over-subscription clause of an additional 86.25 million MTN Nigeria shares.\n\nIn all, 661.25 million MTN Nigeria shares were allotted. A total of 126,720 retail investors submitted valid applications and received full allotment; and institutional investors including pension funds, insurance companies, asset managers, corporates, and foreign portfolio investors that participated in the bookbuild were allotted 72.09percent of their applications.\n\nThis includes Nigerian pension funds representing approximately 6.5 million Nigerian contributors.\n\nFollowing the successful completion of the Offer, MTN Group\u2019s shareholding in MTN Nigeria reduced by 3.25 percentage points, from 78.83percent to 75.58percent.\n\nIn line with the innovative incentive structure of 1 free share for every 20 purchased, subject to a maximum of 250 free shares per investor, an additional 4.28 million MTN Nigeria shares will be allotted to qualifying investors who hold the shares allotted to them for 12 months till 31 January 2023.\n\nRead also: MTN rallies on Nigeria mobile money surge\n\nMTN Group adopted a unique structure in this offering by determining a fixed price of N169 per share for the retail offer through a Bookbuild to Qualified Investors that was completed on 26 November 2021. The fixed price offer to Retail Investors was at a discount of 11percent to the closing price of MTN Nigeria stock on the day the Bookbuild was completed.\n\nThe Offer commenced on December 1, 2021 and was completed on December 14, 2021. Nigerian investors across the country supported the Offer through multiple channels \u2013 Receiving Agents, Issuing Houses and PrimaryOffer (a digital application platform).\n\nThe Offer is a landmark transaction and a true reflection of Nigerian investor confidence in MTN Nigeria. It marks the first time a digital application platform was used to democratize investing in a public offer and maximize investor participation across the country. More than 89% of retail offer subscribers applied through the PrimaryOffer platform (mobile and web), and 114,938 new Central Securities Clearing System (CSCS) accounts were opened by first-time investors.\n\nRalph Mupita, CEO of MTN Group said: \u201cWe are pleased that this Offer has given so many Nigerians the opportunity to become owners of MTN Nigeria.

We thank the Nigerian authorities for their support of this Offer. We remain committed to playing our humble role in driving digital and financial inclusion in Nigeria over the medium.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the Offer, Karl Toriola, CEO of MTN Nigeria said: \u201cWe are delighted to welcome so many new shareholders to the MTN family, up 11.6 times from the number before the offer. It has been inspiring to see so many Nigerians, many of whom are young, acquire shares for the first time, and use a digital platform to do so. This is the beginning of a journey to broaden our shareholding and there will be more opportunities to participate.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased with the level of digital innovation we championed with this offer with the active collaboration of our lead issuing house and the various regulatory bodies. Deepening retail participation in Nigeria\u2019s capital markets is a process, and we are off to a great start, demonstrating the role digital platforms can play in expanding access. I am particularly pleased that we completed this transaction in an accelerated time frame ensuring new shareholders can realize value almost immediately through participation in our 2021 full-year dividend.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would specifically like to thank the Honorable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Ibrahim (Pantami), the Nigerian Communications Commission and the wider Federal Government for the opportunity to execute this Offer.

Over 90percent of subscribers to the Offer were first time participants in the capital markets and MTN Nigeria\u2019s strong investment case made this possible.\u201d\n\nNigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) CEO, Temi Popoola, CFA said: \u201cNGX is proud to have worked with MTN Nigeria, Chapel Hill Denham and other parties to the transaction in advancing Nigeria\u2019s capital market through the adoption of forward-looking technology.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s low-interest rate environment has created an opportunity for corporates in the telecommunication, agric, oil and gas, manufacturing, financial services, among other industries to tap the debt capital market for cheap funds through commercial paper (CP) issuance.\n\nSixteen companies issued over N339.68 billion worth of commercial papers in the 12 months to December 2021, as compiled from data by FMDQ.\n\nThe top five gainers that tapped Nigeria\u2019s low-interest rate environment for cheap funds last year include Coronation Merchant Bank, MTN Nigeria, Dangote Cement plc, Union Bank of Nigeria, and United Capital plc.\n\nThe funds raised by the corporates accounted for 72.309 percent of the total CP that was raised in the review period. The companies issued a combined N245.62 billion worth of CP.\n\n\u201cAn era of low-interest rate is the best time for companies to restructure their debt and access lower finance cost to grow their bottom line,\u201d Yinka Ademuwagun, investment management analyst at ValuAlliance Asset Management, states.\n\nCompared to two years ago when the interest rate was at a record high of over 15 percent, the current single-digit interest rate means lower financing costs for corporates that are borrowing to finance their operations.\n\nAnalysis of the FMDQ data shows that the 16 companies that issued the CP in the review period did so at an average of 10.03 percent, 6.97 percentage points less than the average inflation rate of 17 percent reported in 2021.\n\nIf the companies were to go to the banks to borrow the kind of funds they raised through CP, they would have paid at least 15 percent interest. That is even because they are big institutions. If it were smaller companies, they probably would have obtained the funds at an interest rate of between 18 and 20 percent or more.\n\nMeanwhile, the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), the benchmark against which other lending rates in the economy are pegged, is currently at 11.5 percent. The apex bank has consistently retained the same rate since September 2020.\n\nAlso known as an unsecured short-term debt instrument issued by large corporations to raise funds to meet short-term financial obligations, CPs are issued within a short period, usually between 15 and 270 days. While CPs are issued by companies, Treasury bills are issued by the government.\n\nYields on the government Treasury Bills (T-Bills), the benchmark for determining the interest rate corporates pay investors for borrowing their money, remained relatively low in 2021.\n\nAfter crashing to a four-year low of near-zero percent in 2020, yields on the Federal Government risk-free Treasury bill jumped to a more than 17-month high of 9.75 percent on May 14. The rate, however, plunged to an 11-month low of 4.9 percent at the last auction of 2021, as compiled from Nigerian treasury bills primary market auction results for December 29, 2021, an opportunity for both government and corporates as they raised capital at a lower cost.\n\nCPs are issued at a higher interest rate than T-Bills because of the absence of the full faith of the Federal Government.\n\nInterest rates, according to research analysts at Agusto & Co., will remain low in 2022 \u201cbecause we have an accommodating CBN willing to help the FGN borrow from the markets at rates below inflation.\u201d\n\nRead also: No worries over capital flight \u2013 CBN\n\nWhile the low-interest-rate environment in Nigeria\u2019s debt market has been a boon for large corporates who are raising capital at cheaper rates compared with bank loans, micro and small businesses, which form the bulk of firms in the country, are left out.\n\nLack of proper documentation and inability to meet listing requirements are some of the reasons Nigerian small businesses are unable to tap the low-interest rate opportunity.\n\nBreakdown of the data by FMDQ shows that FSDH Merchant Bank raised N12 billion under its various CP Issuance Programme in 2021. The lender also floated N19.6 billion and FSDH Funding SPV plc, a special purpose vehicle set up to raise capital from the Nigerian debt capital market.\n\nOther corporates that also tapped the Nigerian capital market in 2021 include Total Nigeria, (N15bn); Mixa Real Estate, (N13.36bn); Valency Agro Nigeria, (N12.36bn); FBNQuest Merchant Bank Limited, (N7.34bn); Nigerian Breweries, (N4.66bn); Prima Corporation Limited, (N3.57bn); Eunisell Limited, (N3.50bn); DLM Capital Group Limited, (N2.25bn), while TrustBanc Holdings Limited, (N0.20bn).",

That is why I personally appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari when it became clear that he was in the process of creating six more colleges of education. For us, we were very specific that we wanted a college of education that will train teachers in technical subjects because that aligns with our plans as a government.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to retool the educational system of this country and Edo State.

The children being produced from our basic educational system today, in terms of literacy, almost peer with their mates globally and the records are there.\u201d\n\nAssuring the NCCE delegation on the government\u2019s commitment to ensure the school kicks off academic activities despite the antics of some detractors, Obaseki noted, \u201cThat school was shut down five years ago; it was shut down for us to start a university. The same trouble that led to the shutdown of that school is what they are trying to make with this new one. They frustrated the school for making progress and they want to frustrate this school too from making progress.\n\n\u201cThey are claiming what they didn\u2019t work for because we have set up our own state college of education. When we built our own school, they said we should absorb them into our new school.\n\n\u201cDuring my reelection, they were acting as active politicians, but we cannot sacrifice the future of our children for their selfish gains. They claimed that we owe them, but it is not true. Till tomorrow, they cannot give you the evidence of the school fees they have collected, but we can show you the evidence of subversions we have put in the school.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThey have tried to go to court; they\u2019ve done a lot of publications, and now it\u2019s just blackmailing and as a government, we won\u2019t subject ourselves to blackmails. Even yesterday, they wrote me a letter of apology. But they\u2019ve gone back, front, left, right, and centre. But as a government, we remain focused. We know where we are going and if they have legitimate claims by now they would have gone to court to get court orders.\n\n\u201cWhy have they not opted for that option? Why are they going to barricade the road and embarrass people who want to inspect the facilities? For us, I think this is a politically-motivated action and I don\u2019t think it has a legal basis to stop what we want to do.\n\n\u201cIf they feel they\u2019ve been disenfranchised; they should go to court. We, as a government, will always obey court orders. So, whatever cooperation you need from me, we will give you. We\u2019ve fought tough political battles; hence, this one is a joke. We\u2019ve brought godfathers down and if the godfathers have gone back to mobilize them, they are just joking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t stop the education and future of our children. We will provide whatever support and cooperation that the federal government needs to ensure that this school can be opened to enable us to begin to train our teachers,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the Secretary of NCCE, Prof. Paulinus Okwelle, expressed appreciation to the governor for providing infrastructure for the take-off of the school.\n\nHe added: \u201cOnce again, we congratulate you for attracting this new federal institution to Edo. In 2019, President Buhari approved six colleges of education in each zone and the one in Ekiadolor to serve the South-South. We\u2019ve gone round the site of the college and discovered a lot of good things and we must appreciate your efforts.\u201d.\n\n...",

Barbed wire topped fences are everywhere, surrounding the buildings and even one of the compound\u2019s basketball courts.\n\nThe compound is home to some of the more than 300,000 migrant workers who live and work in Singapore, but even as the island eases some coronavirus restrictions to allow the fully vaccinated to travel again, the people here and in the city-state\u2019s many other worker dormitories have no such freedoms.\n\n\u201cIt gives us an inferiority complex because before COVID-19 we could go outside, use transport, do everything, we never thought that we were overseas workers,\u201d said 36-year-old Narayan, who comes from Bangladesh and works in construction.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cNow we cannot go outside and now we remember that we are overseas workers. It is not normal life,\u201d said Narayan, who requested anonymity for fear of losing his job.\n\nFor two years, workers like Narayan have been living under strict COVID-19 controls.\n\nThe only time they leave their dormitory compounds is to go to work. If they want to visit the recreation centres set up for them nearby, they must use a phone app to apply for an exit pass, which enables them to leave the dorm.\n\nA maximum of 3,000 fully vaccinated workers are allowed out into the wider community each weekday, with double that number able to visit public places on weekends and holidays. Most of the men work six days a week.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSuch a controlled existence is in stark contrast to the lives of other Singapore residents for whom life is finally returning to some sort of normality as the country moves towards \u201cliving with COVID-19\u201d.\n\nNarayan, who has been in Singapore for almost 10 years, is growing increasingly frustrated by the restrictions on his life.\n\n\u201cWe (the workers) hope the government can think about us. We are human. We cannot stay in the dormitories for so long. Especially for our mental health, it is not normal life.\u201d\n\nWhen COVID-19 first arrived in Singapore some two years ago, the government managed to keep control of the situation through a meticulous contact tracing system. The country stayed open, with just relatively minor restrictions imposed.\n\nBut once cases began to emerge among migrant workers, the virus tore through their cramped accommodation.\n\n\u201cDue to their in-dormitory living conditions which do not allow much room for proper isolation, dormitory-dwelling migrant workers would be more susceptible to infectious diseases,\u201d Michael Cheah, Executive Director of HealthServe, a non-profit group that provides medical care to workers, told Al Jazeera.\n\nMany of the men work as manual labourers in the kind of physically demanding jobs that Singaporeans prefer not to do.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe government does not provide a breakdown of their nationalities, but most come from South Asia.\n\n\u201cWhen the pandemic hit in the first year, migrant workers had accounted for almost 90 percent of the confirmed cases in Singapore. This led to dormitory lockdowns and prolonged movement restrictions for the disadvantaged group,\u201d said Cheah.\n\nThe first full dormitory lockdowns were imposed in April 2020. Workers were instructed to stay in their dorms and warned against mixing with other workers in common areas.\n\nAt the time, the island itself was in what the government called a \u201ccircuit-breaker\u201d lockdown, but since then, the divide between the workers inside, and the rest of the community outside, has been impossible to ignore.\n\nMigrant workers are almost entirely cut off from the general public. They are transported around Singapore in the back of lorries and are often only seen at the entrances of building sites or preparing to work on the roads late at night.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any difference between a person living in a jail and me. I feel isolated because of the COVID rules and I feel very sad about the difference in the lives between me and the rest of the people,\u201d said 30-year-old labourer Mohammed, who also spoke under condition of anonymity.",

Most of the men work six days a week.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSuch a controlled existence is in stark contrast to the lives of other Singapore residents for whom life is finally returning to some sort of normality as the country moves towards \u201cliving with COVID-19\u201d.\n\nNarayan, who has been in Singapore for almost 10 years, is growing increasingly frustrated by the restrictions on his life.\n\n\u201cWe (the workers) hope the government can think about us. We are human. We cannot stay in the dormitories for so long. Especially for our mental health, it is not normal life.\u201d\n\nWhen COVID-19 first arrived in Singapore some two years ago, the government managed to keep control of the situation through a meticulous contact tracing system. The country stayed open, with just relatively minor restrictions imposed.\n\nBut once cases began to emerge among migrant workers, the virus tore through their cramped accommodation.\n\n\u201cDue to their in-dormitory living conditions which do not allow much room for proper isolation, dormitory-dwelling migrant workers would be more susceptible to infectious diseases,\u201d Michael Cheah, Executive Director of HealthServe, a non-profit group that provides medical care to workers, told Al Jazeera.\n\nMany of the men work as manual labourers in the kind of physically demanding jobs that Singaporeans prefer not to do.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe government does not provide a breakdown of their nationalities, but most come from South Asia.\n\n\u201cWhen the pandemic hit in the first year, migrant workers had accounted for almost 90 percent of the confirmed cases in Singapore. This led to dormitory lockdowns and prolonged movement restrictions for the disadvantaged group,\u201d said Cheah.\n\nThe first full dormitory lockdowns were imposed in April 2020. Workers were instructed to stay in their dorms and warned against mixing with other workers in common areas.\n\nAt the time, the island itself was in what the government called a \u201ccircuit-breaker\u201d lockdown, but since then, the divide between the workers inside, and the rest of the community outside, has been impossible to ignore.\n\nMigrant workers are almost entirely cut off from the general public. They are transported around Singapore in the back of lorries and are often only seen at the entrances of building sites or preparing to work on the roads late at night.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any difference between a person living in a jail and me. I feel isolated because of the COVID rules and I feel very sad about the difference in the lives between me and the rest of the people,\u201d said 30-year-old labourer Mohammed, who also spoke under condition of anonymity.",

I asked to have a private conversation with His Excellency. During that conversation, I informed his Excellency that once I get back to the United Kingdom, I will go to Dubai and take over the house. He subsequently departed for his medical trip to Germany refusing to address any of the issues I privately wanted to conclude with him outside of third parties\u201d, Jennifer wrote in a long statement on their acrimonious divorce .\n\n\u201cI subsequently travelled to Dubai, and took custody of the said property. Once I did that, on 18 September 2021, His Excellency sent me a text and I quote: \u201cI hear you have moved to Dubai to take over the house. I am still in Germany for my medicals. Make sure all my properties including (redacted) are intact so I can collect all my properties. I wish you well\u2019.\n\n\u201cI responded to him: \u201c Excellency, I am left with no other option as we need to get on with our lives amicably. I hope your medicals are coming up good. I wish you well too\u2019\u201d.\n\nAtiku, who is 75 years old, still nurses the ambition to be Nigeria\u2019s president.\n\nHis first effort was in 1993, some years after he retired from the Nigeria Customs Service.\n\nHe is among the major contenders in the 2023 race and that will be his fourth bid for the nation\u2019s highest position.\n\nAdamawa born Atiku was vice-president of Nigeria between 1999 and 2007.\n\nHe contested to be president in 2007, his second attempt and failed.\n\nHis other attempts in 2011, 2015 also failed at the primary level.\n\nHis major bid was in the 2019 election, which he lost by a wide margin to the incumbent Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHis medical has not usually been in the public arena.\n\nIn December 2015, Abubakar was reportedly in Dubai for medical treatment. He is known to have sought several medical help in the city, which he has made a second home.\n\nHe also took his COVID-19 jabs in Dubai.\n\nHis Germany medical trip was unknown until the release of Jennifer Douglas\u2019s statement today.",

We are aware that the taxes and levies under the responsibilities of the FIRS are income tax, personal income tax, capital gain tax, VAT and so on.\n\n\u201cHowever, the amendment is so wide and open that we in the Nigerian Customs Service took it that it had hindered our ability to collect levies and other collections.\n\n\u201cOur understanding of the provisions is that all other laws which mandated us to collect are inconsistent with the new Act, then they are voided. This means that the law that mandates us to collect as revenue generating agencies, are voided completely. This means that we do not have the responsibilities to collect levies. If we don\u2019t have the responsibilities to collect, what are we going to discuss here.\n\n\u201cWe have consulted with lawyers and the conclusion is that the Act is confusing and if other revenue generating agencies decided to act on the provisions, they may decide not to collect and levies,\u201d Ali said.\n\nIn a similar submission, Director Finance Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) Professor Aba George said the N400 billion the agency supposed to be generating as revenue on yearly basis was being cornered by a UK-based firm handling most of its outsourced services and operations.\n\nHe said contract on the outsourced services and operations given to the UK- based firm on behalf of the NIS in 2003, gives government 33% of proceeds, Immigration 7% while the remaining 60% is cornered by the firm.\n\n\u201cThis is our 7th time of tabling this complaint before the Senate or the House of Representatives. Please rescue us from the hook of this firm.\n\n\u201cThe contract was entered into without the knowledge of Immigration since 2003 and those behind it keep on renewing it and denying us about N400 billion revenue on yearly basis.\n\n\u201cIt is a rip-off and purely one sided contract bleeding Immigration and Nigeria financially on yearly basis \u201c, George lamented.\n\nSenate intervenes\n\nIrked by the submission, Senate President Ahmad Lawan directed the Committee Chairman, Senator Olamilekan Adeola (APC Lagos West), to summon the Ministry of Interior for all the contract documents.\n\n\u201cThis is unacceptable. We cannot continue like this. We must see the end of this contract in the national interest,\u201d he said.\n\nOn complaints made by the Customs boss, Lawan said: \u201cI wonder why the Ministry of Finance is not here because we need their intervention now. Their presence here would have provided some clarifications. We took it for granted that since it was an executive bill, that there were some engagements among the agencies of the federal government.\n\n\u201cWe also called for public hearing so that we could x-ray it. You are saying that you don\u2019t have the legal mandate to collect taxes and it is a scary revelation.\n\n\u201cThe Senate Committee on Finance and the Ministry of Finance and other agencies would look at the Act. If it is established beyond reasonable doubts that we need to amend it, we will do so without delay.\n\n\u201cIt will be the fastest amendment because we need you to collect more monies for the federal government.\u201d\n\nIn his own intervention, Senator Adeola said the section cited by the Customs boss was not targeted at the agency.\n\n\u201cWhat necessitated that singular act was as a result of the issue between the Revenue Mobilisation and Fiscal Commission and the FIRS. There were clashes between them from time to time. Some activities of RMFAC were not in tandem with the Act that established it. We discovered that the only way that we can make their roles explicit is through the Finance Act concerning the assessment and accounting of taxes.\n\n\u201cWe discovered that RMFAC are going to agencies to audit their tax accounts which is not part of their responsibilities based on the law that established RMFAC.\n\n\u201cThe only agencies saddled with that responsibility is the FIRS. That was what that law tends to address. We are ready to look into it again if other revenue generating agencies believe that it has hindered them from performing their responsibilities and we would amend it accordingly,\u201d Adeola said.\n\nNASS sets N3trn target\n\nEarlier, Senate President Lawan said the revenue generating agencies of government were capable of generating and remitting N3 trillion naira annually to the coffers of the federal government if efforts were made to cut down on wasteful spending.\n\nLawan made this known in an address delivered to declare open an interactive session \u201con the need to improve internally generated revenue of the Federal Government of Nigeria and Revenue Projections of the Agencies as Contained in the Appropriation Act 2022.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was between the Senate leadership and members of the committee on finance and revenue generating agencies of government.\n\nIn his speech, Lawan said the purpose of the meeting was to explore means of increasing government revenues.\n\nHe said one of such ways was for the National Assembly to be rigid on increased revenue to cut down on the country\u2019s budget deficit and borrowings, as well as prevent wasteful expenditures by agencies of government.\n\nLawan assured that the upper chamber would provide the needed support through legislation to ensure revenue agencies perform to meet and surpass their targets.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn 2022, the National Assembly assumed and rightly so, that our government owned enterprises can generate up to N3 trillion if we are of the mindset that we can achieve that and, of course, ensure that we oversight to stall any possibility of unwarranted expenditures by agencies of government.\n\n\u201cBut that does not mean in any way that it is going to be some kind of investigation on what you do, but an encouragement of what you need to do. In this meeting and subsequent ones, there should be no holds barred on discussions.\n\n\u201cWhere an agency feels it is encumbered in any way from achieving its target, it should say so, so that we are able to prescribe the right solutions for it to perform. As a National Assembly, let me say that the Senate particularly will be stiff on generating more and more revenue.\n\n\u201cWe will be rigid; we will continue to insist, because we believe that this is one sure and guaranteed way of reducing our deficit and borrowing.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker said the drive by the upper chamber for more revenues to the coffers of government would enhance the economy and facilitate infrastructural development.\n\n\u201cThis Committee is modified, because the leaders of the Senate believe that we can do far better and we have seen signs when last year some of the agencies performed beyond expectation.\n\n\u201cSo, it is an opportunity for us to save and enhance our economy and, of course, make Nigeria achieve more infrastructural development which is the goal of this administration and every Nigerian.\n\n\u201cWe believe that when you (revenue agencies) generate the money, we (National Assembly) appropriate it. Prudence is of essence here, when we spend our money. And when we borrow, like the National Assembly has always tried to do, we borrow to treat specific projects and programmes of government\u201d, the Senate President said.\n\nAnd in his welcome address, the committee chairman, Senator Adeola, lamented the insufficient funds for the implementation of policies and projects captured in the 2022 Budget of the federal government.\n\nHe explained that the funds were derived partly from the revenue generated by the government owned enterprises and other independent revenue sources of the federal government.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need for all hands to be on deck on revenue generation for government, as well as prevent misuse and leakages of such revenue for frivolous purposes not sanctioned by the laws of the National Assembly,\u201d Adeola said.\n\nHe advised that for government to reduce and eliminate deficit budgeting associated with the nation\u2019s budget over the years, effort must be made to minimise borrowing to fund projects.\n\nAttendees\n\nRevenue agencies present at the interactive session include: National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure, the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), National Steel Raw Materials Exploration Agency, Nigerian Postal Service, Lagos University Teaching Hospital, and Nigeria Customs Service.\n\nOthers were the Nigeria Immigration Service, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Nigeria Prisons Service, Maritime Academy of Nigeria, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), and Abuja Geographic Information Systems (AGIS).\n\nAlso present were the Federal Capital Territory Administration, Energy Commission of Nigerians, Administrative Staff College of Nigeria, Nigerian Export Import Bank (NEXIM), Nigerian Ports Authority and the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology, Zaria.\n\n",

          "text": "The House of Representatives has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to comply with a provision of the 2022 Appropriation Act, which gives express permission to Nigeria\u2019s embassies to spend their capital votes in order to speed up foreign operations without seeking the approval of the Ministry.\n\nThis was made known at a meeting on Monday between the Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, and officials of the ministry led by the Minister, Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama, accompanied by the Permanent Secretary Gabriel Aduda and senior directors from the ministry.\n\nAlso in attendance were the Chairman, House Committee on Appropriation, Rep. Mukhtar Betara, and the Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Rep. Yusuf Buba Yakubu.\n\nThe House said compliance with the law was not negotiable until a possible amendment was passed by the National Assembly.\n\nGbajabiamila had convened the meeting on the heels of the discovery by the House that the ministry had issued letters to the embassies instructing them not to spend any money not approved by the ministry, a directive the House termed an \u201caffront\u201d to the Appropriation Act.\n\nSpeaking shortly after the meeting, the Speaker described the ministry\u2019s directive as \u201cillegal and unconstitutional\u201d, insisting that it was in the interest of the image of Nigeria and the ministry to allow the embassies to spend their votes to reverse the state of dilapidation of the country\u2019s foreign missions.\n\nBefore the National Assembly inserted the clause into the Act, the tradition was that embassies would not spend a dime until they got the approval of the ministry.\n\nHowever, the legislature following a series of investigations, uncovered that there were not only delays in getting such approvals but also embassies were increasingly starved of operational funds.\n\nThe Speaker noted that it was painful that some embassy buildings had not been renovated for years, while some ambassadors could only make do with cars that break down often.\n\n\u201cSo, we made this law and inserted a clause to remove the bureautic red-tapism that makes funding not to get to these people.\n\n\u201cThere is no point appropriating money and the money is not reaching the embassies\u201d, Gbajabiamila added.\n\nThe Speaker assured the ministry\u2019s officials that the House could quickly amend the Act if doing so would simplify other due process requirements the ministry might have.\n\nHe stressed that while an amendment was being awaited, the Act assigned by President Muhammadu Buhari, remained in force.\n\nSpeaking earlier, Onyeama said the ministry was happy to honour the invitation to the meeting because it believed both the National Assembly and the ministry worked for the common interest of Nigeria and Nigerians.\n\nHe stated that the ministry would cooperate with the House by supporting any interventions that would improve the operations of foreign missions, especially on how to address the general underfunding of the embassies.",

Mukhtar Betara, and the Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Rep. Yusuf Buba Yakubu.\nThe House said compliance with the law was not negotiable until a possible amendment was passed by the National Assembly.\nBefore the National Assembly inserted the clause into the Act, the tradition was that embassies would not spend a dime until they got the approval of the ministry.\n\u201cThere is no point appropriating money and the money is not reaching the embassies\u201d, Gbajabiamila added.",

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited on Monday gave an account of how it has positioned itself to lead Africa in energy transition.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer and Group Managing Director, Malam Mele Kyari disclosed this while delivering the 30th Convocation Lecture of the Federal University of Technology, Minna, Niger State, at the university\u2019s auditorium.\n\nKyari spoke on the topic: \u201cEnergy Transition & Energy Accessibility \u2013 The New Paradigm.\u201d\n\nThe NNPC CEO also advised industrialised nations not to put Africa in the same energy transition speed because it could spark energy crisis.\n\n\u201cPutting every country in the same energy transition speed could therefore result in unanticipated collateral damage that can spark energy crisis and deny developing countries access to available and cheaper energy for growth,\u201d a statement from the Group General Manager/Group Public Affairs Division, NNPC, Garba Deen Muhammad, quoted Kyari to have said.\n\nExplaining the company\u2019s strategy for a smooth and realistic energy transition, the CEO said the NNPC had set the necessary machineries in motion to lead Africa in transition to low-carbon energy and renewables.\n\nHe noted that the company was deepening natural gas utilisation under the National Gas Expansion Programme (NGEP).\n\nAccording to him, the NNPC was also extending natural gas infrastructure backbone from Ajoakuta in Kogi state to Kano through Abuja and Kaduna under the AKK Gas Pipeline Project.\n\nBesides, he said this mega pipeline would be fed by both Escravos-Lagos Pipeline System (ELPS) and the Obiafu-Obrikom-Oben (OB3) gas pipelines through Oben node in Edo state and deliver 2bscf of natural gas to power plants and industrial off-takers along Abuja, Kaduna and Kano.\n\nContinuing, he said as a national oil company and a global player, the NNPC was ready to shift to renewable energy.\n\nThe GMD dropped the hint that \u201cWe are taking firm position in this transition by institutionalising the necessary enablers for success.\n\n\u201cNNPC has established a Renewable Energy Division and has completely transformed the NNPC R&D Division to NNPC Research, Technology and Innovation as Energy Company of Global Excellence,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said NNPC welcomes beneficial relationship with academia and industry experts who demonstrate capacity for productive research and innovation in the energy sector.\n\nAccording to him, oil would remain very much relevant in the global energy mix of today and the future.\n\nKyari however noted that as transition to cheaper energy gains momentum, especially across the developed countries, oil companies must continuously improve operational efficiency and reduce their costs to remain on the playground.\n\nEarlier in the presentation, he said Africa was endowed with abundant sunshine that can support massive development of renewable energy enough to put Africa on the map of energy sufficient regions of the world.\n\nKyari said attaining this vision would require substantial finance which may have to come from diverse sources globally.\n\nConsidering the financial stretch required to transit at the same pace with the rest of the world, Kyari said, \u201cwhat Africa needs is energy transition that addresses energy poverty across the continent and supports the use of comparative and cheaper available energy resources in Africa.\u201d\n\nHe said this would guarantee affordable and reliable energy for rapid industrialisation and improvement in the economic well-being of the people.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos",

          "text": "The National Assembly on Monday transmitted the reworked 2022 Electoral Act Amendment Bill to President Muhammadu Buhari for assent. Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (Senate), Senator Babajide Omoworare, disclosed this in a one-page statement, titled, \u201cTransmission of the Electoral Bill 2022.\u201d\n\nOmoworare stated that the Clerk to the National Assembly, Mr Olatunde Moses Ojo, had transmitted authentic copies of the bill to the president. He stressed that this was in accordance with the provisions of Section 58 (3) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) and the Acts Authentication Act Cap. A2 LFN 2004.\n\nThe release read in part, \u201cThe Clerk to the National Assembly Mr. Olatunde Amos Ojo, has transmitted the authenticated copies of the Electoral Bill 2022 to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, on 31st January 2022.\n\n\u201cThis was done in accordance with the provisions of Section 58 (3) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) and the Acts Authentication Act Cap. A2 LFN 2004.\n\n\u201cMr. President had withheld assent to the Electoral Bill 2021 transmitted to him on 19th November 2021. The Electoral Bill was thereafter reworked by the National Assembly and both the Senate and the House of Representatives passed same on 25th January 2022.\u201d\n\nThe National Assembly had last Tuesday passed the harmonised version of Clause 84 of the 2010 Electoral Act (amendment) Bill 2022, which allows political parties\u2019 to adopt three modes of primaries. The bill earlier passed last year, was not assented to by Buhari, who cited the provisions of Clause 84 that made direct primary compulsory for all political parties in electing their candidates for elections.\n\nThe two chambers of the National Assembly then recommitted the bill for fresh legislation and added other options, as advised by the president.\n\nThe harmonised version now accommodates direct, indirect, and consensus modes of primary election.\n\nThe senate had earlier passed the three modes of primary, but the House of Representatives version did not include the consensus arrangement. The red chamber considered the harmonised version of the bill at plenary and passed the proposed legislation.\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan said the bill had given sufficient and clear definitions to the modes of primary elections now adopted by both chambers of the National Assembly.\n\nThe re-amendment was sequel to a motion on, \u201cRescission on Clause 84 of the Electoral Act No. 26 2010 (Amendment) Bill, 2022 and Committal to the Committee of the Whole.\u201d The motion was sponsored by Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi (Kebbi North).\n\nThe amended bill provides in Clause 84 (2), \u201cThe procedure for the nomination of candidates by political parties for the various elective positions shall be by direct, indirect primaries or Consensus.\u201d\n\nIt adds in 84(3), \u201cA political party shall not impose nomination qualification or disqualification criteria, measures, or conditions on any aspirant or candidate for any election in its constitution, guidelines, or rules for nomination of candidates for elections, except as prescribed under sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 177 and 187 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended).\u201d\n\nOn Direct Primaries in 84 (4), the amended version provides, \u201cA political party that adopts the direct primaries procedure shall ensure that all aspirants are given equal opportunity of being voted for by members of the party and shall adopt the procedure outlined below:\n\n\u201c(a) In the case of Presidential Primaries, all registered members of the party shall vote for aspirants of their choice at a designated centre at each ward of the Federation.\n\n\u201c(b) The procedure in paragraph (a) above of this subsection shall be adopted for direct primaries in respect of Gubernatorial, Senatorial, Federal and State Constituencies.\u201d\n\nOn Indirect Primaries, the bill provides under 84(5), \u201cA political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall adopt the procedure outlined below:\n\n\u201c(a) In the case of nominations to the position of Presidential candidate, the political party shall \u2013 (i) hold a Special Presidential Convention at a designated centre in the Federal Capital Territory or any other place within the Federation that is agreed to by the National Executive Committee of the party where delegates shall vote for aspirants of their choice.\n\n\u201c(ii) the aspirant with the highest number of votes cast at the end of voting shall be declared the winner of the Presidential primaries of the political party and that aspirant\u2019s name shall be forwarded to the Commission as the candidate of the party.\u201d\n\nOn Consensus Candidate the bill in 84(9)(a) provides, \u201cA political party that adopts a consensus candidate shall secure the written consent of all cleared aspirants for the position, indicating their voluntary withdrawal from the race and their endorsement of the consensus candidate.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye and Sunday Aborisade in Abuja",
