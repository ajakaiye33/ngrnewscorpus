          "text": "The Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), has said that an out-of-court settlement and political solution cannot be ruled out to resolve the ongoing legal tussle between the Federal Inland Revenue Service and some state governments over the collection of Value Added Tax.\n\nMalami stated this on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Politics Today\u2019 programme on Sunday which was monitored by our correspondent.\n\nMalami\u2019s comments came barely days after the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, noted that efforts were ongoing on the issue but she did not give details as the matter was subjudice.\n\nAhmed, in an interview on Thursday night, had said though she was \u201cnot supposed to be talking about issues in court but I do hope that this problem can be solved by sitting on the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of efforts going on right now. As I said, I don\u2019t want to discuss it because it\u2019s in court so I have to be careful. But there will be a positive political solution. We are working towards an out-of-court solution,\u201d she had explained.\n\nWhen asked on Sunday night whether there was any possibility for a political solution or an out-of-court settlement for the VAT battle between the FIRS and some state governments, the AGF replied, \u201cSuch consideration is not rightly on table but as I rightly stated, you cannot rule out any possibility.\n\n\u201cBut as far as we are concerned in the Officer of the Attorney General, there exists judicial proceedings going on and within the context of that proceedings, we will address it squarely but if there is need for further engagement in line and in tune with the tradition of engagement, both judicial and otherwise, such possibility cannot be ruled out.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, had on August 9 ruled that Rivers State and not the FIRS should be the authority collecting VAT and Personal Income Tax in the state.\n\nThe FIRS then approached the Court of Appeal in Abuja to challenge the judgement. It also wrote to the Senate to seek the inclusion of VAT collection in the exclusive legislative list.\n\nFollowing the failure of the FIRS to obtain a stay of execution it sought from the appellate court to prevent the state government from enforcing the verdict, the Rivers State Government enacted a law to empower the state to collect VAT. The governor, Nyesom Wike, signed the bill into law on August 19.\n\nLagos State, whose request for joinder as a respondent in the suit before the Court of Appeal was also granted by the court, also enacted its own VAT law. The governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, signed the bill into law on September 10.\n\nMeanwhile, after approving Lagos State\u2019s request for joinder as a party at the Court of Appeal, ordered all parties to maintain the status quo on the matter, a ruling the Rivers State Government had approached the Supreme Court to set aside.\n\nThe Court of Appeal also directed that the matter be moved from Abuja to its Port Harcourt Division for further hearing. The court has yet to decide on the substantive suit as of the time of filing this report.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Will abp become another disaster like Peoples Bank?",
          "text": "By Dele Sobowale\n\n\u201cHistory does not repeat itself; man does.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Barbara Tuchmann, Harvard University historian\n\nTuchmann was a leading expert on the 13th and 14th centuries of European history during which people and leaders in various places and at different times made the same mistakes resulting in hardships for ordinary citizens. But, of all the blunders committed, the most pathetic are those based on the good intentions while forgetting that \u201cthe road to hell is paved with good intentions\u201d.\n\nABP: Farmers owe CBN N463bn as defaults rise.\u201d \u2014 News Report, November 2021.\n\nThe Nigerian policy framers who created the Anchor Borrowers Programme, ABP in November 2015 and those who introduced the Peoples Bank of Nigeria, PBN, in 1990 were alike in more ways than most people realised.\n\nThe two, Presidents, Generals Babangida and Buhari, were professional soldiers who found their ways into political leadership. The Nigerian economy was in distress when they acted. And, they operated with the same basic assumption that providing easy access to credit for millions of people, especially in rural areas, would create jobs, increase agricultural output and lift millions out of poverty at the same time. Despite the fact that PBN was more broad-based than ABP, the two leaders sincerely believed that, if provided easy loans, Nigeria\u2019s poor people would gladly repay. On the last assumption, they were both wrong; totally wrong. ABP is in trouble today because its promoters failed to learn the lessons PBN taught us about Nigeria\u2019s poor people and public money.\n\nREAD ALSOTordue Salem: We\u2019ll seek more clarifications from police \u2014Family\n\nHow Peoples Bank failed\n\n\u201cThe Decree establishes the Peoples Bank of Nigeria, to give basic credit to underprivileged Nigerians involved in legitimate economic activities charging them with a minimum interest of not more than 5 per cent.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Explanatory Notes to Peoples Bank of Nigeria, Decree 45, 1990.\n\nWhat follows is a summary of what I have already published in IBRAHIM B BABANGIDA 1985-1992: LETTING A THOUSAND FLOWERS BLOOM.\n\nMicro-credit financing originated in Bangladesh when Grameen Bank was established to give loans as small as $1 to rural women, mostly, for petty trading. It was a private bank; started very small and eventually grew big. It was run as a real bank. The PBN, which was set up to achieve the same goals as Grameen, was a government-owned bank. That was the main reason why it failed. PBN also started big; with branches in all the state capitals. That was the second reason for its collapse. Politics intruded too much into banking business.\n\nFinally, \u201cIn Bangladesh, a relatively poor country, governments had very little money for people to embezzle. \u201cIn Nigeria, anything called \u201cgovernment money\u201d inevitably induces the alley cat\u2019s instincts for fish in the people. Perhaps in the beginning the borrowers intended to pay back. But, soon the attitude that each recipient had received a share of the \u201cnational cake\u201d became prevalent.\u201d\n\nThereafter, most borrowers stopped paying back. By the time Babangida stepped aside in 1993, PBN was finished as a project. There is a lesson for the current FG and CBN in the rise and fall of PBN. As things stand right now, and, I will elaborate on that, most of the loans now overdue will never be repaid. However, before explaining why a major loss is inevitable, permit me to make a comment (or is it an appeal?); which governments should always bear in mind.\n\nAll critics are not enemies\n\n\u201cLike all God\u2019s creatures, enemies have a purpose in the world. They offer a criticism of one\u2019s conduct, albeit unsought, that is not always provided by friends.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Rosenblat, VANGUARD BOOK OF QUOTATIONS, VBQ p 48.\n\nAnd, even if the critics are enemies, a wise philosopher has reminded us what we should do with our adversaries. We should actually listen carefully to them. We might learn something that would save us and our project or reputation.\n\nFriends, subordinates, staff, political allies etc seldom tell a leader the whole truth \u2014 if they know that it will be rejected. Only God knows how many initiatives could have succeeded if only the promoter had paused to listen to those with questions to ask or suggestions to make. ABP was fundamentally flawed because it was offering \u201cgovernment money\u201d to the most risky borrowers. Let me elaborate now.\n\nABP is a pupulist idea with serial failures\n\n\u201cFor the Anchor Borrowers Programme, the sum of 615.4bn had been disbursed to 3,038,899 beneficiaries, out of which, N152.3bn was repaid.\u201d \u2014 CBN Report.\n\nThe report also acknowledged that N463bn was outstanding. Simple arithmetic tells us that only 25 per cent had been repaid; while 75 per cent of the loans disbursed is outstanding.\n\nCommonsense also tells us that the programme is in deep trouble. Experience with Nigerians and their attitudes to \u201cgovernment money\u201d will lead to a sad prediction. Most of the outstanding loans will never be recovered. Here are the reasons why.\n\nFirst, in 1992, I worked in the same office building with Peoples Bank at 200, Igbosere Road, Lagos. I was already writing for Vanguard on the Business/Economic pages. One day, there was a great deal of commotion at the bank. Other tenants were prevented from entering or going out. Late Mrs Maria Sokenu, the Managing Director of PBN was visiting the office. Soldiers and policemen were all over the place. Boldly, I stepped forward and shouted \u201cMadam, Dele Sobowale from Vanguard Media, I want to talk to you\u201d. She stopped and told her orderly \u201cLet my senior brother [that\u2019s me] come in.\u201d We went in together. The result of the interview was this. Within two years of its inception, PBN was already experiencing almost 50 per cent un-repaid loans. If it took only two years for 50 per cent of Nigerian borrowers to default in 1992, six years of ABP will result in a higher percentage of Non-Performing Loans, NPLs.\n\nToday\u2019s borrowers are the children of the dead beats of the 1990s. They are mostly chips off the old blocks of rotten wood. FG/CBN under-estimated them.\n\nSecond, while PBN\u2019s borrowers had no reason for defaulting, the current beneficiaries have several genuine or fake alibis for not paying back. Here\u2019s one.\n\nBafarawa provides the perfect excuse\n\n\u201cOur people are harvesting millet in abundance and rice, but people cannot convey the farm produce home. Whoever goes to the farm to convey the crops home will not come back alive.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Attahiru Bafawara, former Sokoto State Governor. November 10, 2021.\n\nWhen ABP was launched in November 2015, there were no bandits in Sokoto State or, in the entire North-West zone of Nigeria. I travelled to Sokoto several times until 2018. By then Zamfara, Katsina and Kaduna were already captured. Today, no Northern state is safe.\n\nMost likely, about 85 per cent of the ABP loans went to the North. That is where \u201cwhoever goes to the farm to convey the crops will not come back alive\u201d.\n\nUnder the prevailing circumstances, can the CBN realistically expect its money back? Can farmers abandoning harvests and running for dear lives repay loans?\n\nThe FG and CBN require Plan B; because ABP has failed miserably.",

With this increase, this will further impoverish Nigerians. It is only in the urban centres that you get meters for free.\n\nBut even at this, consumers cannot have access to the meters because the demand is far more than the supply,\u2019\u2019.\n\nOlubiyo said the Federal Government will require over N500 billion to provide meters for unmetered Nigerians.\n\nHe lamented that all efforts to get the regulator to address this latest increase has been difficult, saying similar to past increases in electricity tariff, the regulator is always evasive.\n\nThe consumer rights activist said the operations of the regulator is opaque, saying most time they are never willing to engage the public or consumers on some of its policy decision.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu, Fred Itua, Abuja and Okey Sampson, Umuahia\n\nLeader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, may soon be released if ongoing negotiations spearheaded by lawmakers from the South East and Igbo leaders pull through.\n\nIn June, Kanu was intercepted in Kenya and brought back to Nigeria for trial.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nAttorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, had revealed that the arrest followed a collaborative effort between security agencies in Nigeria and Interpol.\n\nKanu has since been rearraigned for the continuation of his trial on charges bordering on terrorism, treasonable felony, unlawful possession of firearms and management of an unlawful society.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nIn the South East, the detention of Kanu has led to a series of unrests with IPOB declaring a \u2018sit-at-home\u2019 every week since the continuation of his trial began.\n\nMalami had last week said government was open to political solution for the release of Kanu and the Yoruba nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo (Sunday Igboho).\n\nApex Igbo organizsation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo lauded government for toeing the path of dialogue and indicated readiness of Igbo leaders to meet with the government team.\n\nThis is a joint body comprising South East Council of Traditional Rulers and the representatives of Igbo Archbishops and Bishops asked the Federal Government to swiftly roll out modalities for the proposed political solution.\n\nThe joint body acknowledged the AGF\u2019s statement was in line with the proposal earlier made by the group and other well-meaning persons and groups in Nigeria.\n\nA statement by Most Rev. Anthony Obinna, Igwe Nnaemeka Achebe and Most Rev. Chibuzo Raphael Opoko also commended Kanu and the entire leadership of the IPOB for listening to their appeal and calling off the sit-at-home order. It said the action has offered some relief to the already distressed social and economic life in the region.\n\nPart of the statement said: \u201cThis body, therefore, eagerly awaits the concrete steps that would be taken in this regard.\n\n\u201cThe joint body is relieved that the Anambra State gubernatorial election was conducted without any major incidents or breach of the peace. It also commends the people of Anambra State, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the security forces, the National Peace Committee, and all the other actors who contributed to the successful conduct of the election.\n\n\u201cThe joint body is highly disturbed by the persistent complaints by the IPOB legal team about the difficulties it encounters in dealing with the Department of State Services (DSS) and, especially, the sad events which occurred during Mazi Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s appearance in court last Wednesday, November 10. This body urges the court to affirm the fundamental rights of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, his lawyers, and other stakeholders. Failure to do so would lend weight to the suspicion in some quarters of a planned secret trial, as well as neutralise all the efforts being made to establish peace in the South East.\n\n\u201cThe joint body acknowledges the roles played by various other Igbo organisations and groups in fostering peace in the South East zone and calls on all to sustain the current effort until true peace, based on justice and equity, is achieved in our land.\u201d\n\nHowever, special counsel to the IPOB leader, Aloy Ejimakor, warned that no negotiation would take place on behalf of his client without his being free.\n\n\u201cThere cannot be any negotiation while Kanu is in chains, that was the situation for other freedom fighters like Nelson Mandela of South Africa under apartheid regime.\u201d\n\nBut multiple sources told Daily Sun that selected leaders from the South East have met with heads of security agencies on the issue. One of the sources listed senators, members of the House of Representatives, governors, ministers, traditional rulers and officials of the British High Commission in Nigeria as part of a wider team meeting with relevant government agencies.\n\nHe said two important leaders would be met in the coming days for final talks on the issue that may eventually lead to the release of Kanu. He said the negotiating team has reached out to Malami and awaiting a feedback on a possible face-to-face meeting. If the meeting is successful, the minister would arrange for a final meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, who is expected to give a nod for the release of Kanu if certain conditions are met.\n\nBut the source refused to divulge details of the conditions given by government agencies already met by the negotiating team from the South East as they were too sensitive to be discussed in public.\n\nImmediate-past deputy senate president and leader of the South East caucus in the National Assembly, Ike Ekweremadu, confirmed that a political solution would be adopted. He said if ongoing negotiations with relevant government agencies pan out, Kanu could again walk free again and called on his people in the South East to allow their leaders work out a solution that would protect their interest.\n\nEkweremadu said: \u201cI believe in dialogue. For Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s situation, I don\u2019t think violence is the way. We will find and seek a political solution.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

There\u2019s very little scope for cut in any of these over the medium term.\n\n\u201cThe most viable solution to our fiscal challenge, therefore, remains to grow our revenues and plug all leakages.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Joint Tax Board, only N41 million Nigerians are in the tax pool. So, that\u2019s over 30 million Nigerians not paying their fair share (of tax). These are anonymous people, within the system, making tonnes of money. So, how do we get these people to pay their fair share?\n\n\u201cGovernments in Nigeria are not spending too much. They are actually spending too little. Fifteen percent is the public expenditure ratio to the GDP. Cutting public expenditure is not a viable option for us. The only viable solution is to fix our revenue generation.\n\n\u201cWe must all work together to fix our revenue problem. If we don\u2019t, we will then get into real problem. We all have to galvanise around that objective. If you take Nigeria\u2019s demographics, there\u2019s about 70 million people in the active population and even if you adjust for unemployment rate. It\u2019s about 70 percent\u2026\n\n\u201cThe budget is an estimate, at this point in time; of revenues and expenditure for next year.

          "text": "The Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) has received $226, 889 (N93.3 million) from the United States of America through its embassy in Nigeria, to facilitate activities aimed at strengthening the capacity of its members to understand, appreciate and deliver on their constitutionally assigned responsibility to hold government accountable to the people.\n\nIn statement issued, yesterday, by the President, Mustapha Isah and the General Secretary, Iyobosa Uwugiaren, the professional body of editors, said the capacity building would include training programmes for editors and other senior journalists on press freedom/democracy as well as town hall meetings on media regulation framework.\n\n\u201cThe project also entails printing and distribution of the Journalism Code of ethics, and strengthening of the NGE\u2019s website \u2013 news alerts on media violations.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\n\u201cThese capacity building conferences, which will hold in the six geo-political zones across the country, are to provide a platform for editors to be reminded of the sacred duties they are tasked to perform by the constitution on behalf of the citizens\u2019\u2019, the NGE stated.\n\n\u201cDrawing copious examples from the advanced democracies around the world, like US \u2013 after which the Nigerian constitution is formed, the conferences are expected to instil in the editors the need to perform their duties with the highest form of standard and sense of responsibilities.\u2019\u2019\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nThe body of all Nigerian editors hopes that a responsive and professional media will have the spin-off effect of keeping the government on their toes, holding government accountable to the citizens, securing the confidence and support of the citizens and the international community and advancing the democratic growth and consolidation.\n\nExplaining other components of the project, the statement noted that it would also strengthen NGE\u2019s website to meet up with the demands for news alerts on media violations, public feedback and complaints on allegations of malicious media reportage.\n\n\u201cThis would provide an opportunity for the Guild to strengthen its online presence to promptly disseminate current information with members and the general public, including international partners and audiences.\n\n\u201cA third component is the printing and distribution of Nigeria Journalism Code of Ethics to all journalists, including editors to popularise among editors and senior journalists the professional code of ethics that guilds their profession and have these instilled in their sub-consciousness and serve as a guiding principle.\n\n\u201cIt will also help to promote good governance, transparency and deepening of democracy through objective media practices that effectively demands accountability from those in authorities towards advancing the socio-economic well-being and rights of the people, and enrich their cultural practices, and human rights, in line with the values expected of a modern democratic state.\u201d\n\nThe NGE said at this critical point, especially as it moves towards 2023 general election, Nigeria needs a media that can help set social and political agenda in support of a better society, helping to build visions of hope, nudge Nigerians and Nigeria on the path of development, social reengineering and renaissance.\n\nOn the Town Hall meetings component of the project, the statement explained that it would provide a huge opportunity for stakeholders to assess media performance in consolidating Nigerian\u2019s democracy and outline an agenda for the future.\n\nThe NGE said it has also planned strategy meetings with Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria (NPAN), Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) and other media focused NGOs on framework for self-regulatory for Nigerian media.\n\n\u201cThis will provide a platform for media stakeholders to undertake self-introspection and develop a framework for media regulation, which will not only have their buy-in but also improve the standard for media practice in Nigeria thereby reducing, if not eliminate, incidents of sub-standard and unprofessional reportage in the Nigerian media.\n\n\u201cSuch conversations and hopefully eventual adoption of self-regulatory framework could also have a regional spin-off whereby countries within the region, and indeed Africa, could be encouraged to borrow a leaf from the Nigerian example, as was the case with the adoption of a Freedom of Information Act in Nigeria subsequently having a positive spin-off in Ghana\u2019\u2019, the NGE added.\n\nOn the expected impact of the project, the editors said that a pool of Nigerian editors and media managers will be galvanised and will be committed to the highest ethical standard and taking robust actions to ensure same. And committed to the promotion and protection of the right to independent press, freedom of expression and the deepening of democratic space.\n\nThe NGE also hoped that at the end of the project, mobilised pool of editors will be constantly projecting issue-based governance in defence of the mass of the Nigerian people in line with Section 22 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the statement, the programme looks to galvanise the key stakeholders to act responsibly and deny the authorities the moral authority to take punitive actions against the media for performing their constitutionally assigned role to hold the government to account, and to the general citizens the right to hold and voice their opinions on the conduct of public officers.\n\nThe South West conference and the Town Hall meeting holds in Lagos between December 2 and 4.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "With 559 Days to Go, Buhari on Aggressive Int\u2019l Investment Drive",
          "text": "*From Saudi Arabia, France, now South Africa, president wooing investors\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nWith 559 days to the end of his tenure, a normally reticent President Muhammadu Buhari has come out of his shell, flying from one investment summit to another in aggressive pursuit of foreign investors.\n\nNigerians are currently seeing a different Buhari who is eager to document his achievements at every stop on his international investment drive.\n\nIn France last week, when he hosted Managing Director of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), Dr. Mohammed Al-Jasser, and Chief Executive Officer of Total Energies, Patrick Pouyanne, among other global CEOs, Buhari had said, \u201cWe need roads, rail, power, airports, housing, and that is what we have engaged ourselves with in the past six years.\n\n\u201cAnd our people are seeing the new developments. Relative to the resources available to us, we have not done badly.\n\n\u201cWhat we are so dependent on (crude oil) has lost a lot of energy. It is coming back gradually, and we are breathing a bit more with some confidence. But we expect greater cooperation from you.\u201d\n\nThe president has been on an unusually aggressive investment promotion push in the past three weeks, moving from Saudi Arabia, to France and, presently, South Africa, as he markets the country\u2019s business opportunities to global investors in the quest to attract foreign direct investments (FDIs).\n\nBuhari departed Paris, the French capital, at the weekend to join other African leaders in South Africa for the opening ceremony of the second Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF) 2021. The trade expo is expected to attract $40 billion investments to the continent. The president is attending the event on the special invitation of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nThe event, holding from today to November 21, is convened by the African Export-Import Bank (AFREXIM), in collaboration with the African Union Commission (AUC) and the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat.\n\nThe fair, with the theme, \u201cBuilding Bridges for a Successful AfCFTA,\u201d is aimed at boosting trade and investment across the African continent.\n\nIt also promises to create the enabling environment for businesses to thrive across the African continent; bring to fruition the lofty ideas behind the creation of AfCFTA by providing the platform to further identify and proffer solutions to challenges militating against intra-African trade; and generate market information needed to connect buyers and sellers throughout the continent.\n\nWhile in Paris, the president took part in a one-day Nigeria International Partnership Forum, with focus on, \u201cBeyond the Pandemic,\u201d as well as the Peace Forum, both of which afforded him the opportunity to market Nigeria to the world. These investment meetings came few days after the president returned from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he also participated in a three-day investment conference organised by the Future Investment Initiative Institute.\n\nIn France, top government officials as well as captains of industry in the country discussed business opportunities in Nigeria, with participants agreeing that the country needs massive infrastructure growth to have a seat among the world\u2019s industrialised nations.\n\nSome senior government functionaries and businessmen who took part in one of the panel discussions broadcast on Arise News Channel, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, included Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Power, Aliyu Abubakar; Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva; Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Ali Pantami; and Minister of State, Transportation, Gbemisola Saraki.\n\nOthers were Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari; Chairman, BUA Group and President of the France-Nigeria Business Council, Abdul Samad Rabiu; Founder, Zenith Bank Plc, Jim Ovia; Chief Executive, Oando, Wale Tinubu; and President, African Export-Import Bank, Dr Benedict Oramah.\n\nSamad, speaking at the Nigeria International Partnership Forum, tagged \u201cBeyond the Pandemic\u201d, explained that Nigeria sat atop billions of tonnes of mineral resources. For instance, he said, the country only produced 30 million tonnes of its five billion tonnes reserves.\n\nHe stated that although opportunities abounded in the country, the dearth of infrastructure remained a big problem, explaining, for instance, that transporting a container load of products from China to Lagos is cheaper than shipping the same items from Lagos to Kano.\n\nThe BUA chief executive argued that he shut down some of the company\u2019s production plants in the country because of the lack of power supply, noting that a lot of foreign investments would be required in the sector.\n\nSamad stated, \u201cWe are sitting on billions of tonnes of different mineral resources. If you look at limestone, the area that I represent, because I have plants in Nigeria, Nigeria is sitting on over 4-5 billion tonnes of limestone. Today, we are producing about 30 million tonnes of cement, that is a combination of all the companies that are in Nigeria and scattered all over the country.\u201d\n\nHe added that Nigeria was one of about 12 countries sitting on iron ore, gas, and coal, yet it remained the only country not producing steel and spent $2.5 billion annually importing the commodity.\n\nSamad said, \u201cYet, with $2.5 billion, you wi,ll be able to set up a plant of 1.5 to 2 million tonnes per annum, which means that with that amount of money that you spend annually importing steel, you will be able to set up a plant that will be processing steel forever and, therefore, won\u2019t need to spend that money every year.\n\n\u201cYou know, because without infrastructure, there is nothing you can do. Today, believe it or not, it is cheaper to transport a container from China to Lagos than to transport the container from Lagos to Kano. And that is the truth. Even though you know freight rates have gone up and that is because we do not have proper infrastructure at the ports.\n\n\u201cWe have only about three ports, so we need to improve on these areas. But all these things need finance. And unless, of course, we are able to get finance and be able to do these things, it will be very difficult.\u201d\n\nKyari stated that the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) presented another opportunity for Nigeria, stressing that the current high oil and gas prices are only a reflection of the imbalance between demand and supply.\n\nHe said, \u201cSupply is not meeting demand today. As we all may be aware, today, global demand is at levels above pre-COVID levels. It is about 100 million bpd.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Pantami stressed that Nigeria remained the economic gateway to West Africa, with over 200 million people. He said the rest of West Africa was just about the same population with Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the entire continent of Africa has a population of approximately 1.3 billion people,\u201d Pantami stated. He added, \u201cBeing in Nigeria, you are relatively at the centre. And you will have proximity to other parts of Africa, particularly when it comes to investing in Information and Communications Technology (ICT).\n\n\u201cAs we all know that the youth are the digital natives. They understand ICT better than any other category. In Nigeria, you will discover that the average age in our country is 18.1 years old. By implication, our population has been dominated by the youth and they are digital natives.\n\n\u201cIn addition, this makes Nigeria to be the 14th youngest country in the world, as it is today. So, these are some of the benefits we have in Nigeria, in addition to cheap labour, and many more and the cosmopolitan nature of the country.\u201d\n\nWhile underscoring the need for foreign investment, Ovia recalled that when the telecommunications industry began to grow in Nigeria, the then Econet brought its technology from Zimbabwe, a much smaller country, while MTN brought its own from South Africa. He lamented that today, while tele-density was 100 per cent, broadband technology deployments remained at 40 per cent, stressing that there\u2019s still tremendous opportunity in technology.\n\nOando boss, Tinubu stated that Nigeria had shown that it could be transparent in business, pointing that the open nature of the GSM bidding process in the early 2000s confirmed that Nigeria was capable of doing the right thing.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe had a very simple, transparent advertisement for GSM licences, in the newspapers and on the radio. You paid a $20 million deposit to bid for licence. Now, this is an environment, which always was chastised that it\u2019s a corrupt country, which nothing ever happens.\n\n\u201cWe had a licence, bid for it, we won, $285 million and a group of young people started a GSM company, which rolled out. Today, it is a 30 million, 40 million line company. We have 120 million active GSM lines in Nigeria and one of the highest tele-densities in the world. There is skill in Nigeria and there is a market.\u201d\n\nSpeaking also, President of Africaxim Bank, Oramah, argued that as long as Nigeria remained in the lower rungs of the value chain, it will never experience high economic growth.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo, what is the way out you may ask? I have no fresh insights to bring because we have discussed these same problems over and over again. But what we must do is begin to do what we always understand are the solutions.\n\n\u201cAnd I think the one clear way out is that we must begin to trade more with ourselves. In fact, I don\u2019t think we need a rocket scientist to give us a solution.

          "text": "*Declares loyalty to constitution, president\n\n*Neutralises 37 terrorists in Uba-Askira\u2019s reprisal\n\n*Fintiri mourns Gen. Zirkusu, other soldiers killed in Chibok\n\n*Ndume alleges ISWAP regrouping in Lake Chad\n\nDeji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Daji Sani in Yola\n\nThe country\u2019s military authorities declared at the weekend that the armed forces remained loyal to the constitution and President Muhammadu Buhari and, therefore, had no plans to overthrow his administration. They were reacting to reports claiming that the Defence Headquarters had warned soldiers against overthrowing Buhari.\n\nWhile dismissing claims that it issued such warning, the military said it did not require that caution because the loyalty of the officers and men to the constitution and the president was never in doubt.\n\nThe killing of the Commander, 28 Task Force Brigade, Chibok, Brigadier-General Dzarma Zirkushi, and three soldiers in an ambush in Uba-Askira, Borno State, weekend, also triggered a fierce response by the military, as troops battled and battered the terrorists, killing 37 of them.\n\nBut Adamawa State Governor, Hon. Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, expressed his condolences to the families and colleagues of Zirkusu and the three soldiers killed in the fight against insurgency in Chibok.\n\nMeanwhile, former Senate Leader, Ali Ndume, declared that the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) terrorists were currently regrouping in Lake Chad.\n\nDenying the coup report, the Defence Headquarters warned that it would deal decisively with any individual or group of persons out to tarnish the image of the military. It asked those it called mischief-makers to desist from dragging the military into partisanship.\n\nA statetment by Acting Director, Directorate of Defence, Media Operations (DDMO), Brig Gen Bernard Onyeuko, said, \u201cThe military high command hereby warns all mischief makers and their proxies not to draw the military into their engagements. The Armed Forces of Nigeria remains apolitical and would not hesitate to deal decisively with any person or group of persons that want to tarnish its image or draw it into partisan politics.\n\n\u201cThe Armed Forces of Nigeria remains loyal to President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, and also sworn to defend our democracy as well the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nArmy spokesman, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, in another statement, said, \u201cThe attention of the Defence Headquarters has been drawn to a misleading publication by an online newspaper, Naija News House, on Nigeria military warning politicians and officers against a coup which it credited to\n\n\u201cThe publication is a handiwork of mischief makers and enemies of the state. It is a deliberate and calculated attempt to mislead the general public aimed at causing disharmony in the polity.\n\n\u201cThe online newspaper manipulated with the intent of disinformation a previous message released in May 2021 by the then Director Defence Information, who is the current Army spokesperson. It is a malicious attempt to bring the military to disrepute. It is obvious that the online newspaper has its own sinister intention to cause confusion.\u201d\n\nNwachukwu said the report, titled \u201cDefence Headquarters warns soldiers against overthrowing Buhari\u2019s regime,\u201d was unfounded and the statement did not emanate from the Directorate of Army Public Relations headed by him.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIn any case, officers and soldiers of the Nigerian Army do not need to be \u2018warned against overthrowing Buhari\u2019s government\u2019 as their loyalty to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces has never been in doubt. The Nigerian Army is a reputable national and patriotic institution that has fully subordinated itself to civil authority, having stood unwaveringly in defence of the nation\u2019s democracy.\u201d\n\nThe statement further affirmed, \u201cThe Nigerian Army will continue to be steadfast in defending Nigeria\u2019s constitution and the much cherished democracy by providing aid to the civil authority, whenever it is called upon to so do.\u201d\n\nIt contended that the said publication, which was riddled with outrageous lies and fabrications claimed that the \u201cDefence Headquarters had denounced a call for the military to take over the reins of power. The online outlet went further to attribute its falsehood to Army Spokesman, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu.\n\n\u201cThe only reason why this grossly unprofessional and blatantly irresponsible report is receiving any attention is the attribution of the false statement to the Director, Army Public Relations, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu. The authors of the story must be the only news reporters, who do not know that Army Spokesman does not speak for the Defence Headquarters.\n\n\u201cHowever, for the sake of clarity and to keep the records straight, we wish to state that at no time did the Director, Army Public Relations, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu issue any statement on the subject matter. It is, therefore, a figment of their imagination, which did not in anyway emanate from Brig Gen Nwachukwu.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the military, on Friday, deployed three fighter jets, one Alpha jet and two A-29 Super Tucano attack aircraft as well as ground troops that engaged the insurgents in a fierce fire-fight that spilled over to Sunday morning.\n\nThe insurgents had in a reprisal attack over Friday\u2019s aerial bombardment of their positions and killing of their members, ambushed the commander, killing him and three other soldiers at Bungulwa village near Uba-Askira while on their way to reinforce troops.\n\nBut in a counter offensive, troops engaged the non-state actors, killing an ISWAP Commander and three insurgents.\n\nChief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Faruk Yahaya, following the development, directed troops to sustain the counter-offensive.\n\nA war update issued Saturday by Nigerian Army Headquarters said the army chief commiserated with the families and relations of the fallen heroes and directed the troops to continue the ferocious counter-offensive and hot pursuit to eliminate the remnants of the fleeing terrorists.\n\nIt was gathered that the Nigerian troops, which had tactically retreated, regrouped, reinforced and ambushed the ISWAP commander and eliminated his fighters at Uba-Askira.\n\nA military source confirmed that over 30 bodies of the insurgents decimated on Saturday were recovered yesterday though troops were still combing surrounding bushes for more bodies.\n\nIt was further gathered that nine gun trucks, an Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) and one Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) were destroyed while some other equipment were recovered.\n\n\u201cThis morning while we are still mopping the area, we have so far counted 37 corpses of the terrorists while one of their leaders, a commander, who was arrested for further investigation died in custody this morning. We also recovered dozens of sophisticated guns during the clearance operation,\u201d a security source said.\n\nReports indicated that normalcy had returned to Askira-Uba as the villagers hailed the proactive response of the military after the sudden invasion of their community.\n\nFintiri, in a press release by his press secretary, Mr Humwashi Wonosikou, yesterday, noted that he was saddened to hear how the insurgents launched an attack on an Army Base in Askira Uba Local Government area of Southern Borno. Fintiri commended the bravery of the Special Forces with the support of other troops, who repelled the attack by the insurgents.\n\nFintiri stated, \u201cGeneral Zirkusu and the three others were brave soldiers, who died in the line of duty while fighting terrorists.\n\n\u201cI want to take this opportunity to express my deepest sympathy and that of the government and people of Adamawa State to the families and loved ones of the fallen heros. I stand with you. Nigeria stands with you. I deeply appreciate the sacrifice made by your loved ones in defence of our democracy, our peace and our security.\u201d\n\nWhile urging the citizens to remember the families of the deceased in prayers at \u201cthis difficult time\u201d, Fintiri also urged their families, President Muhammadu Buhari and the Chief of Army Staff to take heart over the irreparable loss, knowing that their loved ones died in active service and paid the supreme sacrifice.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe will not be cowed by these cowards. Our armed forces will continue to fulfil our mission-defeating terror. Our Soldiers\u2019 blood will not be shed in vain.\u201d\n\nThe governor expressed confidence that the day was coming when Nigerians would look back at this moment in history and say, \u201cThank God there were courageous people willing to serve, because they laid the foundation for peace for generations to come.\n\n\u201cWe are on track to victory against evil. My thoughts and prayers go out to families of troops killed in war everyday, not just on the loss of these brave soldiers, but all who laid their lives in supreme sacrifice for the freedom of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNdume alerted that ISWAP members had begun to regroup in Lake Chad. However, he said he was optimistic that the Nigerian military had the capacity to tame as well as defeat the terrorists in the on-going onslaught against them.\n\nReacting to the killing of General Zirkusu and three soldiers, Ndume said the military had been informed about this and the Air Force were giving the necessary back up to fight the terrorists.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe ISWAP are regrouping around Borno North. That\u2019s Lake Chad axis. The military is aware and the Air Forces are providing surveillance in the area. It was a revenge mission.\u201d\n\nWhile condoling with the Army over the recent killings by insurgents, the chairman of Senate Committee on Army, stated that the killing was a revenge mission by ISWAP terrorists, who had of recent been victims of military operations in parts of Borno State.\n\nNdume stated, \u201cFor now, we will assume that it was an isolated case. But the intensity with which they came is worrisome. They came with more than 10 gun trucks. It was a revenge mission. The Army has been taking out key ISWAP commanders and they had their revenge.\n\n\u201cISWAP terrorists attacked a town there. They knew that the General was the major obstacle to their operation. They laid an ambush and rammed a bomb-ladened car into his vehicle. He was a gallant soldier. He took the fight to the terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe General\u2019s death has sent a panic to people in that area. I am aware that some people around that Chibok area have started thinking of relocating. Some want to go to Mubi and other places. We are trying to urge them to remain there. The insurgency is coming to an end.\n\n\u201cThis is not the end, but the beginning of the end of terrorists. I know that the Army has what it takes to take the fight to them. There is need to urge other security agencies to give the Army the needed support. We also need to urge vigilante groups to assist them.\n\n\u201cLast week, for instance, they abducted relatives of the Emir of Askira. They also abducted some passengers along that road. If the Army sustains the temple, we will win this insurgency. The equipment is arriving gradually. We are monitoring. As a committee, we will go and see what they have brought into the country. This is an improvement. The Army is very rapid in responding.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022In raging fire-fight, three jets bombard terrorists\n\n\u2022Borno gov lauds military for resilience\n\n\u2022Nigeria, Niger, Benin plan multinational border force\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nIn a first of its kind since the more than a decade-old insurgency war started, the Nigerian Army yesterday lost a Brigadier-General commanding a Special Forces team, in an ambush by terrorists of the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) in Borno State.\n\nHowever, the military countered the attack by ISWAP with heavy bombardment of the insurgents, following the deployment of three fighter jets to contain the terrorists.\n\nIn a swift reaction, President Muhammadu Buhari and Borno State governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum have mourned the slain officer Commanding the 28 Task Force Brigade in Chibok, Borno State, Brigadier General Dzarma Zirkusu and three other soldiers killed by the ISWAP fighters.\n\nBuhari expressed deep sadness over the death of the Brigadier General and three soldiers who paid the supreme sacrifice in a very rare display of gallantry as they tried to help their compatriots in the war against terrorists.\n\nThe president, in a statement issued by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, stressed that \u201cNigeria has lost brave soldiers and I salute their courage.\n\n\u201cMay their souls Rest In Peace. General Zirkusu leaves us sad and devastated. The soldier in him will remain immortal,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nHe urged the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Faruk Yahaya, to accept his heartfelt condolences and that of the nation, and convey same to the members of the families of those martyred.\n\n\u201cI pray to the Almighty to give you and the bereaved families the strength and courage to bear this irreparable loss,\u201d the President added.\n\nIn his reaction, Borno State Governor, Zulum has also commended the Nigerian military for putting up strong resilience in a battle with the ISWAP fighters, who launched the attacks on a military base in Askira/Uba LGA of southern Borno State.\n\nZulum, in a statement by his spokesman, Malam Isa Gusau, paid tribute to troops at the base as well as troops from neighbouring commands, who mobilised to reinforce before they were ambushed.\n\nThe governor, while commiserating with the military over the loss of some military officers and personnel, thanked the fallen heroes for what he called \u201ctheir supreme sacrifices to the Nigerian Nation\u201d, declaring that \u201cthe people of Borno will remain forever grateful to them and all fallen heroes, and will fully support gallant troops currently operating in front lines\u201d.\n\nHe noted that amid the loss of some officers and personnel, the military was able to mount heavy resistance and recorded gains which the state is proud of.\n\nHe commiserated with affected residents for the trauma caused by the attack and shared the pains of anyone who may have turned victim directly and otherwise.\n\n\u201cWe must always affirm our fates in our armed forces, while the armed forces must remain up and doing. We must always recognise what we already know, that insurgents are always plotting with the elements of surprise. Our troops must redouble efforts to be ahead of insurgents. I salute our troops for the resistance put up today.\n\nI salute troops who mobilised to provide reinforcement. I salute the sacrifices of some officers and men we lost today and share the grieves of the immediate families and the Nigerian military. We thank these fallen heroes for their supreme sacrifices to the Nigerian nation. The people of Borno will remain forever grateful to them and all fallen heroes, and will remain fully supported by gallant troops currently operating in front lines,\u201d Zulum said as quoted in the statement.\n\nThe Nigerian Army confirmed the death of the Commander of the 28 Task Force Brigade in Chibok, Borno State, Brigadier General Zirkusu, and three other soldiers in the attack by ISWAP in the Askira Uba Local Government Area of Borno State.\n\nReacting to the incident, the Borno State Governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum has commended the Nigerian military for putting up strong resilience in the battle with the terrorists, who launched attacks on a military base in Askira/Uba LGA in the southern part of the state.\n\nThis is coming as Nigeria, Niger, and the Republic of Benin have concluded plans to establish a border force in a renewed bid to contain criminalities in their borders.\n\nThe late Brigadier General Zirkusu was in January 2021, redeployed from the Headquarters 1 Brigade, Gusau to Headquarters 28 Task Force Brigade, Chibok, and appointed Commander.\n\nBefore he was killed yesterday, the highest-ranking army officers killed by terrorists in the northeast were colonels.\n\nWhile the Commander of the 25 Task Force Brigade of the Nigerian Army, Damboa, Colonel Dahiru Bako, was killed by Boko Haram terrorists in September 2020, the Commanding Officer of the Chief of Army Staff Mobile Intervention Battalion in Borno, Col. Hussaini Samaila Sankara died in July 2021 following the injuries he sustained when his vehicle ran into a landmine/IED of Boko Haram.\n\nThe IED blast incident, which occurred on May 30 between Marte and Dikwa, also killed some soldiers who were in the same vehicle as to the late Sankara.\n\nThough the Nigerian Army yesterday confirmed the death of three other soldiers, sources from the frontlines put the number of soldiers reportedly killed during the operation which occurred at Bulguma at four.\n\nBulguma is a few kilometres from Askira town in Askira Uba LGA.\n\nAccording to the sources, the troops of 28 Task Force Brigade, Chibok, were ambushed on their way to reinforce Askira, which was under attack by the ISWAP fighters, who had stormed the town in a large convoy of gun trucks.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday by the Director, Army Public Relations, Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu, the Army stated that the troops of Joint Task Force, North East Operation Hadin Kai were engaged in a fierce gun battle with the terrorists which also led to the death of the Brigadier-General and three other soldiers.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cA gallant senior officer, Brigadier-General Dzarma Zirkusu, and three soldiers paid the supreme sacrifice in a very rare display of gallantry as they reinforced a counteroffensive against the terrorists, and successfully defended the location\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that the families of the senior officer and soldiers had been contacted.\n\n\u201cThe Chief of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Farouk Yahaya deeply commiserates with the families and relations of the fallen heroes. He has also directed that the troops continue in the ferocious counteroffensive and hot pursuit to eliminate the remnant of the fleeing terrorists.\u201d\n\nNwachukwu, in the statement, also noted that the military had deployed five A \u2013 Jet, two A-29, and two Dragon combat with which they destroyed nine gun trucks and one armoured personnel carrier of the terrorists.\n\nHe added that the battle was still on at the time he filed the statement.\n\nMeanwhile, the military has also disclosed that airstrikes conducted by the air component of Operation Hadin Kai decimated scores of insurgents, who gathered for a meeting in the Marte area of Lake Chad.\n\nAfter receiving credible intelligence that ISWAP terrorists were converging at a location in Marte for a meeting in Lake Chad yesterday, NAF aircraft under Operation Hadin Kai were immediately deployed to survey and dislodge the gathering.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that while observing the area, it was noticed that another boat came with more fighters surrounding a likely high-profile personality as seen from the way he was being followed around with a flag.\n\nAfter confirming that the meeting was ongoing, the pilots got the go-ahead to strike.\n\nOther sources also confirmed that top ISWAP Commanders that were at the scene at the time of the strikes included Muhammed Bako, Special Militant Forces Commander (Rijal Ann), Muhammad Malumma, a Chief Judge of Marte; Goni Mustapha, the Chief Imam.\n\nOthers included Muhammed Ba\u2019ana, recently appointed Commander of Kirta; Muhammed Ali, Amir of Kwalaram; Ibn Umar, Chief Prosecutor; Bakura Gana, Commander of Jubularam; and Malam Musa, Amir of Jubularam amongst others were either injured or killed in the strike.\n\nIt was not certain if the new Wali, Shuwaram was among those killed or injured in the attack.\n\nIn another development, the National Security Adviser (NSA), Maj. Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd), has disclosed that Nigeria, the Republic of Benin, and the Republic of Niger have also launched tripartite Joint Border Patrol Teams (JBPTs) in a bid to strengthen border security in the three neighbouring countries.\n\nMonguno has also stated that terrorist groups, Boko Haram and the ISWAP remained transnational threats to Nigeria.\n\nArms smuggling and unrestrained movement of armed groups through unmanned borders have fuelled insurgency and armed banditry which ravaged Nigeria and Niger while Benin suffered maritime crimes.\n\nMonguno stated these in a paper themed: \u2018Combating Persistent and Emerging Threats to Regional Peace and Security in Africa: Pivotal Role of Nigeria\u2019 at the Internal Partnership Forum in Paris.\n\nHe said Africa\u2019s porous borders remained a major source of concern as this aided smuggling of prohibited items and irregular migration as well as other transnational organised crimes.\n\n\u201cNigeria is bordered to the North by Niger, to the East by Chad and Cameroon to the South by the Gulf of Guinea of the Atlantic Ocean, and to the West by Benin.\n\n\u201cHowever, Nigeria\u2019s extensive land and maritime borders are incredibly porous and poorly manned. This has placed added responsibility on the border security agencies. In this regard, the Nigeria Customs Service has developed the E-Customs strategy while the Nigeria Immigrations Service has equally put in place an Integrated Border Management System (IBMS)\u201d, he said.\n\nMonguno said the move was aimed at strengthening border security.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to observe that both strategies place a premium on employing technology to complement other existing physical border security arrangements. \u201cFurthermore, as part of efforts at strengthening border security, tripartite Joint Border Patrol Teams (JBPTs) comprising Nigeria, Niger, and Benin Republics were recently established to curb the increasing scale of smuggling of prohibited items as well as irregular migration across the nations\u2019 borders.\n\n\u201cThis has greatly reduced the scale of transnational organised crimes. We are also exploring the feasibility of setting up a border security force in the foreseeable future to secure Nigeria\u2019s border areas\u201d, he said.\n\nMonguno stated that terrorist groups, Boko Haram and the ISWAP remained transnational threats to Nigeria.\n\nHe said the African continent was not immune to such global security concerns.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says 17,618 workers required for only APC, PDP primaries\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has explained that the monitoring of the direct primaries of the 18 registered political parties in the country has financial and security implications, stating that it will require about 17,618 officials to supervise only the primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in one day.\n\nThe commission further explained that monitoring the direct primaries of the 18 political parties registered so far would involve much staff.\n\nIn the amended Electoral Bill awaiting assent by President Muhammadu Buhari, the National Assembly has restricted political parties to the use of direct primaries to elect candidates for elections.\n\nHowever, the state governors, who are opposed to direct primaries, had expressed fear over the logistical problems it would create for the commission.\n\nSpeaking to THISDAY last night, INEC\u2019s National Commissioner in charge of Voter Education and Information, Mr. Festus Okoye, acknowledged that the monitoring of the direct primaries of the 18 registered political parties has security and financial implications.\n\n\u201cIf a political party decides to organise its primaries at the Registration Area (Ward) level, the commission must deploy monitors to the 8,809 Registration Areas in the country. If the party decides to organise its presidential, governorship, National Assembly, and state assembly primaries at different times and on different days, it means that the commission must deploy four times to monitor the primaries of the party.\n\n\u201cIf a political party decides to organise its primaries at the local government level, it means that the commission must deploy monitors to the 774 local government areas of the country,\u201d Okoye explained.\n\nDespite the huge logistics challenges, Okoye said the commission would surely work out the modalities for the monitoring of the primaries as soon as the law is assented to.\n\n\u201cThe monitoring of direct primaries has financial and national security implications. The ad-hoc staff must be harvested from MDAs or the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) or the universities or other sources as may be determined by the commission and supervised by a certain category of our staff\u201d.\n\nAccording to Okoye, the ad-hoc staff must be trained and transported, adding that some of them must be housed.\n\n\u201cSome of the primaries may go late into the night and we must make arrangements for their security and protection. But the fundamental issue is that the commission has the experience in monitoring direct primaries and the only difference here is that in the present context few parties adopted the direct primary method of selecting or electing their candidates,\u201d he said.\n\nOkoye further disclosed that the entire staff strength of the commission is slightly over 16,000, adding the commission must rely on a certain category of ad-hoc staff to cover the Registration Areas if a political party decides to use the 8,809 Registration Areas for its primaries.\n\nOkoye further noted that INEC will aggregate the figures and design a continuity framework and matrix for monitoring of direct primaries.\n\nOkoye explained that the commission as a constitutional and legal body is bound to give effect to and implement laws legally and legitimately passed by the National Assembly.\n\nHe said INEC does not have a choice in this regard.\n\n\u201cThe moment the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria assents to the Bill, it becomes law and the commission must implement the law passed by the National Assembly which has received Presidential assent. Presently, it is in the realm of speculation on whether the president will sign or withhold assent. The bill is inchoate till assented to by the president,\u201d he added.\n\nHe explained that Section 87(2) of the existing and operative law provides that the procedure for the nomination of candidates by a political party for the various elective positions shall be by direct or indirect primaries.\n\nHe added that the moment a political party gives to the commission the requisite 21 days\u2019 notice, the commission must mobilise and monitor the primaries of the party whether it is by direct or indirect primaries.\n\n\u201cHowever, if the president assents to the bill, it means that all the existing political parties must roll out guidelines on how to conduct their primaries bearing in mind that the fundamental and overriding consideration is ensuring that all aspirants are given equal opportunity of being voted for by members of the party. Each political party must design its methodology depending on its strength and capacity.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Section 4 of the Constitution domiciles the legislative powers of the Federation in the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cIt is within their remit to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Federation. Moreover, section 228 of the Constitution provides that the National Assembly may by law provide guidelines and rules to ensure internal democracy within political parties, including making laws for the conduct of party primaries, party congresses, and party conventions,\u201d Okoye said.\n\nAccording to him, INEC\u2019s responsibility is to participate in public hearings and make suggestions and recommendations.\n\n\u201cAs I have pointed out, our responsibility is to obey and give effect to laws passed by the National Assembly and assented to by the President. Section 228 of the Constitution gives the National Assembly the power to make laws relating to internal democracy in political parties,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

It\u2019s not about oil-bearing. And to understand all of these, we need to go back far into history, from the reports of the Willinks commission that recognised the peculiarity of the region \u2013the major challenges and therefore recommended the establishment of a board that will alleviate the fears of the people and act as a special agency for the rapid development of people of the region. At this time when this recommendation was made, there was no oil,\u201d the INC president said.\n\n\u201cThen we now have the NDDC in 2000 to cater for the mandate of the region. The NDDC act provides for, in addition to the 13 percent derivation, another 10 percent to address the challenges of the people. Around that time, when states that was not part of the region were included, people protested.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have a natural area called the Niger Delta, and the politicisation of the Niger Delta is unacceptable. And we foresaw further bastardisation. The inclusion is to say that what was envisaged long ago is coming to pass. The point we are making is that if oil is now found in other places, there\u2019s a law that says that for oil-producing land, 13 percent should be given to them.

          "text": "Digital media in Africa is growing fast: traditional media organisations are finding their way to the internet while digital-only media organisations are taking firm root. More Africans are online, they are spending more time on the internet and relying more on digital media more than ever. According to the Social Flagship Report April 2021, created by Global Web Index (GWI), four African countries cracked the top 10 rankings for social media usage based on time spent, as Nigeria ranked first at (3:46), followed by Kenya (3:33), South Africa (3:32) and Ghana.\n\nOn the latest edition of TechCabal Live\u2014a video interview series in partnership with the UK-Nigeria Tech Hub\u2014held on October 25, we sought to understand Africa\u2019s digital media landscape, its challenges and future, and so we spoke with the editors of two of Africa\u2019s top digital newsrooms\u2014Quartz Africa Editor, Ciku Kimeria; and Stears Business\u2019, Editor-in-Chief, Fadekemi Abiru.\n\nHow can digital media in Africa create a profitable business model?\n\nWhile it is normal to get excited about the different innovative news products in the continent\u2019s digital media landscape, Abiru explains that more media houses need to produce more information that helps people understand what is going on around them.\n\nIn Africa, online news is mostly free. Only a few digital news organisations have been able to monetise their digital content. But Abiru wants this to change. \u201cLet people understand that information is something worth paying for. There is a challenge of helping people understand that where there is value, revenue can also be generated.\u201d Abiru believes that value creation is enough reason for digital media in Africa to monetise their online content. She further explains that the concept of \u201ccontent worth paying for\u201d is why Netflix and Spotify operate subscription-based business models.\n\nAbiru believes that for African newsrooms to use the subscription model successfully, they must produce deep, original and insightful pieces that cannot be found elsewhere.\n\nAfrican newsrooms have a talent problem\n\nAbiru complained about a talent shortage and the challenge of retaining talent. Ciku also believes that Africa faces a talent problem but is hopeful that training would go a long way to solve it. She added, though, that it is easier to train good writers on technical skills but very hard to teach good writing.\n\nQuality of work coming from African newsrooms must improve\n\nSpeaking on the quality of journalistic work coming out of African newsrooms, Ciku believes that there is a huge gap between African and, say, American journalism. But she believes the fault isn\u2019t entirely the journalist\u2019s. She says there has been a drop in the quality of journalism schools in Kenya, her home country.\n\nAnother reason for this drop in the quality of journalism is the university system in Africa, where there are scandals of people paying for their degrees.\n\n\u201cNow, when you read what a journalist has written, there are so many typos and errors,\u201d she lamented.\n\nYet another problem Ciku highlighted was funding. She believes African journalists can do amazing work, but their budget is way smaller than that of global publications.\n\n\u201cIf a great investigative journalist wants to go into a project in a place that\u2019s not safe, and his organisation gives him little or no money to do so, you can understand how they will not come up with the same quality of work as a global media house.\u201d\n\nThe major cause of the funding problem, Ciku said, is the environment and not individual journalists.\n\nYou can watch the rest of the conversation below:\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Launched in 2019 by Cregital, a Lagos-based creative design agency, Disha Pages gave users the tools with which to build their own one-page websites from the comfort of their smartphones, without worrying about technicalities such as coding or sorting out a domain name.\n\nCredit: Disha (Medium)\n\nThe product was an instant hit and got considerable adoption among creators and gig workers. Unfortunately, by a little over a year after its launch\u2014at the peak of the pandemic\u2014the company announced that they were shutting down the product.\n\n\u201cHow can we help?\u201d\n\nAs soon as the announcement of the shutdown went up, the Disha team were inundated with calls and messages from baffled well wishers, all of them concerned and wondering what they could do to keep the platform alive. These early conversations were tepid, nothing was concrete\u2014until Flutterwave came into the picture offering a total buyout. The move by the payments giant, which earlier this year became a unicorn, is surprising as both companies operate in different spaces\u2014Flutterwave in payments and Disha in the creator industry. One wonders, then, what the play is here.\n\nIn a call with Flutterwave\u2019s head of product marketing, Onyedikachim Nwankwo, explained that while both companies may run different businesses, their company goals are aligned. \u201cFlutterwave is about creating endless possibilities for everyone, and Disha\u2019s goal of enabling creators achieve success and get paid for their work ties into Flutterwave\u2019s larger mission of helping small businesses thrive.\u201d\n\nNew look for Disha?\n\nIn a statement announcing the acquisition, Flutterwave says that the buyout will grow Disha\u2019s base by providing users with the ability to make, receive and withdraw money from their Disha accounts in over 150 currencies and 34 countries across the world. Despite the acquisition, however, Disha will remain an independent company. According to Nwankwo, \u201cIts original vision will be maintained.\u201d\n\nRufus Oyemade, Software and Architectural Lead at Flutterwave, states that Disha coming under the Flutterwave family means its vision will be explored farther than earlier imagined. \u201cBefore now, when users created a Disha page and linked to a Flutterwave payment link, they got taken off the Disha site. Now, with the acquisition, users can create and accept their payments, all in one place.\u201d\n\nFlutterwave has always played in the creator space, having supported arts events like ArtX Lagos. Now, as the digital world opens up to creators getting paid for their work through innovations such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the payments giant is well positioned to help creators on Disha access global markets and further grow the global creator economy, which is estimated to be worth $100 billion.\n\nFlutterwave became a unicorn in March after reaching a $1 billion valuation, and the company may be set to triple that value in the future to the tune of $3 billion by acquiring more funding.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Exclusive: Meta\u2019s VP MEA and Turkey on Facebook\u2019s transition into the metaverse",
          "text": "At the end of October, social media giant, Facebook, changed its company to Meta. The announcement was made in an hour-long video that explained the company\u2019s decision to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse.\n\nLeading that work in Africa is Derya Matras, Vice President (VP), Middle East, Africa (MEA) and Turkey, Meta.\n\nPrior to her appointment as VP in August, Matras was the Managing Director for the MEA and Turkey region. Before that, she was Country Director for Facebook in Turkey for four years. Derya holds a BSc in electronics engineering from Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey, and an MBA from Columbia Business School.\n\nOver email, Matras talked to TechCabal about Facebook\u2019s rebrand to Meta and how it plans to make money from the metaverse and deal with the challenges that come with building it.\n\nHow is the Metaverse better than Facebook in its current form?\n\nWhen Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world\u2014and we are not turning away from these existing products. Those experiences are going to form a crucial part of the future metaverse ecosystem. The Facebook app is still going to be called Facebook.\n\nThe name Meta is a clear link to our vision for the metaverse. However, the metaverse will exist, whether Meta is there or not. So, Meta means us moving beyond 2D screens towards immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality, to help build the next evolution in social technology. This is a natural evolution for our company as social media and technology evolves.\n\nWhat demographic is the metaverse targeting in Africa?\n\nGiven all that the metaverse has to offer, there\u2019s a lot at stake in making sure its possibilities are open to everyone and not just people from traditionally underrepresented groups. An inclusive metaverse benefits everyone.\n\nIs Facebook building the metaverse because it\u2019s best positioned to build something that\u2019s inevitable?\n\nIn recent decades, technology has given people the power to connect and express themselves more naturally. We started with websites, then we got phones with cameras, and then the internet became more visual and mobile. As connections got faster, video became a richer way to share experiences. If you look back over time, we\u2019ve gone from desktop to web to mobile; from text to photos to video. Now we are looking at what comes next. The metaverse will feel like a hybrid of today\u2019s online social experiences, sometimes expanded into three dimensions or projected into the physical world. It\u2019s the next evolution in a long line of social technologies, and it\u2019s ushering in a new chapter for our company.\n\nIn Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s letter, he mentioned that the \u201cmetaverse will not be created by one company\u201d. Does this mean there\u2019ll be other metaverses outside of Facebook\u2019s metaverse and that they can all exist side by side without Facebook trying to be the only metaverse out there?\n\nThe metaverse isn\u2019t a single product that one company can build. Its success depends on building robust interoperability across services, so different companies\u2019 experiences can work together. And it won\u2019t be built overnight. Many of these products will only be fully realised in the next 10-15 years. While that\u2019s frustrating for those of us eager to dive right in, it gives us time to ask difficult questions about how they should be built. We\u2019ll work with experts in government, industry and academia to think through issues and opportunities in the metaverse.\n\nWe also need to involve human and civil rights communities from the start to ensure these technologies are built in a way that\u2019s inclusive and empowering.\n\nAcross Africa, we\u2019re supporting Africa No Filter, Electric South and Imisi 3D to support creators who have been pushing the boundaries of digital storytelling using immersive technology to amplify African voices.\n\nIs there the potential for other applications and programmes to be built in the metaverse\u2014similar to the blockchain.\n\nWe are at the very start of this. A lot of the technology and infrastructure still needs to be built. It will take at least 5 to 10 years for this vision of the metaverse to come to life. This pace is going to be dictated less by business interests and more by technological realities. Infrastructure needs to be transformed with new technologies, hardware and cooling specifications to be able to support a robust service. And new hardware still needs to be built, including things like hologram displays, projectors, batteries, radios, custom silicon chips, cameras, speakers, and sensors to map the world around you and more.\n\nWhy should Facebook build this? Why not another company?\n\nThis was an important step for us to take on our journey, and as we evolve to Meta, we hope this will better reflect where we are going as a company. Like all businesses, we continue to innovate so that we can bring value to people\u2019s lives.\n\nWe are a social company with investments in technology, like VR; and the metaverse is the next frontier of virtual digital connection\u2014so it\u2019s a natural evolution for our business. But it\u2019s important to reiterate that Meta is neither going to build, own, or run the metaverse on its own. This isn\u2019t going to be a Meta product.\n\nBuilding this will be more like how the internet came about rather than how one app was launched. That\u2019s why we will be collaborating at every stage with other companies, developers, experts, and policymakers. Principles of privacy, safety, and security need to be built in from the start. If we have the principles right, then as a society, we will be better at tackling new challenges with these technologies as they arise.\n\nThe transition to communication via the metaverse will face some challenges considering that it\u2019s not just another app on the mobile phone. What challenges does Facebook expect to encounter in rolling out the metaverse in Africa?\n\nNew innovations bring new challenges, and there\u2019s lots we need to figure out. But that\u2019s why we\u2019re starting this conversation early. We have to be responsible in our approach, and we intend to do that in a number of ways:\n\nNo surprises: In the past, the speed with which new technologies have emerged has sometimes left policymakers and regulators playing catch-up. We don\u2019t want this to happen this time around. A core principle is going to be \u201cdon\u2019t surprise people\u201d. That\u2019s why we are having this conversation out in the open, way in advance of all these technologies being launched.\n\nCollaboration: Partnering with independent experts and organisations will be a crucial part of how we navigate future challenges. We have already launched a two-year $50 million investment in programmes and external research, collaborating with industry partners, civil rights groups, governments, non-profits, and academic institutions to get input as we build these technologies responsibly. This is alongside being a founding member of the XR Association (XRA), which is committed to helping build responsible XR, which includes virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and future immersive technology.\n\nBuilt-in: While we will need to continue to get better at anticipating risks, we won\u2019t be able to see around every corner. That\u2019s why the principles of privacy, safety, and security need to be built in from the start.\n\nFacebook plans to spend ~$10 billion this year on the metaverse project\u2014and even more in the coming years. How will the company make money from this?\n\nIt\u2019s very early, and our focus today is more around building the foundational pieces for the metaverse, like VR, and bringing more people into those experiences. We outlined a few areas during Connect where we think there is an opportunity around commerce. We want to help provide tools for creators and developers so they can build a meaningful business in the metaverse because we think digital commerce will become increasingly important.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that investing in the metaverse also means additional resources invested in issues like safety and security. For example, the $10 billion investment in Reality Labs that we have already announced will include spending on research to better understand how we can responsibly tackle safety and integrity challenges in the metaverse.\n\nAnd, just like the rest of the internet, we expect that free things in the metaverse would likely be powered by ads while there would also be paid experiences that are ad-free.\n\nThis is a very long-term vision. It\u2019s going to take investment over many years before the metaverse reaches scale.\n\nLately, fingers have been pointed at Facebook for inciting civil unrest in Africa and being ill-equipped to staff its Africa offices to properly regulate posts. How does Facebook plan to build the metaverse responsibly?\n\nEvery day, our teams have to balance protecting the ability of billions of people to express themselves openly with the need to keep our platform a safe and positive place. We continue to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content. To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.\n\nWe are on track to spend over $5 billion on safety and security in 2021 alone and have 40,000 people working on these issues, including 15,000 people who review content in more than 70 languages.\n\nHow we build is as important as what we build. And we will be collaborating at every stage\u2014with other companies, developers, experts and policymakers\u2014to make sure that what we build is good for the world.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of action thrillers, you\u2019ve probably seen security operatives working with hi-tech gadgets like smart glasses and smartwatches (looking at you, James Bond). In case you\u2019re wondering if those are real or if they\u2019ll ever be commonplace in Africa, we are taking a closer look at a Nigerian-founded company building hi-tech gadgets but with a twist.\n\nA conversation about Nigeria\u2019s security challenges could fill an encyclopedia. Besides the numerous lives lost, they have also had a significant economic impact, costing the country billions of dollars.\n\nThe Institute for Economics and Peace \u2018Global Peace Index 2021: Measuring Peace in a Complex World, Sydney, June 2021 report reveals that Nigeria lost $40 billion in 2020 to insecurity \u2014 Unknown gunmen, robberies and theft, and others.\n\nMoreso, in 2020, it lost about $12 million to electronic fraud in nine months. If Deloitte West Africa\u2019s report is to be believed, then the country has lost $13 billion to cybercrime in ten years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a textile businessman who received frequent supplies from Northern Nigeria, these were more than just statistics for him.\n\nIt was a typical day in 2015, and he had just received a familiar call stating that another unforeseen circumstance had disrupted his supply yet again, and he was fed up.\n\nI sent items regularly from Lagos to Kano, and I kept hearing that the containers went missing, vanished. Where are the goods? Where\u2019s the driver?\u201d\n\nWith no answers forthcoming, he installed tracking devices, which didn\u2019t do much because the perpetrators always disarmed them.\n\nThen came the light bulb moment. Monsuru Anifowoshe figured he could build a drone to monitor his trucks.\n\n\u201cTo me, it seemed like the perfect thing to build while also rendering service to other people who were, say, producers or importers who had customers around Nigeria. So I built a UAV or UAS system to monitor my goods to ensure they went to the right place at the right time.\u201d\n\nSide note: UAV stands for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, and UAS stands for Unmanned Aircraft Systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonsuru Anifowoshe, CEO of Kifta Technologies\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following the startup space, you may have noticed how startup or company founders sometimes start a business because of a problem they had which no one was fixing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMonsuru, however, maintains that his reasons were purely selfish. It was when they started building that they talked to other people in the market and realised that there was an opportunity to do something for others too.\n\nHowever, having always run a business, Monsuru, a chemical engineering graduate from the University of Lagos, had no idea how to design UAVs or UAS systems. He had to acquire some knowledge and skills about UAVs to communicate with design companies effectively, specifically, industrial design companies.\n\n\u201cSo it made it easier to talk to professional design companies, and whenever they brought designs, I could say no it can not be like this; it should be like that,\u201d Monsuru says.\n\nIn 2017, he brought in Mcdonald Ukah, an economist with solid business acumen, as a co-founder to help with the company\u2019s business development efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcdonald Ukah, co-founder of Kifta Technologies\n\nWe\u2019ve delved deep into the difficulties of building a hardware business in Nigeria, and the co-founders experienced this first hand when developing prototypes for Kifta\u2019s different products. The usual suspects like unreliable power and lack of local talent were major bottlenecks the company faced.\n\nDespite the challenges, they built a proper team of experts from different continents. Not minding the cost and the time zone issues, he explains that he didn\u2019t have time for trial and error, and he just wanted to get the best people who had done something similar and build a working prototype.\n\nThe UAV prototype cost $450k, and it took three years to complete.\n\nSidenote: The average seed round for software startups in Africa as of 2021 is $1.5 million. Almost a third of that was spent on building one prototype for a hardware startup.\n\nFollowing the success of the UAV prototype, Kifta Technologies was born, and the company now boasts different UAS systems, including firefighting UAS, Naval UAS, Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV), and the regular UAS that is not deployed over a body of water.\n\nAll these products have unique and mouth-watering features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA USV designed by Kifta Technologies\n\nAccording to Monsuru, one of the UAVs, which can travel for nine hours, uses a wireless link where the device communicates with other devices through radio waves.\n\n\u201cIt can go from Lagos to South Africa, charge for a bit, and make it back to Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBesides UAS, the company currently has a diverse range of hardware and software products. There are devices for the police, military, churches, schools, and identification systems.\n\nMonsuru, however, admits that those for churches and schools are less sophisticated than the others.\n\n\u201cWe have a couple of software that we use for pipeline security, power cable security, and border security. Some of them are like the DAS system, the DTS system, and the SCADA system. Most of these things are powered by specific hardware which we use for their operations,\u201d he says.\n\nOf all the equipment, we got to see what the police and identification glasses look like and the possible use cases. Forgive my colleagues for encouraging Monsuru to place me in his facial recognition database as a wanted person. You can watch the video below.\n\nBusiness model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonsuru and Emmanuel Paul, our Senior Reporter, test running the Smart glasses\n\nKifta\u2019s business model is simple: sell these hardware and software products to clients. The company currently has clients from different countries, but it has very minimal operation in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe might sell to an entity in Nigeria that wants to use it for their operations, and they will have to talk to the regulators by themselves. It is not yet fully operational commercially,\u201d he reveals.\n\nKifta mainly runs a B2B model focusing on African businesses. Interestingly, it gets lots of clients from outside the continent. It also licenses some of its proprietary technology, like the pipeline security software, to companies who want to use them.\n\nThe company\u2019s smart glasses, which can see up to 20 kilometres and has a facial and licence plate recognition system, is also gaining traction with security agencies in Africa. There are also industry and educational use cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know, sometimes you develop a project and then stumble on another use case. In the manufacturing industry, we have a function that can record a step by step process on how to assemble this (smart glasses). It can record it for any newbie. The person wears this, and it lectures them. You open the motherboard; you screw it this way.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you sign a six-month or one-year deal with an expatriate. After that one year, you\u2019re certain that the ex-pat has transferred whatever knowledge into your system, and the AI in the glasses transmits it in a step by step process. The glasses teach whatever knowledge that ex-pat has transmitted or shared.\u201d\n\nThe company leverages its expertise in AI and AR to develop IoT devices for different industries. It currently has a partnership with a Rwandan company to develop IoT for farms. A method that promises to be a big boost for the country\u2019s agricultural sector.\n\nOther African countries also use its products, but he didn\u2019t mention which for security reasons. Trust us, we asked.\n\nDespite having several exciting products that could be relevant to the Nigerian situation, we found it quite telling that Kifta Technologies does not have much traction in Nigeria compared to other African countries.\n\nIts smart glasses, for example, could be relevant to Nigerian law enforcement agencies. Features like the recognition software, location search, and live transmission would help them fulfil their duties while keeping them accountable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smart glasses can be connected to a database of people in a company, state, or country.\n\nThe glasses could be connected to the National Identity Number (NIN) database if needed. So why has adoption stalled in Nigeria? Monsuru maintains that it\u2019s a problem of accessing the right people.\n\n\u201cIf you want to install security cameras in our airports or along our borders, it\u2019s not as easy as waltzing into the customs office and saying I want to see the DG. And it\u2019s not as easy as sending them a cold email as you would send to a private company. For a government agency, it doesn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cThere have been situations where I tried to visit some of these places, and the security sent me away at the gate. Their favourite excuse is I can\u2019t come in without an appointment. How do I get an appointment when the contact phone number doesn\u2019t even work, and I didn\u2019t get a reply to my email?\u201d he asks.\n\nNigeria\u2019s power issues also ensure that Kifta limits its production. The production process of those products requires very steady power, and we learnt that even a 1 \u2013 2% voltage increase could damage the whole prototype if it\u2019s not configured correctly.\n\n\u201cAs much as it\u2019s beautiful to have all of these, adopting them in Nigeria is quite difficult, which is why most of our business and customers are not in Nigeria,\u201d Monsuru says.\n\nHe believes that since the high-tech defence industry is still young, most regulators are unaware that Nigerians are doing such innovations. He recommends that processes to reach relevant people should be put in place.\n\nSo far, the company has been bootstrapping and has never raised any institutional funding. It is, however, planning to raise funds to support some of its exciting plans.\n\nCommercialising defence technologies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Monsuru, one reason Kifta is trying to raise now is to expand its offerings to serve a broader market.\n\nFor him, since every facet of the hi-tech industry is quite niche, the company is working on expanding its offerings by implementing a drones-as-a-service platform in collaboration with logistics companies. Maybe not for small packages, but decent-sized parcels.\n\nIn the long run, we\u2019re also looking to scale up our UAS systems into building an air cargo system able to take a 3-ton payload that can move for five hours at a stretch,\u201d he reveals.\n\nMonsuru believes that the UAS system could significantly impact logistics in Nigeria. It would be fitted with storage systems and help many farmers get goods to the market in record time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a two-way thing, where you offer the logistics and help the farmers to become part of the global trade. By cutting off the middlemen completely, who, I must say, are responsible for the hike in food prices.\n\n\u201cImagine a basket of tomatoes in Maiduguri is \u20a6500, but when it gets to Lagos, it\u2019s already \u20a65,500. The middlemen will tell you that they incur all the risks, which was the same issue I had. So imagine you can build something where the producers can connect directly to the buyer.\n\n\u201cThey (the producers) now have the opportunity to sell a bit higher. So a farmer that sells for \u20a6500 can sell for \u20a61500.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also points out that building a cargo UAV to ensure speedy transfer of goods would have significant ripple effects on the economy and, of course, the environment.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s going to be autonomous. It will be designed for that purpose, so it takes away a lot of associated costs because it\u2019s designed for that purpose against normal cargo planes that weren\u2019t designed for that purpose. And because a portion of it is electric, it\u2019s going to reduce emissions, following all those wonderful things we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nEffective logistics has been a considerable challenge for both traditional and electronic commerce in Nigeria. The entire industry has struggled, and every facet of the problems they face runs deep.\n\nDespite the country\u2019s well-documented challenges, the company plans to introduce a manufacturing plant in Nigeria. Though every element might not be made here, it intends to produce enough for the products to qualify as Nigerian-made.\n\nThere are interesting times ahead for Kifta, and if its defence technologies are transferred to a sector like commerce, it could be potentially game-changing. For now, Monsuru encourages the government to improve support for innovative hardware developers.\n\nHe also wants to see more talented people delve into the hardware industry. He argues that while software engineering has gone mainstream, other types of talent like firmware engineers and propulsion and control systems engineers are hard to come by.\n\n\u201cThere might be some, but have they coded into a hardware product? Because a propulsion system can be used in a manufacturing plant or a petrochemical plant, or wherever. But I\u2019m talking in terms of UAVs, smart glasses, how they move from one phase to another, How one part kicks off and what part goes back.\u201d\n\nAre you a talented person out there, and this seems like it\u2019s describing you? Kifta is hiring for as many as nine positions, and the company is actively looking for people like you.\n\n\u201cThey can always go to the website kiftatechnologies.com. And we might even increase that depending on what we decide internally on the industries we\u2019re looking to expand to. Please, I\u2019m looking for wonderful talent, and we pay considerably well. Maths people, physics people, come,\u201d he declares.\n\nSo what do you think? Let\u2019s hear your thoughts in the comments below.\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Senior Reporter at Techpoint Africa | Website Writer and Narrator.

          "title": "How UK-based debt financing company, Lendable, is providing equity-free financing for African startups",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor most startup founders looking to raise money, the obvious choice is equity financing. However, there is another option \u2013 debt financing. Equity financing requires that founders give away shares in their business in exchange for capital.\n\nDebt financing allows founders to raise money by selling debt instruments to individuals or investors, and this money is then paid back at an agreed-upon date with interest.\n\nSo far, few African startups have raised money this way, with fintech startups Carbon, FairMoney, and mobility startup, MAX.ng some examples. During the week, we had a chat with Hani Ibrahim, the Chief Investment Officer of Lendable, a UK-based debt financing company, to learn how the company invests.\n\nAfter studying and working in the UK across various corporate finance and investment banking roles, Ibrahim moved to the Middle East. He spent five years working in Dubai and Qatar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile there, he set up investment banking platforms for local banks and institutions in both countries. In addition, he also worked at QInvest, where he ran a $500 million credit strategy, investing across Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Europe.\n\nIn 2019, he moved to the UK and soon took up his current position at Lendable. Founded by Dyland Friend and Daniel Goldman, the firm provides credit facilities for non-bank lenders in frontier and emerging markets.\n\nInitially a Software as a Service (SaaS) company, Lendable provided an analytics platform to analyse loans. Soon after, they added an investment arm and have provided over $100 million to startups across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.\n\nInvestment thesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHani Ibrahim. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen choosing startups to invest in, Lendable focuses on startups providing credit facilities in frontier or emerging markets across Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\n\n\u201cThe investment thesis is that we target emerging markets, particularly Africa, Asia, and Latin America. But we do look at the wider emerging markets with a focus on the FinTech space. We also target businesses that promote and provide products to those that have found or typically find it difficult to access financial services.\u201d\n\nA key thing to note is that Lendable does not invest in companies at the idea stage. Instead, they invest in startups with a proven product but need capital to get to the next level. The firm provides these startups with money that is repaid over some time.\n\nOn average, these companies receive debt financing between five and ten million dollars.\n\nFintech startups are not the only ones who receive funding from Lendable. Ibrahim reveals that any tech-driven startup providing a financing option fits their investment criteria. However, companies in sectors that they believe have harmful, or no impact on their markets are excluded from their target market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really interested in is supporting micro and small businesses across the African continent,\u201d he says.\n\nThings startups should avoid\n\nIbrahim pointed out that while startups are usually focused on rolling out new products and hiring new staff, they must watch their finances, precisely how and where they are getting their capital.\n\n\u201cOne thing that they should make sure that they spend time over is to think about their financing. How are they actually getting their capital? Where are they getting their capital from, and in what format?\n\n\u201cDo they have the right mix of capital? Are they thinking about the risks of the different types of capital and the costs and drawbacks and the different types of capital\u201d\n\nBiggest success stories\n\nHaving provided financing for several companies, Ibrahim is particularly proud of Watu Credit, a boda boda financing startup. In the five years since their launch in Kenya, the company has expanded its reach into Uganda and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey were a smaller business, and we supported them with a small facility at the time. They are at least in Kenya, but most probably in East Africa, seen as the market leader for leasing motorcycle taxis in their space.\n\n\u201cTo reach a market leadership position in five years is an incredible achievement for their team. But we\u2019re also very proud to have played our part in supporting that.\u201d\n\nOn missed opportunities and regrets\n\nWith fintech the darling of investors across the world, Lendable sees a lot of pitches from startups, so I asked Ibrahim about missed opportunities and possible regrets. \u201cI think there are certainly opportunities that we\u2019ve missed. Because there is so much going on in the space, we can\u2019t do everything.\n\n\u201cWhat I would say is that I would love to do more across different markets in Africa. You know, each market has its own specific ways of doing a transaction. So we\u2019re working through each market, and I\u2019m filtering through them to see where we can do transactions.\u201d\n\nIbrahim discloses that when investments have not gone according to plan, they work with the management team to find solutions. He says that both parties work together to develop a solution that is a win for both parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "It has been 38 years since the idea for a rapid rail system was first conceived for Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital, Lagos, and after a series of setbacks, the project looks closer than ever to completion.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s visit to some of the sites where work was ongoing reveals that progress was being made as the government works towards delivering the rail lines by December 2022, only 13 months from now.\n\nThe two rail lines that are currently under construction are the Blue and Red lines and are being built by the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC).\n\nThe first phase of the Blue line, a 27-km rail road from Okokomaiko to Marina, is under construction from Mile 2 to Marina and four stations are now ready at Mile 2, Alaba, Iganmu and National Theatre, BusinessDay learns.\n\nA visit to CMS and Mile 2 reveals heavy construction work going on at the Marina Terminal, and also at Ecowas Road, Mile 2. For the Red Line, laying of tracks had been completed at Oshodi track.\n\nBy Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority\u2019s (LAMATA) projections, three sets of trains would be deployed to each of the lines for passenger operations with the potential of moving 1.5 million passengers daily when fully developed and operational.\n\nThe idea for a metro line network can be traced back to Lateef Jakande in his days as governor of Lagos in 1983, but the project has suffered false starts since then.\n\nThe project was scrapped in 1985 by Muhammadu Buhari, who together with his co-military junta, toppled the civilian administration of President Shehu Shagari, thus abruptly terminating the Jakande administration\u2019s metro line idea.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Bola Tinubu, then governor, revived the initiative with a formal announcement of its construction in December 2003.\n\nBut the project passed from one administration to another until 2009, when Babatunde Fashola flagged off the Red Line.\n\nThe project has suffered many setbacks linked to financial shortfalls until recently when the present government recommenced construction, announcing that it would be completed by the last quarter of 2022.\n\nKunle, an employee of CCECC- the Chinese company building the rail lines, was ecstatic about the project when he spoke with BusinessDay.\n\nKunle, whose major job is to ensure the safety of workers at the Marina Terminal construction site and prevent movement inbound the axis, told BusinessDay that work was being fast-tracked at the site in a bid to meet the deadline next year.\n\nAccording to Kunle, when completed by 2022, the light rail will make a lot of difference in the Lagos transportation system by significantly cutting down traffic congestion. He believes that many residents will park their cars and use the trains as it will also convey a lot of people.\n\n\u201cJust imagine a situation where you find yourself on the Island within five minutes from Mile 2 rather than spend hours trying to get there by road,\u201d he said.\n\nHis sentiment about traffic congestion is shared by other residents\u2014mostly businessmen and women\u2014who spoke with BusinessDay about the ongoing project.\n\nThe residents who mostly live or work around the rail routes showed excitement after learning that operations will likely start next year as they imagine a Lagos devoid of its perennial traffic congestion.\n\n\u201cThe rail will be good if it is executed as fast as possible,\u201d said Kingsley Okoye, a shoe dealer and importer.\n\nOkoye lives in Alagbado and has been doing business at Arena, Oshodi, for years. According to him, the congestion in Lagos State is \u201ckilling,\u201d adding that he does not get enough sleep as he wakes up early.\n\nHe told BusinessDay that the traffic he faces to and from work has caused him some health challenges, and further urged the government not to dilly-dally in completing such a huge and significant project.\n\n\u201cMy health is at stake,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cI get home late and I don\u2019t eat dinner again and because of that I\u2019ve developed a peptic ulcer. So, whatever they are trying to do, they should be time conscious,\u201d he said angrily, but calm enough to respond to a customer.\n\nFor Maria Ubah, a fish trader, the rail system will benefit traders like her, especially in terms of making transportation/logistics easier for them.\n\nAside from logistics gulping a significant portion of her cost of doing business, which makes her goods expensive thereby limiting patronage, Ubah, who lives in Iyana-Ipaja area, struggles to meet up with her business schedules.\n\n\u201cIf I want to be at the shop, I\u2019ll have to wake up by 4am to prepare and get on the road by 4:30am, else, I won\u2019t be able to meet up because by around 6am., you begin to experience a lot of traffic congestion.\n\n\u201cThe congestion gets so bad that you will have to come down and start trekking to Oshodi or take a bike to meet up.\u201d According to her, going back home is the same headache.\n\nShe explained that as a business person, she ought to close by 8 p.m. so that she could sell to those returning from work. But due to the traffic, she does not wait.\n\nShe believes the rail transit system will bring significant relief and make life better for people in her line of business.\n\n\u201cThe stress is just too much,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the rail will be possible in December, as they said, I\u2019ll be very happy.\u201d\n\nOne major expectation from the completion of the Blue and Red rail lines is that it could cut traffic congestion by 50 percent in Lagos, a big boost for the economy.\n\nLagos residents have long complained about low productivity levels, as some miss out on business opportunities due to heavy traffic.\n\nRead also: Lagos rail lines begin commercial operations 2023 \u2013 Sanwo-Olu\n\nUsing the extra cost of transport as a proxy, Danne Institute for Research in collaboration with Financial Derivatives Company calculated the economic cost of traffic congestion to an individual who lives and works in Lagos. That is the additional cost of public transport or fuel; money that could have been saved or spent on other things.\n\nThe survey found that public transport users spend N359.27 extra on average daily (N1,796.35 per week), due to traffic. The opportunity cost of this is either a reduction in consumption or a decline in savings.\n\nThe survey also found that due to traffic, the additional amount car owners spend on fuel weekly on the average is N3,044.97. The range \u2013 the difference between the highest and the lowest amount \u2013 is N16,800.\n\nWhile Lagosians who own a car spend N133,978.68 extra on fuel each year, those who use public transport spend N79,039.40 each year.\n\nIn a country with a high unemployment rate and an extended family system, this is money that could have been spent on feeding or training relatives\u2019 or simply saved for the future.\n\n\u201cOn a daily basis, more than 8 million people move in 5 million vehicles on a tiny road network of 9,204 roads, including two toll ways and three bridges linking the Mainland to the Island,\u201d notes Franca Ovadje, executive director of Danne Institute of Research.\n\nAccording to research by Danne Institute, the state has spent 35 percent of its budget in the last two decades on infrastructure, but traffic in Lagos persists.\n\nBusinessDay learns that LAMATA has been grappling with securing the right-of-way since construction of the rail lines commenced. But it says it is now managing the challenge effectively. The agency assures residents it is working assiduously to ensure the project is delivered at the announced timeline, but this is if all goes well.\n\n\u201cThe project would be completed within the announced deadline. However, we are all subject to nature. If there is no force majeure, we should be able to complete it within the announced period,\u201d LAMATA states.",

But due to the traffic, she does not wait.\n\nShe believes the rail transit system will bring significant relief and make life better for people in her line of business.\n\n\u201cThe stress is just too much,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the rail will be possible in December, as they said, I\u2019ll be very happy.\u201d\n\nOne major expectation from the completion of the Blue and Red rail lines is that it could cut traffic congestion by 50 percent in Lagos, a big boost for the economy.\n\nLagos residents have long complained about low productivity levels, as some miss out on business opportunities due to heavy traffic.\n\nRead also: Lagos rail lines begin commercial operations 2023 \u2013 Sanwo-Olu\n\nUsing the extra cost of transport as a proxy, Danne Institute for Research in collaboration with Financial Derivatives Company calculated the economic cost of traffic congestion to an individual who lives and works in Lagos. That is the additional cost of public transport or fuel; money that could have been saved or spent on other things.\n\nThe survey found that public transport users spend N359.27 extra on average daily (N1,796.35 per week), due to traffic. The opportunity cost of this is either a reduction in consumption or a decline in savings.\n\nThe survey also found that due to traffic, the additional amount car owners spend on fuel weekly on the average is N3,044.97. The range \u2013 the difference between the highest and the lowest amount \u2013 is N16,800.\n\nWhile Lagosians who own a car spend N133,978.68 extra on fuel each year, those who use public transport spend N79,039.40 each year.\n\nIn a country with a high unemployment rate and an extended family system, this is money that could have been spent on feeding or training relatives\u2019 or simply saved for the future.\n\n\u201cOn a daily basis, more than 8 million people move in 5 million vehicles on a tiny road network of 9,204 roads, including two toll ways and three bridges linking the Mainland to the Island,\u201d notes Franca Ovadje, executive director of Danne Institute of Research.\n\nAccording to research by Danne Institute, the state has spent 35 percent of its budget in the last two decades on infrastructure, but traffic in Lagos persists.\n\nBusinessDay learns that LAMATA has been grappling with securing the right-of-way since construction of the rail lines commenced. But it says it is now managing the challenge effectively. The agency assures residents it is working assiduously to ensure the project is delivered at the announced timeline, but this is if all goes well.\n\n\u201cThe project would be completed within the announced deadline. However, we are all subject to nature. If there is no force majeure, we should be able to complete it within the announced period,\u201d LAMATA states.",

          "title": "Explainer: What to know about Lagos\u2019 rail ambition",
          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s economic hub is a city where millions of people live, work and traverse the Mainland and the Island.\n\nOccupying 3,345 square kilometres of which about 22 percent are covered by lagoons and creeks, making Lagos not only the smallest of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states by landmass, but also a city under intense pressure from inadequate public infrastructure for its growing population.\n\nIn 2006, Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA), a World Bank-assisted agency of the Lagos State government, secured an approval to develop Lagos Light-Rail Mass Transit (LRMT) system.\n\nIt was an audacious move that will see to the development of six rail lines and a monorail that will daily carry millions of commuters across different parts of the state.\n\nThe proposed rail systems are a part of the Lagos Strategic Transport Master (along with the Lagos Urban Transport Project) that seeks to integrate rail lines, 14 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and 26 water routes.\n\nAccording to LAMATA, the urban transport implementation agency of the state, the six rail systems that are differentiated by colours are: Green line, Purple line, Yellow line, Orange line, Blue line and Red line.\n\nGreen Line is a 68km rail designed to run through Marina, Victoria Island, Lekki Phase 1, Ajah, Lekki 2, Ogombo, Elepetu, Eluju, Lekki Airport and Lekki Free Trade Zone and projected to carry over 495,000 passengers per day at starting, rising to over a million in 2031.\n\nPurple Line is a 60km rail designed to run through Redemption Camp, Mowe, Long Bridge, Isheri, Toll Gate, Omole, Ogba, Agege, Iyana Ipaja, Isheri Osun, Igando, Iba, Estate, LASU, Okokomaiko and Ojo. It is projected to move 549,000 per day, and could do 1.3 million by 2031.\n\nRead Also: Lagos rail lines begin commercial operations 2023 \u2013 Sanwo-Olu\n\nYellow Line is a 34km rail system designed to traverse Otta, Meran, Alimosho, Ipaja, Isheri Osun, Ejigbo, Mafoluku, Isolo, Surulere and the National Theatre, with a projected daily capacity of 238,000 passengers, rising to 486,000 passengers in 2031.\n\nAlso captured in the rail mass transportation plan is Orange Line:\n\nThis 48km line is designed to run through Ikeja, Alausa, Magodo, Mile 12, Irawo, Itolowo, MajidunAwori, Majidun Ogolonto, Agric Ikorodu, Alapadi, Maya, Eligana, Isiwu, Ibere, Imota and Agbowa in Ikorodu, and will move about 378,000 daily by 2031.\n\nWhile these four rail lines have remained only on paper, the Blue and Red lines have been receiving attention.\n\nWith an estimated 20 million population, Lagos conveniently ranks the most populous West African city, but the city lags peers like Johannesburg and Cairo in organised and efficient public transportation systems.\n\nThe Johannesburg Park Station in South Africa, which is the centre of the Witwatersrand Metrorail network, with daily commuter rail services running west to Carletonville, Randfontein and Soweto; east to Springs, Nigel and Daveyton; north to Pretoria and south to Vereeniging. The Park Station is also the terminus of Shosholoza Meyl long-distance services to Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, East London, among other locations.\n\nUnlike Johannesburg, the absence of an efficient public transportation system in Lagos, analysts believe, has thrown up what is now seen as an \u2018Okada economy,\u2019 an aberration in a 21st Century city where commercial motorcycles are taking over major roads to offer services as traffic congestion locks down vehicles.\n\nAs part of the solutions to address this anomaly, a former governor of Lagos, Babatunde Fashola, relying on the public transportation master plan designed by LAMATA, flagged off the construction of a Blue Line rail system at Orile-Iganmu in 2009. This raised hopes, especially among residents who ply the Okokomaiko-Mile 2, Alaba-Orile- National Arts Theatre- CMS- Marina route.\n\nThe 27-kilometre rail line from Okokomaiko to Marina is designed to be developed in phases, with LAMATA as supervisor, and the China Construction and Civil Engineering Company (CCECC) as the contractors.\n\nThe rail system is designed to lift 500,000 passengers daily. The first phase will be running from Mile 2 to Marina with stop-overs at Orile-Iganmu and National Arts Theatre in a journey that is faster, safer, reliable, and efficient.\n\nThe system, according to LAMATA, will be coming with an added advantage of reduced fares compared to the unregulated commercial buses on that route, 45 minutes travel time as against the current average of two hours, as well as cut congestion by 50 percent.\n\nBeyond this, the rail line is conceived to encourage the use of a public transportation system with thousands of vehicles to be taken off the road in what will reduce the present level of carbon emissions in the densely populated commercial city.\n\n\u201cThe project has taken off; the baby has been born; it is left for us to nurture it to adulthood. This is going to be the most impactful project this state has ever had. You can only imagine the number of people that will be employed, both directly and indirectly, when the project is finished. It will reduce travel time and all the stress associated with traffic will be removed.\n\nLagosians will travel in comfort,\u201d said Fashola in 2012, three years into the life of the project.\n\nBut, more than a decade after commencement, the project has dragged, dimming hope and expectation.\n\nHowever, the current governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has rekindled hope, promising to complete and deliver the project in 2022.\n\nDuring a tour of the Blue line and Red line rail project sites in September, Sanwo-Olu said the Lagos Rail Mass Transit (LRMT) project would be completed by the last quarter of 2022.\n\nEarlier in the year, April precisely, Sanwo-Olu performed the ground-breaking of another important rail line- the 37-km Red Line, which will run from Agbado to Oyingbo.\n\nAccording to him, flagging off construction work on the Red Line represents a major breakthrough in his administration\u2019s drive to deliver an integrated transportation model that would ease road congestion in the state.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about the ongoing rail projects being undertaken by the state government. There are jobs being provided to Nigerians engaged by the contractor at all stages of the construction work.\n\n\u201cThree of the stations will be constructed with the Lagos-Ibadan Railway Modernisation Project by the federal government at Agbado, Agege and Ebute Metta Junction. The remaining six would be constructed as independent stations at Iju, Ikeja, Oshodi, Mushin Yaba and Oyingbo.\n\n\u201cThe phase two which would be mostly elevated would have stations at Iddo and Ebute-Ero before terminating at Marina where a huge interchange is planned to manage commuters on the Red, Green and Blue Rail lines, BRT buses and those using the waterways.\n\nSome unique characteristics of the Red Line, according to Fredrick Oladeinde, the Lagos State commissioner for transportation, are its integration with the Ikeja Bus Terminal, Oshodi \u2013 Abule-Egba Bus Rapid Transit, the future Orange Line, which goes from Ikeja to Agbowa, and the General Aviation Terminal One of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport through a skywalk.\n\nThis particular station which has been appropriately named Ikeja Train Centre also has facilities for park and ride and commercial spaces. Also, the Oshodi Train Station will integrate with the Oshodi Bus Terminal and there\u2019s provision for adequate park and ride services and commercial spaces.\n\n\u201cWhat we have seen at the Ikeja Station, which is the second biggest station after the one being built at Marina, gives us so much hope that the projects are on course.\n\n\u201cBased on the physical assessment, we believe that the timelines set for the completion of major engineering work are on track. We believe that our contractor is working on schedule.\n\n\u201cAlthough there are a few hiccups, we believe we will be able to address and surmount them. By the last quarter of 2022, we hope that trains will move on both corridors. And by 2023, we expect to see the full operation of both Blue and Red Lines,\u201d Sanwo-Olu assured.\n\nTo ensure delivery of the project on the set date, the state government has decided that there would be quarterly assessments and monitoring of the two rail projects, to avoid pitfalls that can stall the progress of work being done.\n\nThe Red Line is to have six over-passes constructed at strategic level crossings to eliminate interactions between the rail tracks, vehicular and pedestrian traffic.\n\nSpeaking specifically on the Blue Line, Sanwo-Olu said the Marina Terminus would be a transportation hub offering intermodal transportation services to Lagosians.\n\n\u201cAt the Marina Station, not only are we building rail tracks, underneath we will have a bus station as well, for the BRT and First-and-Last Mile buses.\n\n\u201cThere will also be a ferry service at the Marina Station for those who want to travel on the waterways,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "ANALYSIS: How Nigerian govt can correct injustice meted out to senior army officers",
          "text": "It is now more than five years since the Nigerian Army forced 38 senior officers out of service, an action the court has repeatedly declared to be illegal. Following the court judgements and repeated appeals to President Muhammadu Buhari for redress by the affected officers, PREMIUM TIMES can report that the matter has become a subject of memos exchanged in the high government circles, including the presidency, the justice ministry, and the defence headquarters.\n\nLetters seen by PREMIUM TIMES suggest that the reality of the arbitrariness, as well as its consequent implications, is not clear to the authorities. For example, in a letter dated July 6, 2021, to the Minister of Defence, Bashir Magashi, the Chief of Defence Staff, Lucky Irabor, admitted to the impropriety of the military\u2019s action against the 38 officers, many of them the country\u2019s finest.\n\nIn the letter, Mr Irabor, a general, mentioned court judgements for the reinstatement of the officers that the authorities have continued to disregard and said, if that continues, it would affect the psyche and motivation of serving and future personnel of the armed forces.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES also understands that Mr Buhari has, through his Chief of Staff, Ibrahim Gambari, sought advice from the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, on how to ensure justice. Subsequently, Mr Malami has sought comment from the defence chief, Mr Irabor. Insiders said Mr Irabor has claimed difficulty in determining the best course of action to handle the matter.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES obtained submissions from military sources, including serving and retired officers, who suggested ways they said the authorities could take to deliver justice. These ways are summarised below:\n\nThose Senior officers that have reached their Run Out Date\n\nAll affected senior officers of the rank of Major Generals that have reached their run out date should have their retirement converted to Voluntary Retirement and effective from their actual run out date. Outstanding salary up until the effective date of voluntary retirement should then be paid to them.\n\nSenior officers of the rank of Brigadier Generals that have reached their run out date should be promoted to voluntary retirement in the rank of Major General. Voluntary Retirement should be effective from their run out date or date of exit of their course mates while their salary is paid up till the date of voluntary retirement.\n\nThose that still have Active Years of Service Left\n\na. Immediate reinstatement of unjustly retired officers with years of Active Service left and with an immediate promotion to their respective next higher rank \u2013 this is to ensure justice to them by putting their careers back on course as all the victimized officers are already behind their coursemates by at least one promotion due to no fault of theirs.\n\nb. Those that are already 2 ranks down relative to their coursemates should be promoted to their second rank under special consideration using only one-year Personal Evaluation Report \u2013 thus, a second promotion after one year of reinstatement.\n\nc. Payment of all outstanding salary/allowances from Jun 9, 2016, till the date of reinstatement.\n\nd. Outstanding career courses ie National Defence College (NDC) should be undertaken with their promoted rank \u2013 after Immediate promotion to brigadier general, those yet to do NDC will undertake NDC abroad or attend the National Institute at Kuru with their Brig-Gen ranks. Similarly, the Colonels that are due for the same course should also be nominated to attend either overseas Colleges or National Institute.\n\nThe Late Officer \u2013 Lieutenant Colonel Baba-Ochankpa\n\na. Posthumous promotion to immediate next rank effective his promotion due date.\n\nb. Classification of his death as Active-Duty Death, as he was supposed to be serving at the time of occurrence.\n\nb. Payment of all outstanding salary/allowances from Jun 9, 2016, to the time he died.",

          "title": "Itunu Babalola, 23-year-old Nigerian lady wrongfully jailed in Ivory Coast is dead",
          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe tragic story of Itunu Olajumoke Babalola, a 23-year-old Nigerian lady, imprisoned in Ivory Coast on false charges, has seen even more tragic end.\n\nBabalola was pronounced dead yesterday, after battling disease she contracted while in detention.\n\nThis was made known by investigative journalist, David Hundeyin on Sunday night in a thread on his Twitter page.\n\nHundeyin, who had travelled to Ivory Coast as an undercover reporter to investigate and report on Babalola\u2019s case, said the the young lady contracted an infection in prison which led to her death on Sunday night.\n\nSharing videos s attached to the thread showed Babalola writhing in pain on the hospital bed after which she gave up the ghost.\n\nIn a series of tweets, David Hundeyin wrote: \u201cI have just received a message from Cote d\u2019Ivoire about Itunu Babalola. She is still in prison in Abidjan where she has contracted a serious infection and apparently she is dying. All those promises by NIDCOM, Abike Dabiri, OYSG (Oyo State Government) etc \u2013 audio.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s finally dying. She\u2019s finally dying. Well done to the Nigerian government. Well done to NIDCOM (Nigerians in Diaspora Commission) and everyone responsible for this, another young Nigerian is biting the dust. Round of applause for all of you.\n\n\u201cWrite a federal petition, do a thread with 15,000 retweets, Engage with government, do an investigative story. Even travelled illegally to Cote d\u2019Ivoire in a canoe to gather facts.\n\n\u201cNothing we have not done to try to save this girl\u2019s life but we come from Nigeria. Eight months of effort, 8 months of \u2018Uncle David God bless you, eight months of hoping for Nigeria to prove me wrong FOR ONCE\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all over Itunu is dead. She died this night, just confirmed.\u201d\n\nHundeyin had on March 14, posted a thread via his Twitter handle, @DavidHundeyin, narrating Babalola\u2019s ordeal in the hands of Ivorian authorities, while appealing to Nigerian government to attend to her case, to no avail.\n\n\u201cIn September 2019, 21 year-old Itunu, a trader based in Bondoukou, Cote d\u2019Ivoire traveled to Nigeria to visit her sick mom in Ibadan. Unknown to her, her return to Cote d\u2019Ivoire would mark the start of a harrowing ordeal in a notorious Ivorian prison, which is still ongoing,\u201d Hundeyin had narrated.\n\n\u201cShortly before Itunu was due to travel, her flat was burgled and items worth more than N300,000 were stolen including her TV and gas cooker.\n\n\u201cDespite the blow, she decided to travel anyway after reporting the incident to the police. She returned from her trip in October 2019.\n\n\u201cUpon returning, she was informed by a lodger she left in her flat that the thief had been identified.\n\n\u201cThe thief turned out to be a 14 year-old boy who lived nearby. His embarrassed dad apologised and admitted that his son was a habitual thief. The items had already been sold.\n\n\u201cItunu reported this to the police who told her to return on Tuesday Nov 5, 2019. The appointment held on Wednesday Nov 6.\n\n\u201cThere she says, the DPO informed her that the suspect was in fact his nephew. He then offered her a settlement worth roughly N100,000 to drop the case.\n\n\u201cShe refused the settlement, citing the disparity between the value of the stolen items and what was offered. Next she says, the visibly enraged DPO tried everything to frustrate her into dropping the case, including making her travel to Abidjan for a police appointment.\n\n\u2018In Abidjan, she hired a lawyer to attend the appointment with her, all to no avail as the police refused to cooperate. Frustrated, she returned home to Bondoukou.\n\n\u201cAround 5PM the following day, a convoy of police vehicles showed up outside her house and publicly arrested her. On getting to the station, she was charged with theft \u2013 the theft of her own items in her own apartment.\n\n\u201cShe spent the next 4 days in police custody, after which she was taken out of the cell and offered her freedom if she agreed to sign papers dropping her case.\n\n\u201cFor whatever reason despite the clear bad faith displayed by the Ivorian police, Itunu says she rejected the offer and chose to go to court instead.\n\n\u201cShe says she then overheard an officer saying \u201cElle est une Nig\u00e9riane? Elle mourra ici!\u201d (\u201cShe\u2019s a Nigerian? She will die here!\u201d)\n\n\u201cThe decision to go to court turned out to be a monumental error of judgment compounded by her own naivety about the Ivorian justice system.\n\n\u201cThe (French-speaking) court did not allow her adequate legal representation or give her a chance to properly state her case.\n\n\u201cShe was speedily convicted and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. Further complicating this was her decision to identify herself to the court as \u201cBecky Paul\u201d.\n\n\u201cShe says she did this to avoid getting her family name mixed up in bad news and potentially upsetting her aged mom.\n\n\u2018As a result, for the past one year and 4 months since her conviction, Itunu alias \u201cBecky Paul\u201d has become, to all intents and purposes, a forgotten inmate at the notorious Maison d\u2019arr\u00eat et de Correction Bondoukou (Bondoukou Remand and Correction Facility).\n\n\u201cWhen her Nigerian friends in Cote d\u2019Ivoire approached the Nigerian Embassy in Abidjan to provide consular assistance for her case, officials reportedly asked for N400,000 to get her a passport before anything can be done.\n\n\u201cShe says she has exhausted all her savings over the past year, spending well over N1m to try to clear her name while the Ivorian justice system as well as individual prison officials collude to frustrate all her efforts.\n\n\u201cShe has lost hope and she has attempted suicide twice. This is an appeal for the sake of an innocent Nigerian women stuck in a hostile foreign prison after being set up by corrupt officials to cover up a crime committed by an Ivorian DPO\u2019s nephew.\u201d\n\nFollowing Hundeyin\u2019s thread, the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NODICOM), headed by Mrs. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, said on March 15, that it would investigate the matter and that the Nigerian mission to Abidjan will also help out.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has been to several countries such as Togo, Benin Republic, Brazil, South-Africa, etc to facilitate the release of some Nigerians wrongfully arrested and incarcerated,\u201d had assured in tweet via its handle @nidcom_gov\n\nSubsequently on the same March 15, Mrs. Dabiri-Erewa noted that \u201cOur mission in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is handling . The place in question is about 8 hours drive from Abidjan so they hope to be there tomorrow.\u201d\n\nDays later on March 19, NODICOM released a statement saying it has established some facts in the matter.\n\nThe statement signed by Gabriel Odu, the commission\u2019s spokesperson, had said, \u201cFollowing painstaking investigations by the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission and the Nigeria Mission in Abidjan, Cote D\u2019ivoire,\n\n\u201cIt is now confirmed that Itunu Babalola, a Nigerian living in Abidjan was wrongfully charged and incarcerated for a crime she did not commit.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Chairman/CEO Nigerians in Diaspora Commission Hon Abike Dabiri-Erewa the Charge D\u2019Affaires of the Nigerian Mission in C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire Mr Mohammed Gana , sent officials of the mission to Bondoukou, a city eight hours outside Abidjan when the case was brought to his attention. Plans are underway to engage the services of a legal Luminary to prove the innocence of Itunu Babalola at the Court of Appeal after the accused had spent two years out of a ten year jail term for an offense she did not commit.\n\n\u201cReports indicate that the new Prosecutor assigned to the case has given assurances of a fair and unbiased review and retrial of the case to secure the release of Itunu Babalola. Reports also allegedly indicate that the former prosecutor in collaboration with the police twisted the case and accused Itunu Babalolo of human trafficking hence her conviction for 20yrs although the sentence was reduced to 10yrs from which she served 2yrs so far. Itunu Babalola whose family is from Oyo State, Nigeria has been living in Bondoukou, Cote d\u2019ivoire for a long time but got entangled in a legal battle.when she reported the burglary of her house to the Police\n\n\u201cOn efforts made to secure her bail, the prosecutor said it is only the Court that can grant her bail as she has already been convicted We will continue to monitor the case as it unfolds.\u201d\n\nThe case however, failed to proceed as expected, and Miss Babalola eventually died after contracting a disease at the detention facility.",

          "title": "2023 Presidency: Anyim raises the stakes",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe announcement, few days ago, by Nigeria\u2019s former senate president, Anyim Pius Anyim, of his intention to run for president in 2023, has been received coldly by the country\u2019s vibrant social media savvy youth population. Those who didn\u2019t question his credentials as presidential material, wondered what he accomplished as senate president between 2000 and 2003 to justify his quest to rule Nigeria.\n\nSocial media have in recent years played critical roles in shaping public opinions about individuals in the public sphere, which explains increasing interest by politicians who spend huge sums of money on influencers. In particular President Muhammadu Buhari rode to power in 2015 on the back of social media, as thousands used Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other platforms to canvass support for him and his party, the All Progressive Congress (APC), which was critical to their take over of power at the expense of Goodluck Jonathan and the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nAlthough questions remain about how much impact social media ultimately have on election day, there can be little doubt about its growing influence on politics in Nigeria and elsewhere, and for the former senate president, it should be a concern. Perhaps something to work on as he plans to launch his power bid.\n\nHowever, the reservations are understandable. Anyim is a reserved person who is not given to making comments on controversial political issues or attending public functions to make statements. And importantly, a large number of the country\u2019s social media crowd were too young \u2013 or weren\u2019t even born \u2013 when he was the number three man, and therefore cannot recall how, as senate president, even at a young age \u2013 he was only 39 in year 2000 \u2013 he demonstrated rare leadership qualities, displayed maturity and brought much needed stability to the hitherto volatile red chamber, and ensured there was sanity in the business of lawmaking, which was his mandate. And of course, served till the end of his term in 2003, becoming the first senate president to do so in the Fourth Republic.\n\nBut being senate president is not same as governing Nigeria, and becoming the country\u2019s president is not by any means a walk in the park. Anyim is stepping into what is for him, an uncharted territory. And the questions about his credentials are not out of place, even if not well considered, or asked with intention to discredit him.\n\nFor Nigeria\u2019s younger generation, he is very much as an unknown quantity. But for those old enough to know, and politically exposed enough to understand, his decision to throw his hat in the ring, could be a game changer. And perhaps the first real indication that a Nigerian president of Southeast extraction is huge possibility.\n\n\u201cAnyim is a committed Nigerian; someone I have high regard for,\u201d noted the Emir of Kano, His Royal Highness, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, who presented Zik Prize in Leadership Award to the former senate president fortnight ago. \u201cHe is a very experienced person, and I hope he continues to avail of his experience\u2026 \u201d\n\nWith former Anambra State governor, Mr. Peter Obi \u2013 the other expected contender in the PDP \u2013 reluctant to indicate interest to run, many had continued to argue, amid strong agitation for a Southeast president, that the region is not yet prepared to bid for power. But Anyim\u2019s declaration will change this narrative.\n\nShrewd, calm and calculated, Anyim rarely makes any political move unless he has red his compass well, made his calculations and therefore is fairly certain of the possible outcome. And usually he takes people by surprise. His decision to run for president in 2023, couldn\u2019t have been made hastily, and the populace may need to pay attention.\n\n\u201cPeople usually don\u2019t see him coming because he is not loud,\u201d said Mr. Sam Nwaobasi, who worked as media advisor to him during his time as secretary to government. \u201cBefore he takes a step, he would have thought it through. He is a deep thinker.\u201d\n\nAnyim is a different kind of politician. A deeply religious person, and dedicated member of the Assemblies of God Church, his godliness is something quite atypical in the political scene. But it\u2019s what has guided him through life. He doesn\u2019t take a major step without having thoroughly committed same to God, and as he puts it, heard God\u2019s counsel.\n\n\u201cI act with the belief that the Almighty God is behind me,\u201d Anyim said. \u201cWhen I won a senate seat in 1998, God made it possible. I heard His voice clearly asking me to contest.\u201d\n\nIndeed, when Anyim got elected into the Senate, aged just 38 \u2013 the second time he would be winning senate election in his constituency, having initially won a senatorial election under United Nigeria Congress Party (UNCP) in 1998 \u2013 he was possibly the youngest member of the upper legislative chamber, and it would not have been out of place to assume that he was there to make up the numbers. For at his age, it would have been easy to imagine that being a senator was already a huge accomplishment. But a year later in 2000, he clinched the coveted office of Senate President, replacing the late flamboyant Dr. Chuba Okadigbo who was impeached the same year, and thus becoming the number three highest office holder in the country at just 39.\n\n\u201cPrayer is his ultimate strength. He submits totally to the will of God,\u201d noted Mr. Vin Mgbemena, close associate and former Managing Director of Orange Drugs Limited. \u201cRemember the way he handled the senate when he was senate president; the way he handled some of the untouchables in his seniors then, that will tell you the kind of person he is. He is not somebody you can take for granted.\u201d\n\nThe battle that consumed Okadigbo was no less intense than the one that ensued over his replacement. It was a contest that featured ranking lawmakers from Abia, Enugu, Ebonyi among other states, some with close connection to the Olusegun Obasanjo led executive in Aso Rock which wielded colossal influence in every aspect of political life. But guided by God, the young Anyim outwitted all, becoming the youngest senate president in Nigeria\u2019s history, and not indeed the first to serve till the end of his term.\n\nAnyim is a different breed. Some have described him as a child destiny, specially favoured by God. His life story, too, is something quite extraordinary. Born on February 19, 1961, his second anniversary was already something out of the ordinary. And perhaps, it was the earliest indicator that he is one on a mission.\n\nBefore he came along, his mother had had six male children, non of whom lived long enough to mark their second birthday. His extraordinary childhood, as it has turned out, was only a token of what was to come.\n\nBut growing up Anyim faced poverty and daunting challenges. He missed school sometimes because there was no money to pay his fees. He went hungry sometimes at school, because there was nothing to eat. He hawked bread and other items because he had to raise money for his education. But in the end, it has emerged that the vicissitudes of his early life, were invisible hands grooming him for the mission for which he came.\n\nWith only his mother, who had become one of four wives, to rely on, Anyim proceeded to Ishiagu High School for his secondary school education. And from there, to Federal School of Arts & Science, Aba, and Imo State University where he read Law, defying the odds to graduate in 1987 as one of the best.\n\nAnd as one destined for big accomplishments, his posting to the Directorate for Social Mobilisation, a federal government agency, in Sokoto State, during his national youth service, marked a turning point. From there, he proceeded to the National Commission for Refugees (NCR) and soon became Head of Protection Department, a job that included provision of legal services and political protection for refugees. Tutored by Professor Jerry Gana, he would go on to make odd-defying accomplishments.\n\nHaving served his term as senate president in 2003, and deciding not seek another term, Anyim largely retired to a quiet life. And would again announce his presence on the national stage, nearly a decade later in January 2010 when he led a delegation of prominent Nigerians to call on the evidently indisposed then president, Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, to transmit a letter to the National Assembly to save from danger\n\nThe senate, heeding his call, and those of other well-meaning Nigerians, subsequently on February 9, passed a vote to make then vice president, Goodluck Jonathan, acting president. In May 2011, following his victory in the presidential election, Jonathan appointed him secretary to the government of the federation. In that capacity, he proved his mettle.\n\nAhead of 2023, he has set his eyes on the big prize, convinced that time has come for him to step up and contribute more to national development. It is a huge task, especially given complex nature of Nigeria\u2019s politics, and the fact that there other contenders from across the country, with more resources and whom the country\u2019s increasingly polarised polity may tend to favour more.\n\nAnyim, is indeed daring to do what none from his region and tribe has done before: Become Nigeria\u2019s president. The stakes are even higher today, with President Muhammadu Buhari having, in many people\u2019s views, divided the country along ethnic and religious lines in ways never witnessed before with his sectionalism.\n\nBut he is as qualified as anyone, and although it may not be obvious to many, he has many things going for him, which could well see him emerge victorious in 2023.\n\nAnyim is a determined person who does his home work well. This determination; the willpower go fight till the end will be a factor.\n\n\u201cAnyim is somebody who doesn\u2019t give up on anything he believes in,\u201d Mgbemena said. \u201cOnce he sets a goal he will do everything within his power to actualize that goal. Again he doesn\u2019t enter any project without first committing it to God. Whatever he wants; whatever decision he wants to take in life, he always consults God, and that has always guided him in everything he has done in life.\u201d\n\nPerhaps more importantly, calls for a president of Igbo extraction in 2023 is getting ever louder. Anyim stands out as probably the most viable candidate for the top job in Southeast, and will be leading the fight for the realisation of the project; one many believe its time has come, and has to be done if the country is to remain united.\n\n\u201cAnyim is a unique personality, and an ideal candidate for president. He has accomplished many things in his political career,\u201d said Abia Onyike, chairman, publicity bureau of Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF). \u201cWithin few months as a senator, he became the senate president and used the office to set the tone for what the leadership of the senate should be for others coming after him. The respect accorded that office today is as a result of the foundation laid by him.\u201d\n\nCries of marginalisation have given rise to simmering insurgency in the Southeast. The agitation for a separate state of Biafra, led by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), is becoming increasingly violent. Many groups have emerged, many more could yet emerge.\n\nMany in the region feel alienated from the Nigerian state. The feeling of alienation is sure to get much worse should they be denied presidency in 2023. In the event, agitation for Biafra could go mainstream. And for a country already battling hydra headed security challenges, it could be a breaking point. It\u2019s a thorny issue the country must have to deal with. And 2023 is will be the year.",
          "summary": "By OBINNA EZUGWUThe announcement, few days ago, by Nigeria\u2019s former senate president, Anyim Pius Anyim, of his intention to run for president in 2023, has been received coldly by the country\u2019s vibrant social media savvy youth population.\nThose who didn\u2019t question his credentials as presidential material, wondered what he accomplished as senate president between 2000 and 2003 to justify his quest to rule Nigeria.\nAnd of course, served till the end of his term in 2003, becoming the first senate president to do so in the Fourth Republic.\nBut being senate president is not same as governing Nigeria, and becoming the country\u2019s president is not by any means a walk in the park.\nHaving served his term as senate president in 2003, and deciding not seek another term, Anyim largely retired to a quiet life.",

          "title": "Paris club refund crisis deepens; FG, states poise for a fight",
          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThe lingering dispute between the governors and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami over the $418 million Paris Club refund debt is getting deeper by the day amid growing trust deficit.\n\nOn Thursday the AGF said it was too late for the 36 governors to seek the reversal of the decision since they had earlier acknowledged the debt and made a commitment to pay the consultants and private firms.\n\nThe aggrieved governors under the aegis of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), had accused Malami of bias in his handling of the disputed debt, saying that funds belonging to the Federation Account should not be arbitrarily deducted.\n\nThe governors\u2019 accusation contained in a statement signed by the Executive Secretary of NGF, Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, was in reaction to a statement by Mr. Malami\u2019s media aide, Umar Gwandu, who had supported deductions of the states\u2019 resources amounting to $418 million from the Federation Account.\n\nThe amount is allegedly owed the consultants and/or contractors for services rendered during negotiations for the refund. The Paris Club fund has since generated dispute among the three tiers of government.\n\nGwandu\u2019s statement was in reaction to interim restraining orders obtained by the states. The Federal High Court Abuja had on Friday (November 5) stopped the federal government from deducting $418 million from the accounts of the 36 states government to settle the judgment debts concerning the Paris and London clubs refund.\n\nThe debts had accrued from court judgments awarding the creditors, who claimed to be consultants and contractors to the states and local governments, various sums of money which currently stand at $418 million. President Muhammadu Buhari, was said to have ignored the protests by the NGF to approve the refund to creditors.\n\nBut according to the NGF spokesman, the decision of the AGF to throw its weight behind the consultants who had been battling desperately to grab $418 million from the accounts of states and local governments raised questions of propriety and spirit of justice.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cThe attention of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, NGF, has been drawn to a statement issued by the media aide to the Attorney General of the Federation, AGF, Umar Gwandu, on Friday, November 5, 2021, published in a national daily of same date in support of deductions of humongous state resources amounting to $418 million from the Federation Account.\n\n\u201cThe payments are made in favour of private contractors and/or consultants for alleged work done to the Paris Club Refunds to the states and local governments. Since the Attorney General of the Federation has not contradicted his aide, it is, therefore, deemed that the statement was issued with his authorization and consent.\n\n\u201cWe need to state quickly that when we first read this press release, we had to double-check to be sure it was not authored by a lawyer representing either one or all the promissory notes recipients.\n\n\u201cThe AGF is supposed to be the chief arbiter in all matters concerning Nigerians, especially the poor masses of this country. It is incumbent upon him to, not just ensure that justice is done, but that justice is seen to have been done.\n\n\u201cThe undue haste, with which the statement was issued even before the service on the AGF of the court processes and the order dated November 5, 2021, restraining the federal government, seems to suggest that there is a special relationship between the Office of the AGF and the consultants over and above Nigerian citizens, whose interest the AGF as the chief law officer of the federation is statutorily bound to always protect.\n\n\u201cThe statement also suggests that the restraining order issued last Friday not only unsettled preconceived plans and angered the unnamed \u2018government officers\u2019 referred to by the media aide.\u201d\n\nBarkindo said Malami\u2019s claim that he intervened to pay the contractors to avoid execution of the judgments against the federal government resources was false.\n\nHe said also that the NGF and LGAs sought to transfer their liability to the federal government, adding that there was no liability to transfer in the first place and that none existed.\n\nThe NGF spokesman said the governors did not provide any undertaking or indemnity to the federal government to act on their behalf as represented by the AGF.\n\nBarkindo advised Malami to remain neutral and protect scarce public resources, instead of taking sides with the consultants.\n\n\u201cLet him advise the contractors to wait until all appeals and litigations in court are concluded. That is the true test of observing the rule of law. There is no other way, uncomfortable as that would appear,\u201d the statement adds.\n\n\u201cState resources needed for critical development should not under any guise be frittered away as payments for contracts whose veracity and authenticity is still a subject of litigation and disputation.\n\n\u201cThese contractors are impecunious and cannot restitute the states/LGAs if the appeals or other litigation are determined against them.\n\n\u201cWe call on the general public to be alert and vigilant. The debt relief granted to Nigeria by the Paris Club in 2005 was meant to enable her to have a respite and use the resources saved for meaningful development.\n\n\u201cIt was not for distribution to private persons to fund their luxurious lives; neither can Nigeria justify her borrowing funds all over the world to fund capital projects and turn round to disburse state resources to individuals in a manner that offends all public sensibilities.\n\n\u201cWe urge all those appointed as gatekeepers to our laws to ensure that the laws of our land are respected and protected. Let professionalism, reasonable caution and due diligence prevail on this matter, please,\u201d the NGF scribe said.\n\nBlowing hot and cold\n\nHowever, the AGF said, not only did the NGF, the Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON) and the consultants enter into a consent judgment of $3,188, 079,505.56 ($3.2 billion) in 2013, they made the commitment to pay and actually made part payments between 2016 and 2017.\n\nHe accused the NGF of blowing hot and cold at the same time and seeking to shut the barn door after the horse had bolted.\n\nOn whether the federal government\u2019s insistence on the deduction would not amount to disrespecting an existing court order and circumventing pending court cases, Malami wondered why the states, which made a part payment since 2013, decided to go to court.\n\nTracing the genesis of the crisis, Malami said: \u201cSometimes as far back as 2013, there was an engagement by the outgoing administration and the NGF in respect of certain consultants that were engaged by the two (NGF and ALGON) for the purpose of recovering certain amounts of money relating to Paris Club refund.\n\n\u201cAnd these consultants that were engaged have indeed, delivered and fundamentally, they were not paid the fees for the services they claimed to have rendered and on account of which they approached the judicial system for the determination of their rights and indeed, the enforcement of their fees.\n\n\u201cNow, in 2013, the then federal government and the governors\u2019 forum came together, agreed and submitted to a consent judgment by the court of law in 2013. That consent judgment is what gave rise to the liability in contention as we are talking today.\n\n\u201cSome years back, the federal government was approached by these consultants for the purpose of payment of their respective professional fees. The federal government then approached the governors\u2019 forum and ALGON and they collectively walked to the federal government and conceded to the position that the consultants have indeed, provided the services and that they were ready and willing to pay.\n\n\u201cThe point of interest arising therefrom is that the governors\u2019 forum and ALGON walked to the federal government and conceded that payment should be deducted from their monies and then, should be effected to the consultants.\n\n\u201cAnd then, in 2016, 2017, these deductions were carried out at the instance of the governors\u2019 forum and ALGON. Now, that was the situation on the ground.\u201d\n\nMalami recalled that since the Federal Government was suspicious of the huge claim the NGF and ALGON made on behalf of the consultants, which was in the region of $3.2b, the FG invited the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the State Security Services (SSS) to verify the services rendered by the consultants.\n\nHe added: \u201cSo, when eventually the services rendered were confirmed, the Federal Government took steps to demand confirmation in writing from ALGON and the governors.\n\n\u201cThe governors individually wrote to the effect that they were liable. ALGON wrote to the effect that they were liable. And eventually, this payment commenced as far back as 2016.\n\n\u201cNow, nothing untoward happened thereafter until perhaps, of recent when the governors wrote seeking to avoid their liability.\n\nReacting to the crisis, a public affairs analyst, Mr. Philips Okoye, who does not understand the need for the consultants, wondered why the states and the local governments were not part of the process that led to the engagement of their (consultants\u2019) services since they were the beneficiaries of the services.\n\nOkoye queried: \u201cDid we really need the services of these consultants? Whose interest is Malami protecting? Why are we so fast in paying this debt?\n\n\u201cHow come the states and local governments that these consultants rendered the service to were not carried along. Who actually signed for these consultants to help in sharing the money?\n\n\u201cDid we really need the consultants? Obasanjo secured the money (the debt relief), the issue now is how it was shared.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a policy analyst, Mr. Michael Ajayi, wondered why the AGF did not make any attempt to challenge the judgment that awarded the payment to the contractors.\n\nHe argued that if there were any need for the service the contractors claimed to have rendered, it is the government agencies that should have done that, not private firms or individuals.\n\n\u201cIt is even the federal government that is supposed to challenge the judgment secured by the consultants, not even the governors, if it (FG) is not interested in filtering away the nation\u2019s resources,\u201d Ajayi said.\n\n\u201cWhat are we paying these contractors for? What did they do? What are the government agencies doing? Are they not the ones that are supposed to render the said service if need be?\u201d",

          "text": "The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has expressed its readiness to embark on another round of industrial action following what it called government\u2019s unfaithfulness in the implementation of the Memorandum of Action (MoA) it signed with the union upon which the last strike action was suspended.\n\nASUU national president, Professor Emmanuel Osodeke, who stated this after body\u2019s National Executive Council (NEC) meeting at the University of Abuja on November 13 and 14, 2021, said government should be held responsible if it failed to address the issues raised within three weeks.\n\nThe union lamented that depsite its meeting with the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, on October 14, 2021, on the major outstanding issues including funding for revitalisation of public universities, earned academic allowances, University Transparency Accountability Solution (UTAS) promotion arrears, renegotiation of 2009 ASUU-FGN agreement, and the inconsistencies in IPPIS payment, the issues remained unattended to.\n\nOsodeke said, \u201cASUU is fully committed to upholding academic integrity in our universities and working to make them more globally competitive. We are equally committed to promoting industrial harmony in the Nigerian University System for as long as all stakeholders are willing and committed to play their parts.\n\n\u201cWe call on all Vice-Chancellors, as the main drivers of the system, to join us in this mission to safeguard the\n\nwaning image of our universities. They have no business trading honorary degrees and academic positions for personal and immediate gains; thereby smearing the collective integrity of committed scholars and other patriots who are working day and night to\n\nuplift the system that produced them.\n\n\u201cOur union shall not shy away from taking the fight to administrators of Nigerian universities as well as internal and external agents who are and external agents who are bent on compromising the standard ASUU has consistently laboured to protect and improve.\n\n\u201cFinally, we call on all patriotic Nigerians and lovers of Nigeria to prevail on the federal and state governments to act fast to prevent another round of industrial crisis in Nigeria\u2019s public universities.\n\n\u201cIt is painful that our Union may soon have no other way of securing the implementation of FGN-ASUU collectively bargained agreements and redressing the criminal neglect of welfare issues of our members by State Governors. Governments of\n\nNigerian should be held responsible should ASUU be forced to activate the strike it patriotically suspended,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, the union said it was not convinced with the appointment of the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, as a Professor by the Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO), Imo State.\n\nRecall that the FUTO chapter off ASUU had recently said standard processes were followed in the appointment of Pantami as Professor of Cybersecurity in the university following an investigation by the panel.\n\nBut reacting, the national leadership of the union said there was something wrong in the appointment of Panatami as Professor.\n\n\u201cThe controversy this appointment has generated is unprecedented in the recent history of Nigerian universities. Indeed, it has generated passionate comments and responses from individuals and groups within and outside the nation.\n\n\u201cThe controversy centres on the perceived roles played by the University administration in the alleged fraudulent appointment, and the subsequent seeming endorsement by the ASUU branch at FUTO. Consequently, some media commentators \u2013 print electronic and social have impugned that the national body of ASUU was in agreement with the position of ASUU FUTO Branch on the said appointment.\n\n\u201cNothing could be farther from the truth. ASUU, as a Union has never supported, promoted or endorsed any illegal appointment or promotion of academics in any Nigerian University, including those of its members. As a Union, we have always insisted on strict adherence to due process and the rule of law in all aspects of university administration and governance,\u201d ASUU national president stated.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the union rejected the FUTO chapter of ASUU committee\u2019s report and set up an independent committee to investigate all issues surrounding the controversial appointment of Dr. Pantami as a Professor of Cyber Security in the University.\n\nHe added, \u201cThereafter, the position of ASUU-NEC shall be made known to the public. In addition, another committee shall visit the ASUU-FUTO branch with a view to determining the role of members in the controversial appointment and report back to NEC for further action.\u201d\n\nThe union further lamented the state of insecurity, especially in the educational institutions which is gradually becoming a norm, saying the security architecture in the country has almost collapsed.\n\nIt said, \u201cThere is need for government to ensure porous borders around the northwest and northeast to mitigate the spread of terrorists and bandits from neighboring countries, and increase political will and determination to end insecurity to disprove the popular cliche that \u2018if I security lasts for more than 24 hours, the government has a hand in it.\u201d",

Governments of\n\nNigerian should be held responsible should ASUU be forced to activate the strike it patriotically suspended,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, the union said it was not convinced with the appointment of the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, as a Professor by the Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO), Imo State.\n\nRecall that the FUTO chapter off ASUU had recently said standard processes were followed in the appointment of Pantami as Professor of Cybersecurity in the university following an investigation by the panel.\n\nBut reacting, the national leadership of the union said there was something wrong in the appointment of Panatami as Professor.\n\n\u201cThe controversy this appointment has generated is unprecedented in the recent history of Nigerian universities. Indeed, it has generated passionate comments and responses from individuals and groups within and outside the nation.\n\n\u201cThe controversy centres on the perceived roles played by the University administration in the alleged fraudulent appointment, and the subsequent seeming endorsement by the ASUU branch at FUTO. Consequently, some media commentators \u2013 print electronic and social have impugned that the national body of ASUU was in agreement with the position of ASUU FUTO Branch on the said appointment.\n\n\u201cNothing could be farther from the truth. ASUU, as a Union has never supported, promoted or endorsed any illegal appointment or promotion of academics in any Nigerian University, including those of its members. As a Union, we have always insisted on strict adherence to due process and the rule of law in all aspects of university administration and governance,\u201d ASUU national president stated.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the union rejected the FUTO chapter of ASUU committee\u2019s report and set up an independent committee to investigate all issues surrounding the controversial appointment of Dr. Pantami as a Professor of Cyber Security in the University.\n\nHe added, \u201cThereafter, the position of ASUU-NEC shall be made known to the public. In addition, another committee shall visit the ASUU-FUTO branch with a view to determining the role of members in the controversial appointment and report back to NEC for further action.\u201d\n\nThe union further lamented the state of insecurity, especially in the educational institutions which is gradually becoming a norm, saying the security architecture in the country has almost collapsed.\n\nIt said, \u201cThere is need for government to ensure porous borders around the northwest and northeast to mitigate the spread of terrorists and bandits from neighboring countries, and increase political will and determination to end insecurity to disprove the popular cliche that \u2018if I security lasts for more than 24 hours, the government has a hand in it.\u201d",
          "summary": "Osodeke said, \u201cASUU is fully committed to upholding academic integrity in our universities and working to make them more globally competitive.\nWe are equally committed to promoting industrial harmony in the Nigerian University System for as long as all stakeholders are willing and committed to play their parts.\nGovernments ofNigerian should be held responsible should ASUU be forced to activate the strike it patriotically suspended,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe controversy this appointment has generated is unprecedented in the recent history of Nigerian universities.\nConsequently, some media commentators \u2013 print electronic and social have impugned that the national body of ASUU was in agreement with the position of ASUU FUTO Branch on the said appointment.",

          "text": "Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-olu, has said at 6% simple interest rate, Lagos State was best committed to providing affordable housing for the teeming populace compared to any other organisation, state or federal government.\n\nSpeaking at the 2021 Housing Summit held at the Abuja Sheraton Hotel penultimate week, Sanwo-Olu said said his administration has\n\ncommissioned 11 housing estates so far.\n\nRepresented by the Commissioner for Housing, Hon Moruf Akinpelu Fatai, he said: \u201cwhat am selling at Iponri for 30m am selling it in Igbogbo at 8.5m. You pay 5 percent and you pay the rest over the next nine years but we don\u2019t allow you sell until you have finished paying at simple interest rate of 6 percent.\n\n\u201cI challenge any organization here in Nigeria, either federal or state that has been able to provide that.\u201d\n\nOn urban renewal plans, Sanwoolu said \u201cwe are looking at a position that in the next 20 years we have to be thinking vertical, we are looking at the Singapore and Hong Kong models, we have 50 hectares in Ijanikin so that the rail line can evacuate people into the island.\u201d\n\nIn the lead paper presented by the President, Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers (NIESV), Emmanuel Okas Wike, he said that the country would require the sum of N24trillion to bridge the existing housing deficit.\n\nThe NiESV boss lamented that past efforts by government to make houses available for the masses failed because the private sectors were ignored.\n\nHe noted that though there were many unoccupied houses in the city, especially in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), the masses cannot afford them and so continue to lack decent accommodation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWike stressed that private sector involvement could help bridge the yawning housing gap\n\nReferencing recent comments by the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, disputing speculations that the nation\u2019s housing deficit put at 17 million units with annual increase by 20 percent, Wike disclosed that the Minister had commissioned some professionals to research into the matter and come up \u201cwith a genuine, reliable, scientific and verifiable data on the nation\u2019s actual housing needs and make suggestions on way forward.\u201d\n\nTo address housing deficit in the country, Wike suggested the creation of Housing Infrastructure Fund and the encouragement of the use of local materials by the government.\n\nThe Managing Director of the Federal Housing Authority (FHA), Sen. Gbenga Ashafa, represented by General Manager Procurement, Mr Anetor Thomas also advocated government collaboration with the private sector even as he maintained that there should be transition from cash and carry home ownership to mortgage system as practiced in the developed world.\n\nHe equally urged the government to look into banks\u2019 interest rates adding that the prevailing rates are so high and unattractive for developers.\n\nIn his address the Convener and CEO of Housing Circuit Limited Seun Jegede identified corruption as a major cause of Housing deficit.\n\nIn his remarks, \u2018corruption is endemic in the body politics, invariably affecting the Housing chain and we are all culpable. The recent report from ICPC about two civil servants said to have allegedly acquired over 300 houses is a reflection of our moral decadence\u2019.\n\nThe Event had in attendance Commissioners for Housing drawn from different states, policy makers, professionals, real estate developers and enthusiasts.\n\nFive participants at the event bagged different awards for their contributions in their various fields in the built industry.\n\nThe awardees included a retired Surveyor General of the Federation (SGoF), Sur. Taiwo Samuel Adeniran; the President of NIESV; Engineer Chika Felicitas Ebenebe, Regional Technical Head, Globacom, Minna Region, Dr. Babagana Adam, Director, FCTA Department of Outdoor Advertisement and Signage and TPL Sunday Audu, Chief Town Planning Officer, FCDA.",

          "text": "Nigerians have taken to social media to express deep anger over the death of a wrongfully jailed Nigerian lady, Itunu Babalola.\n\nAccording to reports, 21-year-old Babalola from Oyo State was a trader based in Bondoukou, Cote d\u2019Ivoire. Her apartment had been burgled by an Ivorian in September 2019 and she had reported the incident to the police but DPO informed her that the suspect was his nephew. He reportedly offered her a settlement worth roughly N100,000 to drop the case, an amount lesser than the N300,000 worth of stolen effects.\n\nBabalola was subsequently arrested when she refused the settlement, charged to court for human trafficking and sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nA journalist, David Hundeyin, had shared the story of Babalola on Twitter in March 2021 and the Nigerians In Diaspora Commission had said it was working to prove the innocence of Babalola.\n\nNIDCOM, headed by Abike Dabiri-Erewa, had confirmed that the lady was charged and incarcerated for a crime she didn\u2019t commit.\n\n\u201cFollowing painstaking investigations by the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission and the Nigeria Mission in Abidjan, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, it is now confirmed that Itunu Babalola, a Nigerian living in Abidjan was wrongfully charged and incarcerated for a crime she did not commit.\n\n\u201cPlans are underway to engage the services of a legal luminary to prove the innocence of Itunu Babalola at the Court of Appeal after the accused had spent two years out of a ten-year jail term for an offence she did not commit,\u201d the commission had promised in a statement.\n\nHowever, many Nigerians were shocked on Sunday night when Hundeyin, who had been following the case, gave serial updates that Babalola\u2019s contracted an infection in the Ivorian prison. The journalist uploaded photos of the young lady in an emergency situation being attended to on a stretcher by medical personnel.\n\nSome were gutted that eight months after NIDCOM promised to ensure justice was served on the matter and secure the lady\u2019s freedom, Babalola still remained behind bars in the Francophone West African nation.\n\nMany were equally heartbroken when Hundeyin announced hours later that the young lady gave up the ghost.\n\n\u201cI have just received a message from Cote d\u2019Ivoire about Itunu Babalola.

Babalola was shown writhing in anguish on a hospital bed in videos connected to the thread before passing away.\n\nIn a series of tweets, David Hundeyin wrote: \u201cI have just received a message from Cote d\u2019Ivoire about Itunu Babalola. She is still in prison in Abidjan where she has contracted a serious infection and apparently she is dying. All those promises by NIDCOM, Abike Dabiri, OYSG (Oyo State Government) etc \u2013 audio.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s finally dying. She\u2019s finally dying. Well done to the Nigerian government. Well done to NIDCOM (Nigerians in Diaspora Commission) and everyone responsible for this, another young Nigerian is biting the dust. Round of applause for all of you.\n\n\u201cWrite a federal petition, do a thread with 15,000 retweets, Engage with government, do an investigative story. Even travelled illegally to Cote d\u2019Ivoire in a canoe to gather facts.\n\n\u201cNothing we have not done to try to save this girl\u2019s life but we come from Nigeria. Eight months of effort, 8 months of \u2018Uncle David God bless you, eight months of hoping for Nigeria to prove me wrong FOR ONCE\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all over Itunu is dead. She died this night, just confirmed.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had on March 15 reported that Babalola, who was based in Bondoukou, Cote D\u2019Ivoire was rotting in a detention camp for refusing to accept police \u201csettlement\u201d of N100,000 for the crime of burglary committed in her house.\n\nThe Ivorian police allegedly threatened and resolved to prosecute Itunu Babalola, who reported the crime in October 2019, but the suspected burglar was believed to be a close cousin of a key police officer.\n\nInstead of putting the suspected burglar in court, the police devised a scheme to bribe Babalola into accepting N100,000 in exchange for her stolen belongings, which she declined.\n\nAccording to SaharaReporters, when the police authorities noticed that she was adamant about achieving justice, they drafted fabricated accusations against her and detained her.\n\nThe woman had travelled to Nigeria to check on her sick mother in September 2019 when her house in Cote D\u2019Ivoire was burgled, according to Hundeyin, who had been following the case.\n\nNigerians had urged the government to assist in Babalola\u2019s plight and secure her release from detention in the West African country.\n\nThe Nigerian government, through NIDCOM and the Nigerian Mission in Abidjan, Cote D\u2019Ivoire, said that its inquiry into the case of Itunu Babalola revealed that she was innocent and had been falsely accused.\n\nThe government added that the former prosecutor in Cote D\u2019Ivoire in collaboration with the police twisted the case against Babalola and accused the woman of human trafficking, leading to her conviction for 10 years, out of which she had unjustly served two years.\n\nIn a release by Gabriel Odu, of the NIDCOM\u2019s Media, Public Relations and Protocols Unit, the Nigerian government said it would move to rescue Babalola having established that she was framed up by the Ivorian government.\n\nThe government said, \u201cFollowing painstaking investigations by the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission and the Nigeria Mission in Abidjan, Cote D\u2019Ivoire, it is now confirmed that Itunu Babalola, a Nigerian living in Abidjan was wrongfully charged and incarcerated for a crime she did not commit.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Chairman of the NIDCOM, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, the Charge D\u2019Affaires of the Nigerian Mission in C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, Mr Mohammed Gana, sent officials of the mission to Bondoukou, a city eight hours outside Abidjan when the case was brought to his attention.\n\n\u201cPlans are underway to engage the services of a legal Luminary to prove the innocence of Itunu Babalola at the Court of Appeal after the accused had spent two years out of a ten-year jail term for an offense she did not commit.\n\n\u201cReports indicate that the new Prosecutor assigned to the case has given assurances of a fair and unbiased review and retrial of the case to secure the release of Itunu Babalola.\n\n\u201cReports also allegedly indicate that the former prosecutor in collaboration with the police twisted the case and accused Itunu Babalola of human trafficking hence her conviction for 20 years although the sentence was reduced to 10 years from which she has served two years.\n\n\u201cOn efforts made to secure her bail, the prosecutor said it is only the Court that can grant her bail as she has already been convicted. We will continue to monitor the case as it unfolds.\u201d",

Blinke, GATE had asked Washington to designate some Nigerian government officials as sponsors of terrorism.\n\nGATE also described the killings, abductions, and other violent crimes in Nigeria as \u201cstate-sponsored terrorism.\u201d\n\nBut in a statement issued Sunday by Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed, the government said the GATE allegation was orchestrated by those seeking to weaken the ongoing massive onslaught against terrorists and bandits in the country.\n\nThe minister also described GATE \u201cas a pesky irritant that should be ignored because it is confused and irresponsible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis organisation called GATE is not even worth the ink with which its name is written.\n\n\u201cHow can a serious organisation accuse a government that is tackling the twin evil of terrorism and banditry with an uncommon determination of sponsoring terrorism?\n\n\u201dIs it not curious that this organisation has chosen this particular time, when terrorists are either surrendering in droves or running helter-skelter, as a result of a renewed offensive against them by the military, to orchestrate a distraction?\n\n\u201cWhat could be GATE\u2019s motive if not to weaken the fight against terror and banditry?\n\n\u201dGATE and its sponsors should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves and should quit trying to distract our gallant troops who are doing everything possible, including making the supreme sacrifice, to keep our country safe,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe minister further said GATE\u2019s decision to rely on the words of a former Nigerian Navy intelligence officer to make the allegation showed the hollowness of its claim.\n\n\u201cIn the fight against terrorism, Nigeria has availed itself creditably by tackling home-grown terrorists with links to global terrorist organisations.\n\n\u201cWe make bold to say that no administration in Nigeria has risen to the challenge of terrorism like the Buhari administration has done.\n\n\u201dThe acquisition of a myriad of platforms, the boost to the morale of our fighting forces, and the leadership provided by President Muhammadu Buhari have combined to put our gallant troops in good stead.\n\n\u201cThese have also helped the troops to frontally confront and put on the run the terrorists. Fittingly, Nigeria\u2019s efforts at tackling terrorism have been hailed globally.\n\n\u201cWhat our gallant men and women need at this time is the support, encouragement, and prayers of all, not the distracting antics of a relevance-seeking, feckless organisation masquerading as a terrorism eradication advocate,\u201d Mohammed said.",

          "title": "Zamfara crisis: I don\u2019t care if APC implodes \u2013 Marafa",
          "text": "A former lawmaker, Senator Kabiru Marafa, has described the Caretaker/ Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) as a bunch of illegality which he would challenge in court soonest.\n\nMarafa said President Muhammadu Buhari had publicly declared that \u201cif you are aggrieved against the party (APC) then go to court. So if we are operating within the law I don\u2019t think we have committed any sin.\u201d\n\nThe factional leader also said the conduct of the Mai Mala Buni-led CECPC was reflective of a group of people taking delight in breaking the law, warning he doesn\u2019t care a hoot if the party implodes ahead of 2023 polls.\n\nThe former lawmaker\u2019s faction held parallel congresses in Zamfara state Saturday.\n\nBut Governor Buni described Marafa as a sinking politician for his self-inflicted woes.\n\nMarafa\u2019s grouse\n\nAddressing journalists Sunday in Abuja, Senator Marafa said \u201cnothing is left in the party to do,\u201d pointing out that the president had always told the people to stand for their rights.\n\nMarafa said: \u201cMai Mala Buni\u2019s CECPC is an illegal committee. It cannot conduct anything. Whatever it does is a nullity and it cannot stand in this country. We are going to challenge him on that in court and I don\u2019t care what anyone will say. Buni looked for my trouble and I will give him ten times of that.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is very clear that you cannot hold an executive position and hold party position at the same time. Our APC constitution is also very clear in Article 2 which is the supremacy of the constitution. In S. 17(4), it says no officer of the party shall hold any executive position in government concurrently with the party position.\n\n\u201cHe is an Executive Governor. He cannot be the Chairman of APC and if he can, let the courts tell us. I am going to court; I am going to challenge that. And whatever he did from the time he was appointed to this time will be questioned. We have one APC. Remove this man so that he doesn\u2019t bring everybody down. I am on a salvage mission.\n\n\u201cArticle 20 of the same constitution says all party posts prescribed by this constitution shall be filled by democratically conducted elections at respective national convention or congress subject where possible to consensus\u2026 Who elected Buni and his committee? At which convention or congress? Are we throwing away this constitution?\n\n\u201cThen the judgment of the Supreme Court on the Ondo election is a clear indication of where APC is headed but because some people who have never gone to school but who God has elevated to certain positions, have forgotten how they got to the positions.\n\n\u201cFor God sake and with all sense of modesty, I and Gov. el-Rufai of Kaduna state almost single-handedly with the help of some people made Buni the National Secretary of the party some years ago.\n\n\u201cWe will force him to resign and I am sure the President will also do that.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether crisis rocking the ruling party may lead to implosion, the APC chieftain said: \u201cI have the responsibility to be a good son which I have been in the APC but when the father or the mother wants to sniff life out of me, I have a right to defend myself. If there is going to be an implosion that will tear APC apart, already they have already torn us apart, so good luck. It is their own cup of tea.\n\n\u201cWe have participated in the congresses. After this, I am heading straight to the court. I have told Mai Mala Buni to leave the sleeping dog. I told him don\u2019t press us to the wall, but he has pressed us to the wall. In fact, he has pushed us into the wall and we are going to fight back.\n\n\u201cWhatever the consequences this will bring, I want the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to note this because I am sure he is not aware of the illegality Mai Mala is committing. We are going to challenge Mai Mala\u2019s Committee in the court and I don\u2019t care whatever anybody has to say. Mai Mala Buni has looked for my trouble and I am going to give him ten times.\u201d\n\nWhile explaining the rationale behind illegal congress held in Zamfara Saturday, the senator said the current leadership of APC was operating the party \u201cas if they are operating an \u2018Amalanke\u2019 (local toy truck).\u201d\n\nMarafa declared last Saturday\u2019s congress of the party in the state as a charade and an exercise in futility.\n\nHe said the law requires the party to give a 21-day notice to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the conduct of such congresses.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnother letter was issued on the 5th of November. It was addressed to the same Alhaji Kabir Masari and it reads \u2018suspension of ward congresses\u2019. By that letter, that committee was suspended, the congresses entirely were suspended and it said the action was for further consultations to engender a seamless exercise. This was a welcome development because there were problems on ground.\n\n\u201cThis was on the 5th November. Then, just on Friday, some of our friends called us to tell them that there would be congresses in Zamfara. They said they saw a letter addressed to the INEC chairman intimating him of congresses in Zamfara for the 12th. Less than 24 hours. We said that was not possible but we sent our people to INEC and verify, and they (INEC) said that they are in receipt of a letter and the letter said notice for the conduct of state congresses.\n\n\u201cThis confirms to us that the Mai Mala-led APC, as it is today, is on a mission to destroy APC but we don\u2019t care, they have a right to destroy APC but in Zamfara we have interested parties and it is our state and we are not ready to destroy our own house and anybody desirous of doing so, we have a right to say no.\n\n\u201cNow, notice is very key. Section 85 of the Electoral Act made it mandatory. It says INEC must be given a notice of 21 days. This is the provision of the Electoral Act. The law supersedes the APC guidelines. The Electoral Act comes second to the Nigerian constitution.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where Mai Mala got this thing but I\u2019m not surprise because he didn\u2019t go to school. I goggled everywhere, I didn\u2019t see the primary or secondary school he went to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing is wasting the party\u2019s resources and the peoples\u2019 time. This cannot hold anywhere in the world, but we only joined them to show them that look, \u2018you don\u2019t have the monopoly of madness.\u2019 This 24-hour notice cannot stand in any court of law. I want to thank my people because we conducted successful ward congresses. I want to thank the security agencies and the state governments itself for the matured way he handled the situation.\n\n\u201cWe participated just to tell everyone that madness is not an exclusive preserve of some people. The essence of this briefing is to tell Nigerians why there is a faction again in Zamfara. Let everyone know that this faction came about because of the way and manner APC national leadership is trying to suppress us in Zamfara state.\n\n\u201cWe want to tell Mai Mala, Zamfara is not Yobe state. In an interview I granted Arise Television, I sent a direct warning to him, he should learn to leave the sleeping dog lie. They didn\u2019t heed that warning.\n\n\u201cNow APC looked for our trouble, we did not look for APC trouble. We did everything possible to accommodate our new visitor (Matawalle) but APC at all the points frustrated us.\n\n\u201cIt appears APC national headquarters is at loggerheads with rules and procedures. They want to prove at every point that they are lawbreakers and uneducated. We have participated in the congresses, after this I am going straight to court,\u201d Marafa further said.\n\nBuni replies\n\nAnd in a swift reaction, Governor Buni described the former lawmaker as \u201ca sinking politician\u201d seeking to hold on any available object for rescue.\n\nBuni who said this in a statement by his spokesman, Malam Mamman Mohammed, said \u201cMarafa\u2019s vituperations are nothing but an empty ranting of an ant.\u201d\n\nIn the statement titled \u2018Marafa\u2019s political suicide\u2019, Governor Buni questioned the party chieftain\u2019s participated in a congress he called illegal.\n\n\u201cHe described the Zamfara Congress as an illegality, if it is so, why did he participate and if he is in doubt of the party\u2019s leadership, why did he adhere to every directive it issued?\n\n\u201cHe is only complaining now because his camp failed the congress and lost out. He wouldn\u2019t have been shouting if he had won.\n\n\u201cMarafa is a sinking politician who lost out and holding everyone responsible for his self- inflicted political misfortune. As a responsible politician, he should just approach the court and stop being the complainant and juror,\u201d the statement said.\n\nCongresses hold\n\nMeanwhile, the Zamfara APC state chapter of the party conducted its congress to elect new executives in all the 147 wards across the 14 local government area of the state.\n\nThe congress committee Chairman, Alhaji Masari, said the party\u2019s national headquarters had constituted a seven-man committee under his watch to conduct the exercise.\n\nHe expressed satisfaction with the conduct of the congress.\n\nBut the immediate past governor of the state, Abdulaziz Yari and his supporters did not participate in the congress.\n\nThe state publicity secretary of the Yari faction of the APC, Hon. Ibrahim Muhammad Birnin Magaji revealed this in a statement in Gusau.\n\nIt said the congress negated the Federal High Court order which said every faction shall maintain the status quo.\n\n\u201cWe shall continue to abide by the court order not to participate in the congress pending on the final judgement of the case before the court,\u201d it said.",
          "summary": "Marafa said President Muhammadu Buhari had publicly declared that \u201cif you are aggrieved against the party (APC) then go to court.\nThe former lawmaker\u2019s faction held parallel congresses in Zamfara state Saturday.\nWe are going to challenge him on that in court and I don\u2019t care what anyone will say.\nWe are going to challenge Mai Mala\u2019s Committee in the court and I don\u2019t care whatever anybody has to say.\nLet everyone know that this faction came about because of the way and manner APC national leadership is trying to suppress us in Zamfara state.",

By protecting children from conditions that could have exposed them to grave illness, these countries were able to overcome public resistance and spur innovative, age-appropriate justice solutions.\n\n\u201cThis has proved something we already knew \u2013 child-friendly justice solutions are more than possible.\u201d\n\nAccording to UNICEF, the study is one of two analyses that illustrate the situation for hundreds of thousands of children deprived of their liberty every year.\n\nBoth reports were released ahead of the World Congress on Justice with Children.\n\nChildren in detention \u2013 including in pre-and post-trial custody, immigration detention, held in relation to armed conflict or national security, or living with parents in detention \u2013 are often held in confined and overcrowded spaces.\n\n\u201cThey lack adequate access to nutrition, healthcare and hygiene services, and are vulnerable to neglect, physical and psychological abuse, and gender-based violence,\u201d the statement said. \u201cMany are denied access to lawyers and family care, and unable to challenge the legality of their detention.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 has profoundly affected justice for children, shuttering courts and restricting access to essential social and justice services. Evidence shows that many children, including children in street situations, have been detained for violating pandemic curfew orders and movement restrictions.\u201d\n\nFailed Systems\n\nAn estimated 261,000 children in conflict with the law \u2013 those who have been alleged, accused or recognised as having committed an offence \u2013 are held in detention, according to the second UNICEF analysis.\n\nThe second analysis \u2013 Estimating the number of children deprived of their liberty in the administration of justice \u2013 the first of such analysis since 2007, warned that incomplete record-keeping and undeveloped administrative data systems in many countries meant the number was likely to be much higher.\n\n\u201cAny child detained is evidence of failed systems, but that failure is then compounded further. Justice systems meant to protect and support children often add to their suffering,\u201d said Fore.\n\n\u201cAs policymakers, legal practitioners, academics, civil society, and children and young people convene at the World Congress this week, we must work together to end the detention of children.\u201d\n\nUNICEF stressed the need for authorities to ensure justice for children and safely end the detention of all children in various countries.\n\nIt, therefore, called on governments and civil society to invest in legal rights awareness for children in justice and welfare systems, especially for the most marginalised ones, expand free legal aid, representation, and services for all children, and prioritise prevention and early intervention in child offending and diversion to appropriate alternatives.\n\nThe organisation also asked them to end the detention of children \u2013 including through legal reforms to raise the age of criminal responsibility, ensure justice for child survivors of sexual violence, abuse or exploitation \u2013 including investing in child and gender-sensitive justice processes, and establish specialised child-friendly, virtual, and mobile courts.",

          "text": "Nigeria has been ranked among the top ten criminal markets in the world for human trafficking, firearms, illicit cannabis and heroin trade, fauna crimes, synthetic drugs, and non-renewable resource crimes by the Global Organized Crime Index for 2021.\n\nAccording to the index, the countries with the highest levels of criminality are those that are experiencing conflict or fragility, and these countries are particularly vulnerable to organized crime.\n\nAccording to the report, the Democratic Republic of Congo topped the list of the criminal markets with a score of 7.75, followed by Columbia 7.66; Myanmar 7.59; Mexico 7.56; Nigeria 7.15; Iran 7.10; Afghanistan 7.08; Iraq 7.05; Central African Republic 7.04 and Honduras 6.08.\n\nOther high-scoring countries include Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, where conflicts have decimated the formal economies, led to mass displacement and an influx of weapons.\n\nThe Institute for Security Studies and INTERPOL collaborated on the report as part of the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime.\n\nTuvalu 1.54, Nauru 1.76, Sao Tome & Principe 1.78, Liechtenstein 1.88, Samoa 2.04, Vanuatu 2.20, Marshal Island 2.31, Kiribati 2.35, Luxembourg 2.36, and Monaco 2.43 are the lowest-scoring countries with better resilience and social safety.\n\nThe report states, \u201cIn breaking down criminality and looking at the 10 criminal markets covered, the global average was slightly lower at 4.65, with human trafficking determined to be the most pervasive worldwide (with a global average of 5.58). Indeed, human trafficking features in the top five criminal markets of every continent in the world. After the trafficking of people, the illicit cannabis trade and arms trafficking were assessed to be the second and third most pervasive markets worldwide, with global averages of 5.10 and 4.92, respectively.\u201d\n\nAccording to the index, human traffickers exploit victims for profit both within and outside of national borders, using sexual exploitation, forced labor/modern slavery, forced begging, organ trafficking, and child soldier recruitment, with the vast majority of victims being women and girls.\n\nIt affirmed that opportunities for human trafficking have increased with Internet technology, which provides both a ready online market and, simultaneously, the means to exploit people with greater anonymity, adding that human trafficking market is present in a wide range of contexts, from both stable countries to those in conflict, often overlapping with other criminal markets, such as human smuggling.\n\nThe Index data further shows that, as with criminal markets, East Africa is home to the most influential criminal actors on the continent, driven predominantly by state-embedded actors.\n\nOverall, state-embedded actors scored 7.22 in the region with Central Africa (7.55) leading the way, followed by North Africa (7.17), West Africa (6.90) and Southern Africa (6.90).\n\nThe report reads, \u201cCriminal networks are also prevalent across all regions in Africa, but none more so than in East Africa (6.83) and West Africa (6.43). On the other hand, while Central Africa is home to countries with some of the highest levels of state capture in the world, criminal networks in numerous countries in the region are fairly weak.\n\n\u201cWhile mafia-style groups are the lowest-scoring criminal actor type across the continent, there are several countries in Africa where highly organised gangs, armed groups and militias yield significant influence in the criminal landscape, many of whom have even been strengthened by the COVID-19 pandemic, capitalising on openings in illicit markets and in doing so consolidating control over the communities in which they operate.\u201d",

Zhang, now 75, was a vice premier between 2013 and 2018 and served on the Politburo Standing Committee, China\u2019s top decision-making body, between 2012 and 2017.\n\nConcerns among the global tennis community have grown as Peng has not been seen since the post.\n\nThe WTA said in a statement that it will seek a \u201cfull, fair and transparent investigation into sexual assault allegations\u201d against the former Chinese leader.\n\n\u201cThe recent events in China concerning a WTA player, Peng Shuai, are of deep concern,\u201d said WTA Tour Chairman and CEO Steve Simon in a statement.\n\n\u201cPeng Shuai, and all women, deserve to be heard, not censored.

What could be GATE\u2019s motive if not to weaken the fight against terror and banditry?\n\n\u201dGATE and its sponsors should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves and should quit trying to distract our gallant troops who are doing everything possible, including making the supreme sacrifice, to keep our country safe,\u201d he said.\n\nHe accused GATE of relying on the words of a thoroughly-discredited, fake-news-peddling former Nigerian Navy intelligence officer in parroting its absurd allegation.\n\nHe said the action by the organisation had exposed the hollowness of its allegation.\n\n\u201dIn the fight against terrorism, Nigeria has availed itself creditably by tackling home-grown terrorists with links to global terrorist organisations. We make bold to say that no administration in Nigeria has risen to the challenge of terrorism like the Buhari Administration has done.\n\n\u201dThe acquisition of a myriad of platforms, the boost to the morale of our fighting forces and the leadership provided by President Muhammadu Buhari have combined to put our gallant troops in good stead to frontally confront and put on the run the terrorists. Fittingly, Nigeria\u2019s efforts at tackling terrorism have been hailed globally,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister pleaded that what the gallant troops engaged in the fight against insurgency required at this time was the support, encouragement and prayers of all, not the distracting antics of a relevance-seeking, feckless organisation masquerading as a terrorism eradication advocate.\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja",

The security service, MI5, is also assisting.\n\nArmed officers have carried out raids on properties on Rutland Avenue near Sefton Park, and around Sutcliffe Street and Boaler Street in Kensington.\n\nSpecialist officers remain outside a house on Rutland Avenue, in an operation police say is linked to the explosion.\n\nPolice negotiators are on the scene, a fire crew is on standby, and a number of residents have been evacuated.\n\nA large cordon, guarded by uniformed officers, remains in place.\n\nCarl Bessant, whose partner had just had a baby, was inside the hospital at the time of the blast.\n\n\u201cMy partner is really shook up to be honest,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe were so close and she was feeding the baby when it happened. We heard a loud bang and looked out of the window.\n\n\u201cWe saw the car on fire and someone jump out\u2026 screaming, and there was someone inside the car.\n\n\u201cThe hospital shut down, no-one in or out, so they said, but people were using the back entrance.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said on Twitter: \u201cMy thoughts are with all those affected by the awful incident in Liverpool today.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the emergency services for their quick response and professionalism, and the police for their ongoing work on the investigation.\u201d\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel also tweeted she was \u201cbeing kept regularly updated on the awful incident\u201d.\n\nThe first raid happened at about 13:00 GMT on Rutland Avenue in the Sefton Park area of the city. It\u2019s about 0.75 miles from the hospital. It\u2019s an area of the city with large Victorian houses.\n\nThe house that was raided had been split up into flats. Local residents said they had not seen anybody coming or going from the property for some weeks \u2013 they thought it was unoccupied. The street remains cordoned off and some residents have been evacuated.\n\nPolice were also seen at Boaler Street in the Kensington area of the city. It\u2019s about a mile away from the hospital.\n\nEyewitnesses on the street said armed police arrived at about 14:00 and raided a house. They said they saw men being arrested and handcuffed. They were led by armed officers into a car. That street also remains cordoned off.\n\nChief Constable Serena Kennedy, of Merseyside Police, sought to reassure the public, saying events of this nature were very rare and that there would be an increased and visible police presence on the streets in the coming days.\n\nA bomb disposal unit and fire engines attended the scene earlier, which remains cordoned off. Road closures are also in place.\n\nPolice were called at 10:59 to reports of a car explosion.\n\nPhil Garrigan, chief fire officer of Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service, said the car fire had been \u201cfully developed\u201d when crews arrived shortly after 11:00.\n\n\u201cThe operational crews extinguished the fire rapidly but\u2026 there was one fatality,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnother individual had left the vehicle prior to the fire developing to the extent that it did. Our thoughts are with them and the families of those involved.\u201d\n\nNick Aldworth, a former counter terror co-ordinator, said investigators would be looking to ascertain what happened inside the vehicle.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be looking at what sort of damage has been caused, trying to get an assessment of what might have caused that blast,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.\n\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen there is very little blast damage \u2013 a lot of fire damage but very little blast damage.\n\n\u201cSo whatever was in that vehicle was either a low yield or didn\u2019t work properly or was possibly an incendiary.\u201d\n\nMr Aldworth explained it was common for investigations to be linked to terrorism quickly as it provides investigators with more resources from an earlier stage.\n\nHe added that it was entirely appropriate to involve MI5 to understand if it holds relevant information.\n\nLiverpool Women\u2019s Hospital said visiting access had been restricted until further notice and patients had been diverted to other hospitals where possible.\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing our patient activity for the next 24-48 hours and patients should wait to be contacted for updates about any planned appointments or other attendance at the hospital,\u201d chief executive Kathryn Thomson said.\n\nLiverpool Women\u2019s Hospital receives about 50,000 patients annually and is the largest hospital in its specialism in Europe\n\nBBC",
