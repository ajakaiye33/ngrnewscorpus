          "text": "The United States Attorney\u2019s Office in the Central District of California has said that Ramon Abbas, aka Hushpuppi, and his co-conspirator used crime proceeds to acquire a St. Christopher and Nevis citizenship.\n\nThis was contained in a statement released on Wednesday by the court titled, \u2018Six Indicted in International Scheme to Defraud Qatari School Founder and then Launder over $1 Million in Illicit Proceeds\u2019.\n\nThe court also said Hushpuppi, who pleaded guilty to various charges, including money laundering, wire fraud, and felony, among others, used Abba Kyari, a leader of the Inspector-General of Police\u2019s Intelligence Response Team, to jail one of his associates named Chibuzo Vincent.\n\nKyari, however, explained in a Facebook post that Hushpuppi called his office and reported a death threat from someone about two years ago.\n\nThe cop said the suspect, Vincent, was arrested but later released after investigations revealed that \u201cthey are long time friends who have money issues between them\u201d.\n\nKyari also said he did not receive any money from Hushpuppi.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that Hushpuppi allegedly conspired with five others \u2014 including Vincent \u2014 to defraud a businessperson in Qatar by claiming to be consultants and bankers who could facilitate a loan to finance the construction of a school, according to the indictment by the court.\n\nHushpuppi\u2019s associates include 40-year-old Vincent from Nigeria; and 28-year-old Abdulrahman Juma from Kenya. Others are Yusuf Anifowoshe, 26; Rukayat Fashola, 28; and Bolatito Agbabiaka, 34 \u2014 all Nigerian.\n\n\u201cApproximately $230,000 of the stolen funds allegedly were used to purchase a Richard Mille RM11-03 watch, which was hand-delivered to Abbas in Dubai and subsequently appeared in Hushpuppi\u2019s social media posts. Other illicit proceeds from the scheme were allegedly converted into cashier\u2019s checks, including $50,000 in checks that were used by Abbas and a co-conspirator to fraudulently acquire a St. Christopher and Nevis citizenship, as well as a passport for Abbas obtained by creating a false marriage certificate and then bribing a government official in St. Kitts,\u201d the statement partly read.\n\nActing United States Attorney, Tracy Wilkison, said, \u201cMr. Abbas, who played a significant role in the scheme, funded his luxurious lifestyle by laundering illicit proceeds generated by con artists who use increasingly sophisticated means. In conjunction with our law enforcement partners, we will identify and prosecute perpetrators of business email compromise scams, which is a massive and growing international crime problem.\u201d\n\nAlso, Kristi Johnson, the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office, described Hushpuppi as one of \u201cthe most high-profile money launderers in the world\u201d.\n\n\u201cHis celebrity status and ability to make connections seeped into legitimate organizations and led to several spin-off schemes in the U.S. and abroad. Today\u2019s announcement deals a crucial blow to this international network and hopefully serves as a warning to potential victims targeted with this type of theft,\u201d Johnson added.\n\nIn a plea agreement document sighted by The PUNCH on Wednesday, Hushpuppi pleaded guilty as charged.\n\nThe document was signed by Hushpuppi; his lawyer, Loius Shapiro; and Acting United States Attorney, Tracy Wilkison, among others.\n\nIt stated that Hushpuppi risks \u201c20 years\u2019 imprisonment; a three-year period of supervised release; a fine of $500,000 or twice the gross gain or gross loss resulting from the offence.\u201d\n\nThe document, however, did not mention the date of the plea hearing.\n\nHushpuppi is known to have flaunted his luxury lifestyle in private jets with exotic wines and expensive wristwatches. His social media handles were replete with photos of his ostentatious lifestyle before his arrest last year June in Dubai after which he was extradited to the US where he is being prosecuted for money laundering and internet fraud-related charges.",

An allegation the latter described as \u2018untrue\u2019 and \u2018an attempt to tarnish his image\u2019.\n\nReacting, some social media users on Thursday, took to their handles to share their views on the allegation.\n\nBelow are some of the reactions gathered by Vanguard:\n\n@De_Royal: \u201cIs time we test EFCC efficiency in Nigeria.

Almost all the Police Officers in Nigeria have been involved in aiding and abetting fraud.

          "text": "Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola\n\nBy Onozure Dania\n\nA civil society organization, Access to Justice, AJ, has faulted Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, for encouraging state governors to sign death warrants for the execution of inmates on death row as a way of resolving the problem of congestion in prison formations across the country.\n\nAJ in a statement by its convener, Joseph Otteh and Project Director, \u2018Deji Ajare, said: \u201cSpeaking at the official commissioning of Osun State Command Headquarters of Prisons Complex in Osogbo on July 23, 2021, Minister of Interior, Aregbesola, had stated that out of 68,747 inmates currently housed in prison facilities nationwide, 50, 992 of them are awaiting trial, while 17,755 have been convicted and serving sentences.\n\n\u201cAlso speaking on the challenge of congestion in correctional centres, the Minister revealed that its actual capacity of 57,278 has been exceeded by 18 percent. The Minister believes that if governors \u2018take the bold step\u2019 to sign execution orders for inmates on death row, it would help to resolve the problem of congestion.\n\nALSO READ: ACFTA: SON challenges manufacturers on standards\n\n\u201cWe find this proposal preposterous, it treats human lives as intrinsically expendable objects or commodities which may be dispensed with in order to achieve a better representation of prison demographics. But human life, whether of persons under sentence of death or not \u2013 is far too valuable than to be used as a means of reconfiguring the prison population, or reducing it, and it is unfortunate that the Minister would make this kind of obnoxious call.\n\n\u201cBesides, we fear that if the Minister\u2019s call is heeded, many death row convicts who have pending appeals against their convictions will be at risk at execution even before their appeals are determined following administrative errors. This is not a misplaced fear, and there are precedents of such errors leading to unlawful executions.\n\nALSO READ: Fire guts ATBU\u2019s department of agriculture, destroys documents\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that even from the statistics reported by the Minister, it is clear that the problem of congestion is not as a result of an uptick in the number of sentenced persons, including those on death row.\n\nThe congestion is caused by the disturbing demographic of inmates, who are awaiting trial (pre-trial or under-trial inmates), who account for 74 percent of the total inmate population. What the government ought to do is to step up to the plate and address the chronic problem of pre-trial detention in order to manage the incidence of prison congestion, not to request that inmates be executed in order to reduce it.\n\n\u201cMany factors account for the high level of prison congestion, but part of them include political persecution and the misuse of criminal justice institutions. The arrests and jailing of political and civil rights activists, including those agitating for the restructuring of Nigeria, #EndSARs protesters of police violence, members of religious groups protesting the disrespect of court decisions to release their incarcerated members, or simply those clamouring for better political governance, all aggravate the prison congestion problem.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Candidates who could not be initially scheduled for examination owing to their inability to timely procure and supply their mandatory NINs or profile codes until after the close of the registration exercise and, therefore, had to purchase Bank Drafts ( as against the usual vending of PINs) after the scheduled period for the examination and were later registered.\n\nii. Few candidates who encountered peculiar biometric verification problem, or who failed biometric verification on the examination date ( and were recaptured) but were not allowed to partake in the examination.\n\n(Adequate screening arrangements have been made to reverify such claims and any candidate found to be involved in any form of impersonation will be identified for prosecution).\n\niii. Candidates who were unable to sit for the UTME owing to the clash of timetables of the UTME and the then ongoing NABTEB examinations and whose particulars have been verified and supplied directly to JAMB by NABTEB, and\n\niv. Candidates who have been ascertained by JAMB to have experienced genuine rescheduling/technical problems as was the case in 30 of the 760 centres used for the examination.\n\nThe Board advised candidates to avoid supplying their \u201cvital information including registration number to fraudsters who are abound especially in cybercafe(s), tutorial centres springing up almost everywhere in the nation as a result of the illicit activities of examination syndicates.\u201d\n\nThe statement added: \u201cCBT centres approved by JAMB which are consistently monitored are relatively more secured for printing examination notification slips by candidates who cannot print such on their own.\u201d",

Our focus was to save people\u2019s lives that were purported to have been threatened.\n\n\u201cLater, he saw some of my native clothes and caps on my social media page and he said he likes them and he was connected to the person selling the clothes and he sent about N300k directly to the person\u2019s account. The Native Clothes and Caps (5 sets) were brought to our office and he sent somebody to collect them in our office.\n\n\u201cNobody demanded any money from Abbas Hushpuppi and nobody collected any money from him. We responded to a distress call he made on threat to his family and released the suspect when we discovered there was no life threat from the suspect. This is the true story. Vincent is alive, he can be contacted.\u201d\n\nThe police chief said his hands were clean\n\nKyari added: \u201cOur record of service for two decades is open for everybody to see. They will continue seeing us serving our father land and we will continue responding to ALL distress calls from ALL Nigerians provided they are life threatening.\n\n\u201cFor good Nigerians who appreciate our service please don\u2019t worry as our hands are clean and they should please not respond to those celebrating and creating many false narratives without any Evidence. We are used to such types of people and false newsmakers and distributors.\n\n\u201cThank you all and GOD bless Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAbbas faces up to 20 years in jail, following his guilty plea.\n\nHe will be sentenced in the coming weeks and will forfeit some of his assets and his rights to appeal while also paying restitution to victims of his years-long fraud.",

It must be pointed out virtually that all the flood incidents above were caused by poor drainage systems as localised rainfall generated the urban flooding. River flooding and coastal flooding are yet to set in.\u201d\n\nNze, therefore, called on stats and local governments, stakeholders, multi-national companies, public-spirited individuals and philanthropists to take measures to prevent flooding menace instead of waiting to be rehabilitated as victims.\n\nMinister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, while presenting the 2021 Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) to the public said 302 local government areas in 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory ( FCT) would fall within moderate flood risk areas while 121 LGAs in 28 states will be within the highly probably risk areas.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nCatholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese and Founder of the Kukah Centre, Most Revd Matthew Kukah, has called on Nigerians to vote out the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 poll.\n\nKukah, who is currently in Washington, U.S, spoke during a conference on \u2018Civic Space: The Pathway to Social Cohesion and Integration in Nigeria\u2019 organised by the Kukah Centre.\n\nThe former Secretary-General of the Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria lamented that the civil society, which paraded personalities like Olisa Agbakoba, the late Beko Ransome-Kuti, Clement Nwankwo, Chidi Odinkalu and others, went to bed after it succeeded in ushering the country into democratic rule.\n\nThe cleric said the situation resulted in the confusion in the country where members of the National Assembly are working to see that the civic space is closed instead of opening up.\n\nHe said the situation was not unconnected with the fact that the nation currently parades people who are in politics with no track records nor antecedents of engagement with public life.\n\nHe said a close look at the profile of those who are currently in power from top to bottom would show why the system is literally crumbling and why the struggle for human rights is now being renewed.\n\nKukah further lamented what he termed a very dangerous path that the nation is threading, whereby the young people were feeling totally disempowered, even as he said Nigerians were faced with a nation that consumed its own children.\n\nHe added that Nigerians were also faced with the prospects of an uncertain future.\n\nDemocracy, Kukah said, was not an exercise undertaken by good men and women which was really what Nigerians had always fallen victim to\n\nWhile saying that Nigerians assumed that somehow, managing a diverse country did not require some level of deep intellectual reflection and understanding of the complexity of managing a diverse society such as Nigeria. He said now that the barbarians are at the door, how to fight back was the challenge facing the nation.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, the tragedy that has now afflicted our country and where we find ourselves, is no excuse for us to become despondent. In 2023, whether it happens or whatever the case may be, we prayerfully hope it happens, but it gives us another opportunity to ask ourselves and think about the mistake that we made because we are not innocent in the choices that we made. Most of us are complicit despite the fact that of course, using the agencies and agents of state, those in power always continue to seek to close the space.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for us therefore, is to understand that democracy is a work in progress. All of us engage in democracy and opening up the civic space must realise this is a journey, it is a long journey, we must wear the shoes of the long distance runner and every generation face its own challenges and pass the challenges up to the next generation. But whatever we pass to the next generation must be a light of hope,\u201d Kukah said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "Justice Dept\u2019s statement shows Kyari allegedly sent bank account details to Hushpuppi for payment\n\nBy Michael Olugbode\n\nDeputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, has been linked to the celebrated fraudster, Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, also known as Ray Hushpuppi, who is presently facing trial for fraud in a United States court.\n\nHushpuppi, in an indictment unsealed by the US Justice Department, was alleged to have bribed Abba Kyari to get one of his traducers arrested and jailed in Nigeria.\n\nArelease by the Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Central District of California said: \u201cCourt documents outline a dispute among members of the conspiracy, which allegedly prompted Vincent to contact the victim and claim that Abbas (Hushpuppi) and Juma were engaged in fraud. Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, also known as Ray Hushpuppi\n\n\u201cAfter this contact, Abbas allegedly arranged to have Vincent jailed in Nigeria by Abba Alhaji Kyari, 46, of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAccording to the affidavit, Kyari is a highly decorated deputy commissioner of the Nigeria Police Force who is alleged to have arranged for Vincent to be arrested and jailed at Abbas\u2019 behest, and then sent Abbas photographs of Vincent after his arrest. Kyari also allegedly sent Abbas bank account details for an account into which Abbas could deposit payment for Vincent\u2019s arrest and imprisonment.\u201d\n\nAbba Kyari, known to have smashed top criminal cases, drew the ire of the public when he made an appearance at the party of Obi Cubana in Oba where millions in various currencies were obscenely displayed recently.\n\nHushpuppi was indicted with five others in an International Scheme to Defraud Qatari School Founder and then launder over $1 Million in Illicit proceeds.\n\nAccording to the release from the Department of Justice, Hushpuppi has pleaded guilty in the Money Laundering in School Financing Scam and Additional Cyber and Business Email Compromise Schemes.\n\nThe criminal complaint that initiated the prosecution in February was also unsealed on Monday, revealing Hushpuppi was initially charged in this case.\n\nCourt documents ordered unsealed showed that Abbas, a 37-year-old Nigerian national, pleaded guilty on April 20. A version of Abbas\u2019 plea agreement filed late Tuesday outlines his role in the school-finance scheme, as well as several other cyber and business email compromise schemes that cumulatively caused more than $24 million in losses.\n\n\u201cThe defendants allegedly faked the financing of a Qatari school by playing the roles of bank officials and creating a bogus website in a scheme that also bribed a foreign official to keep the elaborate pretense going after the victim was tipped off,\u201d said Acting United States Attorney Tracy L. Wilkison.\n\n\u201cMr. Abbas, who played a significant role in the scheme, funded his luxurious lifestyle by laundering illicit proceeds generated by con artists who use increasingly sophisticated means. In conjunction with our law enforcement partners, we will identify and prosecute perpetrators of business email compromise scams, which is a massive and growing international crime problem,\u201d according to Wilkison.\n\n\u201cMr. Abbas, among the most high-profile money launderers in the world, has admitted to his significant role in perpetrating global BEC fraud, a scheme currently plaguing Americans,\u201d said Kristi K. Johnson, the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office.\n\n\u201cHis celebrity status and ability to make connections seeped into legitimate organizations and led to several spin-off schemes in the U.S. and abroad. Today\u2019s announcement deals a crucial blow to this international network and hopefully serves as a warning to potential victims targeted with this type of theft,\u201d Johnson added.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Abbas allegedly conspired with Abdulrahman Imraan Juma, a.k.a. \u201cAbdul,\u201d 28, of Kenya, and Kelly Chibuzo Vincent, 40, of Nigeria, to defraud the Qatari businessperson by claiming to be consultants and bankers who could facilitate a loan to finance construction of the planned school.\n\nJuma allegedly posed as a facilitator and consultant for the illusory bank loans, while Abbas played the role of \u201cMalik,\u201d a Wells Fargo banker in New York, according to court documents. Vincent, in turn, allegedly provided support for the false narratives fed to the victim by, among other things, creating bogus documents and arranging for the creation of a fake bank website and phone banking line.\n\nYusuf Adekinka Anifowoshe, a.k.a. \u201cAJ,\u201d 26, of Brooklyn, New York, allegedly played a role in the fraud, assisting Abbas with a call to the victim posing as \u201cMalik.\u201d Special agents with the FBI arrested Anifowoshe in New York on July 22.\n\nThe conspirators allegedly defrauded the victim out of more than $1.1 million.\n\nThe proceeds of the fraud allegedly were laundered in several ways. According to the indictment, Abbas was assisted in laundering the proceeds of the fraud by Rukayat Motunraya Fashola, a.k.a. \u201cMorayo,\u201d 28, of Valley Stream, New York, and Bolatito Tawakalitu Agbabiaka, a.k.a. \u201cBolamide,\u201d 34, of Linden, New Jersey. These two defendants also were arrested on July 22 by FBI agents.\n\nApproximately $230,000 of the stolen funds allegedly were used to purchase a Richard Mille RM11-03 watch, which was hand delivered to Abbas in Dubai and subsequently appeared in Hushpuppi\u2019s social media posts. Other illicit proceeds from the scheme were allegedly converted into cashier\u2019s checks, including $50,000 in checks that were used by Abbas and a co-conspirator to fraudulently acquire a St. Christopher and Nevis citizenship, as well as a passport for Abbas obtained by creating a false marriage certificate and then bribing a government official in St. Kitts.\n\nCourt documents outline a dispute among members of the conspiracy, which allegedly prompted Vincent to contact the victim and claim that Abbas and Juma were engaged in fraud. After this contact, Abbas allegedly arranged to have Vincent jailed in Nigeria by Abba Alhaji Kyari, 46, of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAccording to the affidavit, Kyari is a highly decorated deputy commissioner of the Nigeria Police Force who is alleged to have arranged for Vincent to be arrested and jailed at Abbas\u2019 behest, and then sent Abbas photographs of Vincent after his arrest. Kyari also allegedly sent Abbas bank account details for an account into which Abbas could deposit payment for Vincent\u2019s arrest and imprisonment.\u201d\n\nThebr3lease said both conspiracy counts alleged in the indictment carry a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison. Aggravated identity theft carries a mandatory two-year prison term.\n\nIt added that the FBI was investigating this matter as part of Operation Top Dog.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

declare him and the PDP winner on grounds that Akeredolu was not validly nominated as candidate of the APC in the said election.\n\n\u00baHis prayer was hinged on the fact that the acting National Chairman of the APC and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, was the one, who forwarded Akeredolu\u2019s name to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as candidate of the APC in the October 20, 2020 poll.\n\nBuni, it would be recalled, was appointed in acting capacity by the National Working Committee (NWC) of the APC in May last year, after the sack of then National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole.\n\nBut the petitioners in their appeal had argued that Buni, according to section 183 of the constitution and article 17(4) of the APC, could not function both as governor and acting chairman of the APC concurrently.\n\nTo that extent, the PDP and its candidate submitted that Akeredolu\u2019s nomination breached the law and as such, his election should be nullified.\n\nUnfortunately for the PDP, while four of the justices held that the appeal of Jegede and his party was incompetent, because it did not include Buni as a party, the remaining three Justices held that it was not necessary to join Buni since the APC was already made a party to the suit.\n\nThus, in the majority decision delivered by Justice Emmanuel Agim, the apex court held that the failure of the appellants to include Buni as a party was fatal to their case, because all the issues in the appeal revolved around Buni and ought to have been made a party.\n\nIn his judgment, which further dismissed the appeal, Justice Inyang Okoro, also held that the allegations made against Buni were grievous and so should have been made a party to explain his side.\n\nThis position was equally canvassed by Justices Mohammed Garuba and Mohammed Abubakar.\n\nBut in their dissenting judgment, Justice Mary Peter-Odili, who presided as well as Justices Ejembi Eko and Ibrahim Saulawa, held that since the APC was already a party to the suit, it was not necessary to join Buni.\n\nAccording to Peter-Odili, Buni was just an agent while APC was the principal, insisting thatthe case of the appellants had merit and the appeal should be allowed.\n\nShe contended that Akeredolu\u2019s election should have been nullified, while the appellants declared winner of the October 20, 2020 governorship poll.\n\nEko, on his part, maintained that Buni violated the Constitution, when as a sitting governor, still acted as Chairman of the APC by submitting Akeredolu\u2019s name to INEC for purposes of the governorship poll.\n\nTheir disagreement notwithstanding, all the Justices dismissed the cross appeals filed by INEC and the APC for being academic.\n\nBut after studying the judgment of the Supreme Court, the Minister of State for Labour and member of the APC, Mr. Festus Keyamo, SAN, in a leaked memo to the party leadership, said the APC must be wary of the dire consequences of the judgment especially, as it looked forward to its congresses and national convention.\n\nIt is also why the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has advised the Buni to resign from his position as the National Caretaker Committee Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), because it contravened a constitutional provision, which made his continuous stay illegal.\n\nSharing the PDP position, a former National Secretary of the Labour Party and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Chief Kayode Ajuko, also said the judgment was enough indication that the chairman of the APC should resign from office immediately\n\nThat nonetheless, President Muhammadu Buhari, has reacted to the Supreme Court judgment and said the decision had brightened the chances of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in future polls in the country.\n\nAlso, Governor Akeredolu thanked the judiciary for not yielding to any influence, even as he dedicated the election petition success to God.\n\nThe ruling APC has also hailed the decision of the apex court as being in tune with popular vote.\n\nSimilarly, the Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babatunde Sanwo-Olu and the PDP candidate in the Ondo election, Jegede, have also congratulated Akeredolu over his Supreme Court victory.\n\nHowever, dissecting the judgment and its implications in what turned out a leaked memo to the APC leadership, Keyamo said, \u201cThe Supreme Court by a narrow split decision today (4-3) held that GOV. AKEREDOLU cannot be removed as Governor of Ondo State. The little technical point that saved Gov AKEREDOLU was that Jegede failed to join GOV. Mai Mala Buni in the suit.\n\n\u201cJegede was challenging the competence of Gov. Mai Mala Buni as a sitting Governor to run the affairs of the APC as Chairman of the Caretaker Committee. He contends that this is against Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution, which states that a sitting Governor shall not, during the period when he holds office, hold any other executive office or paid employment in any capacity whatsoever.\n\n\u201cIn other words, had Buni been joined in the suit, the story may have been different today as we would have lost Ondo State to the PDP.\n\n\u201cTherefore, any other person affected by the actions of the Buni-led Committee will henceforth not fail to join him in any subsequent case in court. These includes any subsequent election matter in any part of this country and all the APC \u201cThe Supreme Court has just weaponised all those that would be aggrieved by the APC Congresses to proceed to court to Challenge the competence of the Buni-led CECPC to organise the Congresses and National Convention.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary will subsequently destroy the entire structure of the Party from bottom to top. We are lucky the Supreme Court has just given us a great and useful hint to save our Party just before the beginning of our Congresses. We cannot gamble with this delicate issue. The time to act is NOW.\n\n\u201cThe planned Congresses across the country slated for this weekend must immediately be suspended, because it will be an exercise in futility as analysed above. The competence of Gov. Mai Mala Buni to organise the congresses has been called to question by the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cFirstly, the NEC of the Party can URGENTLY meet and consider and reconstitute the CECPC to exclude, not only Gov. Buni, but anyone holding ANY executive position in any government establishment as stipulated in Article 17 of the APC Constitution.\n\n\u201cUnder Article 25 of the APC Constitution, it is the National Chairman OR TWO-THIRDS OF MEMBERS OF NEC that can Summon a NEC meeting. Since we cannot vouch for the legality of any NEC meeting summoned by MAI MALA now, the safest is to get TWO-THIRDS of NEC members to sign an invitation to summon a NEC meeting, where the CECPC would be reconstituted and our Party would be safe.\n\n\u201cAlternatively, the Board of Trustees of the Party, which includes Mr. President, can be activated to organise a National Convention in line with Article 13 of the APC Constitution,where it is given such powers. Those powers can be delegated at the meeting to a Committee in line with the APC Constitution, which will run the Party and plan the Convention. The new Exco can then plan for Congresses.\n\n\u201cAbove are my humble and respectful suggestions to save our Party from imminent danger in the light of the Supreme Court judgment today. To ignore this and do otherwise would be tantamount to playing with fire and the opposition would simply wait till our Presidential Primaries in 2023 to disqualify our candidate and destroy the party.\n\n\u201cI have done my professional bit to the Party. I can do no more.\u201d\n\nOn its part, the PDP, which advised Buni to resign from his position as the National Caretaker Committee Chairman of the APC, also called on Nigerians to use the opportunity of the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) by INEC and the party\u2019s membership registration to vote out the APC government in 2023.\n\nPDP maintained that his best bet was to resign as the acting national chairman of APC as section 183 of the 1999 constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the Ondo State governorship election has declared the position illegal.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, who spoke on the matter, however, said the APC government had brought poverty to the country, with soaring pricesof food stuff hitting the roof.\n\nSpecifically addressing the Supreme Court judgment that validated the election of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo state, the PDP said, \u201cWe insist that the process that led to the emergence of Governor Akeredolu was and remains a violation of the APC constitution as well as the 1999 constitution.\n\n\u201cSection 183 of the 1999 constitution states that no governor should hold any other position in any capacity apart from the office of the governor. As you know, this was the major ground upon which we went to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nAjuko, in a statement, said, \u201cMy humble but cosmic review of the judgment comes with an indication that the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni has to with immediate effect, vacate his seat, as the Chairman of APC.\n\n\u201cAs a one time National Secretary of Labour Party, National Chairman and National Secretary are the soul of the party; they\u2019re saddled with the day to day running of the party and the continuous stay of the Governor as Chief Executive Officer of APC runs contrary to provision of the Constitution and as such may be an albatross on the party soon, as all he had done before would be null and void, including nomination of candidates within the period of his so called leadership of the party,\u201d Ajulo warned.\n\nINEC had declared APC and Akeredolu winner of the Ondo Governorship Election held on October 20, 2020 having won majority of votes cast at the poll.\n\nBut, the petitioners had claimed that his election should be nullified since he was not lawfully nominated.\n\nThe Ondo State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal, led by Justice Umar Abubakar-led struck out the petition for lacking jurisdiction in the matter.\n\n\u201cIssues raised therein in this petition are settled issue of internal affairs and management of a political party on which this tribunal has no jurisdiction,\u201dAbubakar held.\n\nAbubakar, who delivered the judgment via zoom, therefore, upheld the reelection ofAkeredolu.\n\nSimilarly, the Court of Appeal panel presided over by Justice Theresa Orji-Abadua, upheld the judgment of the tribunal and dismissed the appeal for lacking merit.\n\nBuhari: Judgment Brightens APC Chances in Future Polls\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, who formally reacted to the Supreme Court judgement affirming the re-election of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, said the ruling has brightened the chances of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in future polls in the country.\n\nThe President, in a release Wednesday by his Media Adviser, Femi Adesina, noted that the Supreme Court judgement, preceded by that of the Court of Appeal, further bolstered the strength and reach of the APC, and its bright chances of consolidation in coming elections.\n\nHe, therefore, called on the opposition to sheathe the sword, work for the development of Ondo State, and wished the government and people a prosperous future.\n\nBuhari also joined members of the APC in felicitating with Akeredolu over the Supreme Court judgement, and urged the governor, and all elected leaders of the party, to always place the people first in their consideration of development programmes and projects, affirming that the popularity of the APC would continue to depend on performance and acceptance by the electorate.\n\nHe extolled Akeredolu for assiduously working for the development of the state, with reforms that have continued to attract the goodwill of investors, and his insistence that education, health and security take priority.\n\nI Dedicate My Victory to God, Says Akeredolu\n\nOndo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu has dedicated his victory at the Supreme Court to God, while at the same time thanking the judiciary for not yielding to influence of any sort.\n\nHe also appreciated his legal team, the Independent National Electoral Commission and his party, the APC.\n\n\u201cI have every reason to thank God and appreciate the judiciary for not yielding to any influence. We can still be proud of our judiciary. The glory of this election petition success is to God Almighty.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the legal team that has represented us. My team, led by Chief Akin Olujimi and other wonderful lawyers for their wonderful work.\n\n\u201cWe thank the INEC team, Charles Edosanwa, SAN; APC team, Lateef Fagbemi, SAN, Sola Oke and other eminent lawyers,\u201d he said\n\nThe Governor said with the judgement of the apex court, the legal tussle had been laid to rest, stressing that it was time to work more for the people.\n\nAPC Hails Akeredolu\u2019s Supreme Court Election Victory\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) has hailed the Supreme Court decision upholding the victory of the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu in the last governorship election.\n\nNational Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, in a statement issued Wednesday said Akeredolu\u2019s administration was now poised to redouble the tempo of quality service delivery.\n\nHis words: \u201cFondly and popularly referred to as \u2018Aketi\u2019, the Governor Akeredolu administration is now poised to redouble the tempo of quality service delivery and consolidate its giant strides in the critical areas of education, healthcare delivery, infrastructure development, security, youth empowerment and industrialisation.\n\n\u201cFor many residents of the Sunshine State, who joked that Akeredolu has turned the state into a busy construction site, it rings true for a man who is truly passionate about the development of his independent-minded, enlightened and progressive people and state.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Akeredolu had followed up his people-oriented policies with several other developmental initiatives, which were returning the state to its deserved status and consolidating on the landmark and progressive legacies of the late Chief Michael Adekunle Ajasin, the first civilian governor of the state.\n\nJudgment Vindicates Our Appeal, Says PDP\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said the split judgment by the Supreme Court on the flawed nomination of the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, showed that there was merit in its appeal against his election.\n\nThe party noted that the majority judgement as presented by the Supreme Court did not address the impunity in the action of the Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, in functioning as the Chairman of the APC while at the same time holding office as a sitting governor, contrary to the provisions of section 183 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) as well as the constitution of the APC.\n\nAccording to a statement by the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, the PDP said the fact that three justices out of the seven-man panel upheld itsposition on the illegality of Akeredolu\u2019s nomination confirmed his candidacy as cancerous and a brazen violation of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) as well as the constitution of the APC.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that the judgement did not disagree with our position that Mai Mala Buni as Governor of Yobe State cannot function as National Chairman of a political party and nominate a candidate for election to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\n\u201cWhile our party restates its utmost respect for the institution of the judiciary, especially the Supreme Court, the PDP had expected the Apex Court to stand up as the conscience of our nation by halting the absurdities and impunities being entrench in the political firmament by the APC,\u201d the PDP said.\n\nSanwo-Olu Congratulates Akeredolu\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu has congratulated his Ondo State counterpart, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN) on his Supreme Court victory, which upheld his victory in the October 10, 2020 governorship election.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu, who was the Chairman of the All Progressives Congress Committee on the Ondo State gubernatorial election, also congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari, the national leadership of the All Progressives Congress, as well as members of the party in Ondo and across the country on the victory.\n\nSanwo-Olu, in a statement, signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Gboyega Akosile, described the Supreme Court ruling as a \u201cvalidation of the people\u2019s mandate\u201d, saying the election results announced by INEC were evident that Governor Akeredolu was validly elected by Ondo people.\n\n\u201cAs democrats, we must submit ourselves to the tenets of democracy, which include post-election litigation. Today\u2019s judgement has put paid to all insinuations and doubts about the resounding victory of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, call on all lovers of democracy, especially the people of Ondo State to come together for a continuation of good governance and the developmental process of Ondo, started by Governor Akeredolu from his first term of office.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the people and government of Lagos State, I congratulate my brother, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, on his victory at the Supreme Court.\u201d Sanwo-Olu said.\n\n\u2026Jegede Too, Says It\u2019s Time to Thank God\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate in the October 2020 governorship election in Ondo State, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede, has congratulated Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of the state, after the Supreme Court affirmed his victory yesterday.\n\nJegede in a statement personally signed and made available to journalists, disclosed that the ruling would not deter him from respecting the judiciary.\n\nHe thanked the PDP, Ondo State People and his counsel for a good fight, adding that it was time to let go and thank God.\n\n\u201cNow that we have explored the grievance procedure permitted by the constitution and the law, it is time to give glory to God.\n\n\u201cWe thank specially our legal team, under the leadership of Dr. Onyechi Ikpeazu, OON, SAN, FCIArb, for their commitment, industry and dedication to our cause. Over and above all, we thank them for their sacrifice.\n\n\u201cWe are thankful to the people of Ondo State for their steadfastness. We were in this for service and for the collective interest of the majority of our people.\n\n\u201cThe outcome of today\u2019s judgement should not deter good and well-meaning individuals from aspiring for leadership in our state and in our country. For all our people, who have stood strong, we salute you.\n\n\u201cWe thank the National and State leadership, and the generality of the members of PDP for providing us with great support. For our governors, who provided the required leadership and kept faith with our aspiration, gratitude, history will judge you right.\n\n\u201cWith this outcome, our respect and reverence for the judiciary and our justices of the supreme court has not diminished.

          "text": "\u2022 Says El-Zakzaky and wife have committed no offence\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nA Kaduna State High court presided over by Justice Gideon Kurada, has discharged and acquitted leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) also known as the Shiite group, Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenat, after over five years in detention.\n\nAddressing journalists shortly after the court session on Wednesday, a counsel to El-Zakzaky, Marshal Abubakar, said the court upheld their no-case submission filed by the defence counsel and agreed that, the case lacked merit.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe trial of Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky and his wife, Malama Zeenat Ibraheem, has come to an end today. The court has upheld our no-case submission. The court found that the charges that were filed in the year 2018 pursuant to a penal law enacted by the Kaduna State government in 2017 over offences allegedly committed in 2015 is ab-initio.\n\n\u201cThe court ruled that the charge ought not to be in the first place, because you cannot arraign a man for an offence that was already committed as at the time the said crime was not an offence. And the Court was very emphatic on that,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe agreed that though the Kaduna State government has powers to enact laws, \u201cthey cannot enact law to prosecute an offence prospectively. That is the first ground on which the court held that, that charge was incompetent.\n\n\u201cOn another footing, the no-case-submission we filed in court, the court agreed with us that the trial lacked merits, that the prosecution only came to court to tell stories that are at cross variance with the offences that were alleged in the charges.\n\n\u201cThe court agreed with us that, El-Zakzaky and his wife have committed no offence. The Court, however, discharged and acquitted El-Zakzaky and his wife. It said there should not have been any charge against El-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenat in the first place,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the prosecuting counsel, Dari Bayero, did not address journalists as he left immediately after the court session.\n\nSince the commencement of the trial to the end, journalists were barred from covering the proceedings and had to wait outside the court premises for briefings from both the prosecution and defence counsel.\n\nMeanwhile, the IMN leader, along with his lead counsel, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), were seen in the same vehicle as they drove out of the court premises.\n\nEl-Zakzaky and his wife were arrested in December 2015, following a bloody clash between his followers and soldiers in Zaria, Kaduna State.\n\nOver 347 people, said to be members of the Shiite group were allegedly killed during the incident and buried in a mass grave at Mando area of Kaduna metropolis.\n\nThe IMN leader and his wife were being prosecuted by the Kaduna State government following the recommendation of a judicial panel that was set up in 2016 to investigate the clash.\n\nThe IMN leader and his wife stood trial on eight count charge of culpable homicide, disruption of public peace and unlawful assembly among others.\n\nThe IMN, in a statement yesterday while reacting to the judgement, stated it was a victory for perseverance in the face of extreme persecution by the Nigerian government.\n\nAccording to the the statement signed by Ibrahim Musa, spokesman of the Islamic body, \u201cThe judgement has not only vindicated our leader and all members of the movement in Nigeria, but a victory for perseverance in the face of extreme persecution by the Nigerian government. It is a victory for truth and justice against tyranny and impunity\u201d.\n\nMusa said, with the court victory, \u201cthe false charges filed against them has finally been punctured for good after almost five years of excruciating illegal detention.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, the Kaduna State government filed charges against Zakzaky and his wife as an afterthought a year and a half after a Federal High Court in Abuja had ruled that their continued detention was unconstitutional, illegal and a breach of their fundamental rights and ordered for their release and compensation.\n\nThe statement noted that, despite the ruling of the Abuja Federal High Court, \u201cThe government however remained in contempt until they decided to frame these spurious false charges in an attempt to perpetually keep them in their illegal custody.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, give praises to the Almighty for yet another successful outing, which further proves to the world that the Islamic Movement and its leader, are only victims of impunity and mischievous plots by both the Buhari-led federal government and the El-Rufai-led Kaduna State government.\n\n\u201cSince both governments have again failed in court after a fair trial, we expect them to respect the judgement of this honourable court and the course of justice to release them with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cWe wish to use this opportunity to also say a big thank you to all people of conscience, human rights activists and organisations, journalists and all those that joined in our dogged campaign for justice for the victims of Zaria genocide for the past five years\u201d, the statement said.\n\nIn December 2015, IMN members, who were said to be observing a religious ritual, allegedly blocked the road, preventing the convoy of the then Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, who was in Zaria for the Passing Out Parade of the military school in the area.\n\nThe incident snowballed into a serious clash between the IMN members and soldiers the following day, leading to massive killings.\n\nSince the detention of Zakzaky, his followers have been protesting in major cities, like Abuja, Kaduna and Kano, Sokoto, demanding for his release.\n\nSome of their protests often resulted in deaths, following violent confrontations with security agencies, especially, the police.\n\nAn Abuja Federal High Court presided by Justice Gabriel Kolawole had in December 2016, ordered the release of El-Zakzaky and his wife from detention on the grounds that their continuous incarceration was unconstitutional and an infringement on their fundamental human rights.\n\nThe court had also awarded a N50 million compensation to the duo and ordered the federal government to provide a new accommodation for them in Zaria or any northern town of their choice.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022 Says Nigeria spending more on bureau de change than debt service\n\n\u2022 Naira depreciates to N525 on parallel market, stable on I & E window\n\nObinna Chima and\n\nNume Ekeghe\n\nBy putting an end to the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators, Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has \u201cdisrupted one of the juiciest gravy trains in the Nigerian economic racket,\u201d Financial Derivatives Company Limited (FDC) has stated.\n\nHowever, the naira depreciated to N525 to a dollar yesterday on the parallel market, lower than the N505 to a dollar it traded on Tuesday after the central bank announced its discontinuation of FX sale to BDCs. But on the Investors and Exporters\u2019 (I & E) window, the naira exchange rate against the dollar closed at N411.60 to a dollar at the close of market yesterday, compared with the N411.50 to a dollar it closed the previous day.\n\nFDC, a Lagos-based financial advisory and research firm, stressed, \u201cEven though BDCs are licensed by the CBN, the point had been reached where the programme was no longer tenable and surely not sustainable.\u201d\n\nIt stated that Nigeria was spending more on BDCs than debt service.\n\nThe firm wondered how a country whose total exports and receipts were approximately $59.8 billion, was spending $5 billion to subsidise \u201csupposed Nigerian tourists during a COVID-19 year.\n\n\u201cIn other words, spending more on tourism rather than debt servicing. Therefore, the structure of the forex market needed sanitisation,\u201d the firm headed by Mr. Bismarck Rewane added.\n\nNonetheless, recommending solution to the problem, it stated, \u201cThe interim solution of substituting BDCs with banks is hardly going to achieve much. You are virtually handing over the yam barns to goats to secure. In the end, there will be no yams nor goats.\u201d\n\nIt recommended, instead, that the CBN should allow banks to retail dollars as they had done in the past and make BDCs engage in retailing same but at a buy rate different from today\u2019s subsidised rate.\n\nThat is, the BDCs would be allowed to buy dollars from the CBN at the parallel market rate less a N10 premium, the research company stated.\n\nIt said, \u201cFor example, if the parallel market rate is N500/$, the purchase rate from the CBN will be N490/$. If the BDCs sell at N550/$, the CBN increases its rate for BDCs to N540/$.\n\n\u201cThat will be the same retail rate at the banks. This eliminates the arbitrage corridor and abuse. It will certainly reduce the demand for dollars and it must coincide with an increase in dollar supply from the CBN. This way, the naira will appreciate towards the ever elusive fair value or the REER (Real Effective Exchange Rate), which today is anywhere between N470 and N490/$.\u201d\n\nIn his own contribution, Chief Executive Officer, CFG Advisory, Adetilewa Adebajo, said the immediate market reaction was a parallel market spike.\n\nAdebajo said, \u201cIt should be noted that BDCs were set up to serve retail markets with transactions under US$5,000. But this might not be sustainable, as consumers did not benefit from the official rates BDCs were given as they engaged in arbitrage with the parallel markets.\n\n\u201cThis situation offers the banks an opportunity to create a viable FX interbank market with transparent bid and offer rates that Nigerians can access via the existing inter-banking platforms.\n\n\u201cHow long this will last is yet to be seen, as we recall that CBN last year for separate reasons suspended sales to BDCs and resumed several months later.\u201d\n\nEmefiele had disclosed the end of FX sale to BDCs while briefing journalists at the end of a two-day meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in Abuja on Tuesday. He directed all commercial banks to immediately create designated branches for the sale and disposal of FX to customers who deserved it for legitimate purposes.\n\nThe CBN governor said the apex bank will no longer process or issue new licences for BDC operation in the country, adding that all licences being currently processed, regardless of the stage, had been suspended. He said the CBN would now channel weekly FX allocations hitherto meant for BDCs to commercial banks.\n\nEmefiele said commercial banks were now permitted to begin accepting FX cash deposits from their customers. He explained that the measures were to ensure that the apex bank was better able to carry out its mandate in an effective and efficient manner as well as to guarantee preservation of the commonwealth and financial system stability.\n\nEmefiele said the decision to eliminate the BDC operators from the FX market was necessitated by their dubious and unwholesome practices, adding that the operators have gone beyond their primary role of being retail dealers of FX to becoming wholesale dealers.\n\nThe CBN governor stated that rather than catering for the retail users, who required about $5,000 to meet their FX needs, BDCs now transacted in millions of dollars. He said BDCs bought dollars from the CBN at N197 and sold to their customers at N250.\n\nEmefiele said it was no wonder that BDCs had risen \u201cfrom a mere 74 in 2005 to 2,786 BDCs today. In addition, the CBN receives close to 150 new applications for BDC licenses every month.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank (CBN) has stopped the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country. The registration of new players has also been halted, with immediate effect.\n\nGovernor Godwin Emefiele made the announcement at the end of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nAs with almost every announcement made by the CBN regarding the regulation of foreign currency, the decision has sparked a debate between economists, monetary policy experts, and other Nigerians on social media.\n\nWhy is Nigeria halting the sale of forex?\n\nBDCs were set up to receive a weekly supply of FX from the CBN for onward sale to retail end-users, that is, people who needed $5,000 dollars or less.\n\nHowever, Emefiele said the MPC noted that the money changers had become wholesale dealers and illegally traded FX to the tune of millions of dollars per transaction.\n\nAccording to him, the CBN receives about 5,000 fresh applications monthly for BDC registration as players continued to make huge profits while Nigerians suffered from the \u201cdollarisation\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe apex bank also accused BDC operators of speculative, rent-seeking behaviour and involvement in money laundering activities.\n\n\u201cThey have turned themselves away from their objectives,\u201d Emefiele said. \u201cThey are now agents that facilitate graft and corruption in the country. We cannot continue with the bad practices that are happening at the BDC market.\u201d\n\nThe CBN will henceforth channel weekly allocations of dollar sales to commercial banks to meet legitimate FX demands. The banks will be monitored to provide forex for the legitimate use of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe will deal ruthlessly with Nigerian banks that deal with illegal BDCs and we will report foreign organisations patronising them,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that they are mandated to sell forex to every customer.\n\nAssessing the potential impact; Good or bad move?\n\nSome have praised the CBN for ending the \u201cmindless sales\u201d of foreign currency to BDC operators and an end to the reign of traders.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that thousands of Nigerians working at the 3,000+ BDC operators in the country will be thrown into the already large unemployment pool as a result of the ban.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad decision in itself but it\u2019s bad for the times we are in,\u201d said Kelechi Opara, an economist and Market Insights Officer at MMS Nigeria. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to close businesses. We are talking about unemployment and more people are about to be thrown into the same labour market.\u201d\n\nOpara added that instead of an outright ban, the CBN could \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d to properly profile and monitor every BDC operator they license, to ensure a working system void of corruption.\n\n\u201cEven with the move, there\u2019s no assurance that commercial banks will not become a supply chain in the BDCs market. The CBN should assume fulfill its regulatory role and create an enabling environment for legal businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\nAs commercial banks settle to adjust to the CBN directive, the ban is likely to put more pressure on the Nigerian naira in the parallel/black market \u2013 where forex is traded unofficially \u2013 in the immediate term.\n\nDue to the low inflow of U.S. dollars into the Nigerian economy, banks struggle to give foreign currency to their customers on demand.\n\nAlthough the situation should improve with the CBN channelling its weekly allocation to lenders, doubts exist over their capacity to replace BDCs in serving the huge demand for forex in Nigeria\u2019s import-dependent economy.\n\n\u201cGetting dollars could become even more difficult than what we have now,\u201d Opara said, noting that this is likely to push more companies and business people actively in need of dollars to the black market, further adding pressure on the naira.\n\nFollowing the CBN\u2019s announcement, the local unit fell by \u20a61.00 or 0.20% to close at \u20a6505 per $1 on Tuesday, from \u20a6504 on Monday. This is according to data recorded on abokiFX.com, a website that collates the parallel market rates in Lagos.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOver the long term, the central bank\u2019s effectiveness in disbursing foreign currency to retail users through the banks \u2013 if the new system is sustained \u2013 will dictate how the exchange rate at the parallel market will vary from the official rate of \u20a6410/$1.\n\nFor freelancers, remote workers, and remittance recipients that get foreign currencies through banks, the increased quantity of FX in the hands of lenders bodes well for their demands, except for the high fees banks charge on remittances.\n\n\u201cIf banks will be the sole seller of forex to the retail users, then the CBN has to do something about their high remittance charges so as to avoid people rushing to the black market,\u201d Opara added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "To understand how Ato Bentsi-Enchill started investing in startups, let\u2019s rewind to 2014.\n\nHe was a first-year liberal art major at Hobart and William Smith Colleges who won the school\u2019s flagship business plan competition. The business idea was RevisionPrep, an online educational service that combined exam preparation with gaming programs for students in Ghana.\n\nIt was a sign that he had business acumen \u2013 an ability he nurtured while working for his entrepreneurial parents. His grandfather\u2019s company, Black Adam Distilleries, would inspire his current company\u2019s name: Black Adam Africa Capital Management, a boutique investment firm specialising in private equity, investment advisory and project financing.\n\nBentsi-Enchill also invests in startups personally and through syndicates like Future Africa and Rally Cap. He\u2019s also a Venture Scout for Microtraction.\n\nOur conversation begins with how this current phase of his life started.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How and why did you get into investing in companies?\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: I finished college and moved back to Ghana to work on RevisionPrep. After some time, I realised that it wasn\u2019t going to work. So I shut it down and started thinking about what to do next.\n\nBut while in the US, I had attended many Africa-focused business conferences at business schools at Harvard, MIT, Wharton, Stanford and NYU. I was thrilled to understand the power of private capital to transform businesses in Africa. I made life-long connections with individuals who ended up becoming mentors to me in the space.\n\nOnce in Ghana, I started looking at businesses that I thought were interesting enough to invest in if I had that type of money. I wrote summaries and sent them to my investor friends outside Ghana. My pitch was that I could make introductions and help with due diligence if they chose to proceed with the engagement because I was on the ground.\n\nI didn\u2019t close any deals in the early days. I came close to sealing a deal with a gentleman who ran a shea butter processing factory. In a couple of weeks, I had brought in one of the most prominent family offices in South Sudan to look at the deal. They were interested, but the timing wasn\u2019t ideal. The business owner said he liked the way I sourced investors, and if I took this seriously, I could make something out of this.\n\nDA: So when did your big break happen?\n\nAB: I met some investors who wanted to back a fintech company. I helped them with the due diligence, and they decided to invest about $3 million in the startup.\n\nI realised the founder needed more than $3 million during the process, and we agreed I\u2019d help raise more. Initially, he was hesitant as many folks had approached him with similar propositions, proposing hefty retainers while not doing the work.\n\nI was very convinced that this founder will be successful and told him to forget the retainer; I was ready to work with no payment upfront. Thankfully within a year and a half, we raised $7.5 million (up to $15 million now). Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t announce this deal, so I can\u2019t disclose the name. However, that engagement gave me better insights into analysing companies and making my bets on founders at a very early stage.\n\nInitially, when I started investing in companies, I made some mistakes and lost a lot of money, but I believe these lessons have helped me hone my craft. I\u2019ve also just concluded my first scout investment for Microtraction, a deal I also invested in.\n\nDA: You\u2019ve moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did you learn all these?\n\nAB: In the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network. It\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\n\nSometimes potential clients look at my background and are skeptical but I tell them results don\u2019t lie. I\u2019ve done some solid work with my clients, and they are some of my biggest cheerleaders.\n\nDA: What do you look out for when you want to invest in a company?\n\nAB: For early-stage investing, the first thing is the team; I try to understand their motivation to build this company. Not everybody can run any company. Do they have deep knowledge of the industry? Are they resilient?\n\nThe second thing is the size of the market. Companies in Ghana have a more significant challenge in executing, so I\u2019d try to know what\u2019s unique to this firm and their potential for scaling quickly across their desired markets. If I can see them being a big player between 5 and 7 years, that\u2019s a good sign.\n\nI\u2019m also big on understanding how a company can become a monopoly in their space. And by monopoly, I don\u2019t necessarily mean how they become the next Amazon (although that would be awesome!), but what gives them an unfair advantage against their competitors in the industry. How can they dominate the market despite the presence of competitors/incumbents?\n\nI\u2019d also like to understand their challenges and risks of failure. Of course, they don\u2019t need to have the solutions to all these problems today, but it should be evident that they have given it some thought and come up with a plan.\n\nIf they\u2019re not currently making money, I want to know that they\u2019ll make money at some point. I\u2019m not much of a believer in just looking at valuations. Unit economics are also critical; they have to be positive or on the path to being positive.\n\nI also try to find out why now is the right time for your business to exist. What\u2019s happening within your industry? What are your competitors doing? What do your customers want? Once there\u2019s a convergence of needs, there\u2019s a good chance your company will succeed.\n\nToday, I\u2019m a very new angel investor in a space that\u2019s becoming increasingly competitive. I\u2019m happy to invest between $1-5k in companies at pre-seed and seed levels. These may look like small amounts, but it\u2019s always best to start small and learn; you\u2019re going to lose money along the way.\n\nPlus, if you are able to show how you can be an asset to these companies and have a credible story as to why they should take your money versus all the other monies being thrown at them, you\u2019ll be in a good starting position.\n\nOne other thing I did very early in my journey is to learn to write investment memos. I reviewed memos from Sequoia, a16z and Bessemer Ventures to understand what exactly to highlight when presenting a company to an investor.\n\nDA: How do you conduct due diligence?\n\nAB: Definitely I want to see their audited reports; for me, the numbers tell the whole story. But even when you\u2019re looking at numbers you need to look deeper.\n\nA lot of people say they made x amount of sales, they don\u2019t classify it as gross or net. Depending on their business, was it the amount their clients collected, of which a smaller percentage came to the company itself? It\u2019s important to know all these things.\n\nI\u2019m also curious about how money has been passing through the bank account over time. When you understand the business model and their cash flow situation, you can sniff out pertinent questions that make the story clearer to you.\n\nNow a lot of companies are sending links of articles on TechCabal or TechCrunch of similar companies in China, India or the US, to add credibility to the valuation or the business model. I don\u2019t really buy that. You can\u2019t use the fact that someone raised $100 million series B as a pointer that you\u2019ll get there. We all know the market in Africa is different.\n\nIt is definitely possible, but I won\u2019t lean heavily on the fact that a company with a similar business model has succeeded in a market. If I looked deeper, I\u2019d probably see 99 other companies that failed doing the same thing. What shows that you won\u2019t be part of those 99 in Africa?\n\nOther important due diligence points are talking to customers, running reference checks and spending as much time as possible with the founders to see how they run their business on a day to day basis. It takes me between one to three weeks to sort out due diligence.\n\nDA: How do people find you?\n\nAB: Hmmm. Primarily through my newsletter \u2014 musings of a wannabe African VC, LinkedIn or through referrals from previous clients or people in my network.\n\nI also reach out to people. I\u2019ve reached out to a podcast host before to introduce me to a guest who I thought would need my services and it resulted in an engagement.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s important to mention that I don\u2019t take on everyone, either because my team and I don\u2019t have the capacity to or I\u2019m not too convinced on their business.\n\nDA: Are there some sectors you don\u2019t invest in?\n\nAB: Naah. Once I can understand your business model, I can raise money for you or invest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to restrict myself for now.\n\nDA: So what\u2019s your value add to businesses outside of just raising money for them?\n\nAB: I first connect people to capital, but beyond that, I help them understand what they should be focusing on and thinking about the different ways they could be building their business.\n\nFor example with InstantRad, outside of helping them engage investors, I do a lot of business development work for them. I also help companies build a path to exit; It\u2019s something a lot of people don\u2019t understand. Anyone who gives you money is also thinking about how to take it out at some point, so having a workable plan (that of course can be changed depending on market conditions) helps keep everyone focused.\n\nI help founders with term sheet analysis. There\u2019s a lot of technical terms that investors can slip in that young founders aren\u2019t aware of.\n\nDA: In layman terms, please give some examples of these technicalities?\n\nAB: There are good and bad investors. I\u2019ve seen some pretty horrible term sheets that don\u2019t have the founders\u2019 best interests at heart. I\u2019m always on the side of getting the deal done, but it has to be fair. I\u2019ll be the first to speak up when something on a term sheet does not look right.\n\nFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts \u2013 a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\n\nI walked the entrepreneur through the term sheet and we ended up not taking capital from that investor.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen term sheets where investors are asking for four times (4x) liquidation preference. This means that if for any reason the company has to go through any kind of liquidation, the investors will get four times the amount they invested and the founders could possibly be left with little or nothing. No matter the kind of risk the investor is taking on the founder, I don\u2019t believe someone who\u2019s spent their blood, sweat and tears building a company should possibly be left with nothing. To me, investing in a company means you\u2019re sharing the ups and downs of the company, and it\u2019s a partnership.\n\nThese terms aren\u2019t necessarily unfair. It could make sense in certain scenarios as investors are trying to get as much equity from the company. But beyond affecting founders, these terms also affect future investors who could be discouraged from investing.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in Ghana?\n\nAB: Because of its market size, Ghana may not dominate one sector the way Nigeria does in fintech or Kenya in agritech. For the most part, I think we will be in the middle. Maybe number two or three in these sectors.\n\nThat said, the future is exciting.\n\nOne of the biggest success stories out here is mPharma, and it\u2019s unfortunate that most folks may not know that they\u2019re a Ghanaian company. They didn\u2019t just stay in Ghana and call it a day, they expanded to Nigeria and Kenya. Using mPharma as a reference, I believe startups here have to expand to different countries.\n\nZeepay is also doing a good job in respect to expansion, they just raised their $8 million series A. Based on my inside knowledge, I think there are other companies like Zeepay that have a good shot at expanding at a rapid rate. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll see companies like that exit in the next 5 and 7 years as the market grows.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the surface, Reliance HMO, a Nigerian health insurance startup, and Printivo, a print-on-demand startup from Nigeria, have nothing in common. But they do. They are both portfolio companies of LoftyInc Capital Management, creators of Wennovation Hub, Nigeria\u2019s first private incubator.\n\nFounded in 2010 by Wole Odetayo, Idris Ayodeji Bello, Dami Agboola, and Michael Oluwagbemi, Wennovation Hub is the product of a partnership between LoftyInc Allied Partners and the Africa Leadership Forum.\n\nWith startup investing yet to catch on at the time, the plan was to put African startups through an incubator and subsequently present them to institutional investors who could write large cheques. Two years later, while trying to raise money for some of the startups at Wennovation, the partners experienced firsthand how difficult it was for startups to raise money.\n\nInspired by the Houston Angel Network, they decided to set up the LoftyInc Angel Network in Nigeria. But those plans changed when they approached infoDev \u2014 a World Bank programme that promotes entrepreneurship and innovation \u2014 for sponsorship as they were advised to broaden its scope.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd so, in June 2012, together with a few other African angel investors including Tomi Davies and Dotun Sulaiman, the Lagos Angel Network was formed.\n\nHowever, there was still a lot to be done before it could become fully operational. After seeing several startups that needed capital remain without funding, Bello and a few other friends withdrew money from their pension funds to start the Afropreneur Angel Group in 2012.\n\nOne of their earliest investments was in Fora, which would go on to become Andela. From those humble beginnings, the Afropreneur Angel Group has grown to 180 global angels who have invested in 134 companies. Sixty-four of these are African, with Nigeria the most represented country, while 70 are spread across three continents.\n\nWhat sets LoftyInc Capital Management apart?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoftyInc Capital Management Management Partners. Source: Supplied\n\nWith early-stage investing gathering pace in Africa and with the founding of more startups, it is no longer enough to write cheques for startups. Investors now need to be able to offer more than money to the startups they invest in with access to a diverse network and mentorship highly valued by founders.\n\nFrom its early days, the firm has been intent on offering startups more than just money. Bello reveals that the firm has a reputation for being a founder\u2019s friend while serving as extended strategy teams in a startup\u2019s early days.\n\n\u201cWe usually invest before any major investor does, hold the hand of new founders, source their initial clients within our large portfolio (over 65 African startups) and within our large Africa-based Angel/LP network, and provide meaningful introductions to regulators, partners, mentors, top hires and experienced board directors. Also, founders want us in their deals because they have seen us attract both early and later-stage investors to previous ventures,\u201d he reveals.\n\nDeal-sourcing pipelines\n\nBello points out that having backed founders for a long time, they now have five major sources through which they source deals. On average, he says that the firm sees 20 to 30 decks weekly, which makes it important that they pick the right startups to fund.\n\nOne of the most effective sources is through the personal networks of the partners. Besides Bello, Marsha Wulff is an authority on investing in Africa. Through Wennovation Hub, they are also assured of a steady stream of deals from which they can choose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith 180 angels and 70 Limited Partners \u2014 90% of whom are of African origin and/or live in Africa \u2014 the firm gets many deals. Other sources include the over 60 founders who have been funded and other investors aware of LoftyInc\u2019s commitment to helping startups grow.\n\nCriteria for investing in startups\n\nLoftyInc is a sector-agnostic firm that invests in startups building products that users really need.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for balanced founding teams, with a bias towards execution, going after a large market with few to no competitors, and a product that users seriously want/need. We are sector-agnostic with a bias for tech-enabled startups in the health, fintech, and IoT space.\n\n\u201cGiven the robustness of our deal flow, the ultimate differentiator is the ability to pick the ventures that go on to grow and scale and raise additional funding. In doing so, we have found our experiences launching startups, building larger corporations, and angel investing have proven invaluable,\u201d Bello adds.\n\nHe reveals that their process means that they identify gaps in the skills and capabilities of the founders they support and put procedures in place that enable them to fill these gaps. In doing this, they can count on their experience and the experiences of the investors and limited partners in their fund to help the founders.\n\nFor startups that they fund, the average ticket size is between $50,000 and $250,000 for the initial investments, with the possibility of additional funding depending on certain criteria. Startups seeking investment can head over to the website to start the process.\n\nHe advises that startups do not get carried away by the hype that usually accompanies startups but should focus on building for their customers and not investors. On the type of startups he would love to see, he says, \u201cI want to see startups lift more people out of poverty by creating solutions that also create other opportunities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I think it\u2019s an impracticable idea for reasons like epileptic power supply and bad roads.\n\nNevertheless, after three years of researching and testing, JET Motor Company, a company on a mission to lead Africa into a new era of mobility, has launched Nigeria\u2019s first electric cargo vans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Ebuka Uchendu, Technical Lead, JET EV, the vehicle can travel 260-280km on a full charge.\n\nWhy does this matter? It\u2019s good for the environment because the burning of gasoline or petrol from fossils negatively impacts the climate.\n\nAccording to Client Earth, \u201cwhen fossil fuels are burned, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the air. Greenhouse gases trap heat in our atmosphere, causing global warming.\u201d\n\nIn addition, EVs are cost-effective as they require little maintenance. While fueling a vehicle for a 250km journey could cost about \u20a610,000 ($24), you can fully charge an EV for \u20a66,000 ($14) to travel the same distance.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to know more about JET Motor Company\u2019s electric vehicles, check out this article.\n\nField Intelligence expands into 11 cities across Kenya and Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Shelf Life agent. Source: Supplied\n\nWhat happened: On July 28, 2021, Field Intelligence, a health-tech startup digitising the supply of pharmaceutical products in Nigeria and Kenya, expanded into 11 cities across both countries.\n\nWhat does it do? Field Intelligence says Africa\u2019s annual pharmaceutical market is valued at $60 billion, but this could increase. Community pharmacies that provide 80% of medicines used by Africans struggle with identifying fake drugs, having enough capital to stock up, and providing essential medicines.\n\nField Intelligence claims to be solving this problem by easing the supply of medicines with its Shelf Life subscription service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSubscription service? Yes! Shelf Life is a pay-as-you-sell subscription service. When pharmacies subscribe, they get supplies for medicines for an upfront payment and only pay for what they sell.\n\nIn Nigeria, the startup launched initially in Abuja and Lagos and, with this move, it expands into Rivers, Edo, Kaduna, Kano, Enugu, Delta, and Kwara States. It is also expanding beyond Nairobi, Kenya, into Eldoret, Mombasa, Kisumu, and Naivasha.\n\nFor more details, read Nigerian Healthtech startup, Field Intelligence, announces expansion into 11 cities across Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nTwitter is testing a new way to notify suspended accounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nHas your Twitter account been suspended before? Hit reply and tell us what you did.\n\nTwitter is testing a new way to inform users their accounts have been suspended. The new notification will appear as a banner in the profile of a suspended or locked account.\n\nWhy? Well, according to The Verge, a Twitter spokesperson said the company is testing the new feature due to feedback from users who realised they had been suspended after attempting to tweet, reply, or follow.\n\nTwitter Support also tweeted that \u201cKnowing where your account stands is important. We\u2019re testing a new way of letting you know \u2014 right when you log in. If your account is locked or suspended, some of you will start seeing a banner making that clear.\u201d\n\nNew features keep rolling out: Twitter has been on a spree with its rollout of features this year. Recently, the microblogging platform announced testing a downvote and upvote button to understand what users find relevant.\n\nIn May 2021, it launched Tip Jar, allowing users to tip their favourite creators directly through Twitter.\n\nRevenue generation: Twitter has been devising ways to generate more revenue in 2021, following a $260 million drop in revenue in Q4 2020. While some features like Tip Jar are geared directly towards revenue creation, others are for user generation.\n\nMore on Techpoint Africa\n\nSME Clinic 2021: Meet the speakers\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nThe Porsche dynasty is taking on Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk in space.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur ultimate goal is to build the Tesla of Africa.\u201d\n\nThese were the words of Rupani Sanjay, Nigerian automobile company, JET Motor Company\u2019s Director of Sales and Marketing, in an interview with Techpoint Africa in 2020, when the company announced its $9m raise to build Africa\u2019s first all-electric vehicle.\n\nA little more than a year later, in June 2021, the company announced its partnership with Nigerian logistics giant, GIG Logistics (GIGL), to launch the country\u2019s first electric cargo van, JET EV.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Chidi Ajaere, Chairman, GIG Group, and a team of automobile experts, JET Motor Company\u2019s mission is to lead Africa into a new era of mobility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company has now launched JET EV, the first locally made, fully electric vehicle to run on the Nigerian road, with zero emissions.\n\nIf you attended Techpoint Inspired in 2019, you probably remember Joseph Wemimo, Director of Strategy and Operations at JET, introducing JET Mover, the company\u2019s first product.\n\nThe JET EV\n\nAfter about three years of research, testing, and iterative development, the company has finally achieved its primary goal \u2014 to produce electric vehicles from the start.\n\nAccording to Ebuka Uchendu, Technical Lead, JET EV, the vehicle can travel 260-280km on a full charge, although it can technically do 300km. With the EV, he says, the number of engine parts reduces by almost 70%, thereby cutting maintenance costs. Operational costs \u2014 issues such as refuelling \u2014 also drop significantly.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the cost of fueling a vehicle for 250km, you will see that using an EV costs less to maintain. For example, looking at the current billing charges from electric companies, you will see that you can charge the EV to full charge with \u20a66,000 while fueling a vehicle now in Nigeria for 250km will cost between \u20a610,000 and \u20a615,000,\u201d Uchendu says.\n\nThe EV has a high capacity lithium-ion phosphate battery rated at 107.6kwh, a traction motor with a larger torque of 950Nm, making it possible for the vehicle to accelerate from 0-100km/h in under 20 seconds.\n\nIt also comes with a supercharger that can fully charge a dead 107.6kwh SOC (state of charge) in less than 2 hours.\n\nThe African experience\n\nBut there are questions regarding the high cost of entry and epileptic power supply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAjaere says that as their partnership with GIGL indicates, the initial targets are fleet operators \u2014 transport companies like ABC and GIG Mobility, as well as schools and governments.\n\n\u201cFleet operators tend to lose a lot over a period of time. So even though your initial cost of entry might be high, if you think about it as a fleet operator who has 10 or 20 vehicles, two major costs would be maintaining those vehicles and the cost of petrol.\n\n\u201cBut with the EV, you practically reduce that cost by literally 100% because you are not using petroleum and your maintenance cost is almost zero. So in terms of maintenance over a long and short period of time, EVs are better, but the initial cost of entry is higher,\u201d Ajaere concludes.\n\nAs to the power supply issue, he says, each fleet operator has alternative sources to choose from, such as solar, wind power, and diesel.\n\n\u201cSay I am a fleet operator, and I own 20 fuel-powered vehicles,\u201d Ajaere adds, \u201cI have to put petrol in those vehicles. But if I have a 100KVA generator, for example, all I have to do is power it and charge my fleet. Even if I am emitting CO2 via my diesel-powered engine, I am only doing that via my diesel engine. I don\u2019t have 20 vehicles on the road polluting the road. The point is that you can charge your vehicle through any power source.\u201d\n\nBut the company is already building charging stations for its partners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA charging station\n\n\u201cWith the partners we already have, what we are doing is that as they acquire the fleet, we are actually building these stations for them to fit in with their mobility needs.\u201d\n\nHowever, the long-term goal is that as JET attracts more partners and funding from VCs, it will build solar or wind-powered stations across the board.\n\nThere are several players in the African EV industry. Apart from JET in Nigeria, Siltech builds electric bikes, patrol vehicles, and even utility vehicles for the agricultural sector.\n\nIn Kenya, ARC Ride has launched two and three-wheelers which companies like Uber Eats and Kibanda Top Up use for deliveries. In Rwanda, Ampersand has introduced a fleet of electric motorcycle taxis, operating as an Uber of sorts while maintaining ownership of the vehicles.\n\nIn Uganda, Kiira Motors, which has built electric buses and cars since 2011, already ply the country\u2019s roads.\n\nDespite these strides, Africa is still grossly underrepresented. Ajaere believes JET Motor Company is excellently positioned to turn this around with its vehicles specifically designed for the continent\u2019s bad roads and humid temperatures.\n\nNigeria\u2019s automotive industry, much like the fintech space, has had its fair share of interesting policies and Ajaere once again echoes his thoughts on the policy outlook in Africa.\n\n\u201cYou can have great ideas, but every great company had funding and good policies that incentivised them to make these vehicles easily accessible.\n\n\u201cIf countries like Ghana and Nigeria have favourable policies, over time we should be able to export these vehicles not only within Africa but within the decade or next, move across the shores of Africa,\u201d Ajaere concludes.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo words: African dominance. And the company is looking for funding from VCs and angel investors with a similar mindset and interest in the renewable energy space.\n\nAway from that, while JET Motor Company is currently focused on the mass transportation space, it plans to build passenger lines.\n\nThere are also plans to innovate in the battery swapping technology space.\n\n\u201cOur plan for expansion is to rapidly get the right funding and literally plant charging stations across African cities and African highways, making it easier for both individuals and corporations to adopt the EV because they are more likely to buy an EV if they know they can have access to charging stations,\u201d Ajaere says.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "The Lagos State University Teaching Hospital is taking a shot at cutting Nigeria\u2019s medical tourism that costs about $2.1 billion yearly.\n\nPrivate healthcare facilities are already racing to domesticate the high quality of services many seek abroad, government-run hospitals are equally jostling to deliver at par and rebuild confidence in a system that has lost much in the public trust to negligence.\n\nOne of the three tertiary hospitals in Nigeria\u2019s economic capital, the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) is carrying out expansions of critical infrastructure and updates of equipment for advanced delivery.\n\nThese are areas of sub-specialities that public hospitals are often overlooked as lacking expertise, equipment, or low success rate.\n\nFrom non-invasive surgeries on the brain to advanced laser eyes surgeries, transplants, or complex removal of weak organs, the hospital has built a crop of a well-resourced team of experts with international repute and has acquired the requisite tools for them to perform.\n\nAbout 150 consultants in different sub-specialities are available at the hospital, armed with skills to stop the heart from beating, repair the heart and make it start beating again among others, Adetokunbo Fabamwo, a professor and chief medical director, LASUTH stated during a walk-through session with the media.\n\nRead also: \u2018Legislation can make healthcare affordable for everyone\u2019\n\nWhile some can take out gallbladders or fibroids without tearing up the abdomen, others can change a bad kidney to a good one through a process of transplant.\n\nThese complex medical procedures top list of cases that drive medical tourism out of Nigeria, with about 500 patients who seek specialised treatment yearly in India, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Israel among others.\n\nAlthough official data on health do not capture the actual expenditure on Nigeria\u2019s medical tourism, an estimated 1billion is sent yearly.\n\nInternational healthcare organisations who recognise the potential of Nigeria\u2019s patient market leverage ties with primary healthcare physicians to penetrate.\n\nHowever, LASUTH is vying for not just a bigger share of the pie, it is providing subsidised services in the following areas.\n\nUltra-modern Endoscopic Suite\n\nThe hospital is setting up an ultra-modern endoscopic suite that will hold about eight new dialysis units and a cardiac catheterisation laboratory where interventional heart surgeries can take place in real-time.\n\nWhat this means, for instance, is that if patients who suddenly suffer cardiac arrest or stroke make it to the hospital in 30 minutes or an hour, they can get a life-saving intervention.\n\nLASUTH interventional cardiologists had been carrying out this procedure before now but the new laboratory presents an ideal ambience to perform the procedure.\n\nThe laboratory at 70 percent completion will place LASUTH as the first public hospital in Lagos to set this up and ranks it in line with high-rated private hospitals such as First Cardiology and Evercare.\n\nIt is billed to begin operation by August, and it comes under a public-private partnership with Adcem Healthcare Limited, a private company that specialises in sourcing sophisticated medical equipment, consumables, drugs and vascular access products.\n\n\u201cThere are so many patients that die because they do not get immediate intervention. They die from pulmonary embolism and heart attacks. A number die from haemorrhagic stroke leading to sudden death. Pulmonary embolism is when a clot is lodged from either one of the veins in the legs or the pelvis and then goes to block a vessel in the lungs. Usually, such a patient has a short time to survive unless theirs is intervention,\u201d the chief medical director explained.\n\n\u201cSo what a cardiac catheterisation does is that when such a patient is picked up, we have an interventional cardiologist who can go in and remove the clot. If it\u2019s a myocardial infarction (heart attack), they go after the vessel in the heart that is blocked and remove the clot and the patient is dramatically healed. Having this lab should make things easier.\u201d\n\nLASUTH prides itself as the only public hospital that carries out frequent open-heart surgeries, after the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital (OAUTH), Ile-Ife, Osun State.\n\nAnd compared with going abroad at a cost as high as 15 million, the government\u2019s subsidy maintains the hospital\u2019s rate at a range of 1.5 million to two million. This is a rate that leaves no compromise on the quality of procedure as success cases have shown.\n\nOne-stop-emergency-shop\n\nThe distress that comes with roaming the hospital premises to get medical investigations done in scattered units could add salt to injury for patients.\n\nHowever, this has been addressed with an upgrade of the medical and surgical emergency unit to a one-stop-shop where laboratory and radiological tests can be done and the pharmacy can be accessed with minimised movement.\n\nProfessor Fabamwo describes it as an \u201corganisation of patient\u2019s flow\u201d that contributes to better patient outcomes.\n\nThe initiative is equally facilitated by a PPP arrangement with private companies to start providing all services in the emergency units where patients have the first contact with the hospital.\n\n120 more beds coming\n\nIn addition to its combined capacity of 750-bed spaces, which scarcely handles patients\u2019 demands, a 120-bed facility is under construction and will be completed before the year-end.\n\nLack of bed spaces has been a persisting challenge that often dictates survival for most patients. Emergency units are often filled with patients who might take days or weeks to be stable enough for transfer to the wards. This makes taking up new emergencies difficult, sometimes leading to loss of lives or worsened conditions.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s investigation in 2019 found that patients unlucky to be admitted immediately received first aid treatment in private cars, taxis, commercial buses and even tricycles.\n\nLASUTH\u2019s two emergency units have only 40 beds each emergency with far higher demand from patients.\n\n\u201cThis is going to solve the space problem that I referred to earlier because if you have 120 extra-beds to put our patients in, then we are likely to be able to take in more emergencies in all our units of emergency,\u201d the chief medical director said.\n\nThe new 120-bed facility is a donation by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Office, through the special adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on SDGs, Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire.\n\nHe added that plans are also afoot to construct a 600-bed iconic building in the hospital. It\u2019s however at the planning stage, with expectations that the governor will assent to it.\n\nAlso, at the critical care unit, the hospital has a total of 20 beds including 12 under PPP and eight under direct administration of the management. It has a major advantage in rates.\n\nHappiness meters\n\nTo entrench patient-centric culture in its system, an automated feedback system has been set up for patients to communicate their level of satisfaction with services.\n\nAftercare, a patient can indicate if they are leaving happy, unhappy, slightly happy or very annoyed.\n\nThe hospital hopes to use this feedbacks as an assessment of its performance in the hope to keep improving its quality of delivery.\n\nSign languages are also coming to help direct patients around the hospital.\n\nCall for partnership\n\nAccording to Fabamwo, the management is looking to find serious commitment for partnership in certain areas it already has manpower but lacks the equipment to deliver.\n\nIn its eye department, for instance, foreign-trained experts who can handle laser surgeries are available but \u201cwe need advanced laser surgery equipment, which costs between N50 million and N100 million. We want partners to invest. We will run it and they will maintain it. We will operate and they will recoup their money,\u201d he said.\n\nPartnerships are also needed in the radiotherapy aspects of cancer care. Even though it has about five expert oncologists as staff, patients only stop at surgery and chemotherapy and are forced to seek radiotherapy treatment outside.\n\nIn general, LASUTH has displayed its commitment to take healthcare further. It has a governing body that is headed by some of the best hands in Nigeria\u2019s private healthcare sector and they have brought to bear their wealth and experience to help deliver a public healthcare system that works.\n\nThese areas of strength open opportunities that patients can fully leverage, without leaving the shores of Nigeria.",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nA celebrated Nigerian police officer, Abba Kyari, who has been mentioned as a beneficiary in an international fraud case, has explained his stance.\n\nMr Kyari, a deputy commissioner of police, was mentioned by Ramon Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi, as receiving part of the proceeds of fraud for which the latter is being prosecuted in the U.S.\n\nHushpuppi, who has agreed to plead guilty go the fraud, told U.S. prosecutors that he gave Mr Kyari part of the proceeds of the crime.\n\nHe said he also got Mr Kyari to arrest one of Nigerian accomplices when they had a disagreement.\n\nMr Kyari took to his verified Facebook page to state his stance.\n\nIn his statement, Mr Kyari said he did not demand any money from Hushpuppi. He, however, said he introduced the accused to a cloth seller whom Hushpuppi paid about N300,000.\n\nSee Mr Kyari\u2019s full post below.\n\nFriends: Abbas who we later came to know as Hushpuppi called our office about 2years ago that somebody in Nigeria Seriously threatened to kill his Family here in Nigeria and he sent the person\u2019s Phone number and pleaded we take action before the Person attacks his family.\n\nWe traced and arrested the Suspect and after investigations we discovered there wasn\u2019t an actual threat to anyone\u2019s life And they are long time friends who have money issues between them hence we released the Suspect on bail to go and he was not taken to any jail.\n\nNobody demanded for a kobo from Abbas Hushpuppi. Our focus was to Save people\u2019s lives that were purported to have been threatened.\n\nLater, he saw some of my Native Clothes and Caps on my social media page and he said he likes them and he was connected to the person selling the clothes and he sent about N300k directly to the person\u2019s account. The Native Clothes and Caps (5 sets) were brought to our office and He sent somebody to Collect them in our office.\n\nNobody demanded any money from Abbas Hushpuppi and nobody collected any money from him. We responded to a distress call he made on threat to his family and released the Suspect when we discovered there was no life threat from the Suspect. This is the true story. Vincent is alive, he can be contacted.\n\nFor those who are celebrating that this is an indictment on us and mentioning some fictitious Big Money, They will be disappointed once again as our hands are clean and our record of Service for 2 decades is open for everybody to See. They will continue seeing us serving our father land and we will Continue responding to ALL distress Calls from ALL Nigerians provided they are life threatening.\n\nFor Good Nigerians who appreciate our Service please don\u2019t worry as our hands are clean and they should please not respond to those celebrating and creating many false Narratives without any Evidence. We are used to such types of people and false newsmakers and distributors.\n\nThank you all and GOD bless Nigeria.",

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThe decision on Tuesday by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to discontinue forex supplies to the Bureau de Change Operators in the country may have pushed backwards the possibility of an end to the crisis rocking the nation\u2019s foreign exchange market.\n\nNaira fell significantly against the U.S. dollar at the parallel market on Wednesday noon, a day after the apex bank\u2019s decision.\n\nThe local unit, which opened the today\u2019s trading session at N505 per $1, closed at N522 to a dollar at the parallel market segment, data from abokiFX.com, a website that collates parallel rates in Lagos showed.\n\nThis implies a N17.00 or 3.40 per cent devaluation from N505.00, the rate it closed at the previous session of the black market on Tuesday, and the currency\u2019s biggest fall ever.\n\nThe CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, had while announcing the end of forex sales and new licence approval after the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) two-day meeting in Abuja, expressed the MPC\u2019s disappointment over their (BDCs\u2019) continuous abuse of the privilege.\n\nEmefiele said the BDCs had defeated their purpose of existence to provide forex to retail user, but instead, they had become wholesale and illegal dealers.\n\nHe said, \u201cOperators in the BDC have not reciprocated the gesture to help maintain price stability in the market since the CBN had been selling forex to them.\n\n\u201cThey have remained renegade and so greedy, recalcitrant with abnormally high profit from these sales while ordinary Nigerians have been left to feel the pain and therefore suffer.\n\n\u201cGiven this rent seeking behaviour, it is not surprising that since the CBN began to sell forex to the BDCs, the number of operators has risen from mere 74 in 2005 to over 2,700 in 2016, and almost 5,500 BDCs as at today.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the CBN constantly receives nothing less than 500 new applications from BDC licences every month, and we therefore begin to wonder, what is in this business that everybody must be in it?\u201d\n\nOobserving that BDCs had continued to make huge profits while Nigerians suffered in pain, Emefiele said the commercial banks would be monitored to provide forex for the legitimate use of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe Central Bank will henceforth discontinue the sale of forex to Bureau de Change operators,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\nThe CBN had been supplying each licensed BDCs $10,000 twice per week at the rate of N393 with the instruction that they should sell with a margin of N2.\n\nEconomist and former Director-General, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Dr Muda Yusuf, said what was happening in the foreign exchange market was a consequence of the CBN\u2019s policy choice of a fixed exchange rate regime and administrative allocation of forex.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is a policy regime that has created a huge enterprise around foreign exchange \u2013 round tripping, speculation, over invoicing, capital flight etc.\n\n\u201cThe action of the apex bank amounts to tackling the symptoms rather than dealing with the causative factors, which is not a sustainable solution.\n\n\u201cIt is regrettable that the CBN does not believe in the market mechanism. Yet market systems are time tested as instruments of efficient resource allocation in leading economies around the world.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cMoving retail forex transactions from BDCs to the banks was like kicking the can down the road. The same issues would manifest even with the banks.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the way out of the foreign exchange conundrum was for the CBN to allow the market to function.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe CBN needs to give the market a chance. Its current approach would continue to deepen distortions in the economy, perpetuate round tripping, fuel speculation, suppress forex supply and boost underground economy.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say the move is bound to push prices of goods and services higher at a time inflation has reached a four-year high.\n\nMost Nigerian businesses and travellers source forex from BDCs after CBN placed restrictions on transactions that can qualify for official sales of foreign currencies.",

          "text": "Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, has narrated his encounter with alleged international fraudster, Ramon Abbas aka Hushpuppi.\n\nOn his verified Facebook page on Thursday, Kyari, a leader of the Inspector-General of Police\u2019 Intelligence Response Team, said Hushpuppi called his office some two years ago and reported a death threat from someone.\n\nThe cop said the suspect, who was later identified as Chibuzo Vincent, was arrested but released after investigations revealed that \u201cthey are long time friends who have money issues between them\u201d.\n\nKyari also said he did not receive any money from Hushpuppi.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that the United States District Court for the Central District of California said Hushpuppi used Kyari to arrest and jail a co-conspirator, Vincent, after the latter threatened to expose a $1m fraud committed against a Qatari businessman.\n\nHushpuppi, 37, in a plea agreement document he personally signed, pleaded guilty to the charges including money laundering, wire fraud, felony amongst others. He risks 20 years\u2019 imprisonment and other penalties when convicted.\n\nAccording to the indictment by the court, Hushpuppi allegedly conspired with five others \u2013 including Vincent \u2013 to defraud the businessperson (whose name was withheld) by claiming to be consultants and bankers who could facilitate a loan to finance the construction of a school in Qatar.\n\nHushpuppi worked with some of his partners in crime including 28-year-old Abdulrahman Juma from Kenya, and 40-year-old Chibuzo Vincent from Nigeria. Other are Yusuf Anifowoshe, 26; Rukayat Fashola, 28; and Bolatito Agbabiaka, 34.\n\nHowever, Hushpuppi allegedly hunted Vincent after a dispute broke out among the team and after the latter threatened to expose the fraud to the Qatari businessman.\n\n\u201cAccording to the affidavit, Kyari is a highly decorated deputy commissioner of the Nigeria Police Force who is alleged to have arranged for Vincent to be arrested and jailed at Abbas\u2019 behest, and then sent Abbas photographs of Vincent after his arrest. Kyari also allegedly sent Abbas bank account details for an account into which Abbas could deposit payment for Vincent\u2019s arrest and imprisonment,\u201d the statement partly read.\n\nBut Kyari said, \u201cAbbas who we later came to know as Hushpuppi called our office about 2 years ago that somebody in Nigeria seriously threatened to kill his family here in Nigeria and he sent the person\u2019s phone number and pleaded we take action before the person attacks his family.\n\n\u201cWe traced and arrested the suspect and after investigations, we discovered there wasn\u2019t an actual threat to anyone\u2019s life. And they are long time friends who have money issues between them hence we released the suspect on bail to go and he was not taken to any jail.\n\n\u201cNobody demanded a kobo from Abbas Hushpuppi. Our focus was to save people\u2019s lives that were purported to have been threatened.\n\n\u201cLater, he saw some of my native clothes and caps on my social media page and he said he likes them and he was connected to the person selling the clothes and he sent about N300k directly to the person\u2019s account. The native clothes and caps (5 sets) were brought to our office and he sent somebody to collect them in our office.\n\n\u201cNobody demanded any money from Abbas Hushpuppi and nobody collected any money from him. We responded to a distress call he made on threat to his family and released the suspect when we discovered there was no life threat from the suspect. This is the true story. Vincent is alive, he can be contacted.\u201d\n\nHushpuppi is known to have flaunted his luxury lifestyle in private jets with exotic wines and expensive wristwatches. His social media handles were replete with photos of his ostentatious lifestyle before his arrest last year June in Dubai after which he was extradited to the US where he is being prosecuted for money laundering and internet fraud-related charges.

Kyari also allegedly sent Abbas bank account details for an account into which Abbas could deposit payment for Vincent\u2019s arrest and imprisonment,\u201d the statement partly read.\n\nBut Kyari said, \u201cAbbas who we later came to know as Hushpuppi called our office about 2 years ago that somebody in Nigeria seriously threatened to kill his family here in Nigeria and he sent the person\u2019s phone number and pleaded we take action before the person attacks his family.\n\n\u201cWe traced and arrested the suspect and after investigations, we discovered there wasn\u2019t an actual threat to anyone\u2019s life. And they are long time friends who have money issues between them hence we released the suspect on bail to go and he was not taken to any jail.\n\n\u201cNobody demanded a kobo from Abbas Hushpuppi. Our focus was to save people\u2019s lives that were purported to have been threatened.\n\n\u201cLater, he saw some of my native clothes and caps on my social media page and he said he likes them and he was connected to the person selling the clothes and he sent about N300k directly to the person\u2019s account. The native clothes and caps (5 sets) were brought to our office and he sent somebody to collect them in our office.\n\n\u201cNobody demanded any money from Abbas Hushpuppi and nobody collected any money from him. We responded to a distress call he made on threat to his family and released the suspect when we discovered there was no life threat from the suspect. This is the true story. Vincent is alive, he can be contacted.\u201d\n\nHushpuppi is known to have flaunted his luxury lifestyle in private jets with exotic wines and expensive wristwatches. His social media handles were replete with photos of his ostentatious lifestyle before his arrest last year June in Dubai after which he was extradited to the US where he is being prosecuted for money laundering and internet fraud-related charges.

          "text": "About five years after their trial commenced, a Kaduna state High Court Wednesday discharged and acquitted leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) otherwise known as Shi\u2019ites, Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky, and his wife, Zeenat; over a case of homicide.\n\nThe duo were charged to court over allegations of culpable homicide, unlawful assembly, among other criminal charges since December 2018, following a clash between his followers and the convoy of the immediate past Chief of Army Staff, Lt-Gen. Tukur Yusuf Buratai in Zaria December 2015.\n\nAt the end of the court proceedings during which the prosecution and defendants\u2019 counsel addressed the court on the no-case submission prayer filed El-Zakzaky and wife at the last sitting, Justice Gideon Kurada fixed Wednesday July 28 for ruling.\n\nDelivering ruling on the secret trial, Justice Kurada, was said to have upheld the no-case submission of the defendant.\n\nThe court found that the charges filed in the year 2018 pursuant to a Penal law enacted by the Kaduna state government in 2017 over offenses allegedly committed in 2015 were ab-initio.\n\nAccording to the counsel to Zakzaky, Marshal Abubakar, the court upheld their no-case submission and agreed that the case lacked merit. \u201cThe trial of Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky and his wife, Malama Zeenat Ibraheem has come to an end today. The court has upheld our no-case submission.\n\n\u201cThe court found that the charges that were filed in the year 2018 pursuant to a Penal law enacted by the Kaduna state government in 2017 over offenses allegedly committed in 2015 is ab-initio. The court ruled that the charge ought not to be in the first place because you cannot arraign a man for an offence that was already committed as at the time the said crime was not an offence. And the court was very emphatic on that.\n\n\u201cThe Kaduna State government has powers to enact laws, but they cannot enact law to prosecute an offence retrospectively. That is the first ground on which the court held that that charge was incompetent.\n\n\u201cOn the no-case submission we filed in court, the court agreed with us that the trial lacked merits. That the prosecution only came to court to tell stories that are at cross variance with the offences that were alleged in the charges.\n\n\u201cThe court agreed with us that, El-Zakzaky and his wife have committed no offence. The Court however discharged and acquitted El-Zakzaky and his wife. It said there should not have been any charge against El-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenat in the first place,\u201d he said.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) further quoted Abubakar as saying \u201cthe court, thereby, discharges and acquits the defendants, as there should have been no charge in the first place. No party asked for cost of fine.\u201d\n\nHowever, NAN reports that the lead counsel of the prosecution team, Mr. Dari Bayero, declined comment as he stepped into his car and drove off.\n\nThe IMN leader and his wife could not be accessed by journalists as they were whisked out of the court in company of their lead counsel, Femi Falana (SAN), after the judgement that lasted close to eight hours.\n\nWe\u2018re vindicated \u2013 IMN\n\nBut in a reaction to the judgement, the IMN said the ruling vindicated the Shi\u2019ites and had proven that both the movement and its leader were only victims of \u2018impunity and mischievous plots\u2019 by both federal and Kaduna state governments.\n\nThe group said this in a statement, a copy of which was obtained by Blueprint in Abuja.\n\nThe statement was signed by IMN Media Forum President Ibrahim Musa.\n\nIt reads: \u201cToday, Wednesday, 28/07/2021 the Kaduna State High Court presided by Justice Gideon Kurada delivered a favourable judgement in the \u201cno case submission defence led by the defense lawyers on the case brought against the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky and his wife, Malama Zeenah Hashim.\n\n\u201cThe duo have been on standing trumped-up sundry trumped up charges, including that of aiding and abetting culpable homicide punishable by death.With this victory in court today, the false charges filed against them has finally been punctured for good after almost five years of excruciating illegal detention.\n\n\u201cThis judgement has not only vindicated them and all members of the Islamic movement in Nigeria, but it is certainly a victory for perseverance in the face of extreme persecution by the Nigerian government. It is a victory for truth and justice against tyranny and impunity.\n\n\u201cIt will be recalled that the Kaduna state government filed charges against Sheikh Zakzaky and his wife as an afterthought a year and a half after a federal high court in Abuja had ruled that their continued detention was unconstitutional, illegal and a severe breach of their fundamental rights and thereby must be set free and compensated.\n\n\u201cThe government however remained in contempt until they decided to frame these spurious false charges in an attempt to perpetually keep them in their illegal custody.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, give praises to the Almighty for yet another successful outing, which further proves to the world that the Islamic Movement and its leader, are only victims of impunity and mischievous plots by both the Buhari-led federal government and the El-Rufai-led Kaduna state government.\n\n\u201cSince both governments have again failed in court after a fair trial, we expect them to respect the judgement of this honourable court and the course of justice to release them with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cWe wish to use this opportunity to also say a big thank you to all people of conscience, human rights activists and organizations, journalists and all those that joined in our dogged campaign for justice for the victims of Zaria genocide for the past five years. Thank you and God bless.\u201d\n\nThe trial\n\nNAN recalls that the Kaduna State Government had charged El-Zakzaky and Zeenat with an eight-count charge bordering on alleged culpable homicide, unlawful assembly and disruption of public peace, among other charges.\n\nThe defendants had pleaded not guilty to the charge\n\nNAN reports that on September 29, 2021, the court dismissed a no-case submission filed by El-Zakzaky and his wife Zeenat.\n\nIn the motion, El-Zakzaky asked the court to dismiss the allegations against him and his wife for lack of evidence.\n\nBut in his ruling, Justice Kurada dismissed the no-case submission, saying it was premature to rule on the application to quash the charges against the defendants in view of the clear provisions of the Kaduna State Administration of Criminal Justice.\n\n",

The first and second billion were reached after about 140 and 40 days respectively.\n\nForty of the four billion shots have been administered in China (1.6 billion).

          "text": "Respected Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari has been indicted of having links to Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, also known as Ray Hushpuppi, who is presently facing trial for fraud in a United States court.\n\nHushpuppi in the indictment, was said to have paid Abba Kyari to get one of his traducers arrested and jailed in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to a latest release by the Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Central District of California:\n\n\u201cCourt documents outline a dispute among members of the conspiracy, which allegedly prompted Vincent to contact the victim and claim that Abbas (Hushpuppi) and Juma were engaged in fraud.\n\n\u201cAfter this contact, Abbas allegedly arranged to have Vincent jailed in Nigeria by Abba Alhaji Kyari, 46, of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, \u201cKyari is a highly decorated deputy commissioner of the Nigeria Police Force who is alleged to have arranged for Vincent to be arrested and jailed at Abbas\u2019 behest, and then sent Abbas photographs of Vincent after his arrest. Kyari also allegedly sent Abbas bank account details for an account into which Abbas could deposit payment for Vincent\u2019s arrest and imprisonment.\u201d\n\nAbba Kyari, known to have smashed top criminal cases drew the ire of the public when he made an appearance at the party of nightlife entrepreneur Obi Cubana in southeast Anambra State, where millions in various currency were sprayed.\n\nHushpuppi, who is expected to plead guilt in the case where he is indicted with five others in an international scheme to defraud.\n\nAccording to the release from the Department of Justice, Hushpuppi has admitted to guilt in the Money Laundering in School Financing Scam and Additional Cyber and Business Email Compromise Schemes.\n\nThe criminal complaint that initiated the prosecution in February was also unsealed on Monday, revealing Hushpuppi was initially charged in this case.\n\nCourt documents ordered unsealed showed that Abbas, a 37-year-old Nigerian national, pleaded guilty on April 20.\n\nA version of Abbas\u2019 plea agreement filed late Tuesday outlines his role in the school-finance scheme, as well as several other cyber and business email compromise schemes that cumulatively caused more than $24 million in losses.\n\n\u201cThe defendants allegedly faked the financing of a Qatari school by playing the roles of bank officials and creating a bogus website in a scheme that also bribed a foreign official to keep the elaborate pretense going after the victim was tipped off,\u201d said Acting United States Attorney Tracy L. Wilkison.\n\n\u201cMr. Abbas, who played a significant role in the scheme, funded his luxurious lifestyle by laundering illicit proceeds generated by con artists who use increasingly sophisticated means. In conjunction with our law enforcement partners, we will identify and prosecute perpetrators of business email compromise scams, which is a massive and growing international crime problem.\n\n\u201cMr. Abbas, among the most high-profile money launderers in the world, has admitted to his significant role in perpetrating global BEC fraud, a scheme currently plaguing Americans,\u201d said Kristi K. Johnson, the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office. \u201cHis celebrity status and ability to make connections seeped into legitimate organizations and led to several spin-off schemes in the U.S. and abroad. Today\u2019s announcement deals a crucial blow to this international network and hopefully serves as a warning to potential victims targeted with this type of theft.\u201d\n\nAccording to the indictment, Abbas allegedly conspired with Abdulrahman Imraan Juma, a.k.a. \u201cAbdul,\u201d 28, of Kenya, and Kelly Chibuzo Vincent, 40, of Nigeria, to defraud the Qatari businessperson by claiming to be consultants and bankers who could facilitate a loan to finance construction of the planned school.\n\nJuma allegedly posed as a facilitator and consultant for the illusory bank loans, while Abbas played the role of \u201cMalik,\u201d a Wells Fargo banker in New York, according to court documents.\n\nVincent, in turn, allegedly provided support for the false narratives fed to the victim by, among other things, creating bogus documents and arranging for the creation of a fake bank website and phone banking line.\n\nYusuf Adekinka Anifowoshe, a.k.a. \u201cAJ,\u201d 26, of Brooklyn, New York, allegedly played a role in the fraud, assisting Abbas with a call to the victim posing as \u201cMalik.\u201d Special agents with the FBI arrested Anifowoshe in New York on July 22.\n\nThe conspirators allegedly defrauded the victim out of more than $1.1 million.\n\nThe proceeds of the fraud allegedly were laundered in several ways. According to the indictment, Abbas was assisted in laundering the proceeds of the fraud by Rukayat Motunraya Fashola, a.k.a. \u201cMorayo,\u201d 28, of Valley Stream, New York, and Bolatito Tawakalitu Agbabiaka, a.k.a. \u201cBolamide,\u201d 34, of Linden, New Jersey. These two defendants also were arrested on July 22 by FBI agents.\n\nApproximately $230,000 of the stolen funds allegedly were used to purchase a Richard Mille RM11-03 watch, which was hand delivered to Abbas in Dubai and subsequently appeared in Hushpuppi\u2019s social media posts. Other illicit proceeds from the scheme were allegedly converted into cashier\u2019s checks, including $50,000 in checks that were used by Abbas and a co-conspirator to fraudulently acquire a St. Christopher and Nevis citizenship, as well as a passport for Abbas obtained by creating a false marriage certificate and then bribing a government official in St. Kitts.\n\nCourt documents outline a dispute among members of the conspiracy, which allegedly prompted Vincent to contact the victim and claim that Abbas and Juma were engaged in fraud. After this contact, Abbas allegedly arranged to have Vincent jailed in Nigeria by Abba Alhaji Kyari, 46, of Nigeria. According to the affidavit, Kyari is a highly decorated deputy commissioner of the Nigeria Police Force who is alleged to have arranged for Vincent to be arrested and jailed at Abbas\u2019 behest, and then sent Abbas photographs of Vincent after his arrest. Kyari also allegedly sent Abbas bank account details for an account into which Abbas could deposit payment for Vincent\u2019s arrest and imprisonment.\n\nAnifowoshe, Fashola and Agbabiaka were arrested in New York and New Jersey on July 22, and they are expected to be arraigned in Los Angeles in August. All three are currently free on bond.\n\nA criminal complaint and an indictment contain allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nBoth conspiracy counts alleged in the indictment carry a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison. Aggravated identity theft carries a mandatory two-year prison term.\n\nThe FBI is investigating this matter as part of Operation Top Dog. The FBI thanks the government of the United Arab Emirates and the Dubai Police Department for their substantial assistance in this matter. The FBI also thanks the Kenyan Office of Attorney General, Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and Directorate of Criminal Investigations for their substantial assistance.\n\nThis case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Khaldoun Shobaki of the Cyber and Intellectual Property Crimes Section.\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",

          "title": "China Building Second Nuclear Missiles Base, Analysts Say",
          "text": "Analysts at the Federation of American Scientists say China is building a second field of silos for launching nuclear missiles in a development that could constitute \u201cthe most significant expansion of the Chinese nuclear arsenal ever\u201d.\n\nThe United States-based researchers made the discovery after analysing commercial satellite images, and said on Monday that the field \u2013 located near the city of Hami in Xinjiang province \u2013 may eventually include about 110 silos.\n\nThe new field is about 380km (236 miles) from a base near the city of Yumen in neighbouring Gansu province, where a separate group of researchers earlier this month found construction under way on 120 missile silos.\n\nAltogether, the People\u2019s Liberation Army Rocket Force now appears to have 250 silos under construction at Hami, Yumen, as well as at a training ground near the city of Jilantai in Inner Mongolia, wrote the FAS\u2019s Matt Korda and Hans Kristensen.\n\nThe number marks a significant increase, they said, given that China has for decades operated only 20 silos for its liquid fuel Df-5 Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM).\n\n\u201cThe number of new Chinese silos under construction exceeds the number of silo-based ICBMs operated by Russia, and constitutes more than half of the size of the entire US ICBM force,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe Chinese missile silo program constitutes the most extensive silo construction since the US and Soviet missile silo construction during the Cold War.\u201d\n\nHowever, they stressed that it was unclear how China would operate the new silos, whether it would load all of them with missiles or use a portion as empty decoys. They also noted it was not known how many warheads each missile would carry.\n\nStill, Korda and Kristensen said, the new silos could allow China to double or triple its nuclear warhead stockpile, which most experts say numbers between 250 and 350 warheads under Beijing\u2019s \u201cminimum deterrent\u201d policy.\n\nKorda and Kristensen noted, however, that even if China were to double or triple its nuclear stockpile it would still be a long way from near-parity with the stockpiles of Russia and the US, each of which have nuclear warhead stockpiles of close to 4,000.\n\n\u201cRegardless of how many silos China ultimately intends to fill with ICBMs, this new missile complex represents a logical reaction to a dynamic arms competition in which multiple nuclear-armed players \u2013 including Russia, India, and the United States \u2013 are improving both their nuclear and conventional forces as well as missile defense capabilities,\u201d they said.\n\nThere was no response from the Chinese government on the new report.\n\nBut the state-owned tabloid Global Times said on Tuesday that some people in China have suggested those silos claimed by the US might be foundations of wind power plants. It added that US media and relevant institutes hype China\u2019s \u201csilos\u201d to increase pressure on Beijing to change its behaviour and to provide \u201cmore reason for the US to upgrade its nuclear arsenal\u201d.\n\nIt added: \u201cHowever, Washington needs to be clear that in an era when China\u2019s economic and technological capabilities are abundant, the US\u2019 implementation of a policy with strong pressure and the resulting increased risk of a China-US strategic collision will inevitably bring a sense of urgency for China to intensify the building of its nuclear deterrent.\u201d\n\nIn the US capital, the Pentagon appeared to agree with Korda and Kristensen\u2019s assessment that the Hami and Yumen developments were missile silos. \u201cThis is the second time in two months the public has discovered what we have been saying all along about the growing threat the world faces and the veil of secrecy that surrounds it,\u201d the US Strategic Command said in a tweet on Tuesday.\n\nThe report also stoked concern among Republican members of Congress.\n\nMike Turner, a Republican member of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, described China\u2019s nuclear build-up as \u201cunprecedented\u201d and said the development \u201cmakes clear they are deploying nuclear weapons to threaten the United States and our allies\u201d.\n\nChina\u2019s refusal to discuss its nuclear arsenal \u201cshould be a cause for concern and condemned by all responsible nations\u201d, he added.\n\nAnother Republican, Congressman Mike Rodgers, said China\u2019s crash nuclear buildup was not \u201cthe actions of a country with a \u2018no first use\u2019 policy and seeking only a \u2018minimum credible deterrent\u2019\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a serious discussion about what it truly means to have to deter two near-peer nuclear adversaries at the same time,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt is abundantly clear that we must also rapidly modernise our nuclear infrastructure and bring our deterrent into the 21st century.\u201d\n\nThe US has repeatedly called on China to join it and Russia on a new arms control treaty.\n\nBeijing has rejected the call, but said it would be happy to hold arms control talks if the US was willing to reduce the size of its nuclear arsenal to China\u2019s level.",

Sun Dawu runs one of the country\u2019s largest private agricultural businesses in the northern province of Hebei.\n\nSun, 67, has in the past spoken out about human rights and politically sensitive topics.\n\nHe was found guilty of \u201cpicking quarrels and provoking trouble\u201d \u2013 a charge often used against activists.\n\nOther charges against him include illegally occupying farmland, assembling a crowd to attack state agencies and obstructing government workers from performing their duties. He was also fined 3.11 million yuan ($478,697; \u00a3343,227).\n\nSun\u2019s company is among China\u2019s biggest, with businesses ranging from meat processing and pet food to schools and hospitals.\n\nHe was reportedly detained last year, along with 20 relatives and business associates, over a land dispute with a government-run farm.\n\nAt the time, he said dozens of his employees were injured in an incident with police related to the dispute, according to an AFP report.\n\nSun is said to be close to some prominent Chinese political dissidents and has in the past criticised the government\u2019s rural policies.\n\nHe was one of the few people to openly accuse the government of covering up an African swine flu outbreak, which affected his farms in 2019, and later devastated much of the country\u2019s industry.\n\nHe also was sentenced to prison in 2003, for \u201cillegal fundraising\u201d but the case was overturned after an outpouring of support from activists and the public.\n\nSun reportedly denied many of the accusations against him in a pre-trial hearing, describing himself as an \u201coutstanding Communist party member\u201d.\n\nHe did however reportedly admit to making mistakes, including posting messages online.\n\n\u201cThe way they\u2019re investigating me now is making those close to us suffer and those who hate us rejoice. I wish to take the charges upon myself, even if they\u2019re severe, in exchange for the release of others. We are people who have made contributions to society,\u201d he said.\n\nChina has been cracking down on businesses and entrepreneurs in the country. Major technology companies including Alibaba, Didi and Tencent are being investigated for a range of regulatory issues.",

          "text": "Japanese officials sounded the alarm Thursday after Tokyo reported record-breaking coronavirus cases for two straight days with the Olympics well underway.\n\n\u201cWe have never experienced the expansion of the infections of this magnitude,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told reporters. He said the new cases were soaring not only in the Tokyo area but across the country.\n\nTokyo reported 3,177 new cases on Wednesday, up from 2,848 on Tuesday, setting an all-time high and exceeding 3,000 for the first time.\n\nJapan has kept its cases and deaths lower than many other countries, but its seven-day rolling average is growing and now stands at 28 per 100,000 people nationwide and 88 in Tokyo, according to the Health Ministry. This compares to 18.5 in the United States, 48 in Britain and 2.8 in India, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\u201cWhile almost nothing is helping to slow the infections, there are many factors that can accelerate them,\u201d said Dr. Shigeru Omi, a top government medical adviser, noting the Olympics and summer vacation. \u201cThe biggest risk is the lack of a sense of crisis and without it, the infections will further expand and put medical systems under severe strain.\u201d\n\nTokyo has been under its fourth state of emergency since July 12, ahead of the Olympics, which began last Friday despite widespread public opposition and concern that they Games could worsen the outbreak.\n\nPeople are still roaming the streets despite stay-at-home requests, making the measures largely ineffective at a time the more infectious delta strain is spreading, he said. \u201cWe have never seen the infections spread so rapidly.\u201d\n\nAlarmed by the surge in Tokyo, the governors of three prefectures adjacent to the capital said they plan to ask Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to place their areas under the state of emergency too.\n\nExperts say Tokyo\u2019s surge is being propelled by the delta variant of the virus and there is no evidence of the disease being transmitted from Olympic participants to the general public.\n\nTokyo officials said Thursday that two foreign Olympic athletes are currently hospitalized and 38 others are self-isolating at designated hotels in the city. Gov. Yuriko Koike urged the organizers to make sure not to burden Tokyo\u2019s hospitals.\n\nNationwide, Japan reported more than 9,500 confirmed cases, a new record, on Wednesday for a total of about 892,000, with about 15,000 deaths.\n\nAs of Wednesday, 26.3% of the Japanese population has been fully vaccinated. The percentage of the elderly who are fully vaccinated is 70%, or 24.8 million people.",

          "title": "US Congress Pressures Biden to Reassess US-Nigeria Relations Over Human Rights Records",
          "text": "United States lawmakers have begun to mount pressure on President Joe Biden over concerns about Nigeria\u2019s human rights records.\n\nAlready, a proposed sale of 12 attack aircrafts and 28 helicopter engines worth $857 million has been put on hold.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have delayed clearing a proposed sale of 12 AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters and accompanying defence systems to the Nigerian military, pausing a deal worth some $875 million, according to U.S. officials and congressional aides familiar with the matter.\n\nForeign policy observed that Western governments and international human rights organisations had ramped up their criticisms of the Nigerian government, particularly, in the wake of its ban on Twitter, systemic corruption issues, and the Nigerian military\u2019s role in deadly crackdowns on protesters after widespread demonstrations against police brutality last year.\n\nChairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Bob Menendez, called for a \u201cfundamental rethink of the framework of our overall engagement\u201d with Nigeria during a Senate hearing with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in June.\n\nBoth Menendez and Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have therefore placed a hold on the proposed arms sale, according to multiple U.S. officials and congressional aides familiar with the matter, who spoke to Foreign Policy on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe details on the proposed sale were first sent by the US State Department to Congress in January before then former US Vice President Joe Biden was inaugurated as president, according to officials familiar with the matter.\n\nNigeria has relied on US arms sales in the past to help address multiple security challenges, including the 12-year insurgency by Boko Haram militants in the country\u2019s northeast, a spate of high-profile kidnapping-for-ransom campaigns targeting schoolchildren in the country\u2019s North-west, and deadly clashes between the country\u2019s semi-nomadic herders and farmers fueled by climate change and environmental degradation of the country\u2019s arable land.\n\nThe State Department, it was said, described the US-Nigeria relationship as \u201camong the most important in sub-Saharan Africa\u201d and had provided limited funding for various military training and education programmes.\n\nSome experts said the United States should hit the pause button on major defence sales until it could make a broader assessment of the extent to which corruption and mismanagement hobble the Nigerian military and whether the military was doing enough to minimise civilian casualties in its campaign against Boko Haram and other violent insurrectionists.\n\n\u201cThere doesn\u2019t have to be a reason why we don\u2019t provide weapons or equipment to the Nigerian military,\u201d said Judd Devermont, Director of the Africa programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank.\n\nContinuing, he added, \u201cBut it has to be done with an assessment of how it will actually, one, change the direction of conflict in Nigeria, and, two, that they will use it consistent with our laws. In both cases, it\u2019s either a question mark or a fail. There is a culture of impunity that exists around abuses by the military,\u201d said Anietie Ewang, the Nigeria researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\nEwang cited the Nigerian military\u2019s killing of unarmed protesters during the country\u2019s massive #EndSARS demonstrations against police corruption and brutality last year as well as cases documented by human rights organisations of abuses in the military\u2019s campaign against Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s a difficult situation. There are so many conflicts springing up across the country now. The authorities, I presume, are trying to do the best they can to save lives and properties. But this must be done in accordance with human rights standards. You can\u2019t throw one out just to be able to achieve the other.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the helicopters, the proposed sale included 28 helicopter engines produced by GE Aviation, 14 military-grade aircraft navigation systems made by Honeywell, and 2,000 advanced precision kill weapon systems\u2014laser-guided rocket munitions, according to information sent by the State Department to Congress and reviewed by Foreign Policy, a US-based magazine.\n\nIt said the behind-the-scenes controversy over the proposed arms sale illustrated a broader debate among Washington policymakers over how to balance national security with human rights objectives.\n\nIt said the hold on the sale also showcased how powerfully the US lawmakers wanted to push the Biden administration to rethink the country\u2019s relations with Africa\u2019s most populous nation amid overarching concerns that Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari was drifting towards authoritarianism as his government has been besieged by multiple security challenges, including a jihadist insurgency.\n\nNigerian Embassy in Washington did not, however, return a request for comment, foreign policy claimed.\n\nIn the past, the Nigerian military had dismissed reports of human rights abuses by its soldiers as baseless and accused human rights groups of undermining the military\u2019s resolve to combat terrorism.\n\nBut the United States had scrubbed proposed arms sales to Nigeria in the past on a case-by-case basis.\n\nFormer US President Barack Obama\u2019s administration cut back arms sales to Nigeria over concerns about civilian casualties and human rights abuses, including blocking a 2014 sale of Cobra helicopters by Israel to Nigeria.\n\nDuring that time, US officials reportedly voiced concerns that Boko Haram had infiltrated the Nigerian military\u2014an accusation that provoked indignation from the Nigerian government.\n\nThese moves severely strained US-Nigeria relations, with Buhari accusing Obama of having unintentionally \u201caided and abetted\u201d extremist groups by refusing to expand military cooperation and arms sales.\n\nIn late 2017, then US President Donald Trump\u2019s administration agreed to sell the Nigerian government 12 A-29 Super Tucano warplanes, resurrecting a proposed sale the Obama administration froze after the Nigerian Air Force bombed a refugee camp that January.\n\nThe first batch of those planes arrived in Nigeria earlier this month.\n\nA U.S. State Department spokesperson declined to comment on the matter, saying: \u201cas a matter of policy, the department does not confirm or comment upon proposed defence sales or transfers until they have been formally notified to Congress.\u201d\n\nUnder the current practice, the State Department informally notifies Congress through the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee (HFAC) of proposed arms sales in advance of a formal notification.\n\nIf committee members raise concerns about the proposed sale, the committees can freeze the sale until they receive satisfactory answers about their concerns from the State Department.\n\nOnce a proposed arms sale has been formally notified to Congress, Congress has a 30-day window to review the sale and, if it opposed the sale, it would pass a legislation to block it.\n\nBut if Congress took no action, the sale would move forward.\n\nA top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Michael McCaul, has signed off on the proposed sale of Cobra helicopters to Nigeria, a spokesperson for his office confirmed.\n\nThe office of the HFAC chairperson, Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe Trump administration, frustrated with how Congress held up proposed arms sales for months, weighed scrubbing the decades-old practice of informally notifying Congress about arms sales, but it faced steep backlash over the idea from lawmakers.\n\nA bipartisan group of lawmakers is now looking to further extend congressional oversight over US arms sales to foreign countries.\n\nSenator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, Mike Lee, a Republican, and Bernie Sanders, an Independent, introduced legislation earlier this month aimed at reasserting Congress\u2019s role in foreign policy.\n\nThe bill included a provision that would require Congress to actively approve all major sales rather than allow arms sales to be automatically approved unless Congress blocked them.\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja with agency reports",
