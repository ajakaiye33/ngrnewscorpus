Many were quite innovative, as it was a very difficult process coming to the last six and even in the last six, there was very little between them in the judging selection that took place as you see, but I am pleased to say that in the winners, we have some kind of innovative propositions from some young enterprising people, who, with the right support, I believe, can address some of the issues that we have.\u201d\n\nSpokesman of the company, Charles Ofoefula, explained that the competition was \u201copened for individuals and teams creating innovative solutions in virtual reality, artificial intelligence, business intelligence and reporting, digital transformation, disaster and emergency management, education and learning, fintech, and healthcare.\u201d\n\nAbove all, he disclosed that Dovilearn, an online learning and training provider; Regxta, a financial inclusion service provider; and Gbale, a property management platform, emerged the winners of Oasis Innovation Challenge.\n\nThe top three winners went home with N1million, N500,000 and N250,000 respectively.\n\nIn his remarks, an innovation expert and investor, Chris Osondu, said: \u201cThe OIC has presented investors with a rich set of new investment opportunities in virtual reality, digital transformation and fintech.

          "text": "The Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has vowed to go ahead with the March 26 National Convention.\n\nIt insisted it had notified the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of its intention hold the exercise.\n\nThe party said there was no need for a fresh 21-day notice as demanded by INEC for the exercise in a letter.\n\nThe spokesperson for the CECPC and APC National Youth Leader, Barr. Ismail Ahmed, stated these on Friday in Abuja.\n\nHe dismissed the INEC letter insisting on a fresh 21-day notice for the National Convention to follow due process.\n\nAhmed argued that having intimated INEC of its intent to conduct its national convention on February 26, which was moved to March 26, what is required is simply a notice of adjustment and not a fresh 21-day notice.\n\n\u201cConvention will hold on the 26th of March. I am not only a youth leader or internal spokesperson, I am also a lawyer. And we have served a notice to INEC for the 26th of February earlier.\n\n\u201d We served that notice on the 5th of February and that was the required 21 days. If you are going to make any adjustment to that date all you need is a letter, making an adjustment to the date.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need another 21 days and that letter was since written about two weeks ago when we realised that we couldn\u2019t hold it on the 26th of February.\n\n\u201cThe moment, the CECPC agreed on the 26th of March, that letter was written to INEC, INEC has accepted that letter. So that is long gone is not an issue.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Matawalle cautions APC governors over party crisis\n\nHe added: \u201cThe issue of the date of convention is not in question, not in INEC, not certainly with us. That is settled.\n\n\u201cIt is sacrosanct that 26th of March and we have comply with all the rules and we have notified INEC as appropriately expected for us to do that. So that\u2019s no longer an issue.\u201d\n\nOn the status of the embattled chairman of the CECPC, Ahmed maintained Governor Mai Mala Buni remains the chairman of the party.\n\nHe explained that Gov. Abubakar Sani Bello has been functioning in acting capacity whenever the chairman was not available.\n\nAccording to the CECPC spokesman: \u201cSince the inception of this CECPC on June, 25 2020 whenever the chairman is not around and Governor Sani Bello is around, he acts on behalf as the acting Chairman. It has always been the case that has never changed. It has always been the case.\n\n\u201cAnd now we have a convention on the 26th of March, the chairman wrote a letter and transmitting his power to go for medical treatment. These are two emergencies.\n\n\u201cHe has a medical emergency that cannot wait for convention. We have a convention that cannot wait for him to be healthy. So one has to leave for other.\n\n\u201cThe chairman left, transmitted a letter, Governor Sani Bello has been acting appropriately. What is the problem? Why is it? Why is it difficult for people to simply understand that?\u201d he queried.\n\nHe said: \u201cI just simply don\u2019t understand why people are making this an issue.

I don\u2019t know why this is a complicated process for a lot of people not to understand.

It has always been the case. Now, we have a convention on March 26. The chairman wrote a letter and transmitted power to Governor Bello to enable him go for medical treatment. Those are two emergencies. He has a medical emergency, that cannot wait for Convention. We have a convention that cannot wait for him to be healthy.\n\n\u201cSo, one has to leave for the other, whichever, he has transmitted a letter and Governor Sani Bello has been acting appropriately.

          "text": "By Sunday Ani\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo has again reiterated that it would gladden his heart to see a Southeasterner emerge as president of Nigeria after President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.\n\nObasanjo who has maintained that the time has come to bring total reconciliation to Nigeria by supporting a president of Southeast extraction to emerge in 2023, repeated the sermon yesterday when the founder of New Nigeria Group (NNG) and presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa, paid him a visit in his Abeokuta, Ogun State country home.\n\nThe former president said he also believes that there are a lot of things that Southeasterners can bring on the table. \u201cBeyond bringing unity to Nigeria or being the cement that holds the country together, I believe that Southeasterners can model hard work and entrepreneurship. That will help in wealth creation and fight against poverty, which is ravaging Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nHe told Ohuabunwa that running for the office of the president of Nigeria was a tough job but expressed happiness that he (Ohuabunwa) has endured up till date and said he was looking forward to the final realisation of his vision to see Nigeria fully united and restored to a country that all Nigerians would be proud to call theirs.\n\nFielding questions from journalists after the meeting, Ohuabunwa encouraged the people of the south, particularly the southeasterners to aspire to the office of the president because that is what has been done in the past to maintain the unity of the country. \u201cWe had southern and northern protectorates, which came together to form Nigeria and since then, our founding fathers had always wanted to maintain peace by ensuring that there is rotation and that we share things. That is why the federal character principle is in the country\u2019s constitution. We are a nation of diverse ethnicities and geographies, and the only way we can maintain proper peace is to ensure that everybody is treated fairly, and rotation and power sharing are some of the methods of ensuring inclusiveness and making sure that Nigerians feel that they are part of it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that Southeasterners had made great contributions to Nigeria, starting from the days of Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, and reminding them that they are not strangers neither are they just appendages. \u201cWhen it comes to political rights, we need to assert our rights and provide that leadership that Nigeria is lacking, and I hope that in 2023, God will offer us that opportunity and Nigerians will come behind us to take Nigeria to become the first world nation,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said his ambition is to make Nigeria a first world nation; a globally competitive nation and a nation that works like the other countries, which Nigerians admire. \u201cMost importantly, I want a nation that works for all and creates job for the young people of Nigeria to exercise their creativity and innovation; not a nation of poor, corrupt, jobless people or that of terrorists and bandits. That does not describe us; we are going to change the narrative,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that Obasanjo as a president, showed the highest level of not only detribalization but also fairness and equity as he didn\u2019t discriminate. \u201cHe believes in equity but also in merit because he took good people; I mean people like Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, the Chukwuma Soludo and the rest of them worked for him and that is what he represents. He wants Nigeria to work,\u201d he added.\n\nHe described the former president as a phenomenon and conscience of the country. \u201cHe is the conscience of this nation and we must admit it. He speaks his mind. He is not an angel and he can\u2019t be perfect, but I have never seen a man as bold, audacious, and also, with a heart of humanity as Obasanjo.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nGovernor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State said the All Progressives Congress (APC) has been rescued from the vice grip of \u2018Yahoo Yahoo\u2019 governors following the removal of Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State as chairman of the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\nHe alleged that some \u201cYahoo Yahoo governors\u201d had backed Buni to circumvent the will of party members but noted that \u201ctrue\u201d APC governors were determined to see the party \u201cthrough these patchy parts at all cost.\u201d\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly.

However, the Yobe governor was sacked as national caretaker committee of the APC over alleged plot to scuttle the party\u2019s convention fixed for March 26 and replaced with Niger Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello.\n\nIn a statement, yesterday, Akeredolu said the setting up of the CECPC was a necessity and meant to instill discipline in leadership but that the path taken lately by Governor Buni and an indivisible few was an \u2018unenviable trajectory\u2019 undeserving the party and a disdainful narrative.\n\nHe said the party survived a civilian coup largely inspired by mischief and incurable lust for power through artificial barricades but President Muhammadu Buhari salvaged the party from internal scavengers.\n\n\u201cThe installation of the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the APC was beyond a call to service.

          "text": "\n\n*Low crude production volume, oil theft also major factors *Minister of Finance laments widening budget deficit, says subsidy a huge problem *Experts: Petrol subsidy unsustainable, road to bankruptcy, identify local refining as ultimate solution *NLC: Over 74% of petrol subsidy comprises insurance, freight charges, levies\n\n*Jet fuel hits N670 per litre as NNPC promises to intervene *We may shutdown aviation sector soon, NCAA warns\n\nEmmanuel Addeh, Udora Orizu in Abuja; Chinedu Eze, Nume Ekeghe and Dike Onwuamaeze in Lagos\n\nAs oil prices soar to record levels, many Nigerians, ordinarily, would expect that their country would be raking in billions of dollars and realising accretion in external reserves, as was the case in the past, especially during the Gulf War and some other international emergencies. Unfortunately, this is not the case.\n\n\n\nCrude oil price hit $139 per barrel on Monday, but Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, said recently that the country would be comfortable with the price range of between $70 and $80 per barrel.\n\nAnalysts say the reason for this odd wish is the country\u2019s huge fuel subsidy payment and its complete dependence on imported petrol to meet domestic consumption.\n\n\n\nIn addition, there is the problem of waning investment in the oil sector as well as massive oil theft that has gone unabated in the last few years and drastically reduced Nigeria\u2019s crude oil export, leading to inability to meet the country\u2019s OPEC quota. These factors have combined to ensure that the country does not benefit from the current soaring crude oil prices, buoyed by the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n\n\nFor instance, in terms of rig growth, Nigeria\u2019s count had fallen from 11 in September to nine in October 2021, according to data released by OPEC. This got worse after Nigeria began shutting down many of its offshore platforms as oil prices took a downward slope and the producers\u2019 group embarked on production curbs to stabilise the market.\n\n\n\nHistoric rig count figures earlier obtained by THISDAY showed that in May 2020, the country\u2019s producing oil rigs fell from 16 to eight and two months later, in July, it fell further to six.\n\nIn January 2021, only six rigs produced while in February, it was seven; in March, it fell to six again, while in April 2021, total rig count was just five.\n\n\n\nIn the oil industry, the rig count is a major index for measuring activities in the upstream sector.\n\nRecently, a THISDAY review showed that Nigeria was producing far less oil than it did 25 years ago when the estimated population was lesser than what it is today and government spending was far below what it is in 2022.\n\nA comparison of the country\u2019s average oil production per day in 1997, as indicated in the NNPC yearly statistical bulletin, showed that while Nigeria pumped 2.344 million barrels per day, plus condensates, over two and a half decades ago, it can hardly produce 1.4 million as of this year.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, while 26 rigs were in operation, on both onshore and offshore terrains, in 1997, Nigeria as at January this year had just about 12 active oilrigs, with about half of them not in use.\n\n\n\nTo underscore the gravity of the problem, just yesterday, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, lamented that the rise in crude oil price had further widened the country\u2019s budget deficit.\n\nBrent crude price stood at $112.43 a barrel yesterday, while the US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 63 cents to $109.33 a barrel.\n\n\n\nConcerned by the scarcity and high cost of aviation fuel, which has exacerbated flight delays and cancellations in the aviation sector, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mr Mele Kyari, yesterday assured Nigerians that the company would work with relevant authorities to ensure that the current crisis in the aviation sector was resolved. Aviation fuel, which presently sells for N670 per litre, far higher than the N190 per litre sold about a month ago, is also imported 100 per cent.\n\n\n\nHowever, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) yesterday faulted the claim by the federal government that it would spend N3 trillion on petrol subsidy this year. NLC described the claim as bogus, unreal, insisting that the real government subsidy component in petrol consumed in Nigeria was N19 per litre.\n\n\n\nBut President Muhammadu Buhari recently requested the National Assembly to approve a total of N2.557 trillion for the federal government to fund fuel subsidy in 2022 after the current administration suspended its plan to remove the monthly under-recovery. This may be exceeded with the skyrocketing international crude prices.\n\n\n\nThe lack of funding for major upstream infrastructure has ensured incessant breakdown of existing assets. This has led to the highest single-month crude oil loss in a long time, as a result of disruptions due to maintenance and declaration of force majeure at the Forcados terminal and others in January.\n\n\n\nCountry Director of World Bank, Shubham Chaudhuri, recently said Nigeria\u2019s decision to postpone the full deregulation of the downstream sector of the petroleum industry by 18 months might cost the country over N4 trillion in subsidy payments on petrol in 2022. Chaudhuri argued that for a purely economic phenomenon, Nigeria was not meant to make a political decision, adding that the decision to defer the subsidy removal will cost the country in fiscal terms.\n\n\n\nIt is estimated that with the current surging price of crude oil, Nigeria could be paying as high as N300 as subsidy per litre of petrol supplied at the pumps.\n\n\n\nNNPC Limited recently disclosed that it spent N173.488 billion in excess of the budgeted N36.893 billion on petrol subsidy in January.\n\n\n\nA document detailing the company\u2019s presentation before the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) showed that instead of the projected under-recovery for the month, NNPC paid N210.382 billion for the purpose. During the month, NNPC had also failed to make any contribution to the Federation Account, although its forecast payment for January topped N122.7 billion.\n\n\n\nTo underscore the severity of the problem, in 2021, NNPC recorded a whopping deficit of approximately N2 trillion out of its projected N2.511 trillion remittances and was unable to pay roughly 80 per cent of its contribution to the Federation Account for the year.\n\nRising Crude Oil Price Has Widened Budget Deficit, Ahmed Laments\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, stressed that rising crude oil prices had widened the country\u2019s budget deficit. Ahmed pointed out that the federal government was presently in the process of amending the budget to accommodate fuel subsidy.\n\n\n\nThe minister spoke yesterday at the 10th African Fiscal Forum titled, \u201cThe Political Economy of Fiscal Reforms,\u201d organised virtually by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\n\n\nShe said, \u201cWe are cleaning up our subsidies; we had a setback as we were to remove subsidy by July this year, but there was a lot of pushbacks. We have elections coming and also because of the hardship that companies and citizens faced due to the COVID and we were told that the timing was not right, so we pulled back.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut we have been able to quietly implement subsidy in the electricity sector and as it is, as we speak, we don\u2019t have subsidies in the electricity sector.\n\n\n\n\u201cFuel subsidy is a huge problem for us. It has thrown up our deficit much higher than we planned. What is happening to the global oil prices is also going to, perhaps, worsen matters. But the current review we are doing is to say we will hold the subsidy at the level in which it is planned.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking on how much global prices would affect subsidy payment, Ahmed said, \u201cWe are currently doing a budgetary amendment to accommodate the incremental subsidy as a result of the reversed decision and we want to cap it at that.\n\n\n\n\u201cHopefully, the parliament will agree with us and also at least contain the subsidies; otherwise, the way things are going now, we will not be able to predict where the deficit will be as a result of the fluctuation in the global markets.\u201d\n\n\n\nCommenting on increased revenue generation recorded by the country, she explained, \u201cWe have also enhanced our budget process. Three years ago, we had no government enterprise on the national budget, just the government itself. We started with 10, three years ago.\n\n\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, we brought in 40 and now we have all the government-owned enterprises, which is about 61 agencies, in the national budget. So, we are able to see the whole of the revenue and the whole of the expenditure.\n\n\u201cThis is enhanced also by automation in terms of the public financial management. As a result of that, we have been able to see the need to refine our fiscal laws.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have seen revenue from government-owned enterprises increase by 100 per cent within a 12-month period just by being able to pull everything together, put monitoring mechanisms, and being able to track and also put regulations and laws in the finance bill that caps the expenditure to revenue ratio of these government enterprises to 50 per cent. \u201cSo, we saw our revenue double and we are seeing the potential revenue from these enterprises again doubling in this current year as we speak.\u201d\n\nNLC: Over 74% of Petrol Subsidy Comprises Insurance, Freight Charges, Levies\n\nNLC faulted a claim by the federal government that it would spend N3 trillion on petrol subsidy, describing it as bogus and unreal. The congress insisted that the real government subsidy component in petrol consumed in Nigeria was N19 per litre.\n\n\n\nIt alleged that over 74 per cent of what the federal government purported as subsidy comprised of insurance, freight charges, and levies imposed by government agencies, such as the Nigerian Port Authority (NPA), the Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), and the defunct Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR).\n\n\n\nPresident of NLC, Mr. Ayuba Wabba, said these during the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) webinar on \u201cImpact Assessment of the 2021 Finance Act.\u201d\n\n\n\nWabba, who was represented by the Head, Research Department, NLC, Dr. Onoho\u2019Omhen Ebhohimhen, stated that NLC was not averse to privatisation of the country\u2019s moribund refineries as long as it would follow the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) model.\n\n\n\nThe NLC president said, \u201cFor the purpose of clarity, what our government propagates as fuel subsidy does not fit into the logic, theory or the practice of subsidy. Subsidy, in macroeconomic theory, is provided to companies to help reduce production cost so that products can be passed on at lower cost in order to encourage consumption.\n\n\u201cWhat obtains in Nigeria about PMS are oligopolistic practices by agencies of the government of our country.\u201d\n\nNLC disclosed that Nigeria imported petrol largely from North West Europe.\n\n\n\nIt identified other components of the petrol price as insurance on vessels that bring in the product and insurance on the goods in transit, as well as the freight charges.\n\n\n\nWabba stated, \u201cThese three items I have mentioned are about 74 per cent of the petrol prices in our country. This is from government data that it spent 74 per cent on cost, insurance and freight of imported PMS.\n\n\u201cWhen the oil tanker comes into Nigeria it does not dock in our ports. It stays in the high sea while smaller vessels, called barges, are hired to offload the products from the ship to the storage facilities.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe pay the tank farm owners for the storage. We pay the NPA, NIMASA, and DPR for market regulation. We pay NNPC for the cost of finance on the basis of opportunity cost model.\n\n\u201cAll these are costs that are passed over to the consumers. But if you consider all these charges, you can then ask: where is the subsidy?\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat government calls subsidy is the landing cost of PMS, which comprised insurance, freight and local levies, taxes and its administrative charges. That is what they talk about as subsidy.\n\n\u201cIf they are the subsidy, it means that the Nigerian government and Nigerian people are subsidising foreign countries and foreign businesses. That is not subsidy.\u201d\n\n\n\nNLC said the real subsidy component was about N19 a litre of petrol, made up of the bridging cost, retailers margin, and transport cost to different parts of the country.\n\n\n\nThe labour union leader said, \u201cWe pay transporters, we pay retailers margin, and we pay bridging cost. This may be considered as subsidies. But why are they there? We must understand their implications before we remove them. One fundamental implication is that the cost of production will go up.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you remove these subsidy elements, a manufacturer in Kano will not be able to compete with the one in Lagos. It will compound the uneven industrialisation we have in our country. If that is what the government wants to do, they should be honest and come forward to say so.\u201d\n\n\n\nWabba believed the best solution to the fuel crisis is local refining of the product.\n\n\u201cLet us refine our products locally,\u201d he stated, adding, \u201cWarri and Kaduna refineries were established as refinery and petrochemical companies. But the petrochemical segment is dead because we are exporting our crude oil.\n\n\u201cNigeria has experience in the construction and management of refineries. Buhari signed two agreements in 1977 to construct the Warri and Kaduna refineries. Warri was delivered in the middle of 1979. So, nobody can tell us that it is impossible to build refinery in two years. We have done it before. So, what has changed? Is it our capacity or vision that is lower now? Or has our government become different now?\n\n\n\n\u201cWe as a labour congress are agreeable and committed to the privatisation of government\u2019s refineries. But we give only one condition: let us prioritise based on a model that has worked for our country.\n\n\n\n\u201cLate Ernest Shonekan sorted the problem with NLNG within three months that his administration lasted in 1993. He ceded Nigeria\u2019s interest in the NLNG to the private sector that have 51 per cent. Since then the NLNG has functioned well.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have said let us try that model in the refineries, but government drags its feet. Government is unwilling to do that.\u201d\n\nPetrol Subsidy Unsustainable, Road to Bankruptcy, Experts Insist\n\nEconomic experts and opinion leaders in the private sector said the current reliance on importation of refined petroleum products and subsidy on the pump price of petrol (PMS) had become clearly unsustainable and could plunge the country into bankruptcy.\n\nThey pointed out that Nigeria could only sustain the current subsidised consumption of petrol at a high cost of public borrowing.\n\n\n\nThey advised the government to accelerate domestic production of crude oil to enable the country satisfy its OPEC quota and earn more foreign currency to build its foreign reserves.\n\nEconomist and Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), Dr. Muda Yusuf, told THISDAY yesterday that subsidy was clearly no longer sustainable with the current development in the crude oil market, unless the intention was to plunge the nation into bankruptcy.\n\n\n\nYusuf projected that the subsidy budget might climb up to N5 trillion, while the expected revenue of the federal government is about N10 trillion, out of which N4 trillion would be devoted to debt servicing.\n\nYusuf said, \u201cWe are faced with a situation where the combination of debt service and subsidy payments would consume the entire revenue. Yet we have to fund personnel cost, overhead expenditure and capital projects. Where will the money come from?\n\n\n\n\u201cAre we going to depend on borrowing to fund these major line items? Are we going to continue to print money to fill these financing gaps, with the profound inflationary effects?\n\n\u201cWe have some difficult choices to make if we must save the country from bankruptcy. And we need to do so very quickly.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to quickly revisit the conversation on the liberalisation of the downstream oil sector. We need to urgently create a private sector window for the supply of petroleum products. Clearly, NNPC cannot do this alone.\u201d\n\nFormer Professor of Economics, University of Benin, and Chairman, Goldmark Education Academy, Professor Mike Idi Obadan, told THISDAY yesterday that the issue of sustainability of subsidy on refined imported petroleum products would continue to elicit more concerns under this circumstance as oil prices rise.\n\n\n\nObadan, who is also a non-executive director of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and a member of the Monetary Policy Committee said, \u201cSubsidy payment may become unsustainable, except it has to be financed with more borrowing, which in itself the country should be wary of. The opportunity cost of increased subsidy payments is on the high side. However, if the government is able to do the needful to step up crude oil export, it will minimise the negative impact on the economy of increased subsidy payment implied by rising crude oil prices\n\n\u201cIf Nigeria were to be able to raise oil production and export to take advantage of the rising crude oil prices, the undesired impact of the subsidy payments would have been mitigated. But this tends not to be so.\n\n\n\n\u201cFinally, there is need to fast-track the repairs of the public refineries to provide a basis for deregulation of fuel prices and, hence, elimination of subsidies.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn this same direction, whatever support that could be given by the government to the Dangote refinery to fast-track its debut in the refined petroleum products market should be considered. All these actions will result in the early stoppage of fuel subsidy payments while the earmarked resources are freed for commitment to other sectors of the economy.\u201d\n\n\n\nProfessor of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Uyo, Professor Akpan Ekpo, said the issue of sustainability of oil subsidy was a problem created by the government. Ekpo told THISDAY yesterday that the removal of fuel subsidies could only be initiated properly and effectively after the domestic refineries were made to work. He said it did not make economic sense for a country to export crude petroleum and import refined products.\n\n\n\nEkpo said, \u201cWhy are the refineries not working? First things first, get the refineries working so that Nigerians can be sure of refined products. Thereafter revisit the subsidy issue cautiously.\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce the domestic supply is guaranteed, then subsidy can be phased out while providing succour to the poor through a kind of targeted subsidy. But let us not forget that most of what we call subsidy is corruption.\u201d\n\nHe noted that there would be structural inflation once the subsidy was removed, and more untold hardship for Nigerians.\n\n\n\nPresident of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Michael Olawale-Cole, who spoke to THISDAY, recently, stressed the need for the government to get the refineries working again.\n\n\n\nOlawale-Cole said, \u201cThe answer to all these problems is to ensure that we are adding value to our crude oil here and stop depending on imported refined products. That is the solution and it can be met by government showing commitment to ensure that our existing refineries are maintained and made to work.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is agonising that we are producing crude and exporting them abroad for refining and later import them at prices that we cannot afford. Naturally, this is going to affect inflation and add to the suffering of the people.\u201d\n\nThe Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) said the organisation supported subsidy removal. But he said certain measures must be put in place before it could be implemented.\n\n\n\nPublic Relations Officer of IPMAN, Chief Chinedu Ukadike, stated that for the sector to work optimally, it should be deregulated. However, Ukadike stressed that in-country refining must be achieved while pipelines should be fixed.\n\nHe stated that the current practice of going cap in hand when there was need to allow the forces of demand and supply take effect was not helping the sector.\n\n\n\nUkadike stated, \u201cAs it is now, we are not making any margin because it is regulated. Even when it is expensive, our margin remains N9.70. It has not moved. We do not want a regulated system.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut local refineries, pipelines must be put to work. Government should encourage the establishment of modular refineries. We should be able to purchase products directly from our refineries.\n\n\u201cIf the pipelines are good, you won\u2019t see many trucks on the road, bridging gap will not be there. If the trains work, pipelines work, these issues may reduce.\u201d\n\n\n\nNational President, Nigerian Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO), Mr. Yusuf Othman, stressed that in a deregulated downstream sector, stakeholders would not need government consent before taking economic decisions.\n\n\n\nOthman explained that when the forces of demand and supply were allowed to take firm root, the sector would flourish, because freight rate, for instance, will ordinarily increase with cost of transport across the country. \u201cSo I can tell you that we will do better under a deregulated system,\u201d he said.\n\nNNPC Promises End to Aviation Fuel Crisis, Says Price Reduction to N200 Per Litre Not Feasible\n\nGroup Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mr. Mele Kyari, yesterday assured Nigerians that the company would work with relevant authorities to ensure that the present crisis in the aviation sector was resolved.\n\n\n\nThat was as Director General of Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Musa Shuaibu Nuhu, warned that the aviation industry might soon be shutdown, saying with the current jet fuel scarcity, it is not safe to fly anymore.\n\nKyari gave the assurance while addressing the leadership of the House of Representatives, who were investigating the sudden scarcity and high cost of aviation fuel.\n\n\n\nAt the meeting well attended by members of the House Committees on Petroleum Downstream and Upstream, Jet A1 marketers, and airline operators, the NNPC GMD regretted the late intervention, saying all the supply data showed there was sufficient Aviation Turbine Kerosene (ATK) in the country.\n\nGiven the current situation, Kyari advised airline operators to have the right commercial arrangement with their support petroleum products, particularly ATK.\n\n\n\nKyari said, \u201cWhy we didn\u2019t act was that all the supply data we have showed sufficient ATK in the country. This means that it may be in the wrong hands. There\u2019s frenzy in the market today, no one knows what the price will be tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s still not an excuse for escalation of prices, we will work with the relevant authority to ensure that if there\u2019s any such thing, we will deal with it jointly as an industry. We will work together to ensure that this is resolved.\u201d\n\nAddressing the demand by airline operators and lawmakers that the fuel price should be reduced to at least N200 per litre, Kyari said it was not feasible, as they had no control over it. He said the price was determined internationally price.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible; today the landing cost of ATK is N480, the price, we have no control on that.\u201d\n\nResponding to concerns raised by the lawmakers regarding the crisis in the energy sector, despite the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the NNPC GMD said PIA passage was not a mistake. He said the company would work with other stakeholders to ensure gaps in the sector are closed.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhenever there\u2019s supply gap it is our role to ensure that supply gap is closed, we will work with the authority and other stakeholders to ensure that if there\u2019s any gap that\u2019s existing we fill it,\u201d Kyari added\n\nIn his presentation, Director General, Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Musa Shuaibu Nuhu, warned that they might shutdown aviation industry soon as it\u2019s not safe to fly anymore.\n\n\n\nNuhu said, \u201cOver the last couple of weeks we have seen a significant rise in the cost of aviation fuel. One year ago it was selling at N190 per litre and as of this afternoon it has gone for N670 per litre, what this has done is that it has increased the cost of operations.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a significant safety concern to us, if airlines cannot have enough financial margin to comply with all the mandatory requirement then we really have to look at, God forbid I don\u2019t want to come before this committee to explain why something happened.\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery day it increases. I won\u2019t be surprised tomorrow if it sells for N700 per litre. Considering the ticket price now, the airline industry cannot survive. The option is we shutdown, because they cannot generate enough revenues to operate safely.\u201d\n\n\n\nEarlier, Chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyema, who spoke on behalf of the airline operators appealed to NNPC to ensure that in the coming days, the price of aviation fuel dropped to N200 per litre.\n\nOnyema said, \u201cThat\u2019s the only time we will be able to operate safely and ensure some running of the schedule operations in this country. I don\u2019t know how they will do it but they should, it will be good because even at N200 it\u2019s a lot for the airlines. Not N400 or any other higher price, as we are talking now it will soon hit N700 and possibly N1000.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened in the last two weeks is alarming. From a price of N190 per litre two weeks ago, the price is now N670 as at today and we don\u2019t know what it is going to happen.\n\n\u201cThe government has done so much for us in this industry with the president granting us waivers. We held a meeting and decided to shut down our operations because of the cost of operation. We are owing so much money and we don\u2019t want AMCON to come after us.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnyema added, \u201cWe cannot survive like this for another three days. We had to reduce our operations to 30 per cent because the product is not even available. So, I am surprised that the Executive Director said they have supplies to last 34 days. We are making so much sacrifice here.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am evacuating Nigerians from Poland and I had to pay three times the usual amount and I am not asking for a refund. So, something needs to be done and done fast.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn his part, Executive Director, Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), Ogbugo Ukoha, noted the role of the agency in regulating the industry, and issuing licenses to importers of the product. Ukoha said from his records, there was enough aviation fuel to last the country for 34 days. He also said that aviation fuel was one of the petroleum products that had been fully deregulated and was, therefore, controlled by market forces, adding that the authority has issued licenses to about 28 companies to import the product into the country.\n\n\n\nBut his explanation did not go down well with Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase, and other lawmakers.\n\nWase questioned why there should be scarcity of the product if there was enough supply to last for 34 days, alleging that there must be a cartel working hard to sabotage the efforts of the government.\n\n\n\nFormer CEO of Aero Contractors, Captain Ado Sanusi, told THISDAY on Wednesday that due to the scarcity and high cost of aviation fuel, fuel marketers now gave airlines new conditions for selling the product.\n\nThe marketers insisted that airlines must pay before the product was supplied to them, an aberration in an industry globally known for payment after purchase of the product.\n\n\n\nSanusi said, \u201cYou pay for fuel in advance, which is not done in the aviation industry. It will make operations very difficult and lead to more delays and cancellations. You cannot deposit money before you buy fuel.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf nothing is done urgently, this may lead to the beginning of airlines going down because they cannot continue operating like this. The federal government should urgently look for solution to the problem.\u201d\n\nSanusi said government must intervene by doing away with the middlemen, but allowing marketers to import the product and sell directly to the airlines.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cThese middle men don\u2019t understand aviation. The marketers are part of the industry whose operations are approved by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). Ideally, the airlines can buy from the marketers who will issue them invoice and they pay in 24 to 48 hours.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the way it is done. You cannot even deposit money with the marketers because if you do, they may not even have the product at the time you want it because of uncertainty and volatility in the supply of the product. If care is not taken, Nigerian airlines may go down.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHISDAY also spoke with Managing Director of Clean Serve Energy Limited, Chris Ndulue, who explained the challenge the aviation fuel marketers were facing.\n\n\n\nNdulue stated, \u201cThere are three basic things: the cost of crude oil in the international market and the price of the dollar. We have failed to refine fuel locally, so we have to import. The price of crude oil has been rising and the price of dollar has been rising. Supply of the product has been facing disruptions because there is war in Europe. There is scarcity because people have not been producing, so price is rising. We need to start producing refined product here.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe price of diesel has risen, that it is over N600. We need to refine crude oil here so that we end these disruptions and high prices,\u201d Ndulue said.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY findings show that airlines spend huge operating fund on purchase of aviation fuel. A Boeing 737 Classic, for instance, consumes about 2, 300 -2, 500 litres of aviation fuel for one-hour flight. Airbus A320-200 consumes about 3, 125 litres of aviation fuel or 2,500kg per hour.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Explains why governors are against local government autonomy\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nGovernor of Ekiti State and Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), Dr. Kayode Fayemi yesterday defended governors\u2019 spending of security votes, saying the fund was being utilised to fund the police, military, civil defence and other security outfits in the country.\n\n\n\nFayemi also gave reasons why state governors were against local government autonomy.\n\nHe said these during a panel discussion on the overview of security situation across the states at a two-day multi-stakeholders meeting on Peace and Inclusive Security Initiative organised by the NGF in partnership with the Center for Democracy & Development (CDD).\n\n\n\nSpeaking on what state governors do with security votes, the chairman of the NGF said: \u201cThere is hardly any of these institutions we speak that you are talking about that we don\u2019t fund. We fund the police and we fund the police more than the federal government, quote me.\n\n\n\n\u201cState governors fund police more than the federal government. We buy them vehicles and we pay them allowances. In some cases, we even buy ammunitions, of course under the same federal system.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd if we are to engage our military in aid to civil authority, which you will find, actually in 36 states in this country today, the military is involved in internal security operations, which really is a problem. Now, when you inflate the role of the security institution beyond its primary responsibility, you also have consequences that will come with that. That may not be palatable. But that\u2019s where we are, because most Nigerians don\u2019t trust the police.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey will still come and beg governor, \u2018Governor, please, can you ask the brigade commander to put a roadblock in my area.\u2019 And this, right from the bottom up you are talking about, ordinary citizens insist that we should fund and you can\u2019t put military roadblocks everywhere,\u201d he explained to the cheering of the crowd.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Ekiti State governor pointed out that the National Police Council does not operate maximally as the National Judicial Council, explaining that so far, the Police Council only meet to approve the appointment of the Inspector General of Police, already appointed by the President.\n\n\n\nOn governors\u2019 funding of the military, he said: \u201cBut if you engage the military in a civil authority, your state is only responsible if you are to pay for the number of men engaged.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve taken them out of their primary responsibility, you have to pay for it. So, we pay for that, we pay for civil defense, there is no security institution that you have that states are not responsible for more than the federal government that has primary responsibility for them.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the imperatives of state police, the Ekiti state governor said it was a constitutional issue.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis is a perennial excuse that we get. I\u2019m not going to sit here and make an excuse that such powers in the hands of some local actors may not be abused. The federal police that we all know abuses the rights of citizens, including the rights of governors, even with immunity, you may not know that. I was abused by a federal police in 2014, during my election and I had immunity.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnybody could be abused. It could happen, even if you devolve security to the local level. However, what we need to be talking about is what institutional frameworks should we put in place to ensure that such powers are not abused, not to use it as an excuse not to do the right thing. Because at the end of the day, there are mechanisms in our constitution to protect citizens\u2019 rights.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking further, Fayemi said: \u201cIn relation to the police, we have a body in the Constitution, a statutory body known as the National Police Council. The National Police Council is presided over by the president as chairman and he has over 36 governors as members. Unfortunately, unlike the National Judicial Council, that is very effective in meting out punishments, sanctions, promotions, appointments for judicial officers across the length and breadth of the country, the National Police Council has only succeeded since the 1999 constitution to ratify appointment of Inspector General of Police.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are only summoned to National Police Council and this is a constitutional body by the way, check your constitution you find it there. It only meets when a new or acting Inspector General of Police is to be confirmed and ratified.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat meeting is summoned and it meets for 10 or 30 minutes and then we look at the CV of the acting IG, and we approve. You\u2019re not expected to disapprove anyway; the president has already appointed him. But that body actually has powers beyond that,\u201d he explained. .\n\n\n\nThe Ekiti State Governor noted that in most countries where there are multi-level policing, there is a regulatory authority that is responsible for punishment and for sanctioning those who go beyond their own responsibilities.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what we should be talking about. Rather than talking about the possibility of abuse, there would always be possibility of abuse; we can\u2019t run away from that. But do we have effective policing now that is federal?\n\n\u201cI said multi-level policing; which means local police, state police and federal police and arguing for multi-level policing does not suggest that we want the federal police to go because there are federal crimes.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are also crimes that are within the borders of our states in accordance with the statute that\u2019s been promulgated or enacted by our local state assemblies. And there are also crimes that are local, because they are local jurisdictions by local governments.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you have not paid tenement rate, the local police should deal with you, it shouldn\u2019t be state police, because tenement rate is the responsibility of the local authority, not the responsibility of the state. So that\u2019s my take on that,\u201d the governor explained.\n\n\n\nFayemi said he has no objection to local authority playing a role in local security.\n\n\u201cBut the debate about local government autonomy is a totally different debate. The principle of federalism is very clear about federating unit. Local government as a federating unit is a unique innovation in Nigeria. I don\u2019t see it in any research work, in any book on federalism. Local government autonomy is the business of the state, because the state is the federating unit.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, those who are clamoring for local government autonomy, it is a populist demand and is very exciting to talk about it.

          "text": "\n\n*Worried about state of APC, Bello, Malami, others meet president in London this weekend *Akeredolu: No black market court order can stop party convention *Dismisses Buni\u2019s action as disdainful, embarrassing *Memo reveals Yobe gov handed over to Bello before traveling\n\nEmmanuel Addeh, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Fidelis David in Akure\n\nFormer Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to allow him continue as the chairman of the committee until after the national convention of the party which holds in the next two weeks, THISDAY gathered yesterday.\n\n\n\nEssentially, it was learnt that Buni has reached out to Buhari to forgive him of any perceived wrongdoing and allow him to return and conclude the convention in order to forestall any form of legal interpretation of his dramatic removal.\n\n\n\nIn addition, some of the Yobe State governor\u2019s supporters who are mainly first term governors have also pleaded with Buhari to allow the CECPC chairman to finish his assignment, hand over to the new executive that would be constituted at the national convention and go away. They reason that allowing Buni to conduct the convention which is just two weeks away rather than create unnecessary problems and all sorts of legal complications.\n\nAccording to his supporters, this option is far less complicated than if he doesn\u2019t resign and then resorting to legal challenge of his removal. It is however not certain how disposed the president is to Buni and his supporters\u2019 plea.\n\nHowever, apparently worried by some of the developments in the ruling APC, some governors and other stakeholders of the party, who are concerned about the state of the party, are jetting out to meet with Buhari in London this weekend, to clarify issues and put closure to the lingering leadership drama.\n\n\n\nThis is as the Ondo State Governor and Chairman of the South-west Governors\u2019 Forum, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), yesterday, vowed that no black market court order procured against the party\u2019s national convention would prevent the exercise from holding.\n\n\n\nAkeredolu, who did not hide his disdain for Buni\u2019s style of leadership of the CECPC, described his actions as both disdainful and embarrassing.\n\nBut while the fireworks appear not ceasing anytime soon, a leaked memo written by Buni, has revealed that he actually handed over the leadership of the party to the current acting chairman and Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Bello, before embarking on medical treatment.\n\n\n\nHowever, disturbed about how things have turned out in the party, especially the way the coup that ousted Buni was executed, some of the aggrieved governors, have established the need to see the president in person and address some of the grey areas.\n\n\n\nThis, a source among the governors claimed, had become imperative because everything that was done was achieved because they dropped the name of the president all the way, even when there was no communication to that effect to the best of their knowledge.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important we see the president to seek closure to this whole drama and we are seeing him this weekend. They made up too many stories just so their plan works, especially, a deliberate effort to demonise Buni, which is not true,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe source, who hinted that things would become clearer by Monday, explained that, \u201cSome people went to go and say certain things to the president, which made him angry and reacted immediately. The truth of the matter is that certain things the president said are not implementable.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut what really angered the president is the court thing, because they made him believe Buni knew about it, but that is not true. There is no record for the injunction and yet, no one is even taking ownership of the court injunction.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, the governors are going to see Buhari this weekend in London and that includes the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami; the acting chairman, Bello and some other stakeholders. The issues must be understood properly and a closure brought to be,\u201d the sources explained.\n\n\n\nBut Akeredolu, while singling out Buni and those he characterised as pocket-filling black legs in the corridors of power, for allegedly trying to supplant President Buhari\u2019s will, claimed that the APC did not deserve the kind of antics Yobe governor subjected it to.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, the insidious and appalling happenings within our party in the last few months, especially, under the immediate-past leadership clearly posit a huge embarrassment.\n\n\u201cWithout necessarily dwelling on details that are known to critical stakeholders, the path taken lately by Governor Mai Mala Buni, the immediate past head of the CECPC and an indivisible few, is an unenviable trajectory undeserving of our dear party. It is a disdainful narrative,\u201d Akeredolu said in a statement.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, he stated that the courage and determination as well as shrewd sincerity of purpose demonstrated by most of the APC governors remained a delight and should be commended.\n\nThe governor said the swift response and prompt action taken by the president had, in no small measures, salvaged the party from \u201cinternal scavengers\u201d.\n\n\n\nHe insisted that the APC indeed survived a civilian coup largely inspired by people he said were mischievous and had incurable lust for power through artificial barricades.\n\nThe Ondo governor explained that aside feeling very delighted as a major stakeholder in the latest \u201csuccessful rescue mission,\u201d his confidence in the ability and capacity of the new party chair, Bello, remained unflinching.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe, the governors are for the party, except for the few \u2018yahoo, yahoo\u2019 governors (apologies to Salihu, former DG of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum), who were hand in glove with Buni to circumvent the will of majority of our party (APC) members.\n\n\n\n\u201cProgressive governors in the true name, mostly all of us, are determined to see our party through these patchy parts at all cost. None of the scanty number has the guts to carry out their imaginary threats as reported in sponsored stories.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe dare them to leave the party. Their short-lived antics in arm-twisting Buni and probably, some pocket-filling elements within the corridors of power to supplant the president\u2019s will through fake letters, endorsements as well as \u2018black market\u2019 injunction (procured since November, 2021) are despicable,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHe recalled that the moments of the struggle as compatriots from all walks of life enunciated and had berthed Nigeria\u2019s most ingeniously successful political network, the APC, adding that without being immodest, APC\u2019s birth was a novel instance as the party\u2019s philosophical beacon woven around its ideological leaning was alluring.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the firm leadership, candour and honesty exemplified by Mr President, who heads the administration that is the product of the APC, deserve no less of support and complimentary responsibilities from all stakeholders,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the installation of CECPC of the APC was beyond a call to service, but was a child of necessity moulded to, one, instill discipline in leadership and engender coherence among stakeholders and more importantly, deepen the rule of law in the party.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow that the clear motive aimed at frustrating our national convention has been botched, our dear party is on the track to greatness. Governor Sanni Bello, carry on; you have the backing of the majority of us.\n\n\u201cYou shall see our full backing come Thursday, 17th March, 2022, at the National Executive Committee meeting. But as you know, this is only for the conduct of the national convention,\u201d Akeredolu concluded.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Buni had in the leaked letter to Bello, informed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) that he would be embarking on a medical trip to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and that he would assume his duty as the party chairman as soon as he returned from Dubai.\n\n\n\nThe letter read: \u201cThis is to please inform you that I will be embarking on a medical trip to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from today, 28th February, 2022. I will resume office upon my discharge from the hospital.\n\n\u201cIn my absence, I hereby transmit the functions of my office as the National Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to you.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is to enable the committee conclude all arrangements leading to the National Convention slated for March 26th, 2022 and other duties that may be required of the office.\n\n\u201cI invite all members to cooperate with Governor Abubakar Sani Bello, by extending to him all the support that I have enjoyed from you.

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria has stopped the payment of $418 million to Linas International Ltd, a company belonging to Prince Ned Nwoko, a former House of Representatives member and other consultants over the Paris Club refund.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how President Muhammadu Buhari re-approved the payment of the controversial millions of dollars in Paris Club refund to some creditors after being manipulated by the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami.\n\nNed Nwoko\n\nDocuments seen by SaharaReporters had shown that the Debt Management Office (DMO) on September 27, 2021, issued 10 promissory notes valued at $4,783,192.00 each to the creditors.\n\n\n\nThey were asked to submit the original promissory notes to the CBN for dematerialisation.\n\nOne of those who stand to gain if the money is paid is Nwoko. The businessman is laying claim to $142,028,941 via a consent judgment he obtained from the Federal High Court in Abuja in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/148/2017.\n\nA firm, Panic Alert Security System Limited, owned by George Uboh, is also laying claim to $47,831,920.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria by this Promissory Note, which is governed by the Laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, hereby unconditionally and irrevocable promises to pay to the order of: PANIC ALERT SECURITY SYSTEM LIMITED, the sum of four million, seven hundred and eighty-three thousand, one hundred and ninety-two dollars only on the 15th day of October 2022 (\u201cMaturity Date\u201d).\n\n\n\n\u201cThis Promissory Note is backed by the full faith and credit of the Federal Government of Nigeria and charged upon the general assets of Nigeria. The Promissory Note also qualifies as an Instrument for Tax Exemption in line with the Tax Waivers approved for Bonds and Short-Term Federal Government of Nigeria Securities.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis Promissory Note qualifies as a Liquid Asset for liquidity ratio calculation for banks. This Promissory Note is negotiable and transferable, subject to the submission of this original Note to the Central Bank of Nigeria. Holders are also required to submit this original Promissory Note to the Central Bank of Nigeria for dematerialization. In any case, this Promissory Note must be submitted to the Central Bank of Nigeria for payment at least two (2) working days before the Maturity Date,\u201d one of the documents read.\n\n\n\nHowever, the apex bank in a letter to some banks said the promissory notes \u201care not admissible or registrable on the scrip-less securities settlement system.\u201d\n\n\n\nA letter dated November 19, 2021, signed by CBN\u2019s Director of Banking Service, Josephine Ajala and addressed to one of the financial institutions, Keystone Bank, read, \u201cWe are in receipt of two letters dated November 17, 2021, from your office, requesting for dematerialization of various FGN promissory notes for Prince Orji Nwafor-Orizu totalling $1,219,440:00 and Barrister Olaitan Bello totalling $215,195:00.\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease be informed that we are unable to accede to your request because currently, Foreign Currency Denominated Promissory Notes are not admissible or registrable on the scrip-less securities settlement system (54) and as such, only Promissory Notes issued in Naira are registered and dematerialized on 54.\u201d\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nSaharaReporters had in a series of reports exposed wide-ranging legitimacy issues, including non-execution of agreed contracts and backdoor deals raised against the indebtedness from various quarters.\n\n\n\nOne of the beneficiaries is Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards, who was indicted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\n\n\nDocuments seen by SaharaReporters showed that Edwards did not represent the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) as claimed.\n\n\n\nA letter dated August 1, 2018, by former EFCC Chairman, Ibrahim Magu, to the Ministry of Justice/Attorney General Office, indicted him of an attempt to defraud the Nigerian government.\n\n\n\nIt said, \u201cThe suspects had filed applications in court to be joined as one of the judgement creditors during the garnishee proceedings and the applications were refused by the Federal High Court. The judge in a ruling delivered on the 27th of June 2016 frowned on Dr Ted Edward for brandishing a judgment purportedly delivered by the Federal Capital Territory on 30th October, 2015 and in fact, took a swipe at it.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy the Motion Ex parte filed on the 30th of March, 2015, the judgement creditors applied for a Garnishee Order Nisi which was granted on 1st April, 2015 and fixed the return date for 16th April for the Garnishee to show cause why the Order Nisi should not be made absolute.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Honorable Judge in his ruling stated unequivocally that let me state right away that the substantive matter was commenced by me until I entered judgement on the 3rd of December, 2013. I have searched my records up to the date I entered judgement. I could not find the name of Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards as representing the judgement creditors even for one day nor did I find any process filed by his law firm. How then was that judgement prosecuted?\n\n\n\n\u201cAnother point to highlight is the fact that according to the purported letter of engagement being bandied by Dr Ted Edwards, he was engaged on September 15, 2011, long before the matter was filed in court quoting the exact judgment sum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat this throws up is the fact that the said letter of engagement was done after 3rd December, 2013 and backdated to make it look as if the suspect had been engaged before the case started. There is no evidence to prove that the suspect did any work in relation to the recovery process.\n\n\n\n\u201cA careful look at the memorandum of settlement Dr Ted Iseghohi Edwards and Hon Odunayo Ategbero betrays the conspiracy and an attempt to defraud the Federal Government by the suspects.\n\n\n\n\u201cPending Actions; Invitation and/or Arrest of the suspect, Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards with a view of confronting him with all the issues raised in the evaluation above. Tracing and filing interim forfeiture order on any property or asset acquired with proceeds of fraud by Dr. Ted Iseghahi Edwards.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that despite the report, Malami persuaded Buhari to approve $159 million as legal fees to Edward.\n\n\n\nThey also directed the DMO and the Ministry of Finance to release the promissory notes to Edwards and others so that they could take their shares, a source had said.\n\n\n\n\u201cEdward was the Secretary-General of ALGON when the Paris Club refund case FHC/ABJ/CS/130/2013 was done by Joe Agi (SAN) and his colleagues before Justice Ademola. It is clear that he was not the lawyer to ALGON and this much ALGON has said in writing to Malami and the Chief of Staff, Gambari,\u201d the source had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe EFCC in its report to Malami and (Ibrahim) Gambari also established that Ted Edwards did not represent ALGON and that Ted Edward in his own handwriting admitted that Joe Agi was the lead counsel for ALGON. He went to one Judge, Baba Yusuf and procured a judgement that he was the lawyer to ALGON in the Paris Club refund case.\n\n\n\n\u201cYet, Malami who knows this is recommending that Ted Edwards be paid $159,000,000 as fees from ALGON instead of the actual lawyer. Will this not amount to double payment whenever Mr Joe Agi demands to be paid? From my investigation, Mr Joe Agi, ALGON and the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum have all gone back to court to challenge the payment of the $418 million including that of Edward through promissory notes.\n\n\n\n\u201cShould Malami not take a second look at the suit and see if really there is any fraud as being widely alleged? Instead, he and the Chief of Staff tricked the President and subsequently directed the Debt Management Office and the Finance Office to release the promissory notes to Edward and others so that they can take their shares.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe total sum of $418 million promissory note suggested by Malami to be paid is just a tip of the iceberg of what is coming unless he is stopped. Nigeria will become bankrupt before President Buhari leaves office. The anti-corruption war of Buhari has been effectively clipped by Malami and Gambari using their powerful offices to trick the President who really trusted them.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll (that is) needed to be done is to allow independent people to go through the whole cases concocted on the advice of Malami and the truth will be seen and Nigeria saved of all these massive stealing.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy is Malami not challenging any of these court judgements? If I may ask; in most of all these claims, the EFCC had investigated, taken statements and established that none of the contracts was executed. The report was submitted to Malami and former Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun by Magu-led EFCC suggested the arrest and interrogation of Ted Edward and one Prince Nicolas Ukachukwu but he and Gambari suppressed the report.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe same man suggested to be arrested is who Malami said should be given $159,000,000. ALGON had written several letters to him and (Kayode) Fayemi, who is the Chairman of Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum that all the jobs executed by Edwards and others were fake, not executed. Yet Malami in the face of this clear case of fraud tricked the President in a memo and said judgement was given against them.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe also negotiated the debt to 50 percent and convinced the President to pay to avoid more damages. It\u2019s high time President Buhari save his anti-corruption war by causing a thorough investigation of his appointees involved in this massive fraud.\u201d\n\n\n\nOthers who stand to benefit if the money is paid include Ned Nwoko, who is laying claim to $142,028,941 via a consent judgment he obtained from the Federal High Court in Abuja in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/148/2017.\n\n\n\nThree beneficiaries laying claim to $143,463,577.76 via a judgment of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court in the suit marked FCT/HC/CV/2129/2014 are: Riok Nigeria Ltd, Orji Nwafor Orizu, and Olaitan Bello.\n\n\n\nFrom the total money, Riok Nigeria Limited has a share of $142,028,941.95 (about 54 billion), Mr Nwafor is entitled to $1,219,440.45 and Mr Bello has a share of $215,159.36.\n\n\n\nA firm, Panic Alert Security System Limited, owned by George Uboh, is also laying claim to $47,831,920 based on another \u201cconsent judgment\u201d it obtained in suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/123/2018, which was filed as recently as 2018.",

In any case, this Promissory Note must be submitted to the Central Bank of Nigeria for payment at least two (2) working days before the Maturity Date,\u201d one of the documents read.\n\n\n\nHowever, the apex bank in a letter to some banks said the promissory notes \u201care not admissible or registrable on the scrip-less securities settlement system.\u201d\n\n\n\nA letter dated November 19, 2021, signed by CBN\u2019s Director of Banking Service, Josephine Ajala and addressed to one of the financial institutions, Keystone Bank, read, \u201cWe are in receipt of two letters dated November 17, 2021, from your office, requesting for dematerialization of various FGN promissory notes for Prince Orji Nwafor-Orizu totalling $1,219,440:00 and Barrister Olaitan Bello totalling $215,195:00.\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease be informed that we are unable to accede to your request because currently, Foreign Currency Denominated Promissory Notes are not admissible or registrable on the scrip-less securities settlement system (54) and as such, only Promissory Notes issued in Naira are registered and dematerialized on 54.\u201d\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nSaharaReporters had in a series of reports exposed wide-ranging legitimacy issues, including non-execution of agreed contracts and backdoor deals raised against the indebtedness from various quarters.\n\n\n\nOne of the beneficiaries is Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards, who was indicted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\n\n\nDocuments seen by SaharaReporters showed that Edwards did not represent the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) as claimed.\n\n\n\nA letter dated August 1, 2018, by former EFCC Chairman, Ibrahim Magu, to the Ministry of Justice/Attorney General Office, indicted him of an attempt to defraud the Nigerian government.\n\n\n\nIt said, \u201cThe suspects had filed applications in court to be joined as one of the judgement creditors during the garnishee proceedings and the applications were refused by the Federal High Court. The judge in a ruling delivered on the 27th of June 2016 frowned on Dr Ted Edward for brandishing a judgment purportedly delivered by the Federal Capital Territory on 30th October, 2015 and in fact, took a swipe at it.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy the Motion Ex parte filed on the 30th of March, 2015, the judgement creditors applied for a Garnishee Order Nisi which was granted on 1st April, 2015 and fixed the return date for 16th April for the Garnishee to show cause why the Order Nisi should not be made absolute.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Honorable Judge in his ruling stated unequivocally that let me state right away that the substantive matter was commenced by me until I entered judgement on the 3rd of December, 2013. I have searched my records up to the date I entered judgement. I could not find the name of Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards as representing the judgement creditors even for one day nor did I find any process filed by his law firm. How then was that judgement prosecuted?\n\n\n\n\u201cAnother point to highlight is the fact that according to the purported letter of engagement being bandied by Dr Ted Edwards, he was engaged on September 15, 2011, long before the matter was filed in court quoting the exact judgment sum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat this throws up is the fact that the said letter of engagement was done after 3rd December, 2013 and backdated to make it look as if the suspect had been engaged before the case started. There is no evidence to prove that the suspect did any work in relation to the recovery process.\n\n\n\n\u201cA careful look at the memorandum of settlement Dr Ted Iseghohi Edwards and Hon Odunayo Ategbero betrays the conspiracy and an attempt to defraud the Federal Government by the suspects.\n\n\n\n\u201cPending Actions; Invitation and/or Arrest of the suspect, Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards with a view of confronting him with all the issues raised in the evaluation above. Tracing and filing interim forfeiture order on any property or asset acquired with proceeds of fraud by Dr. Ted Iseghahi Edwards.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that despite the report, Malami persuaded Buhari to approve $159 million as legal fees to Edward.\n\n\n\nThey also directed the DMO and the Ministry of Finance to release the promissory notes to Edwards and others so that they could take their shares, a source had said.\n\n\n\n\u201cEdward was the Secretary-General of ALGON when the Paris Club refund case FHC/ABJ/CS/130/2013 was done by Joe Agi (SAN) and his colleagues before Justice Ademola. It is clear that he was not the lawyer to ALGON and this much ALGON has said in writing to Malami and the Chief of Staff, Gambari,\u201d the source had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe EFCC in its report to Malami and (Ibrahim) Gambari also established that Ted Edwards did not represent ALGON and that Ted Edward in his own handwriting admitted that Joe Agi was the lead counsel for ALGON. He went to one Judge, Baba Yusuf and procured a judgement that he was the lawyer to ALGON in the Paris Club refund case.\n\n\n\n\u201cYet, Malami who knows this is recommending that Ted Edwards be paid $159,000,000 as fees from ALGON instead of the actual lawyer. Will this not amount to double payment whenever Mr Joe Agi demands to be paid? From my investigation, Mr Joe Agi, ALGON and the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum have all gone back to court to challenge the payment of the $418 million including that of Edward through promissory notes.\n\n\n\n\u201cShould Malami not take a second look at the suit and see if really there is any fraud as being widely alleged? Instead, he and the Chief of Staff tricked the President and subsequently directed the Debt Management Office and the Finance Office to release the promissory notes to Edward and others so that they can take their shares.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe total sum of $418 million promissory note suggested by Malami to be paid is just a tip of the iceberg of what is coming unless he is stopped. Nigeria will become bankrupt before President Buhari leaves office. The anti-corruption war of Buhari has been effectively clipped by Malami and Gambari using their powerful offices to trick the President who really trusted them.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll (that is) needed to be done is to allow independent people to go through the whole cases concocted on the advice of Malami and the truth will be seen and Nigeria saved of all these massive stealing.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy is Malami not challenging any of these court judgements? If I may ask; in most of all these claims, the EFCC had investigated, taken statements and established that none of the contracts was executed. The report was submitted to Malami and former Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun by Magu-led EFCC suggested the arrest and interrogation of Ted Edward and one Prince Nicolas Ukachukwu but he and Gambari suppressed the report.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe same man suggested to be arrested is who Malami said should be given $159,000,000. ALGON had written several letters to him and (Kayode) Fayemi, who is the Chairman of Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum that all the jobs executed by Edwards and others were fake, not executed. Yet Malami in the face of this clear case of fraud tricked the President in a memo and said judgement was given against them.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe also negotiated the debt to 50 percent and convinced the President to pay to avoid more damages. It\u2019s high time President Buhari save his anti-corruption war by causing a thorough investigation of his appointees involved in this massive fraud.\u201d\n\n\n\nOthers who stand to benefit if the money is paid include Ned Nwoko, who is laying claim to $142,028,941 via a consent judgment he obtained from the Federal High Court in Abuja in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/148/2017.\n\n\n\nThree beneficiaries laying claim to $143,463,577.76 via a judgment of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court in the suit marked FCT/HC/CV/2129/2014 are: Riok Nigeria Ltd, Orji Nwafor Orizu, and Olaitan Bello.\n\n\n\nFrom the total money, Riok Nigeria Limited has a share of $142,028,941.95 (about 54 billion), Mr Nwafor is entitled to $1,219,440.45 and Mr Bello has a share of $215,159.36.\n\n\n\nA firm, Panic Alert Security System Limited, owned by George Uboh, is also laying claim to $47,831,920 based on another \u201cconsent judgment\u201d it obtained in suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/123/2018, which was filed as recently as 2018.",

          "text": "Over the past month, at least 2 of Nigeria\u2019s largest commercial banks have announced reduced limits on international transactions using naira debit cards to $20 (around \u20a610,000) per month.\n\nThis comes as a longstanding scarcity of foreign exchange continues to bite Africa\u2019s largest economy and biggest oil exporter, despite the recent surge in global energy prices.\n\nNigerians can use their naira-denominated debit cards to pay for transactions billed in US dollars online. For every purchase, debits are made directly from their naira accounts at current exchange rates.\n\nBefore now, customers could spend up to $100 (\u20a650,000) on web transactions using their naira cards but that limit has been cut by Zenith Bank PLC and United Bank for Africa (UBA), per emails sent to customers and seen by TechCabal\n\n\u201cThe monthly card international spend limit for web transactions has been reviewed from $100 to $20,\u201d Zenith said, adding that the review is \u201cin response to today\u2019s economic realities.\u201d\n\nThat statement came about two weeks after UBA told its customers the same in February, with the reviewed naira card limits for international transactions taking effect March 1.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe banks have also suspended the use of naira cards for international Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cash withdrawals and POS transactions, meaning cardholders cannot perform cash withdrawals and payments via those channels outside the country.\n\n\u201cIf you have higher International spend requirements, simply visit any of our branches and request for a foreign currency debit or prepaid card, which are available in US Dollar, Pounds, and Euro variants,\u201d Zenith Bank added.\n\n\u201cRemember you can use your UBA Dollar, Pounds or Euro Card for international POS, ATM, and web transactions,\u201d UBA\u2019s mail read. \u201cIf you do not have one and would like to subscribe, please visit a branch close to you.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, Nigerians have reacted with displeasure on social media against the new limits as they restrict their ability to pay for international transactions like Netflix subscriptions, ads on Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms.\n\n$20/month spending limit on @UBAGroup cards???

          "text": "\u201cHoly f*ck.\u201d\n\nThat was what Beeple tweeted when \u201cEverydays: The First 5,000 Days\u201d, his non-fungible Token (NFT) art and the first purely digital work of art ever offered by a major auction house, was bought for $69 million at Christie\u2019s in March last year. This event didn\u2019t only make Beeple the third richest artist in the world, it ushered in the beginning of a new era for the art world.\n\nWhile Beeple\u2019s was the most expensive JPEG NFT format, profile-pic NFT (PPF)\u2014NFTs that depict a portrait that can be used as a social media avatar\u2014also hit some record-breaking milestones. For example, Crypto Punk NFTs that were given out for free in 2017 at launch started trading for prices between $480,000 and $1.25 million in January 2021 and, by the end of the year, they wouldn\u2019t go for anything less than $4 million.\n\nThough NFT has been around since 2014, 2021 was the pivotal year for this \u201cnovelty and strange\u201d technology. It was the year it broke into the mainstream, disrupting the art world and waltzing its way into the hearts of almost every aspect of pop culture, from music to film to sports and literature.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile all of this was happening, a crop of young and curious African minds have also started to develop an appetite and build an NFT ecosystem on the continent. Although it felt\u2014still feels\u2014like a myth to the broader population, more people had started buying into it. Jacon Osinachi was well on his way to becoming the foremost NFT artist on the continent and, arguably, the world. Anthony Azekwoh would soon create and sell his first NFT \u201cThe Red Man\u201d, one of the most popular NFT pieces out of Africa. Zimbabwean Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d, a digital art of late African-American entertainment and sports stars\u2014DMX, Kobe Bryant, Aaliyah, Chadwick Boseman, Tupac Shakur, and Nipsey Hussle\u2014would soon be picked up and displayed on a billboard in New York\u2019s Times Square.\n\nSomewhere in Abuja, Nigeria, is Peace Ojemeh 24, a Nigerian product designer and an Open Source advocate, who, like everybody else, is trying to understand the \u201cinsanity\u201d around this technology, the reason anybody would spend millions of dollars on something intangible\u2014something they might never touch physically.\n\nWhile Ojemeh was still making sense of this, the original copy of \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d, a viral photo meme of a girl smirking as a fire roared behind her, sold for $500,000 (180 ETH at the time).\n\n\u201cReading about Disaster girl, a meme I casually use in my WhatsApp chats with friends, selling for such a ridiculous amount of dollars, was an awakening. I just knew I had to get in on NFTs,\u201d Ojemeh told TechCabal.\n\nBut judging from Ojemeh\u2019s journey, this could have been all talk. That wasn\u2019t the first time Ojemeh would get excited about crypto and its related ventures. In 2017 and 2018, she had planned to buy her first ethereum (ETH) but ended up not going through with it.\n\nWhen she finally did something in the space, it was a disaster. She bought edcoin, a crypto token from a Nigerian blockchain company Edmark. She even convinced her mother and uncle to invest in it but a few months after, while ETH ballooned into over $1,000, Edcoin started dropping in value.\n\nBy 2020, it was obvious edcoin wasn\u2019t going anywhere so she began to think of how to flip this seemingly bad investment into a lucrative one. She withdrew her investment from edcoin into ETH and then into e-gold and some other coins that yielded positives. This experience exposed her to the slippery world of crypto and the learnings from it shaped how she approaches crypto today.\n\nFounding Haze Monkey Society\n\nSo instead of going right into NFTs after the \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d news, Ojemeh decided to learn about the industry, and invested in some NFTs to have access to their communities to understand how they function and are being managed. By the time she gathered enough knowledge, she reached out to her friend Alabo Briggs, 22, a blockchain engineer, about building their own NFT collection. Briggs was on board with the idea but advised that they start small by first minting a single NFT then flying from there. But Ojemeh\u2019s ambition was bigger than that; she wanted to build a strong NFTs community like Crypto Punk and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) had built, and she wanted to hit the ground running.\n\nSo, in August, while Pablo Stanley, a product designer and doodler, was launching Robotos, a 10,000-robot NFT collection, and selling out, Ojemeh and Briggs started building a collection of stoned monkeys they would call Haze Monkey Society.\n\nHaze Monkey Society was launched as a collection of 4,200 NFTs focused on building a no-code platform aimed at empowering NFT creators and artists and making an environmental impact in Africa.\n\n\u201cBecause we didn\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel, we needed to associate ourselves with a successful project while not being a complete replica. So with the success of BAYC, we chose to identify as monkeys,\u201d said Ojemeh. \u201cHaze indicates the weed-smoking culture among creatives. It\u2019s also an inspiration behind our unique number: 420.\u201d\n\nHaze Monkey has unique and rich storytelling built into each of its NFTs.\n\nA thoughtful roadmap\n\nOne of the things that determines the success of an NFT project is its community. And what makes a community thrive is the utilities, the benefits, that come from holding such NFT. Ojemeh and Briggs know this, and that\u2019s why they spent a lot of time deliberating on their roadmap.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to just sell NFTs, we are keen on finding a way to provide value to Haze Monkey\u2019s holders,\u201d said Ojemeh, who also consults for the United Nations, the International Telecommunication Union, and the African Union on a project that exposes technology as a career path to girls across African countries.\n\nBesides access to an exclusive social community, there are 3 major benefits on Haze Monkey\u2019s roadmap. One of them is the no-code platform which Ojemeh said was born out of creating an environment where people don\u2019t need deep tech knowledge to harness the blockchain technology.\n\nThe next one is the animation series about Haze Monkey\u2019s unique stories where holders and community members will be characters. Lastly, the duo, having been born and bred in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, where petroleum exploration in the area continues to pollute their water and atmosphere, decided to include something personal to them: they want to plant 100 trees somewhere in Africa for every single NFT minted.\n\nA learning curve that led to a new direction\n\nAbout 10 days before Haze Monkey NFTs would start its public minting in February, the team behind the project launched a countdown campaign and daily Twitter space discussion, where the community would come together, ask questions, calculate the societal impact of the project and, most importantly, the fortune it promises.\n\nThe minting calendar had been set; the public minting price was set at 0.08 ETH at a maximum of 4 NFTs per address and the presale price for those who had been whitelisted after performing some tasks or winning giveaways was pegged at 0.06 ETH at a maximum of 2 NFTs.\n\nIn one of those Twitter Spaces, a community member with a monkey avatar and a Mexican accent asked what would happen if the collection did not sell out within the opening week. For a few seconds, there was silence and one could tell he\u2019d ask an unexpected question. It was obvious the team hadn\u2019t considered this.\n\n\u201cWell, the plan is to sell out, but in a situation where we don\u2019t the community will decide what to do,\u201d answered Ashlei, one of the US-based community managers who was moderating the space.\n\nBefore the countdown campaign started, Haze Monkey had gathered over 5,000 organic social followers and over 6,000 Discord community members from across the globe. The project had also been listed and verified on 7 of the largest NFT platforms\u2014NFT Calendar, NFT Drop, NFT Evening, Coin Market Cap, Rarity, Next Drop, NFT Genie, and Rarity Sniper.\n\nWith this increasing traction at zero marketing budget, the possibility of not selling out was out of the question. But Haze Money did about 20%. Among other factors, this could be attributed to the recent scare of stolen NFTs that was happening on OpenSea, the biggest NFT marketplace in the world.\n\nHowever, the slow movement couldn\u2019t deter the team as they\u2019ve quickly started looking for new strategies. They are currently iterating their roadmap to suite the new reality and as a result, the community have agreed to the reduction of the amount in circulation.\n\n\u201cAs a request from the community, our genesis collection was cut down to 1,242 with a vision of releasing the rest over time,\u201d Ojemeh told TechCabal.\n\nShe also mentioned that the community had initially agreed to cap volume at 1, 000, but because of how significant 420 is to the project and its weed-cultured monkeys, the number 1,242 was chosen.\n\nHaze Monkey is now a collection of 1,242 NFTs.\n\nThough built by Africans in Africa, Haze Monkey has already positioned itself as a global brand. In its Discord group, the project has about 5 different channels for people who can\u2019t speak English. Its team members are also from across the world.\n\nThough there are African women in the NFT scene minting and selling their own NFT, there\u2019s none building a collection of NFT at the scale that Ojemeh and her team are doing.\n\nOjemeh believes that as they continue to build on the genesis collection and iterate their roadmap to benefit their community, there\u2019s nothing stopping Haze Monkey from becoming one of the most valuable NFTs in the $80 billion industry \u2014 and that their \u201choly f*ck\u201d moment will soon come.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Helium Health assembled a star founding team",
          "text": "Finding co-founders and hiring employees in the early days of a startup is integral to its survival and growth. Nigerian healthtech startup, Helium Health, navigated this challenge in its early days by putting together a team of first employees that got the job done.\n\nHelium Health was co-founded by Adegoke Olubisi, Dimeji Sofowora, and Tito Ovia in 2016 to use technology to provide better healthcare services for Africans. Today, it optimises medical records by storing them electronically; and provides a payment system and healthcare financing solution for clinics, and a telemedicine feature. In 2020, Helium Health raised $10 million in Series A funding to expand its offering across African countries. Last November, it expanded to the MENA region when it acquired a Qatar-headquartered and UAE-based doctor booking platform, Meddy.\n\nTo understand the role having a star team plays in a startup\u2019s early days, Daniel Adeyemi, Senior Reporter at TechCabal, spoke with Tito Ovia, co\u2013founder and current Head of Public Sector Growth at Helium Health, on the fifth episode of Building From Ground Up, Season 2, by the UK-Nigeria Tech Hub.\n\nOvia was named a Forbes 30 under 30 recipient and a winner of the Future Africa Award for Disruption for her work on African healthcare through Helium Health. When Ovia is not fixing healthcare in Africa, she is occupied with the Feminist Coalition, a globally-acclaimed women\u2019s rights advocacy group promoting equality for women in the Nigerian society with a core focus on education, financial freedom, and representation in public office.\n\nFinding co-founders\n\nOvia\u2019s childhood dream was to provide healthcare services across Africa, but that dream did not materialise until she quit her job at the Lagos State AIDS Control Agency. Ovia, at the time, was trying to figure out what to do next in the healthcare space. She also wanted to leave the country. A friend of hers, who attended law school with her co-founder, Demiji, told her about a small group of people trying to build a tech and healthcare company, but none of the co-founders were in the healthcare space. The friend advised Ovia to have a talk with them because they needed directions and would need the help of someone like her.\n\nSo, Ovia met with Goke and Dimeji for the first time for a chat intended to last an hour but stretched to 7 hours. During the conversation, it was clear that they were all connected by a similar drive and interest. \u201cWe connected on a deeper level of wanting to be able to provide value and fix our country,\u201d Ovia said.\n\nConvincing your first set of customers\n\nOvia said that it was challenging to convince people, that they knew what they were doing. When they tried to get their first 10\u201315 customers, they were required to present other people that could vouch for them.\n\nOvia said that another challenge Helium Health faced in its early days was identifying the strength of each of its team members and only assigning related tasks to them. \u201cIf you are a small team of 5, everybody does everything. It was a scramble, and all hands were on deck to get things done.\u201d\n\nWhen Ovia was asked about how she managed conflict and managing relationships with her co-founders, she explained that she likes good conflict and doesn\u2019t see it as a horrible thing because it means that \u201cnobody is a sheep\u2014it means everybody is thinking and invested in the growth of the organisation\u201d. \u201d\n\nShe sees conflict as a pitch: \u201cIf you can\u2019t convince co-founders on a particular direction, how do you want to convince the outside world, your investors, and board?\u201d\n\nOvia also noted that she and her co-founders take management and leadership courses and have mediators who step in during their conflicts. She also revealed they have advisors and neutral parties who are invested in the growth of the company and provide their opinions on important issues.\n\nWhat makes good co-founders?\n\nOvia believes trust is one of the things that makes a good co-founder. \u201cI have to be able to close my eyes and believe that you are not going to throw me off a cliff.\u201d This should be coupled with openness, she noted.\n\nOvia believes it is important that co-founders be at the right place in their lives. \u201cWhat this means is that, if you decide to be a high growth startup, everybody must have the time and bandwidth to build it,\u201d she said. This is because she explained, personal responsibilities might stop some people from committing to such gruelling work. \u201cSometimes, you have a co-founder slacking because they have other priorities in their life.\u201d\n\nShe also believes co-founders must have similar values. \u201cEverybody has to be able to align on how and where they want to end up.\u201d Ovia doesn\u2019t believe there is an ideal number of co-founders but also does not believe in gathering people just for the sake of it.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t believe that every entrepreneur needs a co-founder. Although, she believes every founder needs a strong executive team: a chief financial officer (CFO), chief operating officer (COO), and chief technical officer (CTO) \u201cThis is because, if anything goes wrong, the strong executive team that you\u2019ve built can do the heavy lifting.\u201d\n\nThis is important, she explains because building in a startup\u2019s early days is a lonely process. \u201cThere are so many trials and tribulations that we\u2019ve gone through at Helium Health that I\u2019m so grateful I\u2019ve had co-founders to cry to when it feels like everything is over.\u201d\n\nOvia recalled that in Helium Health\u2019s early days, they couldn\u2019t even afford to schedule a meeting with the kind of talent that they have now. \u201cThen, it was just an idea, a couple of hospitals, and we were not sure if we would make it past the year.\u201d So, Helium Health had to forgo talent and opt for talent that were fresh out of the university and had a few years\u2019 of experience.\n\n\u201cWe targeted dreamers, people who are committed to the idea and who believe that someday the startup would be big. We sold the promise of a tomorrow to our early staff. Some people didn\u2019t buy it, some people did.\u201d\n\nBut as they grew, post-Series A, they needed people with more advanced skills\u2014chief product officer (CPO), head of HR, head of finance, and CFO\u2014so, they started selling good working conditions: early closing time, working from home, and employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) to their employees. \u201cBy doing that, we were able to attract the sort of amazing talent we have now.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ovia didn\u2019t find looking for a technical co-founder difficult because Helium Health\u2019s CEO was a technical person, she advised them to get an executive or senior manager on board instead of a technical co-founder. \u201cWhen you see that there is a working relationship between you and the person, you can then bring them on board as a co-founder.\u201d She advised against rushing into a co-founder relationship because it is like a marriage.\n\nWatch the full conversation here:\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nRecently, my mental health has taken some heavy hits, and this week has been extremely stressful for me. Enough about me, though. What comes to mind when you hear the term \u201cmental health\u201d? A mad person?\n\nSide bar: It\u2019s encouraging to see how people are coming forward to test for mental illnesses and accept treatment. While this is still a long way off in Africa, it\u2019s certain we\u2019re getting there. So, thanks to the Internet for bringing it to light!\n\nBack to the matter. Is mental health only related to mental illnesses? Is it limited to schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, anxiety, eating disorder, depression, insomnia, alcohol and substance abuse, and other similar conditions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s your answer: Mental health encompasses more than just mental illnesses. It is related to how a person feels, thinks, and acts.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) describes it as a state of well-being in which an individual recognises his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and can contribute to his or her community.\n\nThis means that someone may have good mental health, no mental illness or be somewhere in between. This refers to the mental health spectrum.\n\nFor instance, Ayo, a 27-year-old graduate, may not exhibit any signs of mental illness but is unemployed, with a negative attitude toward himself and his relationships, or may not have a strong sense of purpose. Can you say Ayo is mentally healthy? Of course not!\n\nHaving good mental health and no mental illness is at the top of the spectrum, while having poor mental health and a mental illness is at the bottom. While the people who are somewhere in the middle may have good mental health but a mental illness, they may also have poor mental health but no mental illness.\n\nConsequently, we must all strive to be at the top of the mental health spectrum which begins with prioritising your mental health as much as you do your physical and sexual health.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nThe Nigeria Data Protection Bureau\n\nAntler East Africa\u2019s oversubscribed fund\n\nThe Nigeria Data Protection Bureau\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know that the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (CFRN) 1999 guarantees Nigerian citizens the fundamental right to privacy?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis means that under Section 37 of the CFRN, citizens have the right to privacy in their homes, correspondence, phone conversations, and telegraphic communications.\n\nThe Constitution, however, does not define \u201cprivacy\u201d or contain detailed privacy provisions. So, it is unclear how far Nigerian codified law protects data privacy.\n\nBut, personal data is becoming increasingly valuable, and it is constantly sought after by nefarious individuals who intend to exploit it to the detriment of the data subjects.\n\nThe current state of our laws demonstrates the need for Nigeria to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for data protection, don\u2019t you think?\n\nThis, among other reasons, could be why the Nigerian government announced that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved the establishment of a new agency, the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (NDPB), to focus on data protection and privacy in the country.\n\nOgheneruemu, a non-practising lawyer and Techpoint Africa Reporter, provided us with additional information about this new data protection enforcing body. What effect will this new agency have on your privacy rights?\n\nCheck it out here: Nigeria has a new data protection enforcing body; here\u2019s why you should care\n\nAntler East Africa\u2019s oversubscribed fund\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntler East Africa, a venture capital firm based in Nairobi, has closed a $13.5 million fund to invest in early-stage tech startups in an oversubscribed round.\n\nInitially, the VC intended to raise $10 million but ended up with $13.5 million. Do the math: they received an additional $3.5 million.\n\nThe round\u2019s limited partners include Baillie Gifford, Canica, and other institutional investors like the International Finance Corporation.\n\nAntler East Africa launched in August 2019, two years after Antler \u2013 its parent company \u2013 was founded by Magnus Grimeland. Every year, the VC firm employs a full venture building model with two cohorts.\n\nThe company uses a hybrid model acting as both a venture builder and a venture capital firm. From its $300 million fund, the firm has invested in over 250 companies ranging from pre-seed to Series C.\n\nSo far, five cohorts of 153 founders have graduated from the accelerator programs, and the firm has made 14 investments. AIfluence, Marketforce-subsidiary Digiduka, Honeycoin, Uncover Skincare, Try Cooked, and Vybe are some examples.\n\nAntler East Africa\u2019s new fund will allow it to invest in founders who want to build their startups from the ground up and already formed teams that require capital to scale.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nUnderstanding others\u2019 feelings: what is empathy and why do we need it?.

          "title": "Nigeria has a new data protection enforcing body; here\u2019s why you should care",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February 2022, the Nigerian government announced that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved a new agency, the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (NDPB)\n\nThe statement was signed by Uwa Suleiman, Media Aide to the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami.\n\nAccording to Suleiman, the NDPB was established in line with global best practices and would focus on data protection and privacy for the country.\n\nAmong other things, the statement credits the introduction of the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) and the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) with creating more awareness about data protection and resulting in the \u201cdatafication\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough we are not sure of the specifics of the agency\u2019s duties, Suleiman says the NDPB will consolidate the gains of the NDPR and support the process for the development of a primary legislation for data protection and privacy.\n\nFor now, we can say with certainty that Vincent Olatunji will head the NDPB as National Commissioner/CEO.\n\nOlatunji served as the Acting DG of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) until October 2016 before handing over to Pantami, nine months after his appointment.\n\nDoes Nigeria have a new Data Protection Authority?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe short answer to this is no.\n\nThe long answer, which requires some explaining, is maybe.\n\nWhen NITDA introduced the NDPR, the agency handed itself some oversight functions, effectively becoming Nigeria\u2019s default Data Protection Authority (DPA).\n\nBut what are DPAs? According to the European Commission, \u201cDPAs are independent public authorities that supervise, through investigative and corrective powers, the application of the data protection law. They provide expert advice on data protection issues and handle complaints lodged against violations of the General Data Protection Regulation and the relevant national laws.\u201d\n\nSo think of a DPA as a bodyguard to ensure your data rights are protected, and companies don\u2019t get away with anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria\u2019s case, this would apply to the NDPR\n\nHowever, unlike Europe and other countries \u2014 including some countries in Africa \u2014 NITDA did not create a separate entity to act as a DPA. A scenario that some have argued goes beyond the powers assigned in the NITDA Act.\n\nEssentially, one could argue that NITDA appointing itself DPA is unlawful or, in legal terms, void.\n\nThe NITDA Act empowers the Agency to \u201cdevelop guidelines for electronic governance and monitor the use of electronic data interchange and other forms of electronic communication transactions as an alternative to paper-based methods in government, commerce, education, the private and public sectors, labour, and other fields, where the use of electronic communication may improve the exchange of data and information.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the NITDA Act does not appear to give the Agency the power to issue the NDPR in itself. But that\u2019s a discussion for another day.\n\nGoing by this new development, though, it appears that four years into the NDPR\u2019s regime, we might be getting a DPA in the true sense of the word. Let\u2019s not get too far ahead of ourselves, though, because there\u2019s still the pesky problem of an establishing law.\n\nIn most countries, DPAs are created through a governing law or regulation. A presidential approval does not a DPA make, but this is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, for which we are cautiously optimistic.\n\nFor now, however, our earlier answers are still valid. Until NITDA or the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy confirms whether the NDPB is a DPA, we can only speculate.\n\nOlumide Babalola, Managing Partner at Olumide Babalola LP, believes that \u201cThe statement is silent on what form the Bureau would take. It reportedly currently shares an office with the National Information Technology Development Agency (\u2018NITDA\u2019).\n\n\u201cHence, as things stand, the Bureau is no more than a department under NITDA as it currently has no separate identity, not even a website where information on its operations can be accessed.\u201d\n\nWhat happens to the Data Protection Bill?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Suleiman\u2019s statement, the NDPB would \u201csupport the process for the development of a primary legislation for data protection and privacy.\u201d\n\nThe race to a dedicated data protection and privacy law has taken several turns. Filled with false starts, the closest Nigeria has come to a law passed by the National Assembly was in 2018 with the Nigeria Data Protection Bill 2018. Although both houses passed it in 2019, President Buhari withheld his assent.\n\nThe most successful attempt remains the NDPR, a guideline at best.\n\nThe Data Protection Bill 2020 (PDF) is currently before the National Assembly, but nothing much has been heard since a stakeholder session held in September 2020.\n\nThe Bill provides a much more robust approach to data protection, providing for more categories of data than the NDPR, which appears to deal more with electronic data. It also creates a Data Protection Commission, which should act as Nigeria\u2019s DPA.\n\nInterestingly, there are rumours that the Bill has been abandoned, and the federal government is seeking a consultant to draft a new one.\n\nWhat this means\n\nBusiness as usual for now.\n\nAlthough the uncertainty surrounding the NDPR and NITDA\u2019s power to appoint itself DPA are still dark areas, it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got for now.\n\nThe introduction of the NDPB raises a little wave of dust over Nigeria\u2019s data protection and privacy crate. It raises questions that cannot be adequately answered until we see appropriate legislation or more guidelines and perhaps a \u201cdedicated website.\u201d\n\nWhat follows should make for interesting times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

I did, but I saw a recap and the best way to describe my reaction is mind blown \ud83e\udd2f.\n\nThe event had some boring announcements, like the new iPhone colours and the underwhelmingly designed iPhone SE. To be fair, the SE comes with an impressive spec upgrade, but the design is a total replica of the 2020 SE.\n\nMy guess is that Apple wants you to buy their more high-end products rather than their budget (a $430 phone is not a budget phone ) products. So if you cannot afford the flagships, you should be able to buy the SE. Keyword being should.\n\nThe mind-blowing part of the event for me was when the Mac Studio was announced. A machine the size of a bowl of nkwobi, but with beastly specs. It runs on Apple\u2019s new chip \u2014 M1 Ultra \u2014 eight times faster than last year\u2019s M1 Max.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has a 20 core CPU, up to 8 terabytes of solid-state drive (SSD), and 128 gigabytes of unified memory or RAM. While the specs sound incredible, how it handles third-party software will decide its power.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe creation of Ozi with no-code tools\n\nOkHi\u2019s $1.5m raise\n\n$1.5m pre-seed by Yep!\n\nBuilding a startup with no-code tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross section of Ozi team. L-R: Israel Akpan, Co-founder and COO; Azeez Adejumo, Co-founder and CEO; Olukayaode Amusu, CMO. Source: Supplied.\n\nTwo University of Lagos (UNILAG) graduates \u2014 Adejumo Azeez and Israel Akpan \u2014 are building a tech startup without writing one line of code.\n\nHow did it begin? After spending months looking for a developer to build their product, the duo resorted to no-code tools. They found exciting products that didn\u2019t require any coding expertise. But even a startup built with no-code tools still has challenges.\n\nTheir startup, Ozi, can be described as a Communications as a Service product that Azeez and Akpan started in the university. But as their clientele grew in number and quality, privacy concerns they didn\u2019t consider rose, and they lost a considerable amount of clients.\n\nOzi provides chatbots and helps send bulk messages on WhatsApp. Although other platforms like SMS and email can be leveraged, the startup is doubling down on WhatsApp for several reasons. One of them is open rates.\n\nThe startup has recently closed a $10,000 angel round and has increased its user-base from 100 to 10,000\n\nOne thing I find interesting about Ozi is the different iterations and the challenges the founders have gone through in putting a startup together with no-code tools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you have a startup idea and have zero coding skills, you should read Ogheneruemu\u2019s conversation with Azeez and Akpan: How no-code tools helped two UNILAG graduates build omni-channel messaging platform, Ozi\n\nSmart addressing with OkHi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can find your home address easily on Google Maps, you are one of the very few Africans with a verifiable address. Getting packages delivered to your doorsteps would be hassle-free \u2014 for the most part.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re like me and your house doesn\u2019t even have a number, then we\u2019re among the 400 million Africans who do not have verifiable addresses. This makes getting deliveries or even opening bank accounts hard.\n\nInterestingly, OkHi, a smart-addressing startup, wants to solve this problem. The startup was built by Timbo Drayson when he noticed Google Maps doesn\u2019t work perfectly in Africa. In 2014, he launched the address verification startup in Kenya, verifying over 300,000 addresses so far.\n\nOkHi expanded into Nigeria after a $1.5 million seed and a partnership with Interswitch. Yesterday, it also announced another $1.5 million seed extension from investors, including Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga Agboola and Interswitch.\n\nOkHi had a conversation with Chimgozorim, and they discussed how the startup is providing address verification services for businesses, including eCommerce and ride-hailing startups.

The fintech startup isn\u2019t just offering financial services to the digitally savvy but to every African without an Internet connection.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Yep!\u2019s Co-founder, Olaoluwa Awojoodu, said, \u201cWe want to bank the guys in Lagos as well as bank the guys in a village at Ikot Ekpene.\u201d\n\nHow? Yep! isn\u2019t Awojoodu\u2019s first rodeo in the finance world. He is the Founder of E-Settlement, a holding company for different financial entities; its agent banking platform, PayCentre Africa, has over 5 million customers.\n\nYep! will leverage this massive customer base to bring the underbanked among them into the \u201cdigital fold.\u201d\n\nExplaining, Awojoodu said, \u201cnot just the guys that are digitally enabled, but even the guys that are off the digital channels, we are going to bring everybody into the digital environment using both digital tools and agent networks.\u201d\n\nYep! has raised a $1.5 million pre-seed in a round led by Greenhouse Capital. While other fintechs, for example, OPay, have a similar model, its competitive advantage lies in how easily it can provide credit facilities for its agents.\n\nThe pre-seed fund will go into doubling its agent network to over 200,000 by the end of 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nWhat Happens When a Child Gets COVID?

          "title": "Nigeria faces fresh spike in food prices on rising diesel cost",
          "text": "The recent surge in the prices of diesel in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy, has led to a fresh spike in food prices, dashing hopes of returning to a more stable market condition.\n\nThe price of Automotive Gas Oil, popularly known as diesel, has soared by almost 170 percent in one year to N620-650 per litre from N220-N240 in March last year.\n\nThe surge in the price of diesel, which has been deregulated, followed the rally in global oil prices, buoyed by the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Brent, the global oil benchmark, sold for $113 per barrel at the time of writing this report.\n\n\u201cDiesel prices are surging and with this, we are going to see another fresh spike in food prices,\u201d said Victor Iyama, national president of the Federation of Agricultural Commodity Association of Nigeria (FACAN).\n\n\u201cJust in the last two weeks, we paid N350, 000 to transport our commodities from Kano to Lagos, and yesterday we had to pay N550,000 for the same truck and distance because of the surge in diesel price,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have no choice but to transfer the extra cost to the consumers,\u201d he added.\n\nIn Africa\u2019s biggest oil-producing country, food producers and retailers are now facing intense pressure from rising energy costs as they have to spend more on diesel to power their factories and on logistics.\n\nRead also: Nigeria should expect food scarcity by June \u2013 Dangote\n\nFood prices spike in Nigeria\n\nFood prices have been making a rapid climb in Africa\u2019s most populous country since August 2019 when the country shut its borders from neighbouring countries and continued unabated owing to supply chain disruptions induced by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cSadly, food prices are surging again when we are trying to build back from the pandemic impacts,\u201d said Tola Faseru, former national president of Cashew Association of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSince diesel prices started surging, the cost of food transportation has doubled and this has already started affecting commodity prices,\u201d Faseru said.\n\n\u201cA ton of cashew sold for N440,000 when the season started in February is now being sold for N600,000 and this is because of logistics,\u201d he added.\n\nInflation in Africa\u2019s biggest economy declined marginally in January 2022 to 15.60 percent from 15.63 percent recorded in December 2021, but the food index rose by 17.13 percent in January 2022 compared to 20.57 percent in January 2021.\n\nThe inflationary pressure has reduced consumers\u2019 disposable income, making basic needs elude Nigerians.\n\nThe limited purchasing power of Nigerians puts basic food commodities out of the reach of many, especially the country\u2019s over 23.2 million unemployed people. This could indicate a famine threat.\n\n\u201cThings are just getting hard daily for Nigerians and the government is not doing anything about it,\u201d said Obiora Madu, CEO and president of Multimix Group.\n\n\u201cLogistics is already a big challenge in Nigeria and now with the surge in diesel prices, it has further compounded the problem. Transporting fresh vegetables now with cold chains will be almost impossible,\u201d Madu said.\n\nBusinessDay survey of Mile 12 Market shows that 50kg of local parboiled rice which was sold for N24,000 last week now sells for N27,000 while a 50kg pack of foreign parboiled rice now goes for N33,000 from 28,000 sold a week ago.\n\nA big basket of fresh tomatoes now sells for N16,000 as against N12,000 sold two weeks ago, while a small basket sells for N8,000 as against N4,500 sold two weeks ago.\n\nA 25-litre measure of vegetable oil sold N27,500 last week now sells for N33, 500 while a 25-litre measure of palm oil is sold for N19,000.\n\n\u201cThe recent increase in diesel prices is responsible for the current spike in food prices. The cost of transporting the food items from where they are produced to the markets have almost doubled,\u201d said Muhammed Abdul, general secretary, Arewa Perishable FoodStuff Market Association, Mile 12 in a telephone response to questions.\n\n\u201cLast two weeks we transported a bag of potatoes from Jos to Lagos for N2,500 now it is N5,000. The truck drivers are saying it\u2019s because of the high cost of diesel,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Nigeria should expect an outbreak of food scarcity in the next three months as adverse consequences of the Russian-Ukraine war begin to come home to roost, Aliko Dangote, chairman, and chief executive of Dangote Group has said.\n\nThe war\u2019s impact which began with the steep rise in wheat prices may soon spread to other foods including maize and other components of input for industrial food production, triggering low production and low supply, the business mogul said at the 4th annual food processing and nutrition leadership forum in Lagos.\n\nRussia and Ukraine account for about 30 percent of the world\u2019s urea production and 26 percent of the world\u2019s potassium supply, access to these input components will increasingly be stifled for as long as the war persists and could cripple the goal to fortify staples from source.\n\n\u201cNot only wheat or maize will be affected but a lot of components because as we speak, potash and urea supply are held largely by Russia and Ukraine. There will be a scarcity of food because people will not be able to access fertilizers going forward. But we may not see the effects now but in the next two to three months, it will reflect,\u201d Dangote said.\n\n\u201cWe need to sit with the government to look at what to do. We need to make sure we grow more. It is about food security,\u201d Dangote said.\n\nIn Africa\u2019s biggest oil-producing country, flour millers believe a shortage of wheat supplies from Russia would affect the price of products like bread, a common food in Africa\u2019s most populous country.\n\nRead also: Nigeria faces fresh spike in food prices on rising diesel cost\n\nNigerian food companies currently battling an uptick in production costs from exchange range volatility and supply chain disruptions will face the ripple effect.\n\nData from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed wheat is Nigeria\u2019s third most consumed grain.\n\nFor instance, Nigeria imported N898.2 billion worth of wheat in nine months that ended September 2021.\n\nThe top origins of wheat in Nigeria in 2021 included the USA, N194.2 billion; Canada, N136.4 billion, Russia, N124 billion, Lithuania, N122.3 billion and Latvia, N115.9 billion.\n\nRead also: Gold rallies as Russian-Ukraine crisis stoke anxiety\n\nIn the last twelve months, wheat-based products such as the popular pre-packed wheat flour and bread (sliced and unsliced) have witnessed a steady price increase across the country.\n\nIn January 2022, a 500g sliced bread was sold for N418.65, representing a 28 percent increase on a year-on-year basis. The 500g unsliced bread rose by 25 percent from N306.74 in January 2021 to N383.51 in January 2022, NBS data stated.\n\nAccording to Boye Olusanya, chief executive officer, Flour Mills of Nigeria, the reality is that Russia and Ukraine are first and fifth in wheat and if that volume which is almost one-third of the total wheat production in the world is taken out, there will be an immediate impact on pricing.\n\nAs of today, prices of wheat have gone down, he said, noting there is a lag in the system because of inventory control and inventory management.\n\nAlso, he explained that the impact of the war will not only reflect in the short term but could snowball lasting effect on production over a year to 18 months.\n\n\u201cIt is something that we need to be sitting with the government to make discourse about what measures can we put in place to alleviate what is coming. If we don\u2019t manage this well, there will be significant volume compression in terms of input materials that come in and then for the volume of food that is sold and if we realise how much we are a source of fortification, then there is a huge impact on health,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Like Nigeria\u2019s situation in the 1990s, Vietnam\u2019s per generation capacity was only around 8,700 megawatts (MW) in 1990. 17 years after a major policy rethink, Vietnam\u2019s power sector has risen to around 48,000MW while Nigeria is still struggling with a long list of excuses and billion-dollar losses to show for it.\n\nVietnam, a country with a population less than half of Nigeria generates over 20,000 GWh due to a major policy rethink that revolutionised its power sector. This resulted in the commercialisation and introduction of independent power producers, with a commitment to renewable sources where possible.\n\nNigeria on the other hand has nothing but an additional 800 megawatts despite billion dollar investments and an eight-year-old privatisation exercise.\n\nUnlike Nigeria\u2019s power sector which involved changing the structure of the sector to separate generation, distribution and transmission units, Vietnam was able to effectively create investment competition in its electricity market, a development that allowed the Southeast Asian country to attract needed investments to boost generation.\n\nVietnam adopted a major policy turnaround in 2005 that provided the framework to develop a competitive power market, unbundle Electricity Vietnam, set prices that better reflect costs, promote private investment, and establish a regulatory authority.\n\n\u201cVietnam\u2019s lesson story shows Nigeria\u2019s state-centric institutions can develop the power sector with top-level government commitment, highly-qualified staff, and consensus among sector institutions,\u201d Pedro Omontuemhen, partner and energy, utilities and resources leader at PwC Nigeria said.\n\nVietnam\u2019s installed generation capacity grew from 11,578MW in 2005 to 24,500MW in 2016 with transmission and distribution losses reducing by an annual average of 0.6percent in the same period.\n\nRead also: NNPC mulls buying government-owned power plants\n\n\u201cA key strategy used in the initial stages of the electricity expansion program was the deployment of rural electrification to commercial and productive sectors of the economy,\u201d says FBNQuest, a merchant banking and asset management group in Sub-Saharan Africa\n\nIt added, \u201cGiven the importance of rice exports to the country, the earliest electrification programmes focused on connecting rice-producing regions of the country, thereby industrialising the rice production process.\u201d\n\nFindings showed Vietnamese electricity laws require national power development master plans to be adopted every ten-year period. These electricity Laws formalise the shift of the electricity sector to a market economy and diversify forms of ownership and management of electricity generation, wholesale and retail.\n\nAccording to Vietnam Electricity (EVN), a state-owned enterprise, the objective of the electricity law is to encourage the participation of all economic entities in electricity development, development of electricity sources using renewable energy, development of smart power grid and establishing grid links with neighbouring countries.\n\nIn addition, current Vietnamese regulations also provide special incentives for solar energy projects, which are entitled to an import duty exemption.\n\nFor instance, a certain Act 2068 provides incentives such as zero import duty for fixed assets of a renewable energy project, corporate income tax exemption or reduction, land rental exemption or reduction and government funding for research and technology of pilot projects.\n\n\u201cVietnam\u2019s policies are to liberalise the electricity market and encourage foreign investors to invest in the market,\u201d Omontuemhen explained.\n\nData from EVN showed most foreign investment takes the form of build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects, where a foreign investor builds a power generation project, operates it for a certain period of time to gain profits, and then transfers it to the Vietnamese Government.\n\nIt also showed as of February 2020, there were 19 BOT thermal power plant projects, with a total capacity of about 27,000 MW.\n\nAccording to Vietnam\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Trade, the government has adopted various policies to encourage the development of nuclear power.\n\nSpecifically, nuclear power stations were included in the national power development strategy for the period 2012 to 2020, according to which five nuclear power stations will be put into operation from 2020 to 2030.\n\nWhile Vietnam\u2019s forward-thinking policies seem to be yielding more fruits, Nigeria\u2019s policy formation and economic choices leave less to be desired.\n\nBusinessDay analysis shows that although Nigeria\u2019s transmission capacity has increased by 20 percent to an average of 4,200mw in the last eight years, Nigeria\u2019s population has soared by 57 percent in the last eight years from 131 million people to 206, according to the latest World Bank estimates.\n\nDespite prevailing challenges, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has in the past seven years spent over N2 trillion to keep the nation\u2019s power sector from collapse.\n\nThe interventions include Power and Aviation Intervention Fund (PAIF), hovering at about N300 billion, Nigerian Electricity Market Stabilisation Facility (NEMSF) at about N213 billion, N140 billion Solar Connection Intervention Facility, over N600 billion tariff shortfall interventions and another N120 billion intervention designed for mass metering, among others.\n\n\u201cDespite this level of intervention, the generating companies had estimated receivables of over N400 billion in 2020 alone. While the interventions have been central in ensuring the profitability of operators along the industry\u2019s value chain, they remain insufficient and unsustainable,\u201d noted Augusto & Co.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates that Nigeria\u2019s economy loses about $29 billion a year because of electricity supply problems. Ninety percent of the industry provides its own power. The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria says that roughly 40 percent of the cost of production goes to power.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nCan you tell us about yourself?\n\nOnce again, thank you. Welcome to my world. I\u2019m Professor John Abhuere currently professor of development and management. I retired, as many persons know, as director of NYSC after which I went into writing, management consultancy and lately into academics. I set up a foundation which is called Centre for Child Care and Youth development where we try to put some of the ideas we believe in into practice. We have an office in Abuja and the headquarters in Uromi. It is for that reason I\u2019m in Benin City, Edo state to see how the one in Uromi is faring.\n\nProfessor you are welcome to this interview. There are some burning issues we want you to vent your ideas on. First, it is about power rotation or zoning which ever one it is called in the political sphere of Nigeria bearing in mind the upcoming 2023 general elections. What do you have to say about power rotation in Nigeria?\n\nI\u2019m happy you raised this issue if you\u2019ve been following my writing, I\u2019m a sincere advocate of zoning and power rotation as a basis of making reasonable progress in this country, as a basis of having stability in this country, as a basis of promoting participating democracy of all citizens of this country. But for you to know why we are really passionate about zoning you, first of all know the evolution of democracy how it came about, the development so far within the democratic world e.t.c. If you remember or cast your mind back to the relevant literature we were told that democracy started in the Greek city state and the idea really was that every person should have an opportunity to participate in the development or political process of the community so that every person should gather in a community or square for them to take decision on issues that affect them but the city-states were small and people were few. So it wasn\u2019t really possible as the world continues to develop to congregate in one place. We have a situation where in the 5bc to 17th or 18th century. Lets take that big gap, you find America coming up reviewing the whole thing to have a representative democracy as opposed to monarchy which means what they are working against is the advent of dictatorship. So everyone that has been very democratic wants as much as possible, people\u2019s representation. So you find America came up with a novelty approach very different from what the Greek had about representative democracy where you will have your own representative in government making laws on your behalf.\n\nMany parts of the world have seen this variance of democracy today but the point I\u2019m trying to say is that democracy has never been static. It has been expanding, changing in definition or scope. One thing has however remained the need for people to participate. The more the better. I should correct a thing. Even when people like Abraham Lincoln defined democracy as a government of the people, by the people and for the people something of that nature. You, find out that not everyone in America was given the chance to participate. Blacks and slaves initially were not allowed to participate. Even in Greece when it started, it were the citizens that were allowed to vote.\n\nYou find out democracy as a system is where people have been struggling to participate. It took some time for the black man in America to vote. Also it took time for the woman in America and many part of the world to vote. So if you apply this theoretical background in Nigeria we find out that the British helped in establishing the kind of democracy we have with Nigerians participating in bringing it about. But you find from the beginning the democratic space was dominated by a few people the big tribe. If you look at it, again because the minority group wanted a place to participate, it saw them struggling. All this talk on Niger-delta has been there also, the tiv movement.\n\nThey were all about attempt to participate in the democratic space. We find a situation where Nigeria was moving and we began to see the need to balance up. That was why during the military administration then, take back to when Tafawa Balewa was the prime minister Nnamdi Azikiwe was the governor general, the power was being tried to balance up. Then in the military, somebody from the North trying to balance up being the head of government then Chief of staff position to South. We now came to 1993 election, the best ever conducted election that was annulled by the then military administration. Then between 1993 and 1999 there were series of conflict in this country until the same military that created the problem sat and handover. But they made sure the two most popular political parties presidential candidates end up being presented to the people from the same zone. That is why we have Abiola vs Falashe and Abiola eventually won. That alone, trying to zone the political process to the West brought enormous stability to the Yorubas to be brought to the fold and we achieve some reasonable level of development.\n\nNow, if you look at the arithmetic, we have a section of the country with evidence that for a long time they\u2019ve not been allowed to participate seriously at the highest political level in the country and that region continue to boil and what affects one region affects the other and you cannot rule that one out. Power, in a multi- cultural country like Nigeria, you cannot afford to say politics or power must go to the highest winner, no it has to be divided, it has to be zoned so that every region will have a fraction of it. In fact, the whole process of the winner takes all is wrong as power has to be proportional to the vote you won in an election. That\u2019s a matter for another day.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that if we really want stability, cooperation, development and also collective responsibility of every person to the development and promotion of national unity in this country, zoning is the answer, it is the solution to minority neglect whether at the state level or not. It is about proper power-sharing and assurance that once upon a time it will come down to your turn in many states including ours. If you don\u2019t zone power there are some minority groups that will never smell power and they belong to the same country. So do you think they will be happy?\n\nSo my own commitment to the idea of zoning or rotation of power is that it is imbibed, it is what democracy is all out to achieve. Without people trying to recognize it, if you exclude any group from power, democracy itself is being threatened. This is my submission. We may really need to sit down. This is the year we really need to think about it. 2022 is the year that will bring about 2023. So my appeal is that the people and political parties need to sit down and zone presidential candidate to the South-East. I say it again they should zone their presidential ticket to the South-East because every zone in this country has presidential material and when you really look at it again it is unfair. Injustice is the beginning of conflict in any society. A group that feels unjustly treated will always seek a way out to seek for justice. If from 1960 the great Zik can be regarded, in modern times, as the father of Nigeria nationalism, he didn\u2019t cling to political executive power. We had Ironsi he stayed in power briefly and when you look at the history of this country, if you talk about those who made their own selfless contribution to the building of this country the Ibo people come first. We can not afford to exclude them from the political process and expect peace. We can never have it.\n\nThis is not to say that there will be no competition. There will still be competition. The only thing is that it\u2019s limited to a zone such that one person will come and if somebody comes from the southeast as the president another person comes from the North or anywhere, the country will be better off. Development will have trust. These have all been destroyed because of present system of saying a dominant group must take power. It doesn\u2019t work out that way and I think I\u2019m saying this in the interest of national unity, national development and in the interest of peace in this country that is where zoning and rotation of power comes in.\n\nSo you are in variably asking that it should be entrenched in the Constitution?\n\nYeah, it is not there as a chapter but the idea of zoning is there. We are told that the federal government and the state government should ensure, in the appointment of people to offices, that the different geographical zones are represented. That is the federal character. So when you have it in structure, why is there no application in the political arena? So it is there. So the concept of citizens, participation is very germane to the success of any democratic process otherwise it\u2019s not democracy.\n\nAlright, let us look at the call by some state governors for clamp down on illegal refineries. Wike of Rivers State has been very vocal on this area asking for it to be closed down, what is your take on this sir?\n\nWell, I have looked at what people are saying on this issue. We have to be very careful. Before you embark on the pursuit of certain policies, you have to look at the context (circumstances) that led to certain things. First of all, let me clear the fact that I don\u2019t support any form of illegality. That is the point. We need to know what we are trying to do. This is an oil rich country that has consistently imported refined products into this country. We export crude oil out. There are assumptions here. How will we say we don\u2019t have the technical know-how to refine? That is why we send crude oil out or we lack the resources to do so. That is financial capital. It is very evident government has given out licences that were not utilized which means it is expensive to do or it could be an ideological reason also for saying it is cheaper to export crude oil and to import refined products. All these reasons did not allow us to have what I will call meeting the supply and demand of the country. The meaning is that there is a huge gap to be filled in economics of development. The moment there is a demand, there will be supply. It is natural. What we are having in Nigeria is a gap that allow the growth of illegal refineries but the question you have to ask yourself is in an economy that there is hopeless unemployment, is it the correct thing to actually be closing so-called refineries. The wrong impression is given you know.\n\nThat reminds me of the illicit gin of those days. They say the gin produce in sapele is raw. No, the point is this we need to produce to have more employment, we need to produce to have more to consume at home. We give the false impression that we cannot actually produce oil but we have seen from all memos that during the Biafra war, families were producing petroleum from their backyard. So the technology is there. What I expect us to do is this rather than clamping them down, it is to invite them to a meeting, take census, give them conditions and study what can be done.\n\nI think the government promised modular refineries, where are they? So we are crying in this country that we lack technical know how, we lack the capacity and we are seeing a group. Whether they like it or not am more interested in trying to know something about the quality. Is the product they are coming out with useable and how could government tax them and tap them into the economic mainstream. These are the issues I think Governor Wike and co should sit down also with the federal government and see that these people have it. Do we actually need to carry out over \u2013 regimented regulation of the sector? No! If this people really have the technology and it is as simple and they can produce, it will be better for the country to tap into it and help them improve their system, empower them if our borders were well-manned, smuggling itself will go down, the market for illegal refineries will not be there. We have to, first of all, do our home work. I know that people are burning some of their houses. They are being driven underground and I\u2019m saying the more you do this one, the more they go underground, so they become more dangerous. I don\u2019t see or encourage sabotage but I do think that they have some technology, some knowledge, you know, to sell and that the best thing is for the government to tap unto the existing technology to see what can be done to improve the sector.\n\nProfessor thank you so much for dwelling on the usefulness of bringing operators of illegal refineries together. That is harmonise, rather than destroying them or chasing them out of existence. We want to look at another issue very important in Nigeria. The youths. The number is increasing and they have challenges. The country is blessed with a lot of human resources among them are youths. As it is today, how do you perceive the Nigerian youth vis a vis the prospect of the country?\n\nWell this is a very important question. In my book the \u201cPower of Youth\u201d I try to explain why we must invest in the youth. Let\u2019s take a simple theoretical perspective of the youth. They can be defined as an idealistic human being who aspires for the best of a society and the meaning of this is that the youth can easily be bought into something that is good and could also easily rebel when what you have told them is the standard is being deviated from. Almost every protest we\u2019ve had take this nature. They are idealistic and they now express disappointment.\n\nAnother aspect is that youths can actually be always educated to be positive. In other words, we have two aspects or sides of the youth; positive side and the negative side. Negative side is when you don\u2019t give them opportunity to create or participate, to beat their own knowledge e.t.c. and the positive comes out when you create opportunities. So you find out that the easiest ways to really mobilize youths are through education, employment. Education which can\u2019t come from the family could come from the government, also the school. But you must find them employment to engage themselves because as they say the idle man is the devil\u2019s workshop. The youths also need empowerment in the direction the society wants to go.\n\nThis means creating opportunities. Take for instance, government can\u2019t do it alone. We do know that. Look at Nollywood, opportunities it has created for young people. So if government can even, in each of the states, build three or four stadia for people to learn how to play tennis, golf, cricket and engage in other sports it is already empowering them. So coming back now, what I\u2019m trying to say is that unless there\u2019s a deliberate policy to improve the youth in nation-building activities in a very creative way, many of them will be doomed.\n\nOkay now, the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) is a very good example of what you can do with young people and how best to utilize young people. They are there serving under the sun and in the rain also because they have been made to behave that way. They see the benefit towards it.\n\nSo in 2022, we are looking at 2023 facing the role of young people in election most especially, members of NYSC who go to serve as officials during elections. Many have been recruited as thugs. Many recruited for bad purposes by the elite. So the first thing is to focus on each party to ensure that in 2022 the mind of the youths should be addressed to play more positive roles. They should be addressed to support the party they feel will win. What even stops the youths supporting one party heavily in order to secure some positions within that party and see if and when the candidate wins, the candidate will be friendly with youth-beneficial programs.\n\nI\u2019m trying to say that the zoning system I mentioned before, if the youth can be made to see the benefit of it, if the youth can made to see that democracy pays also if the youth are made to participate in campaign against corruption during election and development program that can make society grow like promotion of positive value and discipline in the society, it will be better off.\n\nThere is no doubt at all government must be ready to spend or to invest much more in the youth than they are presently doing and you cannot ask somebody that is hungry to go to the moon when there is nothing on ground. If you don\u2019t provide employment, for example, the temptation of the youth falling for anything available is very, very high. They can be recruited into banditry, terrorism, fraud because at that particular time what is available to them is better than what they have which becomes more attractive and if you have bothered to know what happens in terrorist camp you will know that they spend so much money in trying to win their heart.\n\nIt takes real ideological conviction or faithful belief when you go throw a missile and die that there\u2019s heaven waiting for you, which is a kind of brain-washing. I\u2019m not saying that the Nigerian youth should be so brainwashed, I\u2019m saying if you give employment to the Nigerian youth and proper empowerment to do certain things like we are talking about illegal refineries, you call them together and give proper supervision to the youth. If done, this year they will be better even in 2023 especially during the conduct of the general election.\n\nSir, we have to digress a little from the issues of youths to the intervention of state in the economic process of the Nigerian state. What do you have to say about it?\n\nNigeria, in my view, is a victim of wrong ideological position. You see, the state during Obasanjo\u2019s administration, people will tell you the government has no business with the states, marketing. The government investment in business failed all over. It lost a foundation.\n\nThe state was formed for two primary purpose. Firstly, to give you protection. Secondly, security of life and property, then to create an atmosphere for you to realize your objective in life in terms of welfare. Now when you take it from that position you find out that the state, even from the beginning, was supposed to sit people down to say okay let\u2019s surrender these powers to one strong person that will ensure that they will be free trade, security and others.\n\nAlso, let somebody tell me the state that has developed in this world without government intervention. America is a very good model because it sat down and say look we want to form a country and if you look at the first hundred years of America, even till this moment, America government laid the foundation of railway, telecommunication, city-building and others. So now, the meaning of this is that if there is infrastructure, you just have to make sure that this is a community. There is water, there is electricity, there are good roads and when these are already done, individuals can come and tap into this and ensure the development of that community.\n\nWe cannot in a way run state determination. However, what happened was that around the 1970s, because the argument of whether the state should intervene or not was there when Adams Smith said the wealth of nation is dependent on the free trade across borders. He was projecting an ideological position and if you look at the literature of that period too you will find people who opposed to Adams Smith\u2019s thesis saying that it was wrong and that the state has a role to play and you cannot afford open all your borders to free trade. We see it today. America still controls its borders. Now in the 1970\u2019s, especially Margaret Thatcher in England stated that her father has always been a conservative all her life. She had groceries, her economic outlook contrilled by a private person she never ever liked, so she came up with the idea that it\u2019s very wrong for the economic activities to be in government hand and that government is too inefficient. Now Reagan came up in America supported the idea of free trade and they were able to buy the press and use the western press to support the idea that free market-base approach is really worth it.\n\nTake Nigeria, where are the private men the rich men? Count them they are there and even the rich private men, they got the money from the government in the first instance. So we really have not got the capital base to say we should do our things ourselves at this level. When government gave licenses for, at least, I think 11 and later 20 refineries, did Nigeria have the capital to establish? No they didn\u2019t and those licenses were there so we have to have the capital.\n\nSecondly, historically, when you tell the state not to participate, who will do the infrastructure development that bring, about other development. Thirdly, if you take the census of private people who had invested and loss compare it to the government own is inconsequential. Everyday people invest and loose their own capital. They are not told not to invest again, or why not sit down say why did government firms fail in Nigeria. I have personally looked at it I found out that the reason is politics you set up a multi-million or multi-billion naira enterprise instead of you to go out to look for the best hand whether it\u2019s in Jerusalem to help you run it you say no it must be an Esan man that Esan man doesn\u2019t have it, or it must be a Kanuri person who doesn\u2019t have it, no thinking of competence or about the investment being made. It doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\nThe person has to know it. That\u2019s why me, I\u2019m very crazy about capacity- building. If you don\u2019t have it you don\u2019t have it. Okay take a pen write with your left hand if you will be able to write with it. You won\u2019t be able but the person who can will take the pen and write with the left hand. Capacity building is there. That was the secret of Awolowo, that\u2019s the secret of America, that\u2019s the secret of China.\n\nWhat are we talking about here. We had a kind of ideological mis-step especially in the 1980\u2019s when Babaginda came into power. He started experimenting market economy, it just didn\u2019t work out so why don\u2019t we have the courage. When this administration came, I wrote. Then Obey Ezekwesili suggested government shouldn\u2019t set up a national airways I said government should set it up even if that can give job to three people alone, it is enough but we will keep on developing ourselves. Eight years almost gone. We\u2019ve not been able to establish one whereas nothing stops a local government from investing or having a small refinery or from conquering the bush and making a huge agricultural land and engage competent youths to work.\n\nThe train has come now. What stop the state government from constructing a railway from Benin City to Uromi, Benin City to warri, Benin City to Asaba then you see the ease of movement of goods and services. We have killed the best instrument or regulated the instrument we had in development by saying the state has no role to play. The state\u2019s major role is development. It has a duty to lead development. This doesn\u2019t mean that it should not allow private sector.\n\nThe China that is developed today there are companies that are government- owned operated under the private sector skills. Take one Kobo in China and see if you will not be executed, you will! For financial crimes they send messages to your family for you to commit suicide and if you fail they execute you.\n\nThese are issues we should really think about, what should we do and this is the message whether the federal or state government, it must be prepared to invest in the infrastructure development of this country and as much as possible in areas they think are critical to economic survival and development of this country, that\u2019s number one.\n\nTwo, we need a system where the economy is free and open to both the private sector and the government, in other words, to all that are willing and capable without any hindrance. In other words, if Mr. A is capable of going into this office let him do it, if the government has the capability let it go and do it. Absence of such arrangements or understanding is what is killing the economy.\n\nThree, development should be seeing as a deliberate act to enhance the wealth of an individual and the community he lives. So if my community is so far away and there is no lucky person that is rich, my community should be develop, the local government should ensure development. We can\u2019t fold the hands of the state government and expect development to come.\n\nThe private sector all over the world has no business other than trying to make profit for itself. In economics, when you teach you say they create value. What value are they creating. Value that enhances their personality. That is why America talks about individualism which is about you having a right to produce and get the whole world to yourself. Throw it back to the ocean it doesn\u2019t matter anymore because it\u2019s your own. We are now saying yes you can create all these things let the state also create it\u2019s own. If you like, you may decide to throw this away whereas the state will like its own production given to the human being.\n\nSo what I\u2019m trying to say by my constant preaching on state intervention is that the state should wake up to its responsibility, first and foremost, in protecting people and producing condition for them to develop. You don\u2019t run away from your responsibility under the pretense of one ideological reasoning. So when you say the state shouldn\u2019t, they are all deceiving themselves. We are saying time has come if we say, vote you for a position, if you know unemployment of 20% this year you should allow it go down to 5% and you can\u2019t do anything without investing in the country. So the truth is that the state has a responsibility.\n\nLong before the internet do you know how much America invested in the development of internet. So what it means is the state must not go to sleep with the pretense that it has no business. That idea is just the imagination of some people in Europe who have no idea on how societies in Africa are run. True, we are so poor that the real instrument we have is the state. Yet the government is to bring about the centre of activities and raise money to carry out projects. We need to sit down and look for competent hands, the right hand. There\u2019s nothing stopping the government from investing. For instance, what is it doing in NNPC, is it not a public establishment, why are they carrying our mineral exploration? So government should be asked to do the needful for us.\n\nYou have exhaustively dealt with the issue of state intervention. Lastly sir, we also want you to give a piece or two advice to the Edo state government in its effort to redefine governance and introduce reforms into the state civil service?\n\nI will say this one without any bias. Every person knows me and my development approach of Obaseki. This explains why I wrote and supported him during the election. One thing visible you can\u2019t take from him is that he has a kind of architectural taste, the new buildings. Like the John Odigie Oyegun Civil Service Academy building, it\u2019s a very beautiful piece of work. But then as for the reforms in the civil service, we need to be very careful when we are talking about reforms. What I think we need is general agenda where people say, okay thirty years time, non of us will be around but we know an agenda has been set towards which every person will be walking to and the reform that I will want is a reform that is based on capacity-building that will be about the skills of the civil and public servant to enable him deliver.\n\nTwo, to actually create a sense of pride. What I want call \u2018ideological orientation\u2019 of the average Edolite such that they see themselves as belonging to the same entity. I remember in the days of Bendel, we were Bendelites, There was that pride whether you are in Warri, Asaba. When it comes to sport we were always winning, so we need to create that sense of pride and loyalty to Edo state by it\u2019s citizens.\n\nThen three, the environment of work needs to be made conducive you know because, why I\u2019m always suspicious of reform is that it is always a disguise way of down-sizing. We may down-size the houses but it has many implications. It could create disaffection within the family, it could make sure that people, who hitherto were supportive, are alienated and it could lead to no result, no gainful result. If you enhance the environment in which an individual works, you enhance his skills, knowledge, competence and you promote his sense of fulfillment in terms of pride and belonging.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that for me, the little I have seen, I like his development approach, his strategies that try to reach every corners of the state but this reform is easy, it easier to say reform than to actually get the benefit of reform for a number of reasons; cultural resistance, lack of funds to do the right thing, lack of the vision and ability to carry out or drive it. These are issues but result can be achieved, like I said, through capacity-building (training the individual.).\n\nWhen we can now train dog to catch thief, to catch criminals then you can think of what human beings can do if given decent training, training is it, Like I usually say if you don\u2019t know how to write with your left hand you have to be trained on how to write with your left, if you are right hand person that is my basic example. So you have to train.\n\nThen the condition in which you work if it is not conducive you can\u2019t produce any change. The tools to work are very, very critical. If the tools are not there you cannot perform magic. This is the thing. Then, my advice infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure. the aim should be that each community in Edo-State should have at least water, should have electricity, should have roads. How this is going to be done is a subject for another day. If he consults me I will tell him what should be done because that\u2019s my area of interest, I wish the state luck and a prosperous 2022.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nTHE stage is gradually set for the ultimate senatorial slot for 2023 general election as Ehia Olu Akhabue stages pragmatic stake for Edo Central Senatorial District.\n\nThe uniqueness of his ideas for equitable representation, his seminal thoughts on prodigious community development, his forthrightnesss in articulation of our collective aspiration and the tellingly magnificent road map for actualising it is more than enough to endear the humane people of Esanland to his vision.\n\nHis experiences, spanning over two decades in management of human and industries, home and abroad signposted him as the \u2018primus inter pares\u2019 and clearly a shining star in the political wilderness of the Nigerian State.\n\nInterestingly, history has been magnanimous with the Esan people, having endowed them with the best and brightest as demonstrated by the likes of Chief Anthony Enahoro, Ambrose Alli, Chief Tony Anenih, Christopher Abebe, Comrade Elijah Okougbo of blessed memory and many more.\n\nWithout a doubt, his senatorial aspiration has changed the dynamics of the political superstructure of Edo Central Senatorial District where in recent past, our sons and daughters have been hoisting themselves up for political offices without integrity, required principles and solid agenda for viable and enduring community development.\n\nFor Akhabue, he has resolved to pursue and prosecute the objectives contained in his evergreen Manifesto of Service which is critically built on four fundamental pillars, namely; provision of Water Supply In Edo Central Senatorial District, Formidable Security Architecture to meet the challenges posed by criminal elements, Investment in manpower development/Skills Acquisition, lastly, linking Rural Communities to Urban Centres thereby promoting rural \u2013 urban Integration.\n\nMany of the rural communities in Edo Central have no good roads, infact, they are such in a terrible state of disrepair that farmers face serious difficulties in getting their produce out of the communities to market places in urban areas. The implication of this is that the communities are almost cut off from cities. Akhabue\u2019s mission in the Senate is clear on this, which includes but not limited to ensuring that many roads across Esanland are rehabilitated and reconstructed with the allocations for the constituency projects across board.\n\nIn the past, part of the drawbacks have been that meagre resources allocated for projects are not equitably and fairly distributed in all the five local government areas and this has somewhat created apathy and mistrust between the electorate and the politicians. That is part of what Engr Akhabue is out to restructure to the utmost benefits of everyone in Esanland. Once that is done, in addition to the water project, the people would have achieved a reasonable level of rural \u2013 urban fusion.\n\nInterestingly, Engr Akhabue thorough study of every inch of Esanland has laid bare the factors militating against rural growth and peace and stability as there can\u2019t be peace in the midst of chaos and poverty.

          "text": "In what has been termed a major push for breaking the gender bias in Nigeria, leading financial institution, Fidelity Bank Plc, in partnership with media entrepreneur-Linda Ikeji- celebrated the 2022 International Women\u2019s Day (IWD) with an impressive networking event specifically for women to inspire one another, discuss pertinent challenges they face as well as proffer solutions on breaking the gender biases prevalent in the country.\n\nThe high-profile event, held at the Civic Centre, Lagos on Tuesday, 8 March 2022, featured several notable personalities including former World Bank Vice President and keynote speaker at the event, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili; billionaire businesswoman and philanthropist, Apostle Folorunso Alakija; MD/CEO, Practoil Ltd, Hajia Bola Shagaya; award-winning author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; Iya Oge of Lagos, Opral Benson; Country Director, Empretec Nigeria Foundation, Onari Duke; Executive Vice Chairman, H. Pierson, Eileen Shaiyen; oil magnate and lawyer, Mrs. Uju Ifejika; seasoned actress and journalist, Dame Taiwo Ajayi-Lycett; Former Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Senator Florence Ita-Giwa; Fashion and Style Connoisseur, Nkiru Anumudu; amongst a host of eminent ladies from across the country.\n\nAside from celebrating Nigerian women\u2019s achievements in various industries and drawing attention to the issue of gender inequality, the event also served as a platform for the Bank to officially launch HerFidelity, its niche proposition for female customers. The proposition boasts of exciting features such as capacity development initiatives, access to finance, recognition and networking events, health and wellness programmes, etc, all designed to speak to the yearnings of women.\n\nWelcoming guests to the event, the chief host and Managing Director/CEO, Fidelity Bank Plc, Mrs. Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe said, \u201cDespite the challenges women face, we continue to play a significant role in driving the economic, social and cultural development of our communities. Indeed, a recent PwC Nigeria report indicated that 41 percent of micro-businesses in Nigeria are run by women, with over 23 million female entrepreneurs operating in this segment. This exemplifies not only our drive as women but the immense value we bring to the table. Just imagine what we could achieve if the girl child is given the opportunity she deserves, encouraged to go to school and is judged by her competence and not by her complements! The possibilities are endless.\u201d\n\nDuring the very engaging evening, Mrs. Onyeali-Ikpe made several Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) donations to women-led businesses on behalf of the bank, further demonstrating the bank\u2019s unwavering commitment towards improving the well-being of women across the country. Speaking on the donations, she said, \u201cOne of the pillars of HerFidelity is Capacity Building. Therefore we are sponsoring five female-led enterprises today with a total sum of 5 million naira for training female apprentices.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we are supporting Dream Catchers Academy for Girls\u2014a free educational and performing arts academy for orphaned and underserved girls\u2014 with the sum of 10 million naira for an IT centre at the academy as well as one year of coding training for the girls. We believe this will go a long way to assist the young ladies who need a helping hand while enhancing their knowledge in the areas of technology.\u201d\n\nIn her keynote speech, Dr. Ezekwesili, highlighted the importance of joining forces to fight gender discrimination and inequality ravaging the country, emphasising that, \u201cThe power of collaboration and cooperation is key as implicit bias is not something you can fight alone. It requires a coalition effort. You must build your own coalition. At every point in life, a woman must understand that she will face a major challenge because of the conditioning that society has given to itself. Therefore, build coalitions. We have the numbers and we must let the numbers work for us.\u201d\n\nShe also encouraged forward-thinking organisations to be deliberate about gathering relevant baseline data and eliminating barriers to the career growth of women.\n\nFidelity Bank is a full-fledged commercial bank operating in Nigeria with about six million customers who are serviced across its 250 business offices and digital banking channels. In 2021, the bank was recognised as the \u201cFastest Growing Bank\u201d and \u201cMSME & Entrepreneurship Financing Bank of the Year\u201d at the 2021 BusinessDay Banks and Other Financial Institutions (BAFI) Awards\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

He added that in addition to core real estate development, the company is also engaged in facility management, construction and infrastructure development and it is manned by an innovative and creative team with combined experience spanning more than four decades.\n\nHe said The Oak Capital is a venture capital firm with a bias for supporting underserved start-up founders creating lasting solutions to problems in the African continent by leveraging the use of technology to promote growth of their businesses.\n\nAccording to the Founder, The Oak Capital seeks to back audacious, young entrepreneurs who are solving critical problems across different sectors in Africa, by providing pre-seed and seed stage funding.\n\nCiting statistics from the Credit Bureau Association of Nigeria, Olusanya said limited funding remains a critical bottleneck to the growth of small businesses in Nigeria, as only about four percent have access to credit.\n\nHe remarked that while there has been significant funding for start-ups from foreign venture capital firms, such is concentrated on elite founders and at much later stages, a development which make most indigent young founders struggle to raise funding at very early stage of their businesses.\n\nHe said the venture capital is established to make outstanding investment deals in sub-Saharan Africa as it is sector agnostic but with bias for businesses driving technological innovations, financial inclusion, improve health care services and enable food security.\n\nHe added that the Oak Asset Management Limited provides fund management and portfolio advisory services to a wide range of clientele. The company analyses risks and estimates investment gains before making investment decisions in a bid to ensure that its strategy deliver maximum investment returns to its investors, he said.\n\nThe digital bank is an economic driver and a vehicle of economic empowerment which enables the company to \u201cprovide the wings for its clients to fly,\u201d he said.\n\nOlusanya observed that with access to credit being a major deficiency for SMEs, the Oak Digital Bank proposes value to its clients with strong inclination to have zero deficiencies.\n\nHe added that the bank is set up as a digital bank to support its businesses entities and will run a lean and efficient model while leveraging non-traditional systems and methods such as mobile App, Web and digital kiosks.\n\nFormer Group Managing Director and CEO of First Bank Nigeria Plc, Mr. Bisi Onasanya, who graced the launching, among other dignitaries, advised the board and management of Oak Holdings to create financial advisory services department to relate with customers with a mindset of guiding the needs of its clientele. He urged those who graced the launching to endeavour to do business with the group in the future.\n\nBesides Olusanya, the group management team include: Eng.

          "text": "By Adebayo Obajemu\n\nAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, former Lagos State governor and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), is again in the news, and as always, the idea is to paint him in negative light; even for offences committed by others.\n\nThere is always a tendency by Tinubu haters, and they are legion to make him bear vicariously the sins of others. This is about politics, politics of chicanery and hatred.\n\nYesterday, the National Union of Road Transport Workers allegedly suspended its Lagos State chapter\u2019s Chairman, Musiliu Akinsanya, aka MC Oluomo, indefinitely.\n\nBy a strange mix of deft political mischief and callous anti -Tinubu sentiment, his name is now reverberating currently in the social media as protector of MC Oluomo, and one that provides him with cover and protection from facing the consequences of his actions.\n\nTinubu on his part should publicly come out to distance himself from such unhelpful association with non political actors with credibility baggage as seen in Oluomo. If he fails to do that it will surely affect his electoral fortune. Social media is awash with this kind of thinking that Jagaban of Borgu is in bed with Oluomo, and that his presidency will be to foist gangsterism and thuggery to soil political culture. This is an uncanny remark that Tinubu needs to distance himself from for the sake of his political ambition and reputation.\n\nAccording to the National Public Relations Officer of the union, Chukwudi Asogwa, Oluomo is under suspension. Confirming the suspension to Punch, Asogwa said:\n\n\u201cYes, it is true. The letter you saw in circulation is from the national headquarters,\u201d he said.\n\nThe suspension letter was signed by NURTW\u2019s General Secretary, Kabiru Yau, and dated March 9th, 2022.\n\nIn the letter, the union leader was suspended over alleged misconduct, insubordination, and inciting members of the state chapter against its national body.\n\nFollowing this development, the NURTW directed Akinsanya to hand over to his deputy chairman and release all property belonging to the union in his possession.\n\nThe letter read, \u201cThis is to convey to you that in line with Article 42 section 5, subsection I, II, III, IV, V, and VIII of the union\u2019s constitution, you have been placed on indefinite suspension from office as State Chairman of Lagos State Council of National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) with effect from March 9th, 2021.\n\n\u201cYour suspension is sequel to sustained acts of insubordination and gross misconduct coupled with your clandestine plans to instigate crisis and unleash mayhem on any branch or branches of the union in Lagos state that refuses to obey your order or instructions not to accept directives from the national headquarters of the Union.\n\n\u201cYour orchestrated plan to attack branches that may disobey your orders aforesaid will ultimately endanger public peace and order in Lagos state. It is also very likely to threaten and/or affect the lives and property of the peace-loving people of Lagos state, particularly those doing their legitimate businesses within motor parks, hence the urgent need to take drastic actions against him.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that you were earlier issued with queries on 25th of February 2022 and 3rd of March, 2022 respectively in which you were directed to explain the circumstances surrounding your untoward actions and to also show cause why disciplinary actions should not be taken against you for such acts of insubordination. You bluntly neglected/refuse to respond to the second query, while your response to the first query was unsatisfactory.\n\n\u201cIn view of your suspension, you are hereby directed to hand over the mantle of leadership of the Lagos State Council to the State Deputy Chairman and also surrender all Union properties in your possession to the State Secretary of the Union .\n\nAlready, there is high level of anxiety and apprehension in Lagos over possible outcome of this apprehension.\n\nThe general uncertainty is justified given that such development can turn a tinderbox that can set the peace of Lagos on fire, if not we\u2019ll handled.\n\nOluomo is said to have advised Babajide Sanwoolu to disband the union and set up a caretaker committee to run the affairs of the union. If it is true that will sound preposterous and smacks of blatant ignorance.The suspension letter was from National Body of the union, so what leverage is Sanwoolu\u2019s in the crisis other than to maintain law and order and ensure that the peace of Lagos is maintained in synergy with the law enforcement.\n\nStrangely enough, Thursday night, Gbenga Omotosho, Lagos commissioner of information announced the disbanding of the union in Lagos, adding that they have been barred from operating in the motor parks .\n\nEarlier, Oluomo said he is pulling out Lagos branch of the national body.\n\nThe action of Lagos State would seem to have given credence to hushed talks in some circles that Sanwoolu may be out to act the script of the Oluomo.\n\nWhat the Lagos ought to have done was to uphold the decision of the national body by prevailing on Oluomo to handover to his deputy as directed by the national headquarters of the union.\n\nThe action of the Lagos State government raises the stakes of suspicion, and seems to reinforce the feeling that the government is in cahoots with Oluomo. To erase doubts, the government needs to restore confidence by affirming the decision of the national headquarters.\n\nLagos State should know that no individual is bigger than the need for peace and order, and government does not exist for the furtherance of the interest of an individual but for public good.\n\nThe suspended Chairman according to rumours making the rounds is said to be boasting that he can not be suspended ,adding that he has the backing of Tinubu to do whatever he so wishes.\n\nJagaban has made his name and reputation as consummate politician with wide contact and amazing influence that is yet to be surpassed in modern Nigerian history.\n\nHe has remained one of the main issues in the political evolution of the country in the last two decades, and it would be a great tragedy for anyone, whether Oluomo or somebody\u2019s else to name-drop Tinubu\u2019s name for malevolent activities that can disturb public peace.\n\nTinubu, should, for the sake of his name, his place in our sociopolitical evolution and his current desire to run for president distance himself from such pedestrian issues as having to buoy up an individual who has refused to abide by the decision of his superiors, in this case, the national headquarters of the road transport workers, NURTW.\n\nTinubu is quite far more experienced as to allow himself to be dragged into what ordinarily should pass for routine disciplinary measures against errant state chairman who has refused to abide by the decision of the national headquarters all in the name of having a political heavyweight as backer, even when he has run foul of the law.\n\nAs chairman , etiquette and decency demanded that he respected the decision of the national body with respect to allowing the state chairman of the Tricycles Riders Association, Alhaji Istijabah to run the affairs of the Tricycles union, but he would have none of this, and reportedly has been encroaching on the duty, role and functions of Alhaji Abiola Istijabah, a man widely described as a peace- loving gentleman.\n\nNow, there\u2019s much apprehension in Lagos over a possible breakdown of law and order as a result of the suspension.\n\nPolice officers have moved to strategic areas believed to be prone to violence in Lagos.\n\nThe Lagos governor, Babajide Sanwoolu is a gentleman, and definitely would not want his state to be thrown into another round of violence when it has barely recovered from #Endsars protest.\n\nTinubu as he works all the processes to actualise his presidential ambition should not in anyway allow the little matter of Oluomo\u2019s suspension to affect his reputation. He should not provide political enemies enough ammunition to begin to shoot at him , enough is enough.\n\nThe case is straight forward. Alhaji Abiola Istijabah, the current chairman recognized by the national body as chairman of Tricycles association should be allowed to carry out his duty, while whoever is in charge as state chairman of NURTW should be in his own turf and forte, period!\n\nThe sad icing of the cake is that\n\nLagos State government Thursday night said it has suspended the National Union of Road Transport Workers Union (NURTW) from operating at motor parks and garages in the state.\n\nThe announcement came after the national leadership of the union earlier on Thursday suspended the chairman of the Lagos State chapter, Musiliu Akinsanya.\n\nAkinsanya, blaming the NURTW national leadership for the protracted crisis in the state chapter, said at a press conference later in the day that he and the state chapter had pulled out of the national union.\n\n\u201cAfter considering the provisions of the law, the Government hereby suspends the activities of NURTW, which must cease to operate in all parks and garages in Lagos State,\u201d Commissioner for information, Gbenga Omotoso, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Government will set up a committee to immediately take control of the parks and garages. Members of the committee will be key stakeholders in the sector.\u201d\n\nOmotoso said the suspension of NURTW from parks and garages in the state was necessary to ensure the safety of lives and property of all Lagosians and visitors.\n\nMembers of the union are notorious for employing deadly violence to settle scores, and sometimes, to effect leadership change.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to douse the unnecessary tension generated by the leadership tussle in the NURTW and protect the citizenry from the likely fallout of the situation,\u201d Omotoso said.\n\nSanwoolu\u2019s government should have earlier prevailed on Oluomo to allow Alhaji Abiola Istijabah to operate unfettered as chairman of Tricycles association in the state as directed by national headquarters. This refusal to allow Istijabah to operate is the genesis of the crisis.\n\nWhat the governor should do is to reach a lasting settlement between Alhaji Baruwa, National President of NURTW and Oluomo with the underhand deal being to give Alhaji Istijabah free hand to operate in Lagos.\n\nThe rumours making the rounds that Sanwoolu is bent on acting Oluomo\u2019s script on the ground that he needs him to win reelection is unfortunate and unhelpful. The governor should rise above this primordial sentiment and act by reinforcing the decision of the national headquarters of the union.\n\nThe era of using area boys or motor parks boys to win election is over, 2023 is going to shock many a pundit.",
          "summary": "There is always a tendency by Tinubu haters, and they are legion to make him bear vicariously the sins of others.\nYesterday, the National Union of Road Transport Workers allegedly suspended its Lagos State chapter\u2019s Chairman, Musiliu Akinsanya, aka MC Oluomo, indefinitely.\nThis is an uncanny remark that Tinubu needs to distance himself from for the sake of his political ambition and reputation.\n\u201cYour orchestrated plan to attack branches that may disobey your orders aforesaid will ultimately endanger public peace and order in Lagos state.\nThe announcement came after the national leadership of the union earlier on Thursday suspended the chairman of the Lagos State chapter, Musiliu Akinsanya.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Patriotic Quest (NPQ) has said the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor Godwin Emefiele is qualified to contest for the presidency in 2023, adding that attempts to intimidate him out of the race won\u2019t work.\n\nCo-ordinator of NPQ, Ahmed Ja\u2019Usman Tijani, in a statement, said nobody has the right to denigrate their democratic privilege to support any person or candidate of their choice, especially as Emefiele, by all standards, is very qualified for the position.\n\nHe said \u201cThis statement is in response to the upsurge of negative articles in the media with the intention of discouraging our candidate and demonising his supporters. Most of these contributions are an amalgam of baseless insinuations and innuendos against Godwin Emefiele.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, for the further enlightenment of the naysayers, that is, if they have not been blinkered by their biases against our candidate; the upswell of support for Emefiele are borne out of his solid achievements in his previous professional engagements and also as the CBN Governor.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe added that never in the history of central banking in Nigeria has a CBN governor frontally taken on the various challenges of the Nigerian economy: cutting across agriculture, industries, forex management, monetary policies, fighting the COVID 19 pandemic etcetera.\n\n\u201cIn the area of boosting food security, we witnessed well thought out policies aimed at increasing access to funding by the generality of our farmers, who hitherto were locked out from the major financial institutions.\n\n\u201cThe flagship of these policies is the Anchor Borrowers Programme, which has noticeably boosted local output in rice, sugar, wheat, cotton, cassava, maize etcetera, and helped in conserving our scarce foreign exchange.\n\n\u201cIn the area of employment generation, the investments in agriculture and industries have heavily impacted opportunities for direct and indirect employment within the economy running into millions of jobs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe economic importance of these interventions are further highlighted by the sub 10% interest rates charged across board, coupled with requisite moratoria on repayments.\n\n\u201cUnder Godwin Emefiele, despite the diverse unforseen economic shocks that bedeviled the economy: ranging from the drastic drop in the price of crude oil for years, the Covid 19 pandemic and consequent economic lockdown; the CBN deftly managed the nation\u2019s balance of payments, boosted forex inflows and exponentially increased the forex reserves overtime with various incentives to encourage diaspora and export proceed remittances.\n\n\u201cThese are the qualities that have inspired a large number of people and organisations to selflessly deploy their own resources in advocating for the candidacy of Emefiele as a suitable presidential candidate come 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cWe believe that at this time of great economic challenges in the life of our nation, there is no better candidate than Emefiele, to steer the economic ship of this nation to calmer waters. He has seen it all and battled with very intimidating economic hurdles in the past seven years or so, with outstanding equanimity and desterity.\n\n\u201cInspite of these qualities and achievements, some analysts in the media are fixated with justifying why Emefiele should not run.\n\nWhat are they afraid of? Or could it be a case of the hand of Esau and the voice of Jacob? Only time will tell.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhy should they cherry pick who to run down amongst the gamut of potential/declared presidential candidates parading the national space today?\n\nThe illogical arguments against the candidacy of Godwin Emefiele has reinvigorated our campaign for him to be part of the answer to the presidential question come 2023.\n\nIn order to give their postulations some semblance of objectivity and authority, some of the writers sometimes claim that their findings are based on \u201cenquiries in government and banking circles.\u201d\n\nThese claims are mostly unsubstantiated and, we dare say, products of their fertile imaginations.\n\nUntil those who have the advantage of access to organs of mass communication respect the wishes and desires of ordinary Nigerians, then the Nigeria of our dreams may become more difficult or impossible to attain.\n\nSome contributors try to be clever by half by highlighting some of Emefiele\u2019s indisputable achievements, possibly as a way of hoodwinking the unwary.",

          "title": "Biden announces new crushing sanctions on Putin's Russia",
          "text": "President Joe Biden opened a new attack on Russia\u2019s economy on Friday over its invasion of Ukraine, joining with allies to hit Moscow on trade and shut down development funds.\n\nHe also announced a ban on imports of Russian seafood, vodka and diamonds.\n\nBiden, locked in a test of wills with Russian President Vladimir Putin, said the moves collectively will deliver \u201canother crushing blow\u201d to Russia\u2019s economy, already weighed down by global sanctions that have cratered the rouble and forced the stock market to close.\n\n\u201cPutin is an aggressor. Putin is the aggressor. And Putin must pay a price,\u201d Biden said at the White House, noting he had earlier spoken by phone to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nBut Biden criticised voices in the United States clamouring for an active U.S. military presence in Ukraine or U.S. backing of a \u201cno-fly zone\u201d to protect Ukrainians from the Russian onslaught.\n\n\u201cThe idea that we\u2019re gonna send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with America pilots and American crews \u2026that\u2019s called World War III, OK? Let\u2019s get it straight here, guys,\u201d he told Democrats in Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cWe will defend every inch of NATO territory, every single inch,\u201d including NATO members bordering Russia, Biden said,\n\n\u201cGranted, if we respond it is World War III, but we have a sacred obligation on NATO territory \u2026 although we will not fight the Third World War in Ukraine,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the White House, Biden joined fellow Group of Seven leaders in calling for revoking Russia\u2019s \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d trade status, which would allow G7 nations to increase tariffs and set quotas on Russian products.\n\nThe U.S. Congress would need to pass legislation to revoke the trade status, and lawmakers recently have been moving in that direction.\n\n\u201cWe remain resolved to isolate Russia further from our economies and the international financial system,\u201d the G7 said in a statement.\n\nTrade made up about 46% of Russia\u2019s economy in 2020, much of that with China or linked to energy exports that European nations depend on for heat and electricity, making it unclear how deeply these moves will impact Russia\u2019s economy.\n\nBiden also banned the U.S. import of Russian vodka, seafood and diamonds.\n\nHe warned that Russia would pay a \u201csevere price\u201d should it use chemical weapons against Ukraine. The United States has expressed fears that Russia could be paving the way for a chemical weapons attack, without citing evidence.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Andrew Bates told reporters on Air Force One that if Russia is targeting civilians in Ukraine \u201cthat would be a war crime.\u201d\n\nRussia calls its actions in Ukraine a \u201cspecial operation.\u201d\n\nBiden said the United States would add new names to a list of Russian oligarchs who are sanctioned, and ban the export of luxury goods to Russia.\n\nIn a separate statement, the White House said Biden would ban U.S. investment in Russia beyond the energy sector, and that G7 nations would move to block Russia from funds from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.\n\n\u201cThose are the latest steps we\u2019re taking but they\u2019re not the last steps we\u2019re taking.\u201d Biden said.\n\nThe coordinated moves by Washington, London and other allies come on top of a host of unprecedented sanctions, export controls and banking restrictions aimed at pressuring Putin to end the largest war in Europe since World War Two.\n\nThe moves have already caused the Russian economy to collapse, and the IMF is now predicting that it will plunge into a \u201cdeep recession\u201d this year.\n\nOn Thursday, Moscow banned the export of telecom, medical, auto, agricultural, electrical and tech equipment, as well as some forestry products, in retaliation.\n\nThe United States is expanding sanctions on Russia to include executives of sanctioned banks and Russian banker Yuri Kovalchuk, as well as Russian lawmakers.\n\n\u201cRussia cannot grossly violate international law and expect to benefit from being part of the international economic order,\u201d the White House said in a statement.\n\nU.S. Trade with Russia\n\nStripping Russia of its favoured nation status paves the way for the United States and its allies to impose tariffs on a wide range of Russian goods.\n\nRussia is among the world\u2019s top exporters of oil, natural gas, copper, aluminum, palladium and other important commodities, and accounted for 1.9% of global trade in 2020. China is its biggest export destination. read more\n\nIn the United States, removing Russia\u2019s \u201cPermanent Normal Trade Relations\u201d status will require an act of Congress, but lawmakers in both houses \u2013 and on both sides of the political aisle \u2013 have already signaled their support.\n\nThe White House will work with lawmakers on legislation to revoke Russia\u2019s status, administration sources said.\n\nIn 2019, Russia was the 26th largest goods trading partner of the United States, with some $28 billion exchanged between the two countries, according to the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office.\n\nThe ban of U.S. luxury exports to Russia and Belarus \u2014 including high-end watches, vehicles, clothes, alcohol and jewelry \u2014 takes effect immediately on Friday, the Commerce Department said in a separate statement as part of the effort to further isolate Moscow and its allies.\n\nThe United States imported $1.2 billion in Russian fish and shellfish in 2021, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, including sturgeon black caviar.\n\nAmerica that year also imported from Russia $275 million worth of diamonds, and about $21 million in alcoholic beverages, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nTop U.S. imports from Russia included mineral fuels, precious metal and stone, iron and steel, fertilizers and inorganic chemicals, all goods that could face higher tariffs once Congress acts to revoke Russia\u2019s favoured nation trade status.\n\n*Reuters via NAN",

          "text": "Chile has sworn in its youngest-ever president, Gabriel Boric, a former student activist who will take the reins as the South American nation is undergoing an important political and social transition.\n\nAt the Congress building in the port city of Valparaiso, Boric on Friday took the presidential sash from outgoing billionaire President Sebastian Pinera. \u201cBefore the Chilean people, I make my pledge,\u201d he said.\n\nBoric, 36, is taking over a country seeking change following mass 2019 protests, which he supported, against deep-rooted inequality in income, healthcare, education and pensions.\n\nHis administration will oversee a referendum on a new Chilean constitution, which an elected, constituent assembly is currently rewriting to replace the Magna Carta put in place by Augusto Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here is really an historic shift, a real sign of the changing times in this country,\u201d Al Jazeera\u2019s Latin America editor Lucia Newman reported from outside the Senate building in Valparaiso.\n\n\u201c[Boric] is now heading a feminist, environmentalist government that\u2019s going to try to bring about historic social change, led by a cabinet that is mostly full of young people who don\u2019t have much experience in government, but that certainly have big plans for this country,\u201d Newman said.\n\nPinochet removed socialist President Salvador Allende, who died by suicide in 1973 during a military coup and whose legacy Boric has often praised.\n\n\u201cHe reminds me of Allende, but I hope it has a happier ending,\u201d Marigen Vargas, 62, who travelled all night to be at Boric\u2019s inauguration, told the Reuters news agency. \u201cWe want a more united, happier Chile.\u201d\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nBoric faces a raft of challenges from an economic slowdown, high inflation and a split legislature that will test his deal-making abilities to push through reforms in healthcare and pensions, while toughening environmental regulation.\n\nCarlos Ruiz, an academic at the University of Chile who taught Boric, said the new president would have to deal with a rising ultra-conservative bloc that did well in elections last year and find consensus to push through his reforms. \u201cThese are now the tasks lying ahead of Boric,\u201d he added.\n\nThat was echoed by political analyst Claudia Heiss of the University of Chile. \u201cThis is a government that comes to power in a very fragmented political climate, which does not have a parliamentary majority and therefore cannot make very radical reforms in the short term,\u201d Heiss told AFP.\n\nBut environmentalists and Indigenous community advocates have welcomed Boric\u2019s presidency as an opportunity to advance greater protection of those rights.\n\nA part of the Senate on Friday was filled with representatives of Chile\u2019s various Indigenous communities in traditional attire.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sign that it\u2019s going to be an inclusive government,\u201d Cecilia Flores, an Indigenous Aymara told Reuters, adding it was the first time representatives from each Indigenous group have been present at the inauguration. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a government that will make the social changes the people of Chile have been fighting for, especially Indigenous groups.\u201d\n\nMore than 20 international guests were confirmed to attend the investiture ceremony, including Alberto Fernandez and Pedro Castillo \u2013 the presidents of neighbouring Argentina and Peru \u2013 King Felipe VI of Spain, and famed Chilean author Isabel Allende.\n\nBoric\u2019s female-majority cabinet also was sworn in on Friday, with delegations from the United States, Spain, Argentina, Peru and others in attendance.\n\n\u201cThis is an era full of hope for the defence of society, young people, a green future and equality,\u201d tweeted Yolanda Diaz, Spain\u2019s second deputy prime minister who flew to Chile, referring to Boric\u2019s environmental and feminist agenda.",

          "text": "\u2026Says Buni remains our CECPC chair\n\n\u2026INEC rejects Bello\u2019s invitation to NEC meeting\n\nThe Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Party (APC) has insisted that nothing would change the party\u2019s March 26 National Convention.\n\nAccording to the party, it had notified the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of its intention to hold the convention, stressing that there was no need for a fresh 21-day notice as demanded by INEC for the exercise in its letter.\n\nThe spokesman for the CECPC who is the APC national youth leader, Barrister Ismael Ahmed, said this Friday in Abuja at a press conference.\n\nHe said having already intimated INEC of its intent to conduct its national convention on February 26, which was moved March 26, adding that \u201cwhat is required is simply a notice of adjustment and not a fresh 21-day notice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Convention will be held on March 26. I am not only a youth leader or an interim spokesperson of the party, I am also a lawyer and we have served a notice to INEC for February 26 earlier and we served that notice on February 5. That was the required 21 days. If you are going to make any adjustment to that date, all you need is a letter making an adjustment to the date.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need another 21 days and that letter was written about two weeks ago. Immediately we realised that we couldn\u2019t hold it on February 26. The moment the CECPC agreed on March 26, that letter was written to INEC and they have accepted the letter. So, that is long gone. It is not an issue. The issue of the date of Convention is not an issue, not in INEC, not certainly with us. That is settled. It is sacrosanct. We have complied with all the requirements and we have notified INEC as appropriately expected of us,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said further that the Governor Abubakar Sani-Bello-led CECPC had declared that Yobe state governor, Mai Mala Buni, remained the chairman of the Committee.\n\n\u201cIt is pretty simple. I don\u2019t know why this is a complicated issue for a lot of people to understand. Since the inception of this CECPC on June 25 2020, whenever the chairman is not around and Governor Sani Bello is around, he acts on behalf of the chairman.\n\n\u201cHe is our acting chairman and that has always been the case. That has never changed. And now we have a Convention on March 26, the chairman wrote a letter for his leave to go for medical treatment. Those are two emergencies. He has a medical emergency that cannot wait for the Convention and we have a Convention that cannot wait for him to be healthy.\n\n\u201cSo, one has to leave for the other. The chairman transmitted a letter and Governor Bello has been acting as appropriate. He is acting with the full authority of the CECPC and with the full authority of the stakeholders and leaders of the party and with the full consent and knowledge of Governor Mai Mala Buni. If anybody has any issues with any of our decisions, you can take it to court. For now, we know we are doing it with the full backing of the law. There is no ambiguity in this.\u201d\n\nFindings by our correspondent revealed that according to Article 13.3(v) of the APC Constitution 2014, only the NEC of the party can exercise such control and take such disciplinary actions on governor Buni or his committee, if there is any allegation of infraction against him or any other member of the party.\n\nAlso, Article 13.2(vi) of the same constitution quoted in the preceding paragraph explicitly emphasises that it is the same NEC that can appoint Niger state governor and his committee or any other person it may deem fit and assign powers and functions to them accordingly.\n\nSpeaking with Blueprint on condition of anonymity, a former party leader said: \u201cAs of now, the NEC decision that appointed Buni and his committee is still binding on all organs and members except the National Convention according to Article 13.3(iii) and it is until the same NEC decides otherwise.\n\n\u201cI will rather ask Governor Sani-Bello, Governor el-Rufa\u2019i and others to urgently apologise to the Yobe state governor, Mala Buni, publicly for misleading the public and especially the numerous APC members.\u201d\n\nINEC\u2019s declaration\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had rejected a letter inviting it to an emergency meeting of its National Executive Committee (NEC).\n\nThe development implies that the electoral body did not recognise the removal of Governor Mai Mala Buni as chairman of the party\u2019s caretaker committee and his subsequent replacement by Abubakar Sani Bello, the governor of Niger state.\n\nINEC\u2019s response, which dated March 9, 2022, signed by the secretary to the Commission, Rose Oriaran Anthony, was titled, \u201cRe: Invitation to the emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee,\u201d and addressed to the national chairman, APC CECPC.\n\nThe Commission drew the attention of the CECPC to the fact that the letter of invitation was not signed by the national chairman and the national secretary of the CECPC, Buni and Senator John Akpanudoedehe, respectively.\n\nThis, it said, was contrary to the provision of Article 1.1.3 of the Commission\u2019s Regulations and Guidelines for Political Party Operations (2018).\n\nINEC also reminded those who wrote and signed the letter of the provision in Section 82(1) of the Electoral Act 2022, \u201cwhich requires at least 21 days\u2019 notice of any convention, congress, conference, or meeting convened for the purpose of merger and electing members of its executive committees, other governing bodies or nominating candidates for any elective office.\u201d\n\nThe Commission, therefore, urged APC to note the key issues raised for compliance.\n\nThe letter by INEC is considered a big clog in the wheels of a plot by a bloc in the party to stage a coup against Buni, who duly transferred power to Governor Sani Bello of Niger state, to enable him to attend briefly to health issues, according to a leaked letter on Thursday.\n\nGovernor Nasir el-Rufa\u2019i had indicated on a TV programme Wednesday night that Buni was pushed aside because he was working against holding the APC\u2019s planned National Convention, a claim Buni\u2019s letter, dated February 28, 2022, and addressed to CECPC members, countered.\n\nINEC\u2019s letter read, \u201cPlease refer to your letter Ref.APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/022/32, dated 8th March 2022.\n\n\u201cThe Commission draws your attention to the fact that the notice for the meeting was not signed by the National Chairman and National Secretary of the CECPC contrary to the provision of the Article 1.1.3 of the Commission\u2019s Regulations and Guidelines for Political Party Operations (2018).\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the APC is reminded of the provision in Section 82(1) of the Electoral Act 2022, which requires at least 21 days\u2019 notice of any convention, congress, conference, or meeting convened for the purpose of \u2018merger\u2019 and electing members of its executive committees, other governing bodies or nominating candidates for any elective office.\n\n\u201cWhile hoping these issues are noted for compliance, please accept the assurance of the Commission\u2019s warm regards.",

          "title": "INEC letter: Bello's CECPC makes u-turn, says Buni still in charge -",
          "text": "The Governor Abdullahi Sani Bello-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) has made a U-Turn moments after a leaked letter from the Independent National Electoral Commission had subtly rejected the invitation to the emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee of the party.\n\nThe Bello-led CECPC had on Wednesday, 8 March written to the electoral body inviting it to the emergency NEC meeting of the party. The INEC in its reply stated clearly that the fact that the notice for the meeting was not signed by the National Chairman and National Secretary of the CECPC, runs contrary to the provision of the Article 1.1.3 of the Commission\u2019s Regulations and Guidelines for Political Party Operations (2014).\n\nAddressing the media at the Buhari House National Secretariat of the party on Friday in Abuja, the Spokesman of the CECPC, Ismaeel Ahmed, said, \u201cSomebody asked, what is the position of Governor Mai Mala Buni in the party, I think it\u2019s pretty simple. I don\u2019t know why this is a complicated process for a lot of people not to understand. Since the inception of this CECPC on June 25, 2020, whenever the chairman is not around and Governor Sani Bello is around, he acts on behalf of all as the Chairman.\n\n\u201cIt has always been the case that has never changed. It has always been the case. Now, we have a Convention on March 26. The chairman wrote a letter and transmitted power to Governor Bello to enable him go for medical treatment. Those are two emergencies. He has a medical emergency, that cannot wait for Convention. We have a Convention that cannot wait for him to be healthy.\n\n\u201cSo, one has to leave for the other, whichever, he has transmitted a letter and Governor Sani Bello has been acting appropriately. Why is it so difficult for people to understand that? Why is it so difficult for people to simply understand? I cannot understand why people are making this allegation.\n\n\u201cSo, Governor Sani Bello is acting the full authority of the Caretaker Committee and with the full authority of the stakeholders and with the full consent of Governor Mai Mala Buni. It is very clear and simple. If anybody has issues with any of our decisions, he can head to court. For now, we are doing it with the full backing of the law. So, there is no ambiguity on this, absolutely none.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of Senator John James Akpanudodehe, what is the position because I spelt others out the other members of the committee, but I didn\u2019t say anything about other people as well, we just talked about members of the committee. I didn\u2019t talk about their positions, whether secretary or chairman, since they have their responsibilities spelt out for them.\n\n\u201cThe other members are the ones told to come back to handle specific departments and that is what we are doing. At the full course of time, once all these are over, I will be able to brief you. But for now, these are the responsibilities of every member.\n\n\u201cAs part of efforts towards the hitch-free conduct of the March 26th National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) stepped up preparations this week.\n\n\u201cConvened a meeting chaired by the Acting Chairman and Governor of Niger State, H.E. Abubakar Sani Bello, where strategies were adopted to fast-track the process towards conducting a National Convention;\n\n\u201c35 State chairmen of the APC and that of the FCT were sworn-in and mandated to work towards ensuring unity and harmony in their states. They were also charged to mobilise the members and the people to enable the party win future elections;\n\n\u201cReceived and deliberated on the report of the Committee on zoning. After exhaustively deliberating on the report, it was approved and the zoning formula was made public. The zoning formula was well-received by members of the party and all Nigerians;\n\n\u201cAssigned schedules of specific responsibilities to each members of the Caretaker Committee aligned to the existing Directorates at the Party\u2019s headquarters. The purpose is to ensure speedy execution of the various activities leading to the National Convention on March 26, 2022. The exercise has the additional benefit of ensuring synergy between the leadership of the party and the Directorates.\n\n\u201cDeliberated on and disagreed with the Federal High Court in its judgement on the status of the Governor of Ebonyi state over his sound decision to leave the PDP and join the APC along with the majority of members of the State House Assembly; CECPC regards the judgement as a travesty of justice and stand with the Governor and Ebonyi state legislators on appealing to a higher court;\n\n\u201cStreamlined and expanded the leadership of the various sub committees for the conduct of National Convention by bringing in more Governors and Ministers of the Federal Republic to spearhead the process. This has obviously fostered and deepened sense of belonging, inclusiveness and reflect the mosaic nature of the membership of the party;\n\n\u201cReviewed and strengthened the membership of the National Convention Subcommittees by making them compact and lighter. The subcommittees earlier composed were unnecessarily unwieldy and comprised excessive number of members, a situation that can reduce their efficiency;\n\n\u201cThe CECPC committee chaired by His Excellency the Governor of Niger State has issued a notice for a meeting of the National Executive Committee of the party on March 17, 2022. As usual, a number of important issues will be discussed at the meeting.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, reacting to questions from journalists, Ismaeel Ahmed disclosed that the previously scheduled Zonal Congresses will now be part of the National Convention. He assured that the March 26th National Convention was on course and sacrosanct.",

          "text": "Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Thursday, led leaders and members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state to receive the National Chairman of the party, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, declaring that only the PDP could rescue Nigeria from its current socio-economic woes.\n\nObaseki, who spoke at a grand rally in honour of the national chairman in Benin City, expressed confidence that the party would produce the country\u2019s next president, even as Ayu promised that the issues in the Edo PDP would be resolved.\n\nBut the deputy governor of the state, Comrade Philip Shaibu, protested the exclusion of new members from the party, and urged Ayu to help resolve the crisis in the state chapter of the PDP.\n\nAccording to Obaseki, \u201cI want to thank you for coming with members of the National Board of Trustees (BOT) of the party. PDP is the party of Edo; PDP is in the DNA of Edo, and we do not want that to change. The deputy governor said something and I want to restate it: wherever Edo goes, Nigeria will go.\n\n\u201cOur chairman has what it takes to produce the next president, because Nigerians are suffering too much. How can diesel be sold for over N700? You have all it takes to help us. Only PDP can rescue Nigeria from these sufferings.\n\n\u201cThe only issue is the small quarrel in Edo PDP. Once you can solve the quarrel in Edo and other states, we will take over power in 2023,\u201d the governor said.\n\nAyu, while speaking, said the party would set up a team to resolve the crisis in Edo PDP, and ensure that the governor did not leave.\n\n\u201cLet no one deceive you that he (Obaseki) is leaving PDP. Nigerians will see how we will receive all those from other parties. In 2023, we shall be back in power; we have started working towards that.\n\n\u201cEdo people, learn from my own state, Benue. If you fight, you will lose the election. I am going to bring a team that will settle the issue in Edo.\n\n\u201cI have been working from behind. I am happy that the Deputy Governor, Shaibu said the truth that the leadership of the party in the state is not working. We are very close to solving the crisis in Edo.\n\n\u201cOnce the leadership is divided, you won\u2019t get a good result. All our emphasis is on unity. We cannot talk about taking over power in 2023 if our state leadership is not on good terms.\n\n\u201cEdo is going to produce the highest number of votes in the next general election. We shall win all the Senatorial and House of Representatives seats. I want to assure you that by next week, all the issues in Edo PDP will be resolved. All the leaders in Edo should help to resolve the problem, not to fire it more. We will engineer the process and they will conclude the process,\u201d he stated.\n\nEarlier, Shaibu, who alleged exclusion of new members from the party, stated: \u201cSir, people are saying that the governor will not leave the PDP, but he will only remain if his soldiers remain in the party.\n\n\u201cWe want you to resolve this problem in our party. We have what it takes to take over the national position in the next election. Wherever Edo goes, is where Nigeria will go. If you solve the problem in Edo, you have solved the problem in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAmong those at the event were the Secretary to the State Government, Osarodion Ogie Esq; Chief of Staff to the Governor, Hon. Osaigbovo Iyoha; Speaker, Edo House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Marcus Onobun and State Chairman of the PDP, Tony Aziegbemi.\n\nOthers were former governor of Gombe State, Ibrahim Dankwambo; Chairman, PDP Board of Trustees (BOT), Senator Walid Jubril; Senator Matthew Urhoghide, Senator Clifford Odia, Chief Tom Ikimi and PDP National Women Leader, Josephine Anenih.\n\nMeanwhile, the Deputy National Chairman, South-south zone of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Dan Orbih was absent at the unity rally, later held in Benin City, Edo State, to honour Ayu.\n\nWhile Orbih was of the view that there was nothing like harmonisation of party positions because a congress had been held before Obaseki joined the party with some factional member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and as such, the State Working Committee (SWC) should be allowed to serve out its tenure; Obaseki supported the ideas of harmonisation of the SWC positions to accommodate his people.\n\nThe disagreement took a new dimension last week when Obaseki told Orbih off and branded his position as \u201cirresponsible\u201d.\n\n\u201cI heard that Chief Dan Orbih went around, saying there is no harmonisation in Edo PDP. This is really irresponsible to say and an insult to members of the party, as the party has truly harmonised in the state.\n\n\u201cPDP in Edo State is harmonised, because before we made any appointments in any ward, we made sure the party at that level was harmonised. We are gathered here now as election timetable is out; harmonisation has been done, appointments made and we are ready to win any election before us.\u201d\n\nDwelling on this at the rally, Ayu stayed away from harmonisation and opted for peace and unity by urging all and sundry in the party to tow the path of peace just as he noted that unity remained the only key to election victory.\n\nAyu, who said he was married to an Edo woman, who also was once a PDP national women leader, declared that he would not allow anything that would bring division in the party.\n\nHe said as one of those who formed the party out of the G-34 group, he would not fail to ensure unity, recalling that PDP lost Edo in 2007 governorship election to then Action Congress (AC) in the state as a result of disunity and infighting between former Governor Lucky Igbinedion and Chief Tony Anenih of blessed memory.",

          "title": "Nigeria Seeks US Funding for Development of Natural Gas",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, on Thursday called on the United States Government to provide funding support for Nigeria to develop its natural gas resources.\n\nThe call by Sylva is coming on the heels of the Russian war with Ukraine, which currently threatens the disruption of gas supplies from Russia to the entire European continent.\n\nSpeaking during a meeting with the US Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, on the sidelines of the ongoing CERAweek, in Houston Texas, Sylva said the collaboration between the US and Nigeria in this area would be of immense benefits to both countries as well as the entire globe.\n\n\u201cIt is in the interests of the global community that there is alternative supply of gas to Europe. The challenge for us to achieve this feat has been lack of infrastructure and we need funding to development infrastructure for our gas and we believe that the US can provide that funding,\u201d Sylva stated.\n\nStating that the natural gas could serve as an alternative source of energy for Europe, Sylva told Granholm that Nigeria has abundance of the commodity that can meet European gas demands, but said that the problem has been access to funding.\n\nHe explained that as part of efforts to boost gas supplies across the African continent, Nigeria has embarked upon the construction of 600 kilometres of the Ajaokuta- Kaduna- Kano (AKK) gas pipeline designed to take gas to Europe via North Africa.\n\nSylva therefore called on the US to provide the needed funding for infrastructure for the exploitation of the huge natural gas in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have access to gas but access to funding has been the problem. Our desire is to be able to take gas from Nigeria through Algeria to Europe. We have already kick-started the AKK gas pipeline project and if we have the required funding we can complete that project in two years.\n\n\u201cNigeria has over 206 tcf of natural gas reserve and unproven reserve of 600 tcf and we believe that if we target exploitation of natural gas in Nigeria, we will be able to get up to 600 tcf. We need to have the needed funding to develop our gas and the US can provide us this funding,\u201d he added.\n\nThe minister said the crisis between Russia and Ukraine was a wake-up call to have alternative sources of gas to Europe, stressing that in situations like this, it is always good to have alternatives.\n\nSpeaking on the issue of global energy transition, Sylva said for the energy transition programme to be meaningful, the peculiar problems of Africa must be factored into the entire energy transition arrangement.\n\n\u201cWe have to be given some special considerations. I am excited that the world has started listening to us. I was particularly happy that John Kerry echoed our position when he spoke at a panel session.\n\n\u201cInasmuch as we want to be part of the new economy, we can not move at the same pace. We still have people without clean cooking fuels, so we want to achieve our energy base load through a multi pronged approach. The reality check is that we cannot move at the same pace. There is gap between expectations,\u201d he noted.\n\nSylva however cautioned that such funding and technological supports must be made accessible to interested countries.\n\n\u201cWe have to work out a structured way to access the funding. We must create that understanding to make the loans accessible. The issue of sovereign guarantee must be removed so that interested countries can easily access the funding. \u201cthe minister further stated.\n\nCiting the case of the African Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA), Sylva said since the programme came into force so many years ago, no African country has been able to successfully key into the project for maximum benefits.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt has not been easy for Africa to access AGOA. so the type of funding we are looking at is the one that Nigeria will be able to access\u201d.\n\nIn her remarks, Granholm expressed the readiness of the US to cooperate with Nigeria to develop her renewable energy sector, noting that her government was not against the development of gas or other sources of energy.\n\nShe therefore called for a coordinated strategy to pin down specific areas of focus where funding and other supports would be required.\n\n\u201cInvestors are interested in funding renewable energy in Nigeria but they are interested in knowing possible areas of focus. We have to work out a structured way to access the fund\u201d Granholm said.\n\nIn an earlier meeting with the US Assistant Secretary of State, Harry Karman, Sylva expressed Nigeria\u2019s willingness to develop the different sources of renewable energy such as wind, solar and hydrogen.\n\nHe spoke also about the need to streamline targeted financing adding that \u201cthere must be a framework of accessing the funding\u201d.\n\nKarman in his remarks assured the minister of the US government\u2019s readiness to support Nigeria in finding sustainable energy sources for the millions of Nigerians without access to power.",

          "text": "The Republic of Korea has disclosed that the volume of trade between the country and Nigeria last year rose to $2 billion.\n\nThe Korean Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr. Kim Young Chae, disclosed this on Thursday, when he addressed the media on the heels of the election of Yoon Suk-yeol as South Korea\u2019s President-elect on Wednesday.\n\nHe said the bilateral trade figure was a 50 per cent increase in compared to that of 2020. He said the boost in bilateral trade occurred in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cI hope that this year our bilateral trade rises further and at the end of the day I want to see Nigeria become Korea\u2019s biggest trading partner in Africa. Nigeria is the biggest economy in Africa, so it should be Korea\u2019s number trading partner among Africa\u2019s countries,\u201d Kim said.\n\nPresently, Nigeria is Korea\u2019s third biggest trading partner in Africa.\n\nThe ambassador said the balance of trade between both countries was driven mainly by Korea\u2019s manufactured goods, like plastic and aluminum related products and Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas.\n\n\u201cWe are importing a lot of Nigerian gas to further increase our bilateral trade. Of course oil and gas is very important, but we want to see some agricultural products from Nigeria and manufactured goods in order to penetrate into Korean market.\n\n\u201cI hope more Nigerian companies will study Korean markets and Korean consumers.
