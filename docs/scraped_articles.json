          "title": "Talk to sponsors of violence, Buhari tells Catholic bishops",
          "text": "THE President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Tuesday, called on the Nigeria\u2019s Catholic bishops to keep on speaking truth to power and extend their message of change to violent non-state actors.\n\nAccording to him, some of them are propagating genuine causes but with mindless brutality.\n\nBuhari, who was represented by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, spoke at the opening of the 4th Plenary Assembly of the Reunion of Episcopal Conferences of West Africa, which held in Abuja with the theme, \u2018Fratelli Tutti: Path to build brotherhood and sustainable peace in West Africa.\u2019\n\nHe said the West African sub-region was passing through a season of considerable political, economic and social turmoil, but challenged the bishops to play active roles in building brotherhood and sustainable peace.\n\nHe said, \u201cIndeed, the Catholic Church and the Bishops conference have established a reputation for speaking truth to power in consonance with the highest prophetic traditions and by continuing its illustrious practice of inspiring social action by the lay faithful. Over the years, the Church has modelled profound approaches in challenging the impunity of some state actors and errant power.\n\n\u201cBut I believe the times also call for speaking to the growing numbers of violent non-state actors, some propagating genuine causes but with mindless violence often leading to the destruction of lives and property.\n\n\u201cI urge you to not only explore ways of strengthening the bonds of faith between your communities, but also of building bridges across every divide that threatens to fracture our nations.\u201d\n\nThe president said peace cannot reign in the region if it does not first reign in individual communities and countries.\n\nTo this end, he said the Federal Government was committed to collaborating with the church and all well-meaning actors in promoting peace and security.\n\nHe added, \u201cOur goals of unity and integration have always been thwarted not just by concerns of individual sovereignty of our nations but also by internal crisis and social conflicts in our nations and around the borders.\n\n\u201cSince 2017, there have been 12 military coups in Africa and half of them have occurred since 2020. Historically, in times like these, parochial prejudices are heightened and the fabric of cohesion becomes frayed as people retreat into ethnic, religious and other nativist camps. In all of these, the ideal of an integrated peaceful and prosperous sub region seems almost impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is my hope that you will conceptualise ways of bringing the full weight of the immense moral authority that you possess upon our nations and in the sub-region as a whole. It is evident that we cannot create fraternity and harmony in West Africa without our faith communities.\u201d\n\nDelivering his address, the President, Reunion of Episcopal Conferences of West Africa, Archbishop Ignatius Kaigama, asked political leaders to work harder to deliver good governance to the people.\n\nHe maintained that Catholic bishops in the region, without becoming politically partisan, would continue to ring out their prophetic voices on behalf of the voiceless multitude suffering.\n\nIn his remarks, the President of the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of Nigeria, Most Revd. Lucius Ugorji, said the international community must work together to develop new strategies to tackle global problems.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We need to be classified as a proper security agency because our job is similar to others.\n\n\u201cThere is a need to effectively fund the budget of the NAPTIP to enable it to deliver on its mandate, allow its presence in the 774 local governments, empower the agency to recruit more personnel across the nation, and work more with the immigration service to monitor the flow of migrants where necessary strategically.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to stop gambling with the leadership of the agency. The appointment of three Director Generals for NAPTIP in less than six months is not good for stability. A leader needs to settle down and needs time to work and execute projects.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAvailable data shows that more than one million Nigerians are trapped in Mali, Cotonou, Libya, Chad, and other European nations.\n\n\u201cOut of this figure, 50,000 Nigerian girls are believed to be Victims of Human Trafficking.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "OTC 2022: PETAN advocates independent path to energy transition",
          "text": "By Udeme Akpan & Ediri Ejoh\n\n\n\nTHE Petroleum Technology Association of Nigeria, PETAN, has called on Nigeria and other African nations to chart their independent energy transition paths.\n\n\n\nMany experts in Europe and other continents have already called for an immediate \u2018ban\u2019 of fossil fuel, citing its environmental hazards and other factors as reasons.\n\n\n\nResponding to this clamour while speaking at the opening of the Offshore Technology Conference, OTC, in Houston, United States, Chairman of the Nigeria Pavillion opening ceremony at the OTC, Chinedu Maduakoh, said the time has come for Nigeria and other African nations to pursue their energy transition dreams.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThe clean energy transition debate, no doubt, presents an opportunity for many African countries to chart sustainable energy systems of their own, but capital is an enormous mitigating factor which calls for strengthened regional action to address existing barriers and identify practical steps which regional governments can take to promote capital deployment and adopt the technologies best-suited for their region.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfrica, home to one-sixth of the global population and accounting for less than 6% of the global energy consumption and 2% of cumulative global emissions according to reports, still has a comparative advantage and potential growth in the energy sector even as fossil fuels remain our enduring source of government revenue.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, bridging the finance gap, embracing new technologies, and replicating successful models in other sectors can help to further increase value-retention along the global value chain and deepen the process of economic integration in alignment with the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement which has the potential to lift more Africans out of the vicious cycle of poverty and inter-generational dependency.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\n\nHowever, the Chairman, Board of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), Senator Margrey Chuba-Okadigbo, expressed optimism over the petroleum sector\u2019s growth and development in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nHe made this known while declaring open the Nigerian Pavilion at the 2022 OTC which has, \u201cEnergy Transition and the Future of Africa\u201d as its theme .\n\nEarlier in his opening remarks, the Chairman of Petroleum Technology Association of Nigeria, PETAN, Mr Nicolas Odinuwe, said the theme of this year was carefully chosen to \u201creflect the current realities in African oil and gas.\u201d\n\n\n\nOdinuwe called on the Nigerian oil and gas industry leaders to continue to echo PETAN\u2019s calls to deepen Nigerian content as always and implore NNPC limited board and others to indulge the association.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOTC means different things to different people. But thanks to PETAN\u2019S focused participation. PETAN and Nigeria have built capacities, capabilities and visibility.\n\nPETAN has been the host of the Nigerian pavilion for over 15 years. \u201cAnd we have been fully supported by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (now NNPC Limited) which is in transition. We are here to continue to propagate, advocate and advance technology that has led to Nigeria being the only country in Sub-Saharan Africa with a robust exploration and production service industry,\u201d he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

You also engaged in capacity building as you interchanged skills and made your colleagues here locally improve their knowledge.\n\nThey have learned new ways of doing things. You have brought a new way of commitment and dedication to duty.\n\n\u201cYou have fulfilled your call of service to humanity as the team restored lives during this mission by providing free medical service.\u201d\n\nAlso Read:\n\nWorkers Day: Obaseki announces N40,000 new minimum wage\n\nThe governor said that the activities of ANPA in Edo State have helped the government rethink the issue of brain drain, adding, \u201cYou are in the position to help us tackle brain drain. This mission has been so helpful as I believe that we can do two missions per year. Your services to Edo people are invaluable to the healthcare regeneration of our state and country at large.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Ehanire commended the collaboration between ANPA and the state government, saying, \u201cNigeria suffers from the brain drains as the country\u2019s medical personnel have left to practice abroad. It\u2019s difficult to stop them despite several plans as it affects not only Nigeria but across the globe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI applaud the plan for telemedicine which has been experimented in America during the COVID-19 era with the help of technology which became very useful over there. Technology allows for virtual consultation between experts in the Diaspora and their patients here in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe will like to institutionalise such a relationship to enable us to share knowledge and skills and begin to develop the health sector here in Nigeria. We are waiting for the signature of the president to create the National Health Insurance Commission that will make health insurance mandatory for all Nigerians and increase the physical space for health.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\n*Backs SOKAPU on the deployment of OPSH Commander\n\nBy Joseph Erunke, ABUJA\n\nA Southern Kaduna professional group has flayed a recent report credited to an indigenous peace advocacy group discrediting an earlier call by the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union, SOKAPU, for immediate deployment of the Commander of Operation Safe Haven, OPSH, Major General Ibrahim Salau Ali, over alleged inappropriate handling of the internal security of the area.\n\nSOKAPU which had alleged bias in the handling of the security management in Southern Kaduna by the OPSH Commander did not only call for his immediate deployment but outrightly passed a vote of no confidence on the Nigerian Army General.\n\nHowever, an indigenous Southern Kaduna peace advocacy group, operating under the umbrella of Southern Kaduna Peace Practitioners, SOKIPEP, took a swipe at the position of its sister group, saying its position was unfair to the internal military outfit and its Commander that have sacrificed so much to keep peace in the area.\n\nIts statement by the National Coordinator, Reverend Dauda Fadia, insisted that SOKAPU had no moral justification to speak for the people of the area, tasking it to rather called youths who have taken to criminality as a means of living to order.\n\nBut responding to SOKIPEP\u2019s statement, Tuesday, another indigenous platform operating under the aegis of Coalition of Southern Kaduna Professionals, threw its weight behind the position of SOKAPU, alleging that SOKIPEP was sponsored by enemies of Southern Kaduna to attack its umbrella socio-cultural association.\n\nThis was as the Southern Kaduna Professionals lamented that the governor of Kaduna State, Nasir Ahmed el-Rufai, has abandoned the people of Southern Kaduna to their fate in spite of incessant attacks by their enemies.\n\nThe group said this in a statement signed by its National President, Dr Peter Kukah.\n\n\u201cOur attention has been drawn to a sponsored press statement yesterday by one Rev Dauda Fadia, a very respected elder and clergy from Fadia Community in Southern Kaduna authored on behalf of Southern Kaduna Peace Practitioners which he heads as national coordinator.\n\n\u201cThe statement which absorbed Operation Safe Haven (OPSH), the military outfit in charge of security in Southern Kaduna and Plateau State, headed by Major General IS Ali, of any wrongdoing or negligence is rather unfortunate and obviously sponsored by the people killing our people to occupy our land,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly shocked considering the calibre of the signatory of the statement who we hold in high esteem. However, we have to console ourselves considering the level of hunger in the country and Kaduna State in particular.\n\n\u201cWe wonder why such a man could descend so low to hunger at the detriment of his people\u2019s life. This is obviously why the invaders are having a filled day killing our people. This development has without a doubt confirmed our long-held suspicion that there are powerful collaborators in the ceaseless attacks and killings in our land. Rev. Dauda Fadia has proved to one of them, \u201cthe statement read.\n\nA\u00e7cording to the Southern Kaduna Professionals,\u201d Privileged and very reliable information available to us suggest that Rev. Fadia had a three-hour-long meeting with a very powerful serving commissioner from Southern Kaduna on Sunday in a hotel in Barnawa area of Kaduna State where the discussion to issue the sponsored statement was hatched.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are aware that the said statement was sponsored by some government officials from Southern Kaduna just to discredit SOKAPU and our genuine complaint against the military outfit and the government.\n\n\u201d We wish to unequivocally say here that men of Operation Safe Haven are not doing what they should do in Southern Kaduna. They watch the other way round while our people are killed on a daily basis. Even when they sluggishly respond, the usual excuse is that they don\u2019t have instructions to engage the attackers. This is so sad!\n\n\u201cWe are certain there\u2019s a fifth columnist somewhere working hard to eliminate our people in Southern Kaduna and this is not acceptable, we will do everything possible to secure our land. We are not going to surrender our land to anyone no matter how highly placed,\u201d the statement by the Southern Kaduna Professionals further read.\n\nThe group claimed that \u201cWe strongly believe the entire leadership of Operation Safe Haven is biased against our people.\u201d\n\nIt also claimed that the\u201d Kaduna State Government has practically abandoned our people to their fate\u201d, adding: Our people are homeless, dying daily of hunger, starvation, a disease caused by their homelessness yet the government does not care.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, join SOKAPU to call for the immediate overhaul of the entire security architecture of Operation Safe Haven and replace them with committed and unbiased officers\u201d, it said while calling on \u201cReverend Dauda Fadia and his group to seek the forgiveness of the people of Southern Kaduna for posterity sake.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

In fact he is a field man. I think he spends more time on the fields than in his office. I am very glad to be here and I have, from my heart, to testify that I am here on good faith.

Health indices have improved; we have upgraded facilities across the state.\n\n\u201cWe have taken roads and other developmental projects to the remotest corners of our state; and we have standardized basic education. Today, unlike before, Kwara competes strongly with its peers in things that truly matter.\n\n\u201cBut this is just the beginning. Over the next few years, our state will be the go-to place for national and international events.

One of the outcomes of that meeting was the decision to collaborate with governors of the other states in the North West and Niger State to fund a joint military operation to clear the Kamuku-Kuyambana forest swathes in Birnin Gwari axis of cattle rustlers hibernating in the ranges that cover Niger, Kaduna, Katsina and Zamfara States.

          "text": "\u2022Declare another eight years of northern presidency unacceptable\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren and Chuks Okocha\n\n\n\nThe Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) has issued a stern warning to those trying to do away with the zoning of the presidency in the country, saying any attempt to end zoning, as being insinuated in some northern quarters, would spell the end for Nigeria.\n\nThe leaders condemned a statement credited to the chairman of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Alhaji Ango Abdullahi, that rotation of the presidency between the north and south was \u201cdead and buried\u201d. They declared that another eight years of northern presidency, after President Muhammadu Buhari, was unacceptable.\n\nThe position of the leaders was contained in a joint statement yesterday by National Leader, Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), and Chairman, SMBLF, Chief Edwin Clark; leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo; President-General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Professor George Obiozor; and National President, Middle Belt Forum, Pogu Bitrus. They said they were prepared for those attempting to upturn a practice \u2013 zoning \u2013 that had sustained the country.\n\nThe group warned that any attempt to kill and bury the age-long power rotation agreement between the north and south was tantamount to an attempt to kill and bury Nigeria.\n\nSMBLF warned that the move to tinker with the rotation of the presidency was inimical to national unity.\n\nThe Southern and Middle Belt leaders also warned Abdullahi\u2019s NEF, and wondered if the northern body was now out to dissolve the country.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cSMBLF says it is rather unfortunate and absurd that Ango Abdullahi and his Northern Elders Forum would make such twaddle. Are they now ready to dissolve the country? What has happened that zoning, which has been a sine qua non in the nation\u2019s political progression, has now become a \u2018dead and buried\u2019 issue, in the irrational contemplations of Ango Abdullahi and his co-travellers?\n\n\u201cCould it be due to the incapacity, insipidity and disastrous performance of the Buhari administration or the narcissistic desire to perpetuate Hausa/Fulani hegemony? It has become necessary to underscore that Ango Abdullahi, with his established disposition of inconsistency and duplicity, is one of the people disturbing the polity and peace of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cA few days ago, this same Ango fumbled with the idea of a so-called consensus arrangement for northern presidential aspirants, he has not come out of it. Now he has sprung up with this reckless statement that zoning is dead and buried. Ango and his northern elders do not have the power to kill and bury zoning. If they want to kill and bury Nigeria, then we are ready for them.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesmen stated that the \u201chistory of zoning between the north and the south is well-known to everybody in this country and has been respected by all the major political parties in Nigeria.\u201d They recalled that all the ruling political parties from the Second Republic, such as the now defunct National Party of Nigeria (NPN) and the current opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had adhered to the principle of zoning.\n\nThe elders also accused the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Adamu Abdullahi, of outright dishonesty and chicanery for saying APC had not decided the zoning of the presidency.\n\nAccording to SMBLF, \u201cMore so, earlier this year, the nation and global audience were told by Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State on a national/satellite television station, Channels Television, that zoning of the party and political elective offices exists in the APC.\n\n\u201cThe governor further hinted that all the positions earlier held by the north would be swapped with the south and vice versa. And this was inclusive of the presidency. That was the reason why only northerners vied for the national chairmanship of the party, which was zoned to the north and micro-zoned to the North-central, during the party\u2019s national convention in March this year.\n\n\u201cSadly, we are now being told by the newly \u2018imposed\u2019 national chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, that the APC has not decided on the zoning of the presidency. Such a statement at this stage, with about 30 days to the presidential primaries, amounts to outright dishonesty and chicanery. Who are they trying to deceive and who will allow them?\n\n\u201cIt becomes even more upsetting given the fact that the statement came from someone who himself emerged as National Chairman of the APC through the policy of rotation and zoning.\u201d\n\nThe southern leaders added, \u201cIt is haughty for anybody to say that this is the time to consider the quality of candidates. Where in Nigeria is deficient in quality candidates? Is it the south or the north? Everyone of the individuals from the south, who has indicated interest to contest for the presidency, both in APC and in PDP, is qualified to be President of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey should stop their trickery. Enough is enough! We cannot have a northerner president for eight years and then welcome another northern president for another eight years or more. That is unacceptable to us. We, therefore, strongly caution all our governors, former governors, and top politicians not to accept the vice presidency nomination from any northern presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWe urge the 17 southern governors, who unanimously declared that the presidency must come to the south in May last year, at Asaba, Delta State, to remain resolute. They have our absolute support for the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum and we stand firmly by them. This country belongs to all of us!\n\n\u201cLet everybody take this as a serious warning that the issue of zoning cannot be swept under the carpet; it cannot be dead and buried, if zoning is buried, Nigeria is, then, buried. And if they are thinking that this is a joke, let it be known that it is not. If we cannot abide by the established principle of rotation and zoning between the north and the south, then we should not continue with one Nigeria; we should go back to what we were as a people before the amalgamation of 1914.\n\n\u201cWe also earnestly call on the people of the Middle Belt Region and all minorities in Nigeria to wake up and work conscientiously with the southerners, if we do, the prospects will be pellucid. This was demonstrated at the National Conference of 2014 to the mortification of those who think this country belongs to them alone.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Assures families victims will safely return\n\n\u2022Says terrorists using captives as human shields, making their rescue difficult\n\nDeji Elumoye and Udora Orizu\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, said rescuing the kidnapped passengers of the Kaduna-bound train that was recently attacked by terrorists was a delicate situation, which required wisdom, utmost caution, and proper handling. Buhari, however, assured the families of the victims that efforts were on-going to ensure the safe return of all those held captive by the terrorists.\n\nThe president claimed that the rescue had been made difficult because the terrorists were holding the captives close to places that could be targeted by security operatives in the event of a strong rescue operation, to deter such attack. He directed security agencies and the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) to provide more regular and detailed information to the victims\u2019 families on their condition and efforts to save them.\n\nThe vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, in his own remarks, restated the country\u2019s trust in God, praying that the Almighty would fulfil the heart desires of all Muslims and every Nigerian.\n\nTerrorists had on March 28 attacked a Kaduna-bound train, killing no fewer than nine people, injuring several others, and abducting most of the passengers.\n\nThe president\u2019s assurances on efforts to secure the victims\u2019 release came on the heels of a recent lawsuit filed against him by Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) over failure to protect the rights to life, security, and dignity of the victims of the Abuja-Kaduna train attack. SERAP also sued the president for his failure to secure the safe release of those held captive by the terrorists.\n\nBut speaking yesterday while receiving some residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Sallah homage at the State House, Abuja, Buhari said the government would explore every opportunity to rescue the captives alive and unhurt. He lamented that terrorists, unlike professional soldiers, did not respect the rules of engagement and could resort to harming hostages, when attacked.\n\nBuhari urged Nigerians to create a hostile environment for criminals hiding in communities, saying by sheltering criminals, they are endangering their own security and the security of their own communities. He said strong synergy between security agencies and communities would make a huge difference in efforts to defeat banditry and terrorism in the country.\n\nThe president allayed fears that bandits could grow to yet another big challenge, like the Boko Haram threat, assuring Nigerians that the administration would not allow such to happen, as the welfare of the people of Abuja and all Nigerians remained paramount.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cAs we celebrate this occasion with joy amidst friends and family members, we are fully conscious of the fact that many families in our country are in a state of fear and anxiety on account of the many captives held by terrorists against their will, including those taken away after the tragic bombing of the Abuja-Kaduna train.\n\n\u201cI have directed security agencies to ensure quick and safe recovery of all victims of kidnapping. I urge the railway management to immediately set up a situation room for the coordination of the rescue mission and for a minute-by-minute engagement with the families of the captives.\n\n\u201cThis should ease their pain and anxiety as we push the military to finding a safe return to their families. My aim is to see all those in captivity safely rescued. Let me assure Nigerians that the bandits are just pushing their luck, but this is only for a while before they are finally crushed.\n\n\u201cThey are using civilians as human shields, thereby making it difficult to confront them directly. Terrorists don\u2019t care about killing their hostages if they come under attack. It\u2019s a delicate situation that requires wisdom, caution and also patience. Any rescue operation that results in the death of any hostage cannot be deemed a success.\n\n\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t want this kind of tragic outcome. It\u2019s a complex situation that demands proper handling. The primary objective of any rescue operation is to free the hostages safely, unharmed and alive. Let me make it clear, however, that defeating the terrorists and bandits requires more than weapons.\n\n\u201cWe also need human intelligence, which is necessary to frustrate terrorist plans. The people and community leaders should help our security officials with information about the activities or movements of criminal groups.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the president said his administration had allocated huge resources to improve the capacity of the security forces through timely and adequate supply of equipment and improving the welfare of personnel to boost their morale.\n\nHe said Abuja had witnessed remarkable improvement in terms of security, and claimed that in the past, terrorists had made it almost impossible to lead normal lives in the capital city.\n\nThe president said the completion of the Abuja light rail was one of the major projects embarked on by the administration for the inhabitants, as development of infrastructure remained essential to economic growth. He added that the government would continue to give serious attention to the town and link roads to other states as well as electricity and power.\n\nOsinbajo, at the occasion, thanked God for giving Buhari \u201call that you have required to tackle these challenges and for giving you the life and strength to tackle the challenges and to surmount the challenges.\u201d\n\nThe vice president noted that despite the challenges, Nigeria remained united.

          "text": "\u2022Analysts attribute decline to high volume of currency in circulation\n\nNume Ekeghe\n\n\n\nDeposit money banks (DMBs and merchant banks borrowing from the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) Standing Lending Facility (SLF) dropped year-on-year (YoY) by 66 per cent to N1.49 trillion in first four months of 2022, from N4.44 trillion in the comparable period of 2021.\n\nFinancial institutions in Nigeria through the SLF borrow funds from the apex bank to meet their financial intermediation role.\n\nThe apex bank lends money to banks and merchant banks through the SLF at an interest rate of 100 basis points (bpts) above the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) of 11.50 per cent.\n\nThe trend between January and April 2022, as gathered from the CBN website revealed steady decline in bank and merchant banks\u2019 borrowings, driven by improvement in the level of liquidity in the interbank system.\n\nHowever, analysts have said the development was due to low rates on savings instruments, matured T-bills and bonds have not rolled over, resulting to more currency in circulation.\n\nAn analysis of the CBN financial data revealed that banks and other financial institutions in January 2022, borrowed N313.48 billion, which was a decline of 25.5 per cent from N426.7 billion borrowed in January 2021.\n\nIn February, the total amount borrowed by banks and merchant banks dropped further by 70 per cent to N186.48 billion from N621.7 billion in February 2021.\n\nThe trend continued in March 2022, as the CBN data revealed that N377 billion was borrowed by banks and merchant banks compared to N904.68 billion in March 2021. Also, the amount borrowed by banks and merchants\u2019 banks in April 2022 stood at N612.43 billion, a 75.4 per cent decline from N2.48 trillion reported by the CBN in April 2021.\n\nFinance experts attributed the development to improved business environment post Covid-19, stressing that this paved the way for banks and merchant banks to halt borrowing from the CBN this year.\n\nIn a chat with THISDAY, the Head, Financial Institutions\u2019 Ratings Agusto & Co, Mr. Ayokunle Olubunmi said: \u201cThere are presently low rates, and remember that before 2019, T-bills were actually high and a lot of those instruments are maturing now, so there is money in circulation. And this has been the trend over the last couple of months.\u201d\n\nHe, however predicted that the CBN might soon put out measures to curb excess liquidity in circulation.\n\n\u201cOnce CBN feels the amount of liquidity in circulation is too much, they have different instruments they can use to mop it up. Also remember that as electioneering starts there would be more money in circulation and CBN can get more aggressive,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his part, the Vice President, Highcap Securities Limited, Mr. David Adnori said uncertainty in the nation\u2019s economy forced banks and merchant banks to shun borrowing from CBN.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cBanks and merchant banks have excess liquidity and might not need to borrow from CBN. Besides, economic uncertainty has started to surface following the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction, analysts at PAC Holdings, Mr. Wole Adeyeye maintained that banks and merchant banks in first four months of 2021, borrowed enough funds from the CBN to meet their daily obligations.\n\nHe stressed that the nation\u2019s economy in 2021, had normalised, giving room for banks and merchant banks to reduce borrowing from the CBN in 2022.\n\nAdeyeye explained that banks and merchant banks are maintaining effective risk management in a move to cut down down non-performing Loan (NPL) in the financial sector.\n\nHe added that: \u201cBanks and merchant banks with increasing deposit from customers prefer to lend to CBN rather than their customers to maintain NPL below five per cent threshold demanded by CBN.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\n*Party appeals ruling to show cause why primary should not be suspended*Second aggrieved group says party can only rotate candidacy, not presidency\n\nChuks Okocha and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nTwo Groups have moved to stop the presidential primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over the party\u2019s silence on the issue of rotation of power and zoning.\n\n\n\nOne of the groups is led by one of its presidential aspirants and a former Deputy Speaker of the Abia State House of Assembly, Mr. Cosmas Ndukwe, moved to stop the presidential primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over the party\u2019s stand on the issue of rotation of power and zoning.\n\n\n\nThe kernel of their cases are that the PDP over the years had a tradition of power rotation and zoning.\n\nThe group argued that the only office the opposition party has to offer was the presidential candidate, which they argued should rotate between the north and the south\n\n\n\nThey cited the fact that since the return of democracy in 1999, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, from southern Nigeria was the first to govern the country, followed by the late Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua from the northern part of the country. This was followed by Goodluck Jonathan from the southern part of the country and now Muhammadu Buhari from the north.\n\n\n\nJustice Donatus Okorowo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, had last Thursday, ordered the PDP to appear before it on May 5, to show cause why the request of one of its presidential aspirants to stop the scheduled primary election for the selection of the party\u2019s flag bearer in the 2023 presidential election should not be granted.\n\n\n\nThe PDP had fixed May 28, for the conduct of its presidential primary election and to that effect screened the 17 aspirants who obtained the presidential form to run in the 2023 election.\n\n\n\nIn the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/508/2022 are the PDP, National Chairman of PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Atu, Senator Samuel Anyanwu and the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC) as 1st to fourth respondents respectively.\n\nRather than grant the request, the judge ordered that the PDP should appear before it and show cause why the court should not accede to the plaintiff\u2019s demand.\n\n\n\nIn the suit filed by his lawyer, Mr Paul Erokoro, Ndukwe also challenged the scheduled presidential primary on the grounds that it breached its own constitution on zoning.\n\nAccording to him, the PDP has a rotation of elective offices in place, and by that arrangement, it ought to be the turn of the south to produce the president.\n\n\n\nAs of last week, it was obvious that the PDP was not considering zoning its Presidential ticket to the south as being clamoured by southern governors and other leaders in the zone.\n\n\n\nAlso, a member of the other group challenging the party over the issue of zoning, who pleaded to remain anonymous, pointed out that, \u201cthe presidency is not for the PDP to give; the only thing the PDP can give is its presidential ticket and that must be rotated.\n\n\n\nBut the PDP has challenged the jurisdiction of a Federal High Court to summon it over the issue which the party described as its internal affairs.\n\n\n\nThis emerged just as former Minister of Police Affairs and member of the zoning committee of the party, Adamu Maina Waziri has called on the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party to allow the 4,200 delegates expected at the presidential convention decide who would fly the ticket of the party.\n\n\n\nThe PDP in a Notice of Preliminary Objection filed on Friday, by its lawyer, Mr Mahmud Magaji, submitted that the subject matter of the case which borders on whether to zone its presidential ticket to any part of the country was not an issue that the court has the mandate to decide.\n\n\n\nThe PDP asked the court to strike out the suit for want of jurisdiction and also dismiss it for being \u201cstatute-barred\u201d.\n\nAccording to the defendants, \u201cthe cause of action in the suit relates to the internal affairs of a political party and therefore falls within the doctrine of political questions which are non-justiciable\u201d and as such the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain it.\n\n\n\nOn the issue of statute-barred, the PDP noted that the cause of action arose from the PDP National Zoning Committee Communique of April 5 whereas the plaintiff\u2019s suit was filed on April 19 (15 days after) in violation of Section 285 of the Constitution which provides for 14 days to file such cases.\n\n\n\nWhile arguing further that the plaintiff lacked the necessary legal right to initiate the case, the PDP submitted that no civil right of the plaintiff has been wrong pursuant to section 6(6) of the Constitution.\n\nThe party, therefore, urged the court to uphold its objection and dismiss the case of the plaintiff, adding that the plaintiff would not be prejudiced or suffer any hardship if the case was dismissed.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the 3rd defendant in the suit Senator Anyanwu had approached the Court of Appeal to set aside the order of Justice Okorowo on the defendants to show cause, arguing that the trial judge erred in law when it arrived at that decision without according to them a fair hearing.\n\n\n\nAmong other complaints against the judgment of the lower court was that while the originating summons of Ndukwe was not ripe for hearing, the time for appellants to respond to the suit has also not lapsed, adding that respondents have taken steps to file counter affidavit against the suit.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe learned trial judge erred in entertaining an ex parte motion which seeks to stop the presidential primary election of the appellant without hearing notice\u201d, adding that the court further erred in law when it failed to \u201caver its mind to section 84(15) of the Electoral Act, 2022, before making an order to show cause\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe appellant in the Notice of Appeal dated April 29, further urged the court to allow the appeal and set aside the ruling of Justice Okorowo asking the PDP to show cause why its scheduled primary election should not be halted.\n\nPDP Presidential Ticket: Let Delegates Decide, Ex-minister Tells Party Leaders\n\nMeanwhile, Waziri who called on the NEC of the party to allow the 4,200 delegates expected at the presidential convention decide who would fly the ticket the of the party, also alleged that the issue of zoning in the party was being fuelled by external influences who are not members of the party.\n\n\n\nThe ex-minister claimed that at no time did the PDP mandate General Ibrahim Babangida and Prof. Ango Abdullahi to help it find a consensus candidate for the party\n\nHe said the PDP was not obliged to zone its presidential ticket for the 2023 presidential election, saying the party was preoccupied to use any legitimate method to win the presidential election.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are a party in opposition, our concern at the moment is to use any legitimate process to get back to power. It is the ruling party that should be concerned with zoning, but not the PDP. Ours as an opposition party is to win through Democratic measure.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur concern is to allow the delegates to the presidential convention to the analysis and know who out of the cleared presidential aspirants has the competence and strength of character to win the presidential election for the party \u201c\n\nThe former Minister of Police Affairs stressed that Babangida and Abdullahi have no mandate of the party to conduct any consensus for the presidential candidate to emerge.\n\n\n\nAccording to the former minister who is also a member of the 37-man think tank on zoning, who spoke on Arise News Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY, \u201d it is not true that zoning is tearing the PDP apart. It is all about media creation and external influences that are creating the media controversy within the party.\n\n\n\n\u201cDid you not hear what two frontline presidential aspirants, Peter Obi and Emmanuel Udom said the position of the PDP on zoning is supreme as the party decision on this is final. We will enthrone the best method that would be in the interest of the party and democracy.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

It is one of the most beautiful places you can be in the country and even in the world.\n\n\u201cThis is the reason why we keep talking about tourism, imagine in this lake, there are chalets, places where people can come and visit and stay for weeks.\n\n\u201cThey can also fish, every fish here is natural. The only problem is oil pollution from the Niger Delta Area and people can no longer drink the water here. Everything you see here is natural.\n\n\u201cThis is how it has always been and this is a perfect ecosystem, it is an environment that suits the dream of environmentalists, we also have farmlands around the river.\n\n\u201cThis lake goes all the way to the Niger Delta region. This is a lovely place to be and anytime I come around, I always love to be here because this is for me, a home.\n\n\u201cI heard the governor of Ondo State, in one of their jamborees was saying they want to create a fish pond inside the lake, they don't have sense.\u201d\n\nMore Photos:\n\n\n\n",

The current president comes from the north and if you look at it analytically, the south benefitted more. If the president comes from the south, we will benefit more just as we did previously during Jonathan\u2019s administration,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt pays the north more if there is a southern president. It pays the south when there is a northern president. When Buhari was appointed, the south benefitted more. They have the vice-president and the vice-president is so powerful, because the president at one time handed over the country to him when he left \u2013 that was unprecedented.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe vice-president and speaker of the house of representatives are from the south-west. From the south, there are more than five strategic ministers \u2014 the minister of finance was from the south-west until the south-west pushed her out, because it was the media hype that pushed her out because of the trivial matter of NYSC certificate.\n\n\u201cThen, we have the ministers of works, health and state for health from the south. Another important ministry is the petroleum ministry \u2014 the president is the minister, and the minister of state is from south-south.\n\n\u201cIn terms of infrastructure, the south benefitted more because the second Niger bridge will be completed very soon. East-west road will be completed. The deep blue sea project is in the south. The Lagos-Ibadan rail was started and commissioned. The Lagos-Ibadan expressway is also going on smoothly. So many projects in the south. Without fear of any contradiction, we will benefit more if the president comes from the south.\u201d",

          "text": "Ali Ndume, senator representing Borno south district, says the northern region will benefit more if a southerner becomes president in 2023.\n\nWith months to the 2023 elections, there have been calls for the next president to come from the south.\n\nThe two major political parties in the country \u2014 Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC) \u2014 are currently silent on the zoning of their presidential tickets, and this has fuelled speculations that both parties may throw the contest open.\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday in an interview on Channels Television, Ndume said the next president of the country should come from the south in the spirit of justice and fairness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Borno senator added that the northern part of the country benefitted more during the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan, who hails from the south.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I feel we will be better off with the president coming from the south. The current president comes from the north and if you look at it analytically, the south benefitted more. If the president comes from the south, we will benefit more just as we did previously during Jonathan\u2019s administration,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt pays the north more if there is a southern president. It pays the south when there is a northern president. When Buhari was appointed, the south benefitted more. They have the vice-president and the vice-president is so powerful, because the president at one time handed over the country to him when he left \u2013 that was unprecedented.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe vice-president and speaker of the house of representatives are from the south-west. From the south, there are more than five strategic ministers \u2014 the minister of finance was from the south-west until the south-west pushed her out, because it was the media hype that pushed her out because of the trivial matter of NYSC certificate.\n\n\u201cThen, we have the ministers of works, health and state for health from the south. Another important ministry is the petroleum ministry \u2014 the president is the minister, and the minister of state is from south-south.\n\n\u201cIn terms of infrastructure, the south benefitted more because the second Niger bridge will be completed very soon. East-west road will be completed. The deep blue sea project is in the south. The Lagos-Ibadan rail was started and commissioned. The Lagos-Ibadan expressway is also going on smoothly. So many projects in the south. Without fear of any contradiction, we will benefit more if the president comes from the south.\u201d",

          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "CAR becomes first African country to legalise crypto",
          "text": "The Central African Republic (CAR) has just become the first African country to adopt bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\nThe Parliament of the Central African Republic (CAR) today voted unanimously to sign a bill that will recognise Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency as national legal tender, according to a statement posted to the country\u2019s presidential Facebook page. After El Salvador, CAR is just the second country in the world to legalise it.\n\nThe bill was earlier proposed by Gourna Zacko, CAR\u2019s Minister of Digital Economy, and Calixte Nganongo, CAR\u2019s former Minister of Finance and Budget. Last week, lawmakers adopted proposals to facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies and create regulatory bodies to oversee the use and adoption as well. At Parliament earlier today, the draft bill was officially adopted and will soon be signed into law.\n\n\u201cWith cryptocurrency, there is no more control of the Central Bank. You have your money, you send it to an investor for a business, you receive it in any currency, you can dispose of it in Dollar, Euro, CFA, or Naira,\u201d said Zacko, according to a report by iAfrikan.\n\nHow popular is crypto?\n\nAlthough bitcoin has gained worldwide popularity and usage in the past decade\u2014with global adoption growing by 2300% since 2019 and 103 countries allowing crypto trading\u2014governments and regulators worldwide are still debating its safety. At least 9 countries, including China and Qatar, have absolute bans on crypto, while 42 others have levied other forms of prohibition.\n\nFour African countries\u2014Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia\u2014have banned all forms of crypto trading, while 7 including Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon have some forms of prohibition regarding crypto trading.\n\nThese governments have cited numerous reasons for the bans from fraud and money laundering to tax evasion and terrorist financing.\n\nThese prohibitions, however, do not mean that crypto adoption amongst citizens isn\u2019t growing in these countries. In its 2021 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report, Chainanalysis reported that Africa\u2019s cryptocurrency market grew by over 1200% between 2020 and 2021. Kenya, Nigeria, Togo, South Africa, Ghana, and Tanzania are also featured in its Top 20 Global Crypto Adoption Index. In fact, Kenya is leading the continent in peer-to-peer crypto trading.\n\nChainanalysis\u2019 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report\n\nThis is what makes the CAR\u2019s adoption an interesting feat. The country hasn\u2019t topped any charts, the highest crypto transactions don\u2019t originate from it. In fact, at 11%, CAR has the fifth-lowest internet penetration rate in Africa, and this brings into question the feasibility of crypto adoption in the country. As of 2020, only 48% of its population had access to mobile connections, while less than 2.8% were connected to social media. Unlike mobile money, trading, storing and transacting with cryptocurrencies require both smartphone and internet connections, both of which the CAR is low on.\n\nCentral African Republic's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender is interesting.\n\n\n\nIf they manage to do transactions via USSD, this might just work. Not sure how BEAC (central bank for 6 central African countries that use XAF currency tied to Euro) will react. pic.twitter.com/mUvxrgfhNA \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) April 27, 2022\n\nWhile CAR remains the first and only African country to legalise cryptocurrency for now, other African countries are rushing towards another form of digital currencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) which are digital representations of fiat currencies and unlike crypto, can be regulated by their central banks.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nDid you know Margaret Thatcher? Born on October 13, 1925, she was the only British Prime Minister in the twentieth century to win three consecutive terms.\n\nSignificantly, she accelerated the evolution of the British economy from statism to liberalism and became the most renowned British political leader since Winston Churchill, both in terms of personality and achievement.\n\nOn this day in 1979, Margaret Thatcher of the Conservative Party was elected British Prime Minister, becoming the first woman in Europe to hold that position; she later became the longest continuously serving British premier since 1827.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that I\u2019ve enlightened or reminded you of history, here\u2019s what I\u2019ll be talking about today:\n\nBank of Uganda warns crypto traders\n\nMental health care over data privacy\n\nSafaricom to protect customers\u2019 personal info\n\nBank of Uganda warns crypto traders\n\nThe Bank of Uganda (BOU) has urged all licenced companies under the National Payments Systems Act not to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions because crypto is not recognised as legal tender.\n\nWhat does this mean? This means that owners of such financial assets are not protected if their holdings lose value. Also, the BOU said that no institution has been authorised to sell or facilitate the trade in cryptocurrencies.\n\nRing a bell? In February 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) banned banks and other licenced financial institutions from handling cryptocurrency transactions and threatened severe penalties for violations.\n\nTo reduce demand for other digital tokens, Nigeria launched its virtual currency, the eNaira, backed by the CBN.\n\nYou can read this for more details: eNaira: How much control does a private blockchain give the CBN?\n\nBut did the ban stop Nigerians from trading cryptocurrencies? Keep in mind that recently, in April 2022, Access Bank was slammed with a \u20a6500 million ($1.2 million) fine, Stanbic IBTC was fined \u20a6200 million ($481,000), while United Bank for Africa (UBA) had to pay \u20a6100 million ($240,000) because some crypto-related transactions slipped through without the banks detecting it.\n\nInterestingly, Paxful reveals that Nigeria is second only to the US in bitcoin trading. Also, Statista shows that Nigeria has the highest per capita rate of crypto ownership globally, at 31.9% in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, will the BOU\u2019s warning deter Ugandans from trading? If you want to share your thoughts on this, please share your thoughts in the comments section.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Uganda\u2019s monetary authorities claim that cryptocurrencies make it simple for criminals to use such assets for money laundering, the sale of illegal goods and services, and fraudulent ventures such as Ponzi and pyramid schemes.\n\nBut how true is that? Recall that last week, The Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt Bitcoin as a reference currency in a bid to put the country\u2019s plan for economic recovery and peacebuilding on track.\n\nSo, is Uganda implying that the CAR government is ignorant or didn\u2019t do their homework before adopting Bitcoin as legal tender?\n\nIn today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, the editorial team had an interesting discussion about CAR\u2019s Bitcoin adoption. Bolu also has his reservations about the subject. You can listen to it here.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Fisayo Fosudo\u2019s escapades in tech and finance to Hillary Omitogun\u2019s journey as a Web3 UX researcher at Nestcoin, we have a star-studded line-up of speakers at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022).\n\nTickets are selling out fast, save a seat for yourself here.\n\nMental health care over data privacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens to your data when you die?\n\nMay is Mental Health Awareness Month in the United States. This could be why Mozilla\u2019s study on mental health and prayer apps was released yesterday, May 2, 2022. The report contained the findings of an analysis of 32 mental health and religious applications.\n\nEssentially, these apps frequently deal with sensitive topics like depression, mental health awareness, anxiety, domestic violence, PTSD, and religious-themed services.\n\nWhat did the company discover? It revealed a startling disregard for user security and privacy in mental health and prayer apps. This implies that users\u2019 privacy is less protected in mental health and prayer apps than most other apps.\n\nSeriously, I\u2019m worried because I use 3 \u2014 7 Cups, Bearable, and Better Help \u2014 out of the 32 apps. What does this mean for me? Is my data at risk? On the flip side is the ever golden question: Are Africans concerned about data privacy and security?\n\nShall we take a poll to determine this? Interestingly, the editorial team discussed this in today\u2019s podcast. Team Ogheneruemu believes that Africans care about their data but lack alternatives, whereas team Oluwanifemi believes that most Africans do not care at all.\n\nWhat\u2019s your opinion? Do you care about your data or not? Leave your response in the comment section.\n\nBack to the story, according to Mozilla\u2019s latest *Privacy Not Included guide, despite the sensitive information these apps handle, they \u201croutinely share data, allow weak passwords, target vulnerable users with personalised ads, and feature vague and poorly written privacy policies,\u201d\n\nHow? Jen Caltrider, the Mozilla guide lead, said the apps are exceptionally creepy because \u201cthey track, share, and capitalise on users\u2019 most intimate personal thoughts and feelings, like moods, mental state, and biometric data.\u201d\n\nAlso, 29 of the 32 mental health and prayer apps reviewed received a \u201cprivacy not included\u201d warning label, indicating that the team was concerned about how the app managed user data.\n\nWhile mental health care is becoming popular in Africa, does this mean we are better off sticking to traditional mental health care? Especially considering the stigma and flack people get for going that route.\n\nEven though these apps typically make mental health care more accessible, the report suggests that access to mental health care may come at the expense of privacy. Still, once again, who cares about privacy? Will you choose data privacy over your mental health or vice-versa?\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent.

Banks already use this when sending debit or credit alerts to avoid disclosing client information.\n\nPreviously, the company claimed that people who pay for goods and services leave their phone numbers and names with thousands of merchants who use personal information like phone numbers and purchasing habits to send unsolicited advertising via text messages.\n\nAlso, in violation of Kenya\u2019s Data Protection Act passed in 2019, the information can be sold to third parties without consent.\n\nMoreover, this follows the discovery that more than a fifth of Kenyan businesses shared financial and personal information about their customers without their consent.\n\nPer a survey conducted by Ernst & Young, 41% of firms transferred client data to third-party service providers, while more than 53% of these companies did not seek customer approval.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nHere are the confirmed speakers for the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge is sourcing ventures building or interested in leveraging the Cardano blockchain platform and community.

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa\u2019s audience directly. Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook holding company Meta has gotten off to a rough start in its efforts to create a metaverse as popular as its flagship platform. The company lost an estimated $10 billion in 2021 on metaverse-related initiatives alone, and its share price has plummeted.\n\nUndeterred, Chinese tech goliath ByteDance is busy planning a metaverse of its own, tentatively poised as an Eastern-inflected version of Meta\u2019s effort. Both companies have invested huge amounts in VR hardware\u2014Facebook by acquiring Oculus for a reported $2 billion, ByteDance through a $1.4 billion acquisition of Chinese headset manufacturer Pico. Both have followed roughly the same playbook, hoping that an early foothold in the looming contest of metaverses will secure a large and loyal customer base for their commercial offerings.\n\nMushe (XMU) recently made a less publicized announcement of its own planned metaverse, but the details should interest anyone interested in virtual commercialization. Like its better-known peers, the MusheVerse will feature a marketplace for virtual goods, including virtual land and NFTs. It also allows users to earn XMJ tokens for gaming, employing a play-to-earn model alongside a reward incentive program.\n\nBut the MusheVerse are on a groundbreaking journey that rival metaverses dare not emulate: offering full financial integration with other metaverses. Its governing Mushe Token (XMU) is designed to be compatible with multiple blockchains and metaverses. This makes the MusheVerse both a compelling metaverse in its own right and a hub for users to explore whatever metaverse they choose, safe in the knowledge that their existing cryptocurrency holdings will be honored wherever they go.\n\nXMU will also integrate with fiat-based financial services, Mushe\u2019s roadmap mentions a partnership with a digital banking app which will make a long-sought-after bridge between financial realms. Mushe\u2019s flexibility and interoperability have already earned the attention of savvy investors: as of this writing, XMU has risen more than threefold in the first two weeks of its presale, giving investors reason to expect an enormous return when the currency officially launches on July 4, 2022.\n\nThis study in contrast is as fresh as the idea of the metaverse and as old as commerce. On the one hand, Facebook and ByteDance are seeking to develop large, highly detailed, largely proprietary metaverses centred around their commercial interests. On the other hand, Mushe World is developing the MusheVerse on the principle that metaverses, and the currencies used within them, should be traversed as freely and easily as possible. Early returns suggest that investors find the MusheVerse more compelling at the moment, and a more interesting long-term proposition as well.\n\nLearn more about Mushe (XMU)\n\n\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.mushe.world/\n\nPresale Registration: https://portal.mushe.world/sign-up\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/MusheWorldXMU\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Mushe_World\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mushe_world/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

A total of 39 percent of respondent banks now invest at least three million dollars yearly for digital transformation and innovation.\n\nOn the effect of COVID-19, the report shows that the pandemic accelerated the shift in the banks\u2019 model as it highlighted the many limitations they were facing.\n\nOut of the African banks who participated in the survey, 49 percent said that they had greatly increased the speed of implementation because of Covid-19. Some banks were already trying to transition from the traditional model before the pandemic, due to the emergence of new competition on the part of African fintech and pure digital players.\n\nWhile 81 percent described themselves as being open to change. \u201cIn this context, it is no surprise that the need to transform banking practices seems widely accepted,\u201d the report stated.\n\nRead also: How banks allocated credit to sectors in three months\n\nHowever, one of the challenges is the lack of inclusion of African small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the new digital platforms and the banking system in general.\n\nThe report stated that Indeed, SMEs are often afraid of the huge fees that banks usually charge. Being unable to address these potential customers represents a missed opportunity for banks, even more so in the digital era where SMEs are being lured by the new fintech players.\n\nWhile some lenders have adopted strategies to address these issues, experts say their efforts could be an inspiration to the industry.\n\nRegarding challenges faced by the banking industry, the lack of a skilled workforce is viewed as the biggest threat. This is cited by 46 percent of participants in the survey.\n\nTelecom companies entering the industry to provide financial services are considered a bigger threat to banks\u2019 market share than the rise of fintechs and challenger banks.\n\nThe report stated that it is widely accepted that digitalization can solve many of the structural problems that exist in access to finance in Africa and banks still have a huge role to play to spread financial inclusion, including in the business-to-business segment.",

It is killing us and sometimes it looks like nobody is doing anything about it because the situation is worsening. I know the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, has set up a joint industry committee to address that. They have a plan and we want to key into that plan,\u201d he said.\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cWe all have a duty to ensure that we leave a better world to our children. We do not need to wait for the government because everyone has a role to play. Beyond all of this, we must be something to our communities and society.\u201d\n\nAhmed said that NSML has a new plastic campaign initiative that it has started to enable the cleaning of the waterfront.\n\nRead also: New report faults FG, states on housing, proposes devt fund\n\n\u201cOur vessels already operate according to international standards when it comes to risk management. On a quarterly basis, we embark on that clean-up exercise,\u201d he said.\n\nAhmed further said that NSML has been reaching out to the community around the Bonny Terminal to clean up their waterfront as well because NSML is not the only one in the waterway.\n\nTo him, collaborating with the communities around the Bonny Terminal to clean up the waterways will enable NSML to drive a huge industry campaign aimed at addressing the source of the plastics, educating people on the menace of plastics, and doing something to clean up.\n\n\u201cWe hope to come out fully on that this year. For us, it is being driven by three A \u2013 including awareness, advocacy, and action. Awareness means educating people because a lot of people still do not understand the impact of plastics. It is about creating that awareness on the impact of plastics and educating people on how to dispose of plastics in a way that it will not be harmful to the environment,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further said that the exercise is also about advocacy on the part of government and the society so that actions can be taken when relevant, in order to recognise plastics as a danger to the waterway.\n\nAhmed also said that the third represents action where everyone is expected to do their bits to keep the environment clean.",

We will link education with street begging and street children.\n\n\u201cIn the next few weeks or months, we will not allow street begging in Edo anymore. We have farm settlements and we need hands and labour to cultivate foods.

We will make sure those hard-to-reach areas in the riverine communities will have teachers to teach the children. We are training them now to work in those communities,\u201d he added.\n\nCharging the Muslim faithful on tolerance, Obaseki stated, \u201cWe all must learn to be tolerant to be able to overcome the economic pressure in the land.\n\n\u201cAs a government, we will never deceive our people because the people gave us power through the electoral process to lead them.\n\n\u201cOur administration is working hard to create more jobs and opportunities for the people of the State and ensure life is better for them. We are also creating a peaceful environment, infrastructure and security to make the State safe.\u201d\n\nReassuring that his administration will continue to use resources of the state for the growth and development of Edo, the governor added, \u201cAs a government, we will continue to emphasize that government money is not for few politicians but for the generality of the public and will not be used for politicians but for the people. We will continue to work for the people of Edo State, not for a few politicians.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Chief Imam of Benin Central Mosque, Alhaji Abdulfatai Enabulele commended the governor for his developmental strides across all sectors of the state, hailing him for his efforts at ending street begging in the state.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

You also engaged in capacity building as you interchanged skills and made your colleagues here locally improve their knowledge. They have learned new ways of doing things. You have brought a new way of commitment and dedication to duty.\n\n\u201cYou have fulfilled your call of service to humanity as the team restored lives during this mission by providing free medical service.\u201d\n\nThe governor noted that the activities of ANPA in Edo State have helped the government rethink the issue of brain drain, adding, \u201cYou are in the position to help us tackle brain drain. This mission has been so helpful as I believe that we can do two missions per year. Your services to Edo people are invaluable to the healthcare regeneration of our state and country at large.\u201d\n\nHe further stated, \u201cTo transform or reform any healthcare system in the world, we must focus on the people. It\u2019s about the quality of human capacity and development. I am grateful to God that we have you. We need to organise ourselves to receive the value you are ready to give us.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Ehanire has commended the collaboration between ANPA and the state government, noting, \u201cNigeria suffers from brain drains as the country\u2019s medical personnel have left to practice abroad. It\u2019s difficult to stop them despite several plans as it affects not only Nigeria but across the globe.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI applaud the plan for telemedicine which has been experimented in America during the COVID-19 era with the help of technology which became very useful over there. Technology allows for virtual consultation between experts in the Diaspora and their patients here in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe would like to institutionalize such a relationship to enable us share knowledge and skills and begin to develop the health sector here in Nigeria. We are waiting for the signature of the president to create the National Health Insurance Commission that will make health insurance mandatory for all Nigerians and increase the physical space for health.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Onyema Nwachukwu, its spokesperson, on Tuesday, noted that the decision of the separatist group to commit the act against an Igbo daughter in Private Mathew, was evidence of its acts of terrorism against the Igbo.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army (NA), on Saturday 30 April 2022 received information on the gruesome, barbaric and most despicable manner in which members of the Indigenous People of Biafra(IPOB) and its armed affiliate, Eastern Security Network(ESN) murdered in cold blood, two soldiers Master Warrant Officer (MWO) Audu M Linus (retired) and Private(Pte)Gloria Matthew, who were on transit to Imo state for their traditional wedding. Apparently, the soldiers had embarked on the trip to fulfill the traditional rites of conjugating their matrimony, as the very well respected and cherished Igbo tradition demands,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cIronically, the fact that one of the soldiers, Pte Gloria Matthew who hails from Nkwerre LGA of Imo state, has an ethnic affiliation with the good people of South East Nigeria did not prevail on the sensibility of the dissidents.\n\n\u201cThis dastardly act, one too many, clearly portends the deep seated hate, desperation and lawlessness with which foot soldiers of IPOB/ESN have being unleashing terror on Ndigbo, whom they claim they are on a mission to protect and emancipate, as well as other innocent Nigerians who are resident or transiting the South East.\n\n\u201cThis gruesome murder, in which they did not spare even their own child, clearly depicts callousness, impenitence and is indisputably, a brazen act of terrorism perpetrated by IPOB/ESN.\n\n\u201cThough the dissident groups have continued to live in denial, while masquerading as unknown gunmen in their criminal violent campaign in the region, the NA will ensure the perpetrators of this dastardly act unleashed on its personnel do not go unpunished. While we deeply condole with the families, relations and close associates of the victims, the NA has commenced investigation to unmask and bring the criminals to book.\n\n\u201cMembers of the public are please enjoined to oblige security agencies actionable information that will lead to the arrest of these criminals.\u201d",

          "text": "Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has urged the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to probe Abubakar Malami, the Attorney General of the Federation and the Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), who allegedly distributed over 200 exotic sport utility vehicles to politicians in Kebbi State to influence the May governorship primary of the All Progressives Congress in the state.\n\nHURIWA, in a statement by its National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, said it is illegal enough that Malami declared his ambition to succeed Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi in May 2023, without resigning his position as a minister according to the Electoral Act.\n\nThe group described as untenable and diversionary, Malami\u2019s denial that it was his friends and associates who donated and distributed the vehicles just as the rights group challenged the Federal Attorney General and Minister of Justice to publish the list of his friends that donated those cars as he reportedly claimed and also furnish Nigerians with the receipts of purchases of the vehicles so Nigerians from all over the world can easily make an inquiry from the sellers if they are overseas. HURIWA said it is relying on the Freedom Of Information Act to make the demand public.\n\nIn a statement after the photos of the lush vehicles went viral, Malami\u2019s spokesman, Umar Gwandu, claimed, \u201cIt was friends and associates of Malami who donated and distributed vehicles to long term workers in the Khadimiyya Foundation.\u201d\n\nHowever, HURIWA\u2019s Onwubiko said, \u201cThe excuse of the AGF through his aide is the same ambiguous and one-sided strategy that all politicians use during campaigns.\n\n\u201cThey use phantom groups as an alleged shield to divert what is alleged to be ill-gotten money and fund campaign expenses, as corroborated by Transparency International recently which raised the alarm that support groups use stolen funds to purchase exotic cars for party delegates and party forms politicians.\n\n\u201cIt is very suspicious that the so-called chief law officer who has been in charge of the recovery of foreign loots including those of the late Sani Abacha and James Ibori is involved in this bogus donation of cars to party delegates even if remotely through his affiliates and friends.\n\n\u201cHe could have dissuaded those so-called friends not to proceed with this illegality given his frontline role as the Premier Cabinet-level officer in the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari that lay claims to fighting corruption.\n\n\u201cThe EFCC must probe Malami and his so-called friends whose names are not mentioned by the AGF\u2019s spokesman. Who are they? What is their pedigree to afford 200 lush SUVs?\n\n\u201cThe anti-corruption agency must quit its keeping cool whilst ministers like Malami allegedly fritter millions buying cars for delegates, buying nomination forms. So we aren\u2019t indicating the minister of Justice but we are of the humble opinion that there have to be FULL DISCLOSURES on the donors if any.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to state that the EFCC is complicit in corruption by refusing to probe the Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba; Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige; Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi; and other serving ministers, governors, and appointees who have purchased the exorbitant N100 million nomination and expression of interest forms of the ruling APC.\n\n\u201cThe silence and inaction of the Rasheed Bawa-led EFCC can instigate a big protest worst than EndSARS if nothing is done to reassure Nigerians that EFCC and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission are not already hijacked by corrupt politicians.\u201d\n\nHURIWA further slammed President Muhammadu Buhari for failing to compel his appointees to comply with the provision in the Electoral Act that demands that political appointees should resign before pursuing any electoral ambition.\n\nSection 84(12) of the Electoral Act reads, \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nHURIWA said even without any clearly stated statute, it is unethical for those who still enjoy public salaries to divert the resources and time for which the public pays them as servants of the people as ministers to engage in the selfish pursuit of political aspiration.\n\nOnwubiko added, \u201cIt is not surprising that the same AGF had gone to court surreptitiously as alleged by some persons in the corridors of power and even some sources in government who wouldn\u2019t speak publicly for fear of retribution from the powerful minister who single-handedly railroaded the EFCC Chairman into office and allegedly lobbied (We are not alleging bribery) Justice Evelyn Anyadike of the Federal High Court in Umuahia, Abia State, to nullify the section of the amended Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cThe alleged action of the AGF if found out by the government investigators like the Nigeria Police Force or EFCC turns out to be true then it is illegal and then it would be regarded as a clear case of a hidden agenda laced with corrupt motives.\u201d",

          "text": "By Angela Atabo\n\nThe Director-General of the Hope \u201923 Yahaya Bello Campaign Council, Hafsat Abiola-Costello has said no candidate is better positioned for the 2023 presidency than Gov. Yahaya Bello of Kogi.\n\nAbiola-Costello, who is also the daughter of the acclaimed winner of the 1993 presidential election, late Chief MKO Abiola, made this known on Tuesday in an interview with newsmen in Abuja.\n\nShe rolled out reasons Yahaya Bello remained Nigeria\u2019s best bet in the forth-coming 2023 presidential election.\n\nShe explained that 30 years after June 12, Bello was in the Presidential race to restore the truncated hope of Nigerians, especially that of the youth, women and the vulnerable.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, the people that are truly marginalised in Nigeria are the women and the young people. And, if there is any moral obligation, it is to them that it is owed.\n\n\u201cWho led the fight against June 12, against the annulment? Was it not the students, the young people? Where were they in 1999 after the whole fight, where were they placed, can we say nowhere?\n\n\u201cWhen I look at all these events, the kidnappings and all now, it is clear to me that this is a revolt of young people of Nigeria, that they have had enough.\n\n\u201cMany of them are revolting in ways that we do not endorse because they have had enough of being marginalized in their own country.\n\n\u201cIf the country will not use them for good, they will use themselves for bad,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Abiola-Costello, there is no candidate better positioned to harness the potentials of young people in Nigeria than Bello.\n\nShe said that Bello had signaled the youth that \u201cNigeria is for them, that they are the ones that should be in charge and young people and women in Nigeria are ready to lead.\u201d\n\nShe said that there was no longer room excuses.\n\nThe director-general, while further explaining reason Bello was the best choice for Nigeria\u2019s Presidency, said that he had demonstrated transparency, credibility and accountability as governor of Kogi, an action which had been recognized over and over again by the World Bank.\n\nShe noted that Kogi, being given such ranking by the World Bank, dismissed all other misinformation about finances being peddled by political opponents.\n\n\u201cFirst the governor is an accountant, and he actually is one of the few state governors in Nigeria that the World Bank has certified his transparency in finances.\n\n\u201cI do not know any other state that the World Bank has given his ranking.\n\n\u201cSo, we can safely say that if this kind of international agency has evaluated him, the work of the state in the management of resources and not found it to be wanting.\n\n\u201cIt means that there is really no credibility to the idea that he is mismanaging the state,\u201d she said.\n\nAbiola-Costello added that Bello was someone that did not like to take loans as he had been carefully managing the resources of the state by the IGR of the state he built .\n\n\u201cWhen he came on board, it was N350 million, he has built it to N2billion. And his own intention is to build the capacity of the state to grow wealth,\u201d she added.\n\nOn boosting the economy, Abiola-Castello said that Bello also succeeded in making Kogi investment friendly, which had wooed good investors to the state.\n\nShe explained that the governor, in a bid to achieve his aim, set up a business council made up some of the most successful businessmen in Nigeria, not just in Kogi.\n\nShe said that the council had been guiding the government on policies and practices that would encourage business investments.\n\n\u201cSignificantly, His Excellency has brought business to the state, you know Confluence Rice, and other significant investment he has been making in the Rice Value Chain.\n\n\u201cHe understands that one of the big assets in the state is agriculture. But he does not want us to just be restricted to farming but to look also at the value addition in farming. So significant resources in the state have been invested in that regard,\u201d she said.\n\nAbiola-Costello said that there was also the investment agency of the state to help potential investors to go through all the process so that everything is made easy for them.\n\nShe added that Bello set up a business council made up of some of the most successful businessmen in Nigeria, not just in Kogi.\n\nShe said that those people had been guiding the government on policies and practices that would encourage business investments and it has been working.\n\nShe said that it was with it that the state\u2019s IGR grew to almost N2billion before the pandemic,(NAN)(www.nannews.ng)",

          "text": "Members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) have been charged by the Nigerian Army of killing two soldiers in Imo State.\n\nA.M Linus, a Master Warrant Officer in the army, and his Private officer wife, Pte Gloria Matthew, were shot and beheaded on Saturday, according to NEWS DIRECT.\n\nThe gunmen are claimed to have mocked the couple\u2019s family members after beheading them.\n\nNEWS DIRECT obtained a graphic video of the incident, which showed the gunmen placing the victims\u2019 heads on their chests following the shooting.\n\nA phone chat with the suspected gunman has also appeared online, said to have been initiated by a friend of the dead female soldier.\n\nIn the phone conversation, obtained by our reporter, a suspected gunman admitted that he killed the couple.\n\nThe gunman said they were aggrieved that the military has been consistently killing innocent residents in efforts to attack them (gunmen).\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite unfortunate that it is this way. I killed both of them yesterday,\u201d the suspected gunman was heard saying in the phone conversation.\n\n\n\nReacting to the incident, army spokesperson, Onyema Nwachukwu said the \u201cdastardly act, one too many, clearly portends the deep-seated hate, desperation and lawlessness with which foot soldiers of IPOB/ESN have been unleashing terror on Ndigbo, whom they claim they are on a mission to protect and emancipate, as well as other innocent Nigerians who are resident or transiting the South East.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added, \u201cThe Nigerian Army (NA), on Saturday 30 April 2022 received information on the gruesome, barbaric and most despicable manner in which members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its armed affiliate, Eastern Security Network(ESN) murdered in cold blood, two soldiers Master Warrant Officer (MWO) Audu M Linus (retired) and Private(Pte)Gloria Matthew, who were on transit to Imo state for their traditional wedding.\n\n\n\n\u201cApparently, the soldiers had embarked on the trip to fulfil the traditional rites of conjugating their matrimony, as the very well respected and cherished Igbo tradition demands.\n\n\n\n\u201cIronically, the fact that one of the soldiers, Pte Gloria Matthew who hails from Nkwerre LGA of Imo state, has an ethnic affiliation with the good people of South-East Nigeria did not prevail on the sensibility of the dissidents.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis gruesome murder, in which they did not spare even their own child, clearly depicts callousness, impenitence and is indisputable, a brazen act of terrorism perpetrated by IPOB/ESN.\n\n\n\n\u201cThough the dissident groups have continued to live in denial, while masquerading as unknown gunmen in their criminal violent campaign in the region, the NA will ensure the perpetrators of this dastardly act unleashed on its personnel do not go unpunished. While we deeply condole with the families, relations and close associates of the victims, the NA has commenced investigation to unmask and bring the criminals to book.\n\n\n\n\u201cMembers of the public are please enjoined to oblige security agencies actionable information that will lead to the arrest of these criminals.\u201d\n\n\n\nAttacks by armed men have increased in the South-East in recent times. The attacks often target security agencies and government facilities.\n\n\n\nIPOB, an outlawed group, has been linked to the deadly attacks in the region. But the group has repeatedly denied its involvement in the attacks.\n\n\n\nThe leader of the group, Nnamdi Kanu, is currently detained in Abuja where he is facing trial for treason.",

          "title": "2023: Osinbajo Divides RCCG As Pastor Calls For Sack Of Colleague Who Campaigned For Him",
          "text": "Dr. Oche Otorkpa, a Youth Pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, has called on the church\u2019s leadership to fire Pastor Timothy Olaniyan, the church\u2019s Head of Politics and Governance, who campaigned for Vice President Prof. Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nIt will be noted that at a public function over the weekend, Olaniyan openly stated his support for Osinbajo.\n\nAs a pastor of the RCCG, he believes Osinbajo will keep his election promise.\n\nHowever, in response to Olaniyan\u2019s remark, Otorkpa urged that he be fired.\n\nHe said in the statement: \u201cI was saddened when my attention was drawn to the statement credited to the Head of Politics and Governance of the Redeemed Christian Church, RCCG, \u2018Pastor\u2019 Timothy Olaniyan. This act reminds me of the tragedy promoted by many of my colleagues in the Redeemed Christian Church of God, who used the RCCG altar to promote Buhari as the only savior of Nigeria because Osinbajo also a Redeemed Pastor, was his running mate.\n\n\u201cAgainst all admonition by our father the General Overseer, these pastors choose to ignore an express order and promoted Buhari/Osinbajo using the RCCG pulpit in 2015 and the results are what we see today.\n\n\u201cWhile I have nothing personal against Osinbajo and those campaigning for him, our father, the General Overseer has made it clear to everyone that the church is a congregation of all parties and all are his children.\n\n\u201cIf truly the said \u2018Pastor\u2019 Timothy Olaniyan voiced such a one-sided opinion, then he should be ashamed of himself, and the many people who insulted Leke (Adeboye, the son of the General Overseer of the RCCG, Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye) for calling such people goats should apologize to him because this man\u2019s action has not only ridiculed the mission but also the reputation of our father in the Lord.\n\n\u201cAs one of those who fiercely defended the RCCG when concerned Nigerians labeled the newly created Politics and Governance directorate as an Osinbajo campaign arm of the church, I felt I owe it a duty as an ordained minister and someone who has spent close to 3 decades working to help achieve the church\u2019s missionary objectives, to speak out.\n\n\u201cHow can a Redeemed Pastor, saddled with the responsibility of promoting all, insist on a public forum that one person is the only child of God that could change the narrative of governance in Nigeria?\n\n\u201cThis is someone who says he wants to consolidate Buhari\u2019s legacies, a legacy characterized by banditry, kidnappings, massive killings, corruption, stealing and diversion of crude oil, unfulfilled promises, and borrowings that are about to throw us into a state of bankruptcy as a nation.\n\n\u201cPastor Olaniyan claimed that politicians will promise heaven and earth, and at the end of the day, you see them giving N1000, N2000 to eligible voters. That was similar to what Osibanjo did the last time with Trader money prior to the elections, jumping from one market to the other.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to failed promises, nobody beats Osinbajo and Buhari. They promised three million jobs per year, it is almost 8 years, and those who have jobs before they came to power are now jobless.\n\n\u201cOsinbajo and Buhari promised 20,000 MW of electricity within four years, but today, grid collapse and darkness are what Nigerians are battling.\n\n\u201cWhen Osinbajo and Buhari came to power on the 29th of May 2015, the naira was exchanged at N199 to the dollar. Today, the naira is exchanging at almost N600 when they promised to make it equal to the dollar.\n\n\u201cAs I write this response, our youths and children are at home due to the ongoing ASUU strike, Osinbajo and Buhari had promised to give up to 20 percent of the national budget for the educational sector, they have never exceeded 6% since they took power.

          "text": "The Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) Monday said the inalienable right to access and disseminate information through an independent press is under attack in Nigeria.\n\nThe body therefore called for an urgent need to protect the media, saying \u201cdemocracy is in danger when a free press is threatened.\u201d\n\nThe NGE made the position known in a statement to commemorate the World Press Freedom Day(WPFD) observed May 3 every year.\n\nA statement by the NGE President Mustapha Isah and General Secretary Iyobosa Uwugiaren, said \u201cwhile the threat to the media freedom in Nigeria is real, the impact on the state of democracy in the country will be very dangerous, if not checked.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday is a day globally, to remind governments of the need to respect their commitment to press freedom. It is also a day of reflection among journalists and other media professionals about issues of press freedom and professional ethics.\n\n\u201cWe need to remind governments at all levels in Nigeria that a free and independent media that can keep the people informed and hold leaders accountable, is essential for a strong and sustainable democracy, including free and fair elections. Without it, Nigerians cannot make informed decisions about how they are governed; and address human rights abuses, corruption and abuse of power,\u201d the editors stated.\n\nThe Guild further said its members were concerned that \u201celected leaders in Nigeria, who should be press freedom\u2019s dependable protectors, have made several overt attempts to silence the media voices through proposed legislations that clearly seek to criminalise journalism practice in the country.\u201d\n\nThe editors added that \u201capart from the regular attacks on journalists carrying out their legitimate editorial assignments by overzealous security agents, the current attempts to criminalise journalism practice in the country through obnoxious proposed laws, the suffocating economic environment and harsh political/economic policies of the federal government, have in the past few years, made it almost impossible for the media sector to carry out its constitutional responsibility for the benefit of the citizens.\u201d\n\nIt therefore said \u201cthere is an urgent need to protect the media; because the impact of the suffocating economic and political environment being created by the government will be very dangerous to our democracy. A threat to the media is a threat to our democracy.\n\n\u201cGovernments at all levels must take the lead in making sure that their actions do not inspire violations of press freedom. A democratic society like Nigeria should know that it has a crucial role to play in maintaining media freedom and facilitating access to public information.\n\n\u201cGovernment should regularly take strong and immediate action against any violations of media freedom \u2013 this should include speaking out against violence against journalists and authorities\u2019 failure/refusal to identify and prosecute attackers.\u201d\n\nThe NGE also called on the federal government to make newsprints, broadcast equipment and all other consumables in the media sector tax-free, in order to save the media from total collapse.\n\n\u201cThe media is a strong pillar of democracy; it is the oxygen of the democratic space; and there is urgent need by the federal government to make intervention to save it from collapsing,\u201d the editors added.\n\nBuhari cautions\n\nAlso speaking on the WPFD, President Muhammadu Buhari lauded the role of the Nigerian media in strengthening democracy.\n\nHe also commended the courage and determination of those who daily go the extra time, sometimes at great personal risks, to keep the society well informed.\n\nIn fostering the pursuit of journalism in the country, the president reiterated the Nigerian government\u2019s commitment to freedom of the press, pledging to continue ensuring the protection of the rights and privileges of journalists in the lawful performance of their professional duties.\n\nHe charged the Nigerian Press to use the WPFD to reflect on the need to embrace the best professional standards and practices, especially in the build-up to the forthcoming general elections.\n\nHe said the free performance of media roles and responsibilities during the electoral process is as important as the sanctity and will of Nigerians, expressed through the ballot box.\n\nWith the elections in sight, he urged the media \u201cto be mindful of sponsored political news or publications capable of inciting hatred, division, violence, and chaos in the country, while also ensuring that the electoral umpire and other stakeholders play their roles in delivering free, fair, credible and transparent elections to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe must stay united in supporting media professionals who work hard to de-escalate violent conflict and promote peaceful societies without compromising the responsibility to report.\u201d\n\nThe president also urged government information managers to ensure the press and the general public have access to facts and figures of government information, without tears.\n\nIn line with the theme of this year\u2019s World Press Freedom Day, \u201dJournalism under digital siege,\u201d President Buhari assured that government agencies under his watch would always stand against actions capable of limiting the preservation of the freedom of the Press guaranteed by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nHe said the federal government was working hard to support media organisations in Nigeria through provision of better internet access to underserved communities, and achieve 95 per cent digital literacy by 2030.\n\nHe thanked \u201cmembers of the Fourth Estate of the Realm whose diligent work help in guaranteeing peace, stability, and progress in the country.\u201d\n\nIPI Nigeria holds symposium\n\nAnd as part of the activities marking the day, the International Press Institute (IPI) Nigeria will hold a one-day symposium in collaboration with the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ).\n\nA statement by IPI Nigeria Secretary Ahmed I. Shekarau said the symposium holds Friday, May 6, 2022, at the National Press Centre, Radio House, Area 8, Garki, Abuja.\n\nThe statement said a former Director General of the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), Prof. Tonnie Iredia, would be the guest speaker at the symposium.\n\nThe statement said further that Prof. Iredia, who is now a lecturer in Mass Communication at the Nasarawa state University, will speak on \u201cWhat Journalists and Media in Nigeria Need to Do to Keep Safe, Retain Credibility and be Sustainable.\u201d\n\nThe statement lists as panelists to discuss the former NTA DG\u2019s presentation, the Senior Special Assistant on Media to the First Lady, Hon. Muhammad Sani Zorro; President of the National Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ), Mrs. Ladi Bala and the Nigeria Police Force Public Relations Officer, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi.\n\nThe panel discussion, according to the statement, will be moderated by the Editor-in-Chief of LEADERSHIP, Mr. Azubuike Ishiekwene.\n\nAccording to the statement, the event to be graced by top media leaders, editors and reporters, kicks off at 10am.\n\nIt also announced that provision has been made for remote participation by stakeholders who may not be at the venue of the event. The Zoom link for virtual participation is as follows: https://us06web.zoom.us/j/87905583791?pwd=dnpuV3NRM2RjdEd5QVhqV2E2cVEzdz09\n\nMeeting ID: 879 0558 3791\n\nPasscode: qV94NB\n\n356 media freedom attacks\n\nIn a related development the International Press Institute (IPI) has documented 356 attacks on journalists, acts of censorship and serious violations of media freedom since the beginning of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, according to the latest figures.\n\nPublished ahead of World Press Freedom Day May 3, the data from IPI\u2019s Ukraine War Press Freedom Tracker underscores the devastating toll the conflict has already taken on independent journalism, media freedom and the safety of journalists in both countries.\n\nSeven journalists and media workers in Ukraine have so far been killed in the line of duty since February 24, according to IPI monitoring.\n\nThere is evidence at least two more may have been killed by Russian troops in occupied territory in apparent connection to their profession.\n\nIPI has also documented 33 serious cases of domestic and foreign journalists reporting from the frontlines in Ukraine being attacked, shot at, or caught in shelling, with many being hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\nThis includes 21 journalists either sustaining gunshot wounds or coming under fire and at least 12 members of reporting crews being injured or caught in shelling and other airstrikes.\n\nAt least five journalists have been kidnapped or abducted, with some undergoing torture, beatings and other human rights abuses at the hands of Russian soldiers.\n\nDozens of regional media outlets have been forced to shut due to threats and newsroom seizures. IPI has documented four confirmed strikes on TV towers and infrastructure in Ukraine.\n\nOverall, Russian state authorities and military forces have been responsible for 76% of all press freedom violations linked to the conflict documented by IPI over the last three months.\n\nMassive repression in Russia\n\nAlso in Russia, where the Kremlin has moved to wipe out all remaining sources of independent news and information, at least 114 media and news websites have been blocked by the Roskomnadzor regulator, making up 32% of all recorded violations on IPI\u2019s Tracker.\n\nAt least 10 major broadcasters or publications have since been shuttered or forced to cease operations altogether, including many of the last bastions of independent news such as Novaya Gazeta, Ekho Moskvy and Dozhd.\n\nIPI documented 49 incidents of media professionals being detained as they covered anti-war protests in cities across the country over the last three months. Many were arrested despite being in possession of journalistic identification.\n\nSo far, at least eleven journalists have been fined or detained under a restrictive new law criminalizing what authorities deem to be \u201cfake\u201d news about the armed forces. Hundreds of Russian journalists have reportedly since fled the country fearing prosecution.\n\nDozens of foreign media have also been forced to close their offices and pull their correspondents out of the country, contributing to a blackout for impartial coverage and leaving citizens increasingly isolated and exposed to pro-Kremlin propaganda.\n\n\u201cThese figures underscore the devastating toll this war has already taken on the lives of journalists as well as the scale of the human rights abuses and attacks on press freedom\u201d, IPI Executive Director Barbara Trionfi said. \u201cWe honour the courage of all journalists who continue to document the tragic human cost of this war in extremely challenging circumstances.\n\n\u201cIn Ukraine, journalists reporting from the front lines have lost their lives and other have faced attacks, abductions and torture. In Russia, the Kremlin has moved to systematically cleanse the media ecosystem of all impartial reporting on the war and eradicate what remained of the country\u2019s independent press.\n\n\u201cThese attacks in both countries cast a dark shadow over this year\u2019s World Press Freedom Day. They should also refocus the resolve of the international community to provide much needed support to the journalistic community in Ukraine and the independent Russia journalists driven into exile, while also safeguarding press freedoms at home.\n\n\u201cAs this appalling war continues, IPI will continue to do all we can to document every single attack on journalists and every act of censorship and violence against the press, to ensure a comprehensive record exists of the full scale of these assaults on journalistic freedoms.\u201d\n\nActs of censorship or restrictive regulations on independent journalism accounted for 46% of IPI\u2019s documented alerts, with 87% of these violations carried out by Russian authorities.\n\nArrests and criminal investigations and charges made up a further 25% of all recorded alerts, of which Russian police and security forces were responsible for 94% of cases.\n\nAttacks on journalists and media actors by Russian armed forces accounted for 14% of all documented alerts, though these include the most serious attacks and killings.\n\nRussian state authorities such as the government, prosecutors and regulators were responsible for an additional 61% of all recorded alerts.\n\nIPI\u2019s monitoring includes all violations of press freedom linked to the war in Ukraine.\n\nWhile the vast majority of alerts were documented in the territory of Ukraine and Russia, the monitoring also covers Belarus and other states around the world.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "\u2026 As Edo approves N40,000 new minimum wage\n\nBy Onu Okorie\n\nEdo State Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Mr. Odion Olaye has charged the Federal Government to step up efforts to tackle the high rate of insecurity, unemployment and hunger in the country.\n\nHe made the call yesterday during the 2022 Workers\u2019 Day in Benin City, Edo State.\n\nMeanwhile, the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has approved N40,000 as new minimum wage for workers in the state, in commemoration of this year\u2019s Workers\u2019 Day.\n\nThe governor, who made the announcement while delivering his 2022 Workers\u2019 Day speech, said his government would continue to prioritise the welfare of Edo workers, equipping them with capacity and the environment to deliver efficient and quality service to the people.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cAs we all know, the minimum of N30,000 can barely sustain a family. It will be immoral and mindless of us to continue to pretend we do not know our workers are suffering.\n\n\u201cThe government of Edo has now decided to review the minimum wage for Edo workers from N30,000 to N40,000. Undoubtedly, Edo is the first state since the current outbreak of coronavirus to take this initiative.\n\n\u201cEven though we would have loved to pay more, we hope that this little adjustment would enable us to cushion the impact of the inflation that we are faced with. There is no doubt that the financial implications will be heavy and put another burden on the government. But as a government, we are prepared to make the sacrifices so that the workers can live a better life.

          "text": "Ekiti State Governor and Chairman, Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Dr Kayode Fayemi will formally declare his intention to run for the position of President of the country tomorrow in Abuja.The Wednesday\u2019s declaration, tagged \u201cUnveiling My Nigeria Agenda\u201d, is the climax of the Governor\u2019s extensive consultations across the geo-political zones in the last six weeks. It will also lay to rest speculations on whether he would run for the Presidency or not.\n\nThis is contained in statement made available by the governor\u2019s media aide, Yinka Oyebode, on Tuesday.\n\nDr Fayemi, had after discussing his plan to run for the number one office with President Mohammadu Buhari last month, sought counsel, guidance and support from traditional and political leaders across states in the federation.\n\nRemarkably, Dr Fayemi kick-started the consultation in Owo, Ondo State, where he met with the Olowo of Owo, His Royal Majesty, Oba Ajibade Gbadegesin Ogunoye. Owo is renowned as the seat of progressive politics in the country, being the birth place of the defunct Action Group (AG) led by the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo. Thereafter, Dr Fayemi met with Afenifere leader, Chief Reuben Fasoranti, (who was his Secondary School principal) and other leaders, of the pan-Yoruba socio-political group, including Chief Olu Falae and Chief Cornelius Adebayo in Akure, Ondo State capital.\n\nThe Afenifere leaders did a frank assessment of current trends in the country and concluded that the country needs a leader, a democrat with character, courage and compassion at this critical period. They scored Dr Fayemi high on these points and gave their blessings for his aspiration.\n\nDetermined to deepen the consultations, Dr Fayemi also visited the Osemawe of Ondo, HRM Oba Adesimbo Victor kiladejo at his palace in Ondo town and the Deji of Akure, HRM Oba Aladetoyinbo Ognlade Aladelusi at his palace in Akure. The consultation also took him to Ile- Ife, Osun State, the cradle of the Yoruba, where he met the Ooni of Ife, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, who accorded him a grand reception that lasted for hours, interspersed with prayer sessions and cultural entertainment.\n\nDr Fayemi also met with the Olubadan of Ibadan, HRM Oba Lekan Bbalogun; the Alake of Egbaland, HRM Oba Michael Adedotun Gbadebo; the Awujale of Ijebu ode, HRM Oba Sikiru Adetona; and the Akarigbo of Remoland, who is also the chairman of Ogun State Council of Traditional Rulers, HRM Oba Babatunde Adewale Ajayi in their respective palaces, where he got royal blessings.\n\nDr Fayemi\u2019s consultation train later moved to the palace of Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Achebe; King (Dr) Dandeson Douglas Jaja, of the Opobo Kingdom and Chairman of Rivers State Council of Traditional Rulers. He also visited and had talks with the Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar and the Emir of Gwandu, Alhaji Mohammed Jega during the Sallah holiday and both leaders respectively expressed their admiration for his personality and capacity as a bridge builder and lover of peace.\n\nHe had earlier held a major meeting with members of Ekiti State Traditional Council in Ado-Ekiti, with over 110 Obas in attendance. The Ekiti Obas who were excited at the possibility of one of their sons becoming the next President of the country, pledged their unalloyed support for Dr Fayemi\u2019s presidential bid. The Ewi of Ado-Ekiti, HRM Oba Rufus Adeyemo Aladesanmi; Ajero of Ijero- Ekiti, Oba Joseph Adebayo Adewole and Owaoye of Okemesi Ekiti, Oba Michael Gbadebo Adedeji, who spoke on behalf of the Obas, said Fayemi is eminently qualified to lead the country in view of his exposure, education, experience and capacity.\n\nDr Fayemi\u2019s engagements with political and traditional leaders went on side by side with consultations with his colleague governors, especially those elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). As at date he has conferred with and shared his vision with no fewer than 20 of the 22 APC governors, in the consultation process that is expected to run till the party\u2019s primaries, later in the month.\n\nThe NGF Chairman said the engagements with the traditional rulers and political leaders provided an avenue to share and listen to their perspectives on the ideal approaches to building a united country based on justice, freedom, equity and the rule of law. The aggregate opinion, counsel and goodwill received during the consultation period will form the crux of his declaration on Wednesday at the nation\u2019s capital city.\n\nBorn on February 9, 1965, Dr. Fayemi holds degrees in History and International Relations from the University of Lagos and Obafemi Awolowo University respectively, a Doctorate in War Studies from King\u2019s College, University of London and is a Fellow of the Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, University of Ibadan. His research and policy development interests include: Natural Resource Governance, Democratisation, Constitutionalism, Security Sector Governance, Civil-Military Relations and Regionalism in the Global Context.\n\nDr. Fayemi was the founding director of the Centre for Democracy & Development (CDD), a research and training institute dedicated to the study and promotion of democratisation, peace-building and human security in Africa. As a central figure in the coalition of civil society actors that resisted oppressive military rule in Nigeria in the early 1990s, he was central to the founding and running of opposition radio stations while in exile. His role in the struggle to restore democratic governance in Nigeria is documented in his book Out of the Shadows: Exile and the Struggle for Freedom and Democracy in Nigeria (CDD, 2005). His other publications include: Mercenaries: The African Security Dilemma, co-edited with Abdel-Fatau Musah (Pluto Press, 2000); Deepening the Culture of Constitutionalism: The Role of Regional Institutions in Constitutional Development in Africa (CDD, 2003); and Security Sector Governance in Africa: A Handbook (co-edited with Nicole Ball, CDD, 2004); Reclaiming the Trust (Amandla, 2012); Regaining the Legacy (Amandla, 2013); and Legacy of Honour and Service (Amandla, 2014). His most recent book, \u201cUnfinished Greatness\u201d, (which was unveiled in February), articulates his vision of a Nigeria Agenda that is inclusive, progressive, equitable and people centred\n\nDr. Fayemi is a prominent member of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) and chaired the party\u2019s National Convention Planning Committee that produced President Mohammadu Buhari as Presidential Candidate for the 2015 general election. He also served as the Director, Policy Research and Strategy of the APC Presidential Campaign Council.\n\nHe was Governor of Ekiti State between 2010 and 2014. He served as Minister of Mines and Steel Development in the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria between 2015 and 2018. As Minister, he led the administration\u2019s efforts in repositioning the Nigerian Mining sector to contribute optimally to the priority agendas of diversifying the country\u2019s revenue base and creating jobs and economic opportunities for Nigerians. He resigned as Minister to contest the governorship of Ekiti State for a second term in 2018. He won the election and was inaugurated for a second term as Governor of Ekiti State on October 16, 2018.\n\nHe is married to Erelu Bisi Fayemi, the renowned women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights advocate, international development specialist, writer and social entrepreneur and blessed with a son. He has received several awards and recognitions at home and abroad, and holds the national honour of Commander of the Order of the Niger (CON).",

          "text": "The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, has said that ongoing investigation of a \u201cbillionaire drug baron\u201d Chief Afam Ukatu, has led to the discovery of how the suspect imported into Nigeria in a single month, October 2019, two containers containing 1,284 cartons of tramadol with market value of over N22 billion.\n\nThe agency stated this in a statement on Tuesday to counter insinuations by some people it referred to as hirelings who alleged that NDLEA has no evidence to pin a crime on Ukatu, who is the Chairman/CEO of Mallinson Group of companies.\n\nThe spokesman of the agency in the statement said, after months of surveillance, Ukatu was eventually arrested on board a flight to Abuja at the MM2 Terminal of the Lagos airport, Ikeja on Wednesday 13th April.\n\nHe said Investigations revealed that he has been a major importer of large consignments of different brands and high dosages of tramadol hydrochloride, ranging from 120mg, 200mg, 225mg and 250mg, all of which are illicit.\n\nHe further said Ukatu owns pharmaceutical and plastic manufacturing companies, which he used as a cover to import illicit drugs into Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, in the course of investigating the N3 billion tramadol saga between Ukatu and the Abba Kyari\u2019s IRT team, NDLEA operatives have unearthed more evidences establishing how Ukatu has been importing large quantities of tramadol far above the approved threshold allowed into the country.\n\nHe noted that in one instance, Ukatu through his Mallinson Group of Companies imported into the country two-container loads of five different brands of tramadol in October 2019 through the Apapa ports in Lagos.\n\nHe said all the evidences so far gathered show that the imported tramadol brands were far above the threshold permitted to be imported into Nigeria, adding that: \u201cNo doubt the suspect will soon have his day in court.\u201d",

          "text": "Russian forces fired rockets at an encircled steel works in Ukraine\u2019s southern port city of Mariupol and thick smoke blackened the sky at the plant where officials on Tuesday said 200 civilians were trapped despite evacuations.\n\nRussia\u2019s offensive to capture the east and south after failing to take the capital of Kyiv has been met with commitments by Western powers to supply heavier weapons to Ukraine. On Tuesday, the European Commission is expected to finalise a ban on buying Russian oil in an effort to squeeze Moscow\u2019s war chest.\n\nThe U.S. Congress is considering a $33 billion military aid package, and the United Kingdom this week vowed an additional $375 million in defence assistance.\n\nReuters images showed volleys of rockets fired from a Russian truck-mounted launcher towards the sprawling Soviet-era steel complex from the outskirts of Russian-occupied Mariupol on Monday.\n\nThe attack followed a UN-brokered ceasefire around the complex that allowed several groups of civilians to escape Mariupol\u2019s last holdout of Ukrainian fighters in recent days. It was not immediately clear if new fighting was preventing more evacuations.\n\nMariupol mayor Vadym Boychenko said he hoped a first column of evacuees would reach the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on Tuesday, adding that more civilians were trapped in bunkers and tunnels under the complex and some 100,000 remained in the rest of the city.\n\n\u201cYou wake up in the morning and you cry. You cry in the evening. I don\u2019t know where to go at all,\u201d said Mariupol resident Tatyana Bushlanova, sitting by a blackened apartment block and talking over the sound of shells exploding nearby.\n\nMariupol is a major target for Russia as it seeks to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea and connect Russian-controlled territory in the south and east.\n\nRussian bombardments since troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 have flattened cities, killed thousands of civilians and forced more than five million to flee the country.\n\nThe war launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin has shifted to the eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, parts of which were already held by Russian-backed separatists.\n\nRussia\u2019s troops are trying to encircle a large Ukrainian force there, attacking from three directions with massive bombardment along the front. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a \u201cspecial operation\u201d to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists.\n\nUkraine and the West say the fascist allegation is baseless and that the war is an unprovoked act of aggression.\n\nWestern allies of Ukraine have stepped up supplies of increasingly heavy weapons. Ukraine\u2019s First Lady Olena Zelenska asked the West to maintain its support.\n\n\u201cWe ask you not to stop, to accelerate the pace of heavy weapons provision,\u201d she told British television, adding that she had not seen President Volodymyr Zelenskiy since the start of the invasion.\n\nPope Francis said in an interview published on Tuesday that he had asked for a meeting in Moscow with Putin to try to stop the war but had not received a response. read more French President Emmanuel Macron will speak with Putin on Tuesday, Macron\u2019s office said.\n\nEU SET TO SHUN RUSSIAN OIL\n\nIn Brussels, the European Commission is expected to finalise a proposed sixth package of EU sanctions against Russia on Tuesday, including a possible embargo on buying Russian oil. In a major shift, Germany said it was prepared to back an immediate oil embargo.\n\nKyiv says Russia\u2019s energy exports to Europe, so far largely exempt from international sanctions, are funding the Kremlin war effort.\n\n\u201cThis package should include clear steps to block Russia\u2019s revenues from energy resources,\u201d Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.\n\nEU countries have paid more than 47 billion euros ($47.43 billion) to Russia for gas and oil since it invaded Ukraine, according to research organisation the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.\n\nAmbassadors from EU countries will discuss the proposed sanctions when they meet on Wednesday. Putin responded with retaliatory economic sanctions against \u201cunfriendly\u201d foreign states on Tuesday.\n\nThe pope told the newspaper that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban had told him Russia planned to end the war on May 9, which Russia celebrates as \u201cVictory Day\u201d, marking Nazi Germany\u2019s surrender in 1945.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said earlier this week that Moscow would not rush to meet that symbolic date.\n\nTRAIL OF DESTRUCTION\n\nUkraine\u2019s second biggest city, Kharkiv, was under bombardment, as it has been since the early days of the invasion, the Ukrainian military said on Tuesday.\n\nGiving an update on the battle front, Ukraine\u2019s general staff said its forces were defending the approach to Kharkiv from Izyum, a town on the Donets river, some 120 km (75 miles) to the southeast, as the enemy left a trail of destruction in Luhansk province.\n\nSome other areas of Donetsk were under constant fire and regional authorities were trying to evacuate civilians from frontline areas, the Ukrainian president\u2019s office said.\n\nRussian shelling killed at least three civilians in the town of Vuhledar, the president\u2019s office said. Ukraine\u2019s military said Russian forces were trying to take the frontline town of Rubizhne.\n\nReuters could not independently verify Ukraine\u2019s battlefield accounts.\n\nHeavy clashes were taking place around Popasna, in Luhansk. Shelling was so intense it was not possible to collect bodies, said regional Governor Serhiy Gaidai.\n\n\u200b\u201dI don\u2019t even want to speak about what\u2019s happening with the people living in Popasna, Rubizhne and Novotoshkivske right now. These cities simply don\u2019t exist anymore. They have completely destroyed them.\u201d\n\nReuters",

          "title": "US: Potential Supreme Court Move to Overturn Abortion Rights Sends Protesters onto Streets",
          "text": "The bombshell draft U.S. Supreme Court decision suggesting the court may overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion sent Democrats scrambling on Tuesday, with lawmakers and activists looking for some way to head off the sweeping social change.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom said, after Politico reported the draft decision, that his state will propose an amendment in the state\u2019s constitution to \u201censhrine the right to choose\u201d.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t trust SCOTUS to protect the right to abortion, so we\u2019ll do it ourselves,\u201d Newsom said on Twitter, referring to the Supreme Court.\n\nReuters was not immediately able to confirm the authenticity of the draft opinion. The Supreme Court and the White House declined to comment.\n\n\u201cDo something, Democrats,\u201d abortion-rights protesters chanted as they rallied outside the court in the pre-dawn hours against the decision, which would be a triumph for Republicans who spent decades building the court\u2019s current 6-3 conservative majority.\n\n\u201cIf the report is accurate, the Supreme Court is poised to inflict the greatest restriction of rights in the past fifty years \u2013 not just on women but on all Americans,\u201d Congress\u2019s top two Democrats \u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer \u2014 said in a joint statement. \u201cThe Republican-appointed Justices\u2019 reported votes to overturn Roe v. Wade would go down as an abomination, one of the worst and most damaging decisions in modern history.\u201d\n\nA bill that would have protected the right to abortion nationally died in Congress early this year as Democrats\u2019 razor-thin majority was not enough to overcome Senate rules requiring a supermajority to agree on most legislation.\n\nIn the absence of federal action, states have passed a raft of abortion-related laws. Republican-led states have moved swiftly, with new restrictions passed this year in six states. Three Democratic-led states this year have passed measures intended to protect abortion rights.\n\nAbortion is one of the most divisive issues in U.S. politics and has been for nearly a half century.\n\nA 2021 poll by the Pew Research Center found that 59% of U.S. adults believed it should be legal in all or most cases, while 39% thought it should be illegal in most or all cases.\n\n\u2018WRONG FROM THE START\u2019\n\n\u201cRoe was egregiously wrong from the start,\u201d conservative Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the draft opinion, which is dated Feb. 10, according to Politico, which posted a copy online.\n\nBased on Alito\u2019s opinion, the court would find that the Roe v. Wade decision that allowed abortions performed before a fetus would be viable outside the womb \u2013 between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy \u2013 was wrongly decided because the U.S. Constitution makes no specific mention of abortion rights.\n\n\u201cAbortion presents a profound moral question. The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each state from regulating or prohibiting abortion,\u201d Alito said, according to the leaked document.\n\nThe sweeping nature of the decision raised questions among legal experts and court observers about what other rights established by the court could be overturned.\n\nThe ruling would be the court\u2019s most sweeping since former President Donald Trump succeeded in naming three justices to the court.\n\nThe news broke a little more than six months before midterm elections that will determine if Democrats hold their razor-thin majorities in the U.S. Congress for the next two years of President Joe Biden\u2019s term.\n\n\u201cCongress must pass legislation that codifies Roe v. Wade as the law of the land in this country NOW,\u201d said Independent Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nABORTION PROVIDERS STUNNED\n\nThe decision appeared based on an oral argument in December on Mississippi\u2019s bid to revive its ban on abortion starting at 15 weeks of pregnancy, a law blocked by lower courts.\n\nThe Politico report said a court majority was inclined to uphold Mississippi\u2019s abortion ban and that there could be five votes to overturn Roe. An official ruling is expected before the end of June.\n\nFour of the other Republican-appointed justices \u2013 Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 voted with Alito in the conference held among the justices, it added.\n\nAfter an initial vote among the justices following an oral argument, one is assigned the majority opinion and writes a draft. It is then circulated among the justices.\n\nAt times, in between the initial vote and the ruling being released, the vote alignment can change. A ruling is only final when it is published by the court.\n\nThe news of the draft opinion stunned abortion providers.\n\nAndrea Gallegos, executive administrator at Tulsa Women\u2019s Clinic in Oklahoma, had just finished calling some 25 patients to tell them their Tuesday abortion appointments would need to be canceled because of a soon to be enacted Oklahoma law modeled on a highly restrictive Texas abortion ban.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that I\u2019m surprised,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNow all these other conservative states like Oklahoma are passing the exact same legislation that Texas did, I have to say I became less optimistic and way more scared for what the future of Roe looks like.\u201d\n\nThe Roe v. Wade decision recognized the right to personal privacy under the U.S. Constitution protects a woman\u2019s ability to terminate her pregnancy.\n\nChristian conservatives and many Republican officeholders have long sought to overturn it.\n\nIf Roe is overturned, abortion is likely to remain legal in liberal states. More than a dozen states have laws protecting abortion rights. Numerous Republican-led states have passed various abortion restrictions in defiance of the Roe precedent in recent years.\n\nThe anti-abortion group the Susan B. Anthony List welcomed the news.\n\n\u201cIf Roe is indeed overturned, our job will be to build consensus for the strongest protections possible for unborn children and women in every legislature,\u201d its president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, said in a statement.\n\nReuters",
