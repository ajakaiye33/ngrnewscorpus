          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nA Consultant Psychiatrist at the Federal Neuropsychiatrist Hospital, Yaba, Dr. Dapo Adegbaju says the lifespan of patients diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia is about five years after diagnosis.\n\nAccording to Adegbaju, the prognosis for the health condition is poor because its symptoms progressively get worse.\n\nDementia with Lewy Bodies also known as Lewy Body Dementia is a type of progressive dementia that leads to a decline in thinking, reasoning, and independent function because of abnormal microscopic deposits that damage brain cells over time.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, Dr. Adegbaju said Lewy bodies are plaques that are proteinous deposited in the areas of the brain that controls thinking, movement, and memory.\n\nAccording to him, Lewy Body Dementia is the second most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nDementia is a syndrome in which there is deterioration in cognitive function beyond what might be expected from the usual consequences of biological aging. Dementia is currently the seventh leading cause of death among all diseases and one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people globally\n\nAdegbaju said the cause of the disorder is mostly unknown \u201cbut there have been theories about genetics especially with the coding for the protein causing it but the disease is more common in males than females.\n\n\u201cThe prevalence of the disease in Nigeria is not known. Although the prevalence of all types of dementia is about 5 per cent.\n\n\u201cPeople with Lewy Body Dementia may have hallucinations, poor sleep, poor concentration, movement issues leading to falls most times, and poor memory.\u201d\n\nThe psychiatrist noted that Lewy Body Dementia is progressive and the symptoms worsen, causing depression, fractures, bleeding into the brain, anxiety, agitation, and restlessness\n\n\u201cDiagnosis is made by a psychiatrist who will notice a decline in cognitive abilities, memory, and movement. Magnetic Resonance Imaging may help but the definitive diagnosis is at autopsy.\n\n\u201cLewy Body Dementia has no cure but can be managed with physical and occupational therapies as well as medications. It can be prevented by managing all physical illnesses like diabetes, hypertension, lipid issues, engaging in regular exercise, sleeping well, staying mentally fit, and eating a balanced diet.\n\n\u201cIt is better prevented than treated,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to an online portal, Healthline, Lewy Body Dementia is a term that covers two conditions that have similar symptoms. One is dementia with Lewy bodies, and the other is Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia.\n\n\u201cWhen you think of dementia, the first thing that comes to mind might be Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The two conditions differ in that Alzheimer\u2019s involves extreme memory problems, and Lewy Body Dementia is more likely to affect how you process information. In addition, Lewy Body Dementia causes physical symptoms such as tremor and muscle stiffness,\u201d it noted.\n\nIt added that there\u2019s no way to stop the progression of Lewy Body Dementia as it will continue to affect cognitive abilities and motor functions and require lifelong medical care.\n\n\u201cSome symptoms can be managed, but medications must be monitored and adjusted as needed.\n\n\u201cA person with LBD will need the assistance provided by family and professional caregivers.

Awo, informed the court that a gang of mobile armed robbers commonly known as \u2018One Chance\u2019 operators, highjacked its case file on a fundamental rights enforcement suit Igboho\u2019s aides filed to challenge their arrest and detention.\n\nThe court had on the strength of the fundamental right suit, granted bail to all the 12 detainees.\n\nHowever, in the fresh charge marked FHC/ABJ/CR/305/2021, which was signed by S. M. Bello, the DSS alleged that the 1st Defendant, Oyetunji, was in possession of firearms for terrorism-related activities.\n\nIt further alleged that the 2nd Defendant, Amudat, helped to promote acts of terrorism, using her Facebook page.\n\nSome of the counts in the charge, a copy of which was sighted by Vanguard, read: \u201cThat you Jamiu Noah Oyetunji, Amudat Habibat Babatunade, adults, with others still at large, on or about the 1st day of July 2021, at the residence of one Sunday Adeniyi Adeyemo (aka Sunday Igboho), located at Soka area of Ibadan, Oyo State within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, did conspire to commit acts of terrorism, to wits possession of prohibited firearms: contrary to Section 17 of Terrorism (Prevention) (Amendment) Act, 2013 and punishable under the same section of the Act.\n\n\u201cThat you Jamiu Noah Oyetunji, Amudat Habibat Babatunade, adults with others still at large, on or about the 1st day of July 2021, at the residence of Sunday Adeniyi Adeyemo (aka Sunday Igboho) located at Soka area of Ibadan, Oyo State, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, did have in your possession, without lawful authority, the under listed prohibited firearms:\n\n\u201cFive (5) AK 47 rifles with serial numbers 04956, 213740, 8673, 945999 and 6139 respectively, Two (2) AK 47 rifles whose serial numbers could not be identified; Two (2) pump action rifle with serial numbers 8836 and 9398 respectively; One (1) pump action which serial number could not be identified; and One (1) stun gun.\n\n\u201cContrary to Section 1(3)(c)(v) of the Terrorism Prevention Act CAP 10, 2011 and punishable under Section 1(2) of the Terrorism Prevention (Amendment) act 2013\u201d.\n\nThe duo were in count three of the charge, alleged to have had in their possession, without lawful authority, 1,295 live rounds of 7.62mm ammunition and 221 live rounds of 5.56mm ammunition, contrary to Section 1(3)(c)(v) of the Terrorism Prevention Act CAP 10, 2011 and punishable under Section 1(2) of the Terrorism Prevention (Amendment) Act 2013.\n\nWhen the matter came up on Monday for the arraignment of the Defendants, their lawyer, Mr Pelumi Olajengbensi, told the court that his clients do not understand the English language.\n\nThe effort by the court to secure the service of an interpreter proved abortive, a situation that led Justice Obiora Egwuatu to adjourn the matter till next year.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

I just told you what we are meeting the president for, it is to discuss the on-coming national convention of the party,\u2019\u2019 he stressed.\n\nBagudu said that the forum also discussed issues of good governance, development in the polity and other issues that were pertinent to the progress of the party and the country.\n\nHe said the forum passed a vote of confidence on the party\u2019s Gov. Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Committee and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee.\n\n\u201cWe passed a vote of confidence on the caretaker committee that has done a wonderful job, chaired by Gov.

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Isaac Anumihe and Joseph Inokotong, Abuja\n\nParents and school proprietors in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital, are in a panic mode, over rising wave of abductions and attacks by bandits, especially around the southern and northeastern fringes of the FCT.\n\nThe parents cited the recent attack on the staff quarters of the University of Abuja in Giri, Gwagwalada Area Council by gunmen and the abduction of a vice principal around Kwali Area Council.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nDaily Sun gathered from some school proprietors that daily bus shuttle services have been suspended till further notice, pending when security would improve.\n\nA school proprietor told our correspondent they were advised by top security agents that bandits were plotting to launch coordinated attacks and possibly ambush school buses conveying school children.\n\nThe proprietor said her colleagues were making plans to halt the services in the new year when students resume from the Christmas break.\n\nShe further revealed the presence of large private and government security agents around many schools in Abuja, as part of moves to prevent any possible attack by bandits who are believed to be operating already around many parts of Abuja.\n\nShe said schools under the control of the FCT Administration, would shutdown long ahead of the Christmas break, to allow government work out a policy that would be made known by January.\n\nSome of the parents said the FCT Administration, headed by Muhammad Bello, appeared overwhelmed by the many challenges facing the territory.\n\nDr. Kehinde Akinbode, proprietor of Kareem International School, Kuje, while reacting to the alert that bandits and terrorists were beginning to target schools in the FCT, confirmed that parents were apprehensive, but said he has assured them that adequate measures were already in place to forestall any unforeseen circumstances.\n\n\u201cI will not disclose to you what we have done because it is top secret and a security issue. Be rest assured that our school is safe. We have done everything humanly possible to prevent any security breach here,\u201d said Dr. Akinbode.\n\nAt the New Hope International School, Kuje, a female administrative manager, who said she had no permission to speak on the issue, disclosed that the school management has been holding series of meeting with stakeholders since the University of Abuja kidnap saga.\n\nShe disclosed that work on the perimeter fencing of the school which was suspended due to lack of funds has commenced and would soon be completed. Besides, she pointed out that the location of the school would make it difficult, if not impossible, for any intruder to gain access to the premises, noting that closure of the school due to insecurity is not being considered. She admitted as genuine, fears being harboured in some quarters that bandits and terrorists are beginning to target schools in the FCT.\n\nMajor private schools on the fringes of Nasarawa, such as Mararaba and Nyanya, are apprehensive and have beefed up security. Investigations by Daily Sun revealed that parents have started withdrawing their children and wards from boarding houses, while day students have stopped using school buses.\n\nMany parents, according to investigations, now take their children to school in their own vehicles or engage the services of drivers who take their children or wards to and from schools.\n\n\u201cNasarawa State is a neighbouring state and what happens there can spill over to FCT. So, it is better to be on the side of caution,\u201d Mrs Peace Ntaji, whose children attend one of the prestigious schools in Nyanya, revealed.\n\nShe said dormitories are soft targets for bandits and that it makes no sense for her children to remain there.\n\n\u201cBy God\u2019s Grace, I have a car that has not been put to use for some time. I will fix it for the children,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother parent, Mr. Williams Agiriga, told Daily Sun that he has withdrawn his wards from the school bus because, according to him, apart from the boarding houses, the school buses are also soft targets.\n\n\u201cWe will devise a way of taking them to school and bringing them back. We are in perilous times. One has to be extra careful with what one does. Exposing the children to unnecessary danger is not the best,\u201d he noted.\n\nFor the second time, this year, Governor of Nasarawa State, Abdullahi Sule, has raised the alarm over activities of a group known as Darusalam, a dreaded version of Boko Haram in the state. Eight months after raising the alarm, there have been increased cases of kidnappings and disappearances of persons.\n\nHowever, the FCT Administration has revealed that it would continue to pay adequate attention to school security.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

We met and agreed that the national chairman of our great party should come from the North Central; and that one had been achieved. Other arrangements are on the way.

Nigeria is in a state of disarray. But a good political party and a good government can solve this problem of insecurity.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you that traveling by road is now dangerous, traveling by train is also dangerous. And those who have the money travel by air. But the common man cannot travel by air. Anywhere you go today, you are not safe.\n\n\u201cThe industrial development in Nigeria is not going well because government policy is not consistent over the years.\n\n\u201cIf government policy is consistent, Nigeria wouldn\u2019t have been where it is. Every policy needs to be consistent for a period of five years running. But changing policy soon after implementation by successive government is not good for industrial development of the country.

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja and Okey Sampson, Umuahia\n\nCounsel to detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, Aloy Ejimakor, has said the unconditional release of his client lies with the Executive arm of government and not the Judiciary.\n\nKanu had fled Nigeria in 2017, jumping bail, after his Afaraukwu home in Abia State was invaded by soldiers. Extradited from Kenya in June, he is facing trial bordering on treason at an Abuja court.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nBut Some Igbo leaders, led by 93-year-old first republic parliamentarian and minister of Aviation, Chief Mbazulike Amechi, had last week met with President Muhammadu Buhari, and requested for Kanu\u2019s unconditional release.\n\nPresident Buhari was quoted to have described the request as a difficult and heavy one. He hinged his assertion on the premise that the request ran contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers between the Executive and Judiciary, and cited his policy of non-interference with the judiciary.\n\nHowever, Ejimakor, in a statement, quoting section 174 of the Nigerian Constitution as amended, said the unconditional release of Kanu lies with the executive and not the judiciary.\n\nSection 174 of the Constitution said inter Alia, \u201cThe Attorney General of the Federation shall have power:\n\n(a) \u201cto institute and undertake criminal proceedings against any person before any court of law in respect of any offence created by or under any Act of the National Assembly.\n\n(b) \u201cto take over and continue any such criminal proceedings that may have been instituted by any other authority or person; and\n\n(c) \u201cto discontinue at any stage before judgment is delivered any such criminal proceedings instituted or undertaking by him or any other authority or person.\u201d\n\nKanu\u2019s counsel said since the Constitution in sub section C of section 174 gave the attorney general and minister of justice to discontinue at any stage before judgment is delivered in any criminal proceedings, it would not amount to interference by the executive should Kanu\u2019s case be discontinued.\n\nHe, therefore, urged the president to act divisively in the instant case as he would not be acting contrary to the Constitution or interfering in the affairs of the judiciary.\n\nMeanwhile, chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Osita Okechukwu, has pleaded with President Muhammadu Buhari to honour Chief Amechi with the release of Kanu.\n\nHe also appealed to IPOB to support and promote Nigeria president of Igbo extraction in 2023 as a personal project.\n\n\u201cI join, Ohaneze Ndigbo, eminent constitutional lawyer and Chairman, Igbo Leaders of Thought, Prof Ben Nwabueze, and people of goodwill nationwide in commending President Buhari for accepting to consider the release of held leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu. I also appeal to IPOB to support Nigeria President of Igbo extraction 2023 project. Methinks IPOB support will kill two birds with one stone,\u201d Okechukwu argued.\n\nAsked if IPOB support for Nigeria president of Igbo extraction 2023 project is a precondition for the release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, Okechukwu said Capital No.\n\n\u201cCapital No, it is not a precondition, all I am saying is that Mr President and host of other Nigerians are silently in support of Nigeria president of Igbo extraction 2023 project, but are weary and reticent of IPOB stance. Therefore, in my little opinion, IPOB support of our project will kill two birds with one stone.\u201d Okechukwu quipped.\n\nThe Director-General Voice of Nigeria (VON) explained that \u201cone stone is the release of Mazi Kanu, another is the return of economic activities in our geopolitical zone and thirdly IPOB support will no doubt rekindle wider support of Nigeria president of Igbo extraction 2023 project.\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "title": "2023: Osinbajo Dares Tinubu as Support Group Opens Campaign Office in Abuja",
          "text": "*Tinubu movement keeps mum\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nA political slugfest seems to be in the offing between Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and his godfather, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, as an Osinbajo support group made public and formal their principal\u2019s intention to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 with the launch of a campaign office at the weekend in Abuja.\n\nCuriously, after months of equivocation and outright repudiation, Osinbajo appears finally ready to emerge from the shadows of doubt and throw his hat in the ring for the country\u2019s top job.\n\nA major pointer to this suggestion is the opening of a campaign office by a motley coalition of his supporters.\n\nThough some of the vice president\u2019s supporters denied the office launched was Osinbajo\u2019s campaign office, they said it was merely the office of a coalition aiming to draft him into the 2023 presidential race.\n\nOsinbajo\u2019s spokesperson, Laolu Akande, also denied the opening of a campaign office by his principal, in a chat with a national daily (not THISDAY), describing the report as \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\nThe campaign office, located at No. 15b, Buchanan Crescent, off Aminu Kano, by Emab Plaza, Wuse 11, Abuja, was inaugurated on Saturday in Abuja. It was decorated with Osinbajo\u2019s banner, bearing the inscription, \u201cFace of Hope.\u201d\n\nPublicity Secretary of the group, Mr. Emmanuel Pippa, in a statement yesterday, reiterated that the office belonged to the support group.\n\nPippa said in the statement, \u201cOur attention has just been brought to online publications, which allege that the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, has opened a campaign office in Abuja ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cWe wish to clarify that the said office belongs to our coalition of support groups, which strongly believes in Professor Osinbajo as the leader Nigeria needs in 2023, and is determined to get him to declare an interest in running for the office of President as early as possible.\u201d\n\nThe group said to actualise the objective of bringing the vice president into the presidential contest, they recently acquired an administrative office in the heart of Wuse 2 area of Abuja.\n\nThey added that though Osinbajo was yet to be acquainted with their activities, they intended to operate through a new organ, The Progressive Project (TPP), to coordinate the youth, women, and other groups across the federation.\n\nThe group declared: \u201cOurs is, therefore, not a campaign office but a venue for coordination, handling of increasing volume of correspondence, and meetings in readiness for the time, when Vice President Yemi Osinbajo accedes to our request for him to run and consolidate gains made under President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nThe group stressed that party chieftains would lead the real campaign in the fullness of time. It also stated that being a heartbeat away from the number one job, there were countless members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and even non-partisan citizens across the federation, who were pushing for Osinbajo to succeed Buhari in the interest of the country.\n\nThe group said it was convinced that Osinbajo\u2019s level of familiarity with the vision, achievements and challenges being handled by Buhari was second to none and that such insight would enable a new APC administration hit the ground running in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tinubu Support Group refused to give an opinion on the development. Acting Director, Media and Publicity of the group, Mr. Tosin Adeyanju, when contacted for his reaction, declined comment on the latest development coming from the Osibanjo camp.\n\nThough the vice president has not officially announced his intention to contest the 2023 presidency against his political godfather and former governor of Lagos State, Tinubu, the opening of the campaign office at the weekend in Abuja was a strong indication that he might have decided to throw his hat in the ring.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2015 elections, recall that Tinubu wanted to be Buhari\u2019s running mate and had done everything possible to get the ticket, including stalling the nomination process, after he was initially appointed by the party leadership to head a selection committee.\n\nBut Tinubu\u2019s ambition of becoming Buhari\u2019s deputy hit brick wall because the mood of the nation at the time was believed to be averse to a Muslim/Muslim ticket, a situation that eventually paved the way for the nomination of Osinbajo by Tinubu, in the presence of the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor E.A Adeboye.\n\nIt is, therefore, believed that for yielding the position of the number two citizen to him in 2015, despite wanting it for himself, it is only morally and politically imperative that Osinbajo would seek and secure Tinubu\u2019s blessing if he truly intends to run in 2023. But some Tinubu supporters believe he should not even seek the office of President since he knows Tinubu is nursing similar ambition.\n\nUnfortunately, those who believe Osinbajo should seek Tinubu\u2019s endorsement have another thing coming, because Tinubu is not about to make that sacrifice a second time. Since he too now wants the big prize for himself and has not relented in his push for the presidency in 2023, even though largely by support groups.\n\nHowever, prior to the inauguration of the campaign office, the Osinbajo group had in July lobbied some highly-placed members of APC to join forces towards mobilising support for Osinbajo.\n\nThe group, in a letter dated July 14, 2021, titled, \u201cAPC and The Future of Nigeria: Why We Must Get It Right and Consider the Osinbajo Option in 2023,\u201d and jointly signed by its National Coordinator, Mr. Ahmed Mohammed, and National Secretary, Dr. Eberechukwu Dibia, said there was need for early preparations towards ensuring that Osinbajo and some elements within the current administration emerged to deepen APC and Buhari\u2019s legacies after 2023.\n\nThe letter, which was addressed to the Senate President, Senator Ahmed Lawan, and other top party leaders, indicated that several APC governors, principal officers in the Senate, and House of Representatives, members of the APC National Caretaker Committee, former and serving federal legislators, other stakeholders, as well as the political aides of Osinbajo were being lobbied to partake in the mobilisation process.\n\nIt said, \u201cWith history in mind, we, members of the Progressive Consolidation Group (PCG), hereby solemnly join our voices with that of many others in appealing that you throw your weight behind our call for consideration of an Osinbajo successor administration after that of President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR), would have run a full course in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe believe \u2013 without any iota of doubt \u2013 that giving a worthy element within the system such as Vice President Osinbajo the chance to lead would not only enrich the system; it would certainly be the best assurance of stability and progress for extant developmental objectives.\u201d\n\nThe group expressed conviction that the task of inspiring party members \u201ctowards a shared consciousness of insightful search for Buhari\u2019s successor come 2023 should not be left to chance or last minute \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019 contests,\u201d stressing that Osinbajo should be collectively adopted as the right successor.\n\nThe group took it a step further, when it inaugurated the campaign office. Though the support group has denied Osinbajo has a hand in it, analysts wonder where the group is getting the funding to bankroll its activities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Zainab Ahmed: We Do Not Have Debt Problem, What We Have is Revenue Problem",
          "text": "She wasn\u2019t uncomfortable saying she was the shy type. But that took nothing away from the content of her character. Patient, articulate and sound with dignified carriage, you can only underrate the Minister of Finance, Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed, at your peril. For a woman in power, especially one with a major portfolio, her mannerisms and courtesies would cause even a stone-hearted person to thaw out. Disarmingly simple, charming and immediately likeable. She had no hesitation giving us an appointment. Business-like and time-conscious, the formalities were measured as much as the pre-interview familiarity exchanges. And as she took on the innuendoes, numbers, facts and figures, the almost two hours\u2019 interaction with THISDAY became naturally animated, dwelling on those issues that currently define the nation\u2019s political economy. Excerpts:\n\nRecently, the Federal Executive Council approved a five-year National Development Plan (NDP) for the country and a lot of people have said the target of N348 trillion investment in five years was overambitious. What\u2019s this plan about and how do you intend to implement it?\n\nThe new NDP is a medium-term plan of five years. It is a successor to the Economic and Recovery Growth Plan (ERGP) that has expired since December 2020. Well, we are actually working on two plans \u2013 we are also working on the Nigeria Agenda 2050, which is a longer term plan for the country. What we have as objectives of the NDP are to ensure that the diversification of the economy is concentrated, more inclusive and sustainable. I hear people say we have not achieved diversification, but that is not true. The Nigerian economy is truly diversified. People say we are dependent on the oil and gas sector, but how much is the oil and gas sector\u2019s contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)? It is probably about eight per cent. The whole of the 92 per cent is the non-oil sector. So the economy is truly diversified. But we would need to deepen that diversification; we need to support micro, small and medium scale enterprises (MSMEs) to grow, so that our GDP growth would be more sustainable.\n\nAnother major objective of the plan is to create jobs, reduce poverty and also deepen the development of the agriculture sector and enhance food security. How are we going to do this? It is by concentrating more on developing agri-business. Our agriculture over the years had been largely subsistence until 2015, when the president took over power and decided to select some parts of the agriculture value chain to concentrate on. In the ERGP, we selected three crops that we said we were going to achieve self-sufficiency and self-sufficiency is very important, because a population of 200 million people should be able to feed itself.\n\nWhen we were doing the plan, we asked Mr. President for his guidance and he just said, we must grow what we eat and consume what we produce. And every time we sat down, what we needed to do to achieve that just kept expanding.\n\nOf course, agriculture and food security are obviously key priorities for Nigeria\u2019s government today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow and whichever government comes must concentrate on agriculture and food security and then the improvement of the welfare of its citizens, which is the third key objective of the new NDP. These are basic things that any government that comes into power must do. We set out this plan in a manner that produced a fully developed NDP. We were accused that the ERGP was a federal government plan and so we wanted to change that. We did this by putting together a very broad spectrum of multiple stakeholders; so it involves the federal, state and local governments. The steering committee is chaired by myself and Atedo Peterside from the private sector and there is a strong private sector representation in the steering committee, the central working groups and the 26 technical working groups that we have.\n\nIn each of the technical working groups, we have representatives of six states, we have the local government representative, youth representative, women, people with special needs and different spheres of businesses. And this plan was built by both top-down and bottom-up approach. The concentrations were wide and what we want is for every Nigerian to actually own this plan. There are some countries, if you enter a taxi and start talking about the country, they would tell you the priorities of that country. That is what we want. We want every Nigerian to feel that they have a responsibility to contribute towards the development of this country. What is different about this plan compared to other plans? We took the pain to cost the plan and even though you have said the N348 trillion is large, we made the costing to be very pessimistic.\n\nFor example, when we were costing the revenue for oil and gas, we used $40 per barrel across the five years and the reason being that crude oil pricing is not something that you have control over. It is completely out of our control and it has this impact on the government, because even though our economy is diversified, crude oil is still the largest earner of forex. There is a strong focus on the plan to diversify the economy to support exports so that we can also have alternative sources of forex from oil and gas. Of course, the most likely sectors are agriculture and solid minerals, which involves the mining sector. We see a great potential in the mining sector and also greater potential in the agriculture value chain. When we were doing the plan, one of the issues we found out was human capital.\n\nIn every sector of the economy, there is the consideration of the kind of skill set you need to develop in the various sectors to be able to realise the objectives that we set. So capacity and skills are cross-cutting issues. Other cross-cutting issues for us are innovation and technology. That is because for us to make a quantum leap, and increase production, whether in the oil and gas sector, agriculture, mining, education or health, you have to use ICT. Then, based on the directive of the president, there is a serious attention on education and health. Why? That is because Nigeria still has one of the poorest human capital development indexes and we need to continuously look at how to improve the health and education sectors. We took the pain together with the Ministries, Departments and Agencies and the states to cost the plan, which is something that has never been done before.\n\nSo the N348 trillion was actually a line by line costing of programmes and projects in each of the five years that we put together. The plan is in three volumes. There is the policy itself, which is the plan; there is the costing and there is a third volume, which contains reforms that must be undertaken as well as legislations that may either be amended or made, to make sure we are able to achieve the targets. We also had representatives from the three major political parties as part of the process, because we wanted the plan to be beyond the ruling party. We had the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), All Progressives Congress (APC) and the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). The truth is that the PDP didn\u2019t show up for one day, but we made sure we invited them to every meeting.\n\nBut for this plan to really be effective, is there a plan to sensitise members of the public and how are you going about that?\n\nThere is a communication plan that is just like an outline, but needs to be developed. Why it has not been developed in full is that we realised that we need more consultations on that aspect of the plan itself. The communication plan would be able to educate everyone on specific responsibilities. That is, everyone would know the responsibilities of government in the plan, that of the states, businesses and citizens. Citizens have the responsibility to pay taxes, to hold the government accountable and to obey the laws. So there is a communication plan that would identify every stakeholder and their responsibilities in the value chain and also the method that would be used in communicating the plan to the various groups and stakeholders.\n\nYou said the economy is diversified, but why is Nigeria still heavily dependent on oil revenue to the extent that once there is a shock in the oil sector, the impact on our economy is always immediate?\n\nThe economy is fully diversified, but we need to deepen that diversification; we also need to enhance our alternative exports to oil and gas. Right now, the oil and gas sector still earns like 90 per cent of the forex for our economy and that exposes us to different kinds of fragilities and any hiccup in the sector affects. Forex has effects on so many things, including production, because of inputs that need to be brought into the country by the manufacturers.\n\nAre there milestones that have been set in this new NDP to measure achievements and successes in different sectors?\n\nThere is a robust monitoring and evaluation framework that has been set. There is a national steering committee that would be headed by the Vice President, with some ministers. The secretariat would be the planning arm of the ministry. The costing also included clear key performance indicators that needed to be tracked and measured on an ongoing basis. There is a Project Implementation Unit, that has been set up, whose sole responsibility is the tracking of performance of the plan on a daily basis. The unit will be tracking not just the federal government component, but also the states and private sector performances.\n\nFederal government\u2019s revenue projections have always missed targets. For 2022, 34.9 per cent of projected revenue is to come from oil-related sources while 65.1 per cent is expected from non-oil sources. Is there any reason for optimism that the country might have a break from the past?\n\nThe 2021 budget has 55 per cent revenue contribution from the non-oil sector and 45 per cent from the oil sector. From 2019, we were able to turn the tide such that the greater contribution to our revenue is from the non-oil sector. The actual performance of the non-oil sector as at the end of August 2021 was 116 per cent. So it is not true that we have never reached the target; we have actually gone above the target in terms of non-oil revenue. It is the oil and gas sector that is actually lagging behind and when we prorated the total performance as of August, it was 73 per cent. So revenues have picked up generally, because in 2019, we put in place the Strategic Revenue Growth Initiative (SRGI), which is an initiative of our ministry that was designed to enhance the existing revenue streams, to also identify and put in place new revenue streams. Since then, we have seen our revenue increase on an incremental basis, but the problem is that our expenditure has also been increasing and much faster than the revenue.\n\nIn 2020, when we had the COVID-19, we ended up going out to borrow more money. We were on a growth part for about 12 quarters and our revenues were increasing reasonably. When this administration came into power, the Revenue-to-GDP was six per cent, but we were at nine per cent at the end of 2019, but now we are down to eight per cent. But our target is to get to 15 per cent by 2025. So the SRGI has helped us to not only increase revenue, but to enforce necessary reforms that have helped us to reduce leakages, cut down costs that are necessary, introduce the Finance Bill that we have so far done in 2019 and 2020. The Finance Bill was part of the initiatives that we have in the SRGI and through the instruments of the Finance Bill, we have been able to do so many things in terms of improving the fiscal space across several sectors of the Nigerian economy by changing and amending laws. Every year, we continue to tighten those gaps that were resulting in wastage within the economy.\n\nOne issue that keeps coming up is Nigeria\u2019s debt. The Senate recently approved fresh borrowing for the federal government, are you not worried about the country\u2019s rising debt profile which the Chairman of the President\u2019s Economic Advisory Council recently warned was unsustainable?\n\nOn revenues, we can look inwards and we are looking inwards and also a lot of the things we are doing in terms of enhancing revenue are working. Every Nigerian is right to be concerned about borrowing. Even as a household, if you are borrowing continuously, you should be worried about it, because the thing about borrowing is that you need to repay. So while we have been borrowing, we have made sure that we apply what we borrow to critical infrastructure necessary to enhance our business environment. If we don\u2019t invest to make sure that we have adequate power, good roads and also that we have rail lines that are able to move cargoes, not just people and that our airports are of international standards, it would cost us in terms of growth and we would be regressing. It is not fun for us just going out to borrow. We are also not borrowing irresponsibly. We have a Debt Management Office and there is a lot of rigour that goes through the borrowing process.\n\nFirst of all, there is a limit to borrowing that was set by the Fiscal Responsibility Act. The limit today is three per cent of the GDP. In 2020, we exceeded three per cent, because of the national emergency. In 2021, we also exceeded it slightly, but in 2022, we have been able to come down to 3.05 per cent and in subsequent years, we are reducing. I say it again today, that we don\u2019t have a debt problem, what we have is a revenue problem. At about 23 per cent of GDP, Nigeria\u2019s debt level is one of the lowest amongst its comparators. It is the revenue that we have to concentrate on, working on and also we have to be vigilant as Nigerians to make sure that the borrowing is applied to important projects that would enhance the growth of the economy. And for our revenues, we have taken a lot of measures. The Finance Act has helped us to tighten a lot of the gaps that used to exist, especially the provision we made in the Act that limits government-owned enterprises to 50 per cent expenditure of their revenue. In the past, we had agencies that would spend 95 per cent of their revenues and either very little or nothing came to the government.\n\nAre they complying?\n\nYes, it is working even though it is very difficult to enforce. People are not happy about it, but it is a law and we are enforcing it. In the 2021 budget, we have been able to bring all government enterprises into the budget and now, we have 64 agencies and that gives us control, to be able to see even from the budget level that the expenditure budgets of those agencies are limited to that 50 per cent. It is a struggle, but we have the National Assembly behind us and they understand the importance and the president has directed it. And in doing that, the revenue from the government-owned enterprises tripled. In the 2021 Finance Act, we are also going to compel every government agency to comply with the provisions of the constitution that states that every revenue that they generate must first of all go to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Right now, we have several agencies of government that have different provisions in their Acts that empower them to use their revenues in so many different things. So what we are planning to achieve in the next Finance Bill which is major, is to make sure that every revenue goes into the pool and then what is due to you would be given to you, instead of the agencies spending and then deciding what goes to the government. We believe that also, would be a game changer for us in terms of revenues.\n\nBut for how long will Nigeria continue to use more than 90 per cent of its revenue to service debt, which you know is unsustainable?\n\nThat happens when revenues are underperforming. When you look at the budget, the revenue-to-debt service ratio is 40 to 45 per cent. In 2021 budget, it is 45 per cent. If the revenue underperforms, then you now have that ratio climbing high. In 2020, we had a challenge, when revenues were very low, we had some months that the ratio was up to 90 per cent revenue-to-GDP. In that case, we had to get a short-term facility from the Central Bank, to be able to support the government in terms of running its day-to-day expenditure. But we are no longer in that position. From March this year, we didn\u2019t have to borrow from the CBN and we were able to use our revenues to service debts. Also, we have also been able to raise funds in terms of borrowings as approved in the national budget, both from the domestic market as well as the external borrowing sources.\n\nYou have always blamed much of Nigeria\u2019s fiscal challenges on revenue shortfall, but some hold the view that the public service is bogged down by wastages.\n\nIt is a combination of both. We are now investing in automation as the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), for example, has been doing a lot of investments on automations, supported by some of the provisions we made in the Finance Act. For example, the FIRS has the authority to go into any system, government or private business and interrogate the numbers such as the turnover. We also have support from several sources such as the National Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU), the CBN, with data. With data, we have been able to identify people that are either not paying taxes or are underpaying and we are going after them one after the other, conducting audits.\n\nSo how realistic are your assumptions in the 2022 Appropriation Bill, especially, when you consider oil production?\n\nOil production estimated in the 2022 budget at 1.8 million barrels per day is less than the 2.5 million barrels per day installed capacity that we have. When we make the budget assumptions, we try to be pessimistic on the price and optimistic on production. The price, because we don\u2019t have control, but for production, we do have control and we do it to incentivise the oil and gas sector to be able to produce more.\n\nBut the nation has been lagging behind in the OPEC allocation quota for some time now and hasn\u2019t that also impacted revenue?\n\nThat is something that is of great concern to us. The explanation that we have from the national oil company is that at some point, we actually produce more than the OPEC quota and the regulator would authorise production to be reduced and in reducing production, it means some wells were shut down. The moment you shut down an oil well, in bringing it back up, you might not be able to get to the same level of production it was before. We were told it was a major part of the problem. Also recently, we have seen reports that there were losses that occurred due to oil theft.\n\nA few years ago, your ministry launched the Whistleblower policy as a tool to fight corruption and it was widely celebrated then. Today, there\u2019s hardly a word about that policy. Was it just an idea for the moment?\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t meant to be an idea for the moment. In also trying to reinvigorate it, we have had a stakeholders\u2019 workshop to ask how best this could be utilised for us to be able to do more than we had done so far. Also, there is an aspect of it that requires legislation to protect the whistleblower. A lot of people are not willing to come up, because there is no protection for them. So there has been a bill submitted to the National Assembly, but somehow the process was stalled.\n\nSome people have the impression that the whistleblower policy was actually targeted at political opponents, especially those in the past administration. Yet, things are happening in this government and when the whistleblowers come up with information, nobody acts on them.\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t targeted at the past administration. It was meant to improve reforms and also enable citizens to provide information to help the government in recovering either funds or assets that were illegally acquired. Again as I said, the issue of a lack of protection is usually a disincentive for citizens to act. So it is not political.\n\nYou have genuine reasons to stay away from the Value Added Tax (VAT) debate, but are you not worried that if the pending court judgment goes in favour of the states, it might affect the federal government\u2019s revenue base badly?\n\nNo, it will not affect the federal government, but it would affect a good number of states, especially those that have minimal contribution in terms of the derivation. Why did I say that? It is because currently, the federal government\u2019s share of VAT is 15 per cent and from what the states are advocating for, if the VAT case is decided in favour of States, then we would have the Federal Capital Territory, which is a federal government body, that currently contributes 20 per cent of the VAT. And also, you will have imports, which is a major component of Customs revenue will also go to the federal government, that\u2019s about another 15 to 20 per cent. So the federal government might end up with 40 per cent or even more. But we don\u2019t want this to happen. Why? That is because the fiscal federalism that is instituted in our constitution was designed for the strong to support the weak and that is what keeps us as a nation. So at the federal level, we are open to engaging with the states so that what is being advocated by the states that went to court doesn\u2019t happen, because it hurts federalism.\n\nBut they argue that it promotes it?\n\nSo, you would have states that have a large contribution to the derivation getting more revenue; but you might have some states that have very little or nothing. So, how does that encourage fiscal federalism?\n\nYou said last month that the fiscal authorities were working with the Central Bank of Nigeria to close the gap between the official and unofficial exchange rates and of today, there are some improvements, with the parallel market rate appreciating to about N525/$ from as high as N575/$ about a month ago. What measures did you introduce to achieve this?\n\nI would like to say that it would be good for you to hear from the Central Bank about that. All I can say is that I am in support of the work the CBN is doing and Nigerians should realise that you don\u2019t achieve results in one day. You set up policies, a lot of them very well intended, sometimes you get immediate results and a lot of time, it takes time to get the results. We hope that within the medium term, the gap that exists within the NAFEX market and the black market, which the central bank does not agree with, narrows. This is because it is important for businesses and the government. So the measures the monetary authorities are taking were designed to control price, to control inflation and also to better manage the exchange rate.\n\nBut one other thing that would also support exchange rate stability is the government\u2019s ability to attract FDIs. The president has been travelling in recent times trying to woo foreign investors, what is your government telling potential investors about Nigeria?\n\nThe president\u2019s message is that Nigeria is open for investments and also sitting one-on-one with investors, trying to know what they expect from us. That is why we are investing in basic infrastructure that businesses require. That is because no investor would want to go to a country, where they would still have to provide their own power, roads, and others. The investments we are doing in infrastructure are designed to bring in FDIs that would bring in long-term capital that would stay in this country. Recently, we went to the international capital market to raise Eurobonds of $3 billion, but we ended up with $4.2 billion in terms of interest. That shows you that discerning investors actually see the great potential that we have in the country and are willing to stake their resources in this country. As a people, we oftentimes do a lot of disservice to ourselves.\n\nWhile there are things that are not working well, there are some things that we have done well, but we don\u2019t talk about them and we just concentrate on the negative things. People might think they are hurting the government of the day, but what they are actually doing is hurting the nation. This is the only nation that we have that we can call our own. I just wish we can be a little bit more patriotic, knowing that this is our country; this is where our children are and we all have the responsibility to make sure that our nation continues to be stable.\n\nOne of the complaints from foreign investors is the ease of doing business. There is the issue of multiple taxation and it scares foreign investors away. What is the government doing to address that?\n\nReally, that is a problem. But we\u2019ll continue to work with the states to make things better. At the federal level, through the Finance Bills, we shall continue to improve the fiscal laws to avoid those duplications as well as block leakages and to provide incentives that are meaningful and that would help the investors. There are some states that are reforming their tax environment. I know of two states that have been able to repeal all laws and levies and they have just one tax law and one tax authority collecting all taxes, be it company income tax, property tax, or whatever. And when that state did that, it saw its revenue grow astronomically. So there is a benefit in doing that. The state governments are being supported by the federal government to enhance their public financial management. One of the ways we have done this, apart from supporting the states, is that we have also put in place the States\u2019 Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability (SFTAS) programme, which is funded by the World Bank.\n\nIt is a performance-for-result programme, whereby every state was asked to list key reforms that they would undertake. If they do that, they earn some revenue and it is not a loan. So SFTAS became so popular and we saw the states competing against each other, because it is a pool of funds. Also, we saw states becoming up to date in the audit of their financial statements, publishing their budgets so that it is open and doing a number of things that needed to be done that were not being done. This programme became so popular that we are doing another round of it, which is $750 million. We\u2019ll continue to find ways to incentivise as well as encourage the states to do more.\n\nIt is true that too many taxes and levies hurt businesses and the newest programme we have, apart from the SFTAS version two, is one we are designing with the states to improve the ease of doing business. We also designed it in the form of performance-for-result. For example, they are required to automate their land registration. Lagos and a few other states have done that, but a lot of the states have not. That is, if you automate your land registration, you get some points and you earn some money. So there is another performance-for-result programme that we are designing with the states and the World Bank that would help to enhance tax reforms, so that this multiple taxation you mentioned would be addressed.\n\nFunding the 2022 budget deficit is to come from domestic and external borrowings. Is the $3.4 billion Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund going to form part of the funding sources?\n\nYes, the $3.35 billion SDR from the IMF would be part of our external borrowing for the 2022 budget.\n\nTalking about revenue shortfall, how are you addressing wastage in public service?\n\nWe are doing that by the process of automation and the provisions in the Finance Act about state-owned enterprises and by monitoring and enforcing the law. The Treasury Single Account is one very important tool that we have put in place, that is helping us to enhance our liquidity management. Also is the Government Integrated Financial and Management Information System (GIFMIS). It is a system whereby all government payment transactions are processed. The Integrated Payroll and Personnel information system (IPPIS) is another tool that we are using. The IPPIS is being enhanced by bringing on board its HR component.\n\nWhat was your experience with the Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS)?\n\nThe VAIDS was an incentive programme that was open for 12 months and then extended for six months. It was a period within which a defaulting taxpayer was given relief to come clean and file their taxes without any penalty. It worked at that time in terms of incremental revenue that wouldn\u2019t have come if that programme wasn\u2019t implemented. But what VAIDS left for us wasn\u2019t just the revenue that we collected, but the data that we were able to get from it. We got the data of the taxpayers that were not in the tax net.\n\nAre you likely to reintroduce it because of the benefits you talked about?\n\nIt is a double-edged sword. It is not something you want to do on a continuous basis. But there is a similar programme to VAIDS; it is called Voluntary Offshore Assets Regularisation Scheme (VOARS). Nigerians or businesses that have funds offshore can also freely declare their funds. But in this particular scheme, there is a cost, unlike VAIDS. There is a certain percentage of what they declare that would be forfeited to the government. Once they bring in that money, they are free to invest it in Nigeria. That is led by the Attorney General of the Federation, because there are several bilateral agreements and treaties that take place between Nigeria and different countries.\n\nBy the second half of 2022, fuel subsidies would cease to exist as the NNPC becomes a full commercial entity, operating in line with the Petroleum Industry Act. Have you started engaging the labour unions and other stakeholders on the proposed phasing out of fuel subsidy to avoid strike or any other distortions to economic activities?\n\nThere is a special committee that is engaging with labour that is chaired by the Minister of Labour, the Ministry of Finance, Budget and Planning, Ministry of Petroleum Resources and several ministers that are engaging labour on an ongoing basis. To implement the provisions of the PIA, we have made provisions in the 2022 budget that the withdrawal will take place from July, 2022. But what we are doing is to look at a situation whereby there is some kind of support that is provided to a certain pool of citizens. This involves providing funds to the citizens directly to act as a buffer and the period is part of the thing that is being negotiated. It may be a minimum of six months to nine or 12 months. It is supposed to be like an allowance to support citizens and we hope to be able to cover a minimum of 20 million, up to 40 million citizens. But the condition is that you have to be registered and you must have a national Identity card; you have to be under a certain income bracket and once you meet the criteria, the money goes to you directly in the form of transport.\n\nGoing by recent experience, there is a likelihood that the National Assembly might jack up the aggregate budget of N16. 39 trillion. In the event that this happens, is that not going to compound your fiscal challenges, especially, budget deficit?\n\nI hope that doesn\u2019t happen because we have been trying to bring down the budget deficit which is slightly above the FRA at 3.05 per cent. The National Assembly is also sensitive about the size of the deficit. Yes, I know that in the past, they have increased the revenue and at the same time, increased the expenditure. We hope it doesn\u2019t happen, but if it does, we would try as much as possible to ensure that it is contained.\n\nIn the 2022 budget proposal, Defence, comprising the entire military and police, attracted the highest allocation. But the Nigerian Army has declared that its own allocation was grossly low. Are you likely to help?\n\nThere is nothing I can do about that, because whatever we provided is what is possible. Even if we give the Nigerian Army the whole of the N16 trillion budget, it still would not be enough. We also have to provide for education, health and other sectors of the economy \u2013infrastructure. Yes, security is important, that is why it has the highest size of the budget.\n\nDuring a recent public presentation, you did say the government would review sectors eligible for Pioneer Tax Holiday Incentives under the Industrial Development Income Tax Relief Act (IDITRA) as well as dimension the cost of tax waivers/concessions, and evaluate their policy effectiveness. Can you provide more insights into this?\n\nThere is a fiscal policy committee of the government that is reviewing the various incentives that the government has provided to businesses and Pioneer Status is just one of them. But what we want to do is to make sure that the incentives we are giving, that we are getting value from it. For example, the Pioneer Status is meant for businesses to plough back those taxes that were waived for them into the business, so that their businesses grow and they employ more people. In a lot of cases, that is not what happens. Some businesses would just repatriate that money that they would have paid as taxes. So we are reviewing and redesigning the incentives so that, once what we have on ground reaches their sunset date, the new ones that come into place would be more beneficial to the country.\n\nThis is the last full year budget of the Buhari administration as well as one preceding the election year. What are the unique features that the government has factored into the budget in line with these considerations?\n\nOur view is that the government is a continuum and whatever government that comes into power would still need to provide a significant amount of its budget for security as well as health and education. So we don\u2019t anticipate that there would be anything different from what we are doing right now. We are confident that whichever government comes would continue to implement the 2023 budget and also they would look at the NDP that we have started implementing.\n\nWhat are your takeaways from the pandemic experience and do you think the country is in a position to withstand a similar shock in the future?\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a wildcat that was never supposed to happen but happened across the world. I pray that it doesn\u2019t happen again, because it is difficult for an African economy to experience that kind of shock.\n\nAs you recently alluded to, there is a direct relationship between governance, poverty, and insecurity. How realistic is the president\u2019s target of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty and how do you intend to achieve that?\n\nThe president has said he would lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in the next 10 years. We did a National Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy, which has been commissioned by the president. There is a National Steering Committee that was set up, because a lot of the work needs to be done by the states, because the people are in the states. The major focus is to support MSMEs and to create jobs. So we are carefully selecting and providing support to businesses based on the number of jobs that they would create and to also reskill and up-skill our people, especially, the youth, mostly in the use of ICT, because that provides the best opportunity, even for self-employment and employment across board. We are also enhancing agricultural productivity by moving into agro-business \u2013 enhancing the value chain by processing more of the food that we produce and also reducing wastages due to post-harvest losses that we suffer.\n\nYou are the finance minister, under this government, Nigeria was rated the poverty capital of the world, how do you feel with such a label on your country?\n\nI feel very bad about it. I feel it is an unfair label and I feel it has to do with not having enough awareness on the things that we are doing and also us not putting forward the data on what we have done. If what has been done by this administration was taken into account, then, we would not be labelled the poverty capital of the world.\n\nFinally, as the Finance Minister, where do you stand on the proposed deduction of $418 million Paris Club refunds from states and local governments\u2019 accounts to pay some consultants? Are you in support of it and if not, what is your position about it?\n\nThe position of the finance ministry is just to implement the position of the court. The court has taken a decision, the Attorney General and the President have directed that we pay and we paid through a promissory note, which is a debt instrument. If the states have a problem with that, the courts are there. As long as we don\u2019t have a counter decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, we are compelled to implement the decision of the court.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Many are wondering whose is served to deny arms sale to Nigeria. Is it the interest of terrorists? Does the United States and its Western allies want to cripple the country on the pretext of rights abuse so terrorists and bandits can ride to power?\n\nNonetheless, Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Farouk Yahaya, told officers and men of the Nigerian armed forces and other security agencies engaged in the battle against insurgents to deal decisively with them in order to restore peace to the troubled areas. Yahaya said this yesterday in Minna during a chat with journalists, after a closed-door meeting with officers and men of the armed officers at the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) headquarters.\n\nA recent research paper prepared for the European Peace Facility (EPF), an European Union project for peace support operations across the globe, stated that terrorist groups, Boko Haram and the Islamic State for West African Province (ISWAP), had launched 500 attacks on military bases and formations of the Multi-national Joint Task Force (MNJTF) between 2015 and 2020\n\nThe paper noted that between 2015 and 2020, 2,368, \u201cuniformed personnel fatalities were recorded.\u201d\n\nYet, the United States threatened that Nigeria risked arms embargo for alleged violations of the laws on armed conflicts in the fight against banditry, terrorism, and other forms of violence in different parts of the country.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with CNN International released by the US Department of State, the US Secretary of State, Antony J. Blinken, had threatened that his country could apply the Leahy Laws against Nigeria if the allegations of rights violations were found to be credible.\n\nWhile the US has demonstrated considerable commitment in partnering with Nigeria to contain terrorism, especially with the recent delivery of 12 A-29 Super Tucano fighter jets purchased by Nigeria and the training of military personnel, the comment by the US top official left security experts wondering the actual position of the US in the war against insurgency.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY yesterday, a former army spokesman, Brigadier-General S.K. Usman (rtd), advised the US government to withdraw the threat of imposing arms embargo on Nigeria.\n\nUsman said, \u201cI do not think that arms embargo is advisable. The US should rescind its threat to impose arms embargo on Nigeria. The Nigerian government should also review its relations with the US.\n\n\u201cCameroon, Niger, and Chad are steeped in human rights abuses, yet they have good relations with them. Nigeria has done a good job fighting insurgency for 12 years. Sometimes it looks as if there\u2019s something else behind all these issues about human rights violations. Nigerians who are providing all these information to US from which they reach such decisions should also have a rethink.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cPeople should know that once Nigeria as the most populous black nation is in trouble, the rest of Africa is in trouble. It is important that we solve our problems ourselves.\u201d\n\nA top military official, who pleaded to remain anonymous, also faulted the comments by Blinken, saying a lot is on-going between the two countries presently that should not have warranted an embargo threat from the US official.\n\nThe official stated, \u201cThere is a lot going on between US and Nigeria not to warrant such an embargo. We recently inducted 12 fighter aircraft; there are training programmes on-going.\n\n\u201cOur relationship with the US has improved greatly. A lot is going on presently. I am not saying nothing is happening but I don\u2019t see that (arms embargo) happening.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government recently commenced a subtle celebration of an impending victory over terrorists in the North-east, following the surrender of 17,000 fighters of Boko Haram and ISWAP.\n\nUnder the President Good luck Jonathan presidency, the US government led by then President Barrack Obama and other Western nations had denied Nigeria access to arms on the allegation of human rights abuses. That had led to resort to self-help and black market procurement of arms that turned out inferior to the arms wielded by terrorists.\n\nIn a recent interview with THISDAY, Defence Spokesman, Maj Gen Olufemi Sawyerr, said the Armed Forces of Nigeria were winning the war against insurgency and armed banditry.\n\nSawyerr said, \u201cWe are winning the war in the North-east and North-west and the terrorists are surrendering in large numbers.\n\n\u201cWhy is it that it is now that we are clearly winning the war that such report is coming up to drag us back? We are winning the war and thousands of them are surrendering with their families. What else are we saying?\u201d\n\nThe US Embassy in Abuja had, last week, following the submission of the panel report on last year\u2019s #EndSARS protests in Lagos State, urged the state and federal governments to take steps to address the allegations of abuses raised in the report.\n\nMeanwhile, Yahaya told officers and men of the security services engaged in the battle against insurgency to deal decisively with those causing problems for the country in order to restore peace to troubled areas of the country.\n\nThe army chief stated, \u201cWe should be more resolute and decisive when dealing with criminals.\u201d\n\nYahaya told soldiers on the frontlines not to be lenient with the insurgents because, \u201cit is like fighting a war.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen we engage the bandits it is just like in a war, We kill them and take their weapons, that is what we will continue to do.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged there were challenges, but said the bottlenecks had been identified and would be addressed.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI have gone round all the states in Nigeria to assess the security situation and now that I came here, I have been briefed by my officers on ground.\n\n\u201cI commend them for the job they are doing\u2026\n\n\u201cThe essence of the visit is to interact with the troops, to ginger them more to do better. The challenges across the nation have been unfolded and we are doing our best. In war like this, you can have surprises sometimes.\u201d\n\nYahaya said many people had acknowledged there was much improvement in the security situation across the country when \u201ccompared to the beginning\u201d. He assured that military would continue in that drive.\n\nYahaya promised that the army would collaborate with other security services, agencies, and stakeholders to ensure the fight was won. He urged relevant institutions and individuals to lend the security agencies a helping hand, particularly with respect to intelligence information.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThese criminal elements are living with us and if we all join hands together, we will eliminate them. Now we are making progress we have improved results. The others (other security agencies) are already collaborating with us in the area of information sharing.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "In Double Standard, US Threatens Nigeria with Arms Embargo, While Silent on Israel",
          "text": "\u2022 100 NAF personnel as force reviews safety standards\n\n\u2022 CAN faults removal of Nigeria from religious violations list\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi in Lagos, Kingsley Nwezeh and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nIn what seems to be a clear case of double standard, the United States has threatened that Nigeria risks arms embargo for alleged violations of the laws on armed conflicts in the fight against banditry, terrorism, and other forms of violence in different parts of the federation.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with CNN International released yesterday by the US Department of State, the US Secretary of State, Antony J. Blinken, threatened that his country would apply the Leahy Laws against Nigeria if the allegations of rights violations were found to be credible.\n\nThe threat came just as the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) faulted the removal of Nigeria from the US 2021 list of religious violators, insisting that Christians are still being persecuted by terrorist groups and other Islamic associations in the country.\n\nAccording to reports, the United States was said to have vetoed over 50 United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions critical of Israel since 1972.\n\nDuring the last escalation of violence between Israel and the Palestinians, the US had reportedly stuck to that playbook, blocking a joint statement calling for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.\n\nSeveral resolutions condemning violence against Palestine protesters, and the illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, were also reportedly thwarted by the US.\n\nThe UN resolutions had also stated that East Jerusalem should not be considered Israeli territory, but the US recognised Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital in December 2017.\n\nIn contrast to Washington\u2019s blanket support for Israel, concerns have heightened that the US wants to tie Nigeria\u2019s hand behind her back in the face of attacks by terrorists, and bandits by threatening arms embargo against the country in the fight against insurgent groups.\n\nBut Blinken, in a surprise move, said his country would apply the Leahy Laws against Nigeria.\n\nThe Leahy Laws prohibit the US Department of State and Department of Defence from providing military assistance to foreign security force units that violate human rights with impunity.\n\nBlinken said: \u201cOf course, we also have laws in place \u2013 the Leahy laws, for example. That makes sure that if there are units that have committed abuses; we are not going to provide equipment to those units.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the US would invoke the Leahy Laws against Nigeria, the secretary of state promised: \u201cWell, we look in any instance if there are credible allegations that prove out or that we believe meet the standard of the law, of course, we will apply the law.\n\n\u201cIf there is genuine transparency, accountability, and change that follows from these incidents and these abuses, I think that is very important, not only to our administration. It is also important to the US Congress in making judgments about continuing to assist the security forces,\u201d Blinken explained.\n\nThe secretary of state, however, explained the nature of military assistance the US had been giving Nigeria, noting that it was not all about the sale of military hardware alone, but also about the software.\n\nAccording to Blinken, \u201cthe military assistance itself is not just the hardware that we might provide \u2013 airplanes or helicopters. It is also the software as well as the human software\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cBecause one of the things that we are doing is making sure that as we are providing equipment to deal with profound security challenges that are faced here in Nigeria \u2013 terrorism, criminal activity, other violence, those who will be using the equipment are trained.\n\n\u201cSecurity forces must be trained in a way that makes sure that they are doing it to avoid hurting the good guys, even as they are going after the bad guys, to make sure that the laws of armed conflict are fully in mind. If they make mistakes, they are corrected and they are brought to light immediately,\u201d Blinken explained.\n\nReacting to the report on the Lekki Tollgate incident, Blinken admitted that the report of the Lekki Incident had brought transparency to what happened on the night of October 20, 2020.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think the first of all, the fact of the report, of the panel\u2019s work is usually important because it is bringing vital transparency to what happened, to the violence that took place around the #EndSARS protests and the allegations of abuses by the security forces.\n\n\u201cI have not seen the published report yet. I think it will hopefully be coming out very, very soon. But a couple of things are really important,\u201d Blinken added.\n\nHe explained that the report was important to make sure that such an incident would not happen again.\n\nHe argued that reforms \u201care necessary to build and rebuild trust between the citizens and the security services, between citizens and the state. That is an obligation of both the state government and the federal government.\u201d\n\nBlinken insisted that officers of the Nigerian Army and the Nigeria Police, who played one role or the other in the Lekki Incident should be made to account for their roles.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf there are individuals that \u2013 as it emerges from this report \u2013 who are responsible for committing abuses, there has to be accountability in terms of those individuals. That too is vital to rebuilding trust between citizens and the state and the security services.\u201d\n\nThe panel\u2019s report had recommended that all officers deployed to the tollgate should face appropriate disciplinary action. Except for Commander, 81 Division Garrison, Brig. Gen. Francis Omata, the panel demanded that all military officers involved in the operations should be stripped of their status and dismissed on the ground that they \u201care not fit and proper to serve in any public or security service of the nation.\u201d\n\nThe panel equally recommended that the Divisional Police Officer, Maroko Police Division, Mr. Raji Ganiyu, and all police officers deployed for operation between October 20 and 21, 2020 should be prosecuted for arbitrary and indiscriminate shooting and killing of the #EndSARS protesters.\n\nOn the Ethiopia-Tigray conflict, Blinken disclosed that the US \u201cis acting in close coordination with former President Olusegun Obasanjo, supporting his efforts, and other leaders on the continent including Kenyan President Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta to end the conflict.\u201d\n\nHe emphasised the African-led solutions to end the Ethiopia-Tigray conflict, noting that the African Union with Obasanjo \u201cis doing exactly that. It is a very important approach and it is something that we will support.\u201d\n\nCAN Faults Removal of Nigeria from Religious Violations List\n\nIn another development, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) yesterday faulted the removal of Nigeria Nigeria from the US 2021 list of religious violators, insisting that Christians are still being persecuted by terrorist groups and other Islamic associations in the country.\n\nThe apex Christian organisation said that it was at a loss on the data or statistics used by the US government in arriving at delisting Nigeria from the list of \u2018Countries of Particular Concern\u2019 on the issue of freedom of religion.\n\nUS Secretary of State, Blinken, had in a statement on Wednesday, blacklisted Russia, China, and eight other countries as religious violators, leaving out Nigeria which was placed on the same list in 2020.\n\nSpeaking in Nigeria during a two-day official visit that ended on Friday, Blinken had disclosed that the delisting of Nigeria was based on facts.\n\nBut CAN in a statement yesterday condemned the decision, saying that Christians were still being ferociously attacked and that nothing has changed between 2020 and 2021 to warrant the removal of Nigeria from the list of religious violators.\n\nThe statement signed by CAN President, Rev Samson Ayokunle, read in part: \u201cThe US government did not contact us when they were listing Nigeria among the countries of \u2018Particular Concern\u2019 on religious freedom, neither did they seek our opinion before removing Nigeria from the list. If they had done, we would have been able to compare the statistics then and now on the issue of freedom of religion in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhatever may be the data they used, our prayer is that Nigeria would be a country where no religious group is discriminated against or persecuted and that our government would see to it that all religiously biased policies are discontinued.\n\n\u201cChristians had faced and are still facing persecution from ISWAP and the Boko Haram Islamic Group till today as before. These are the people who said their agenda was to wipe away Christianity from Nigeria and to plant Islam as the only religion from the North down to the Atlantic Ocean in the South. That agenda with the killing of Christians has not stopped till today and Nigerians are living witnesses.\n\n\u201cThe bandits have joined other militant Islamic groups to be ferociously attacking churches, killing worshippers, and kidnapping for ransom. The herdsmen are equally doing their havoc. We have lost many people and places of worship to their assault, especially in the North-central part of the country and the northeast.\n\n\u201cThough the madness has grown now and those who are not Christians are being attacked, killed, and kidnapped, this is because these criminal acts have become a lucrative business and it is whoever you can kidnap for money! If the government had responded appropriately when this criminal madness began and subdued these evil groups immediately, we wouldn\u2019t be where we are now!\u201d\n\nThe Christian association also said discrimination against Christians, especially in Northern Nigeria has not stopped.\n\n\u201cUp till today, our government is still funding the membership of Nigeria in all the International Islamic organisations like OIC and its allies without being part of any international Christian organisation.\u201d\n\nUS Trains 100 NAF Personnel as Force Reviews Safety Standards\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has stated that it would collaborate with the United States Air Force to conduct a training programme for its personnel on safety standards, disclosing the US had trained 100 of its personnel in the last six months.\n\nThe training is coming as the air force began a review of its safety standards in a bid to maintain high standards.\n\nAbout four air force planes had recently crashed in Abuja, Kaduna, and Borno within three months, recording high casualty figures and raising safety issues about the health of the air force fleet.\n\nThe air force, has, however, replenished its fleet with 12 A-29 Super Tucano fighter jets made up of six attack aircraft and six reconnaissance mission jets.\n\nThe air force said: \u201cEfforts were on to collaborate with the United States Air Force to organise an in-country safety management training for more NAF personnel before the end of the year\u201d.\n\nIt said so far 100 NAF personnel have undergone various safety courses within and outside the country in the last six months as part of measures to maintain international best practices in its operations.\n\nA statement issued by NAF said the review was predicated on the need to continually review and evaluate key safety strategies affecting its operations while ensuring the service remained a credible reference point for maintenance of high safety standards which was at the forefront of discussions at the just concluded 2021 NAF Safety Review Board (SRB) meeting.\n\nThe statement signed by NAF Spokesman, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, said the meeting, which was held at the NAF Headquarters Abuja, \u201callowed the service to take stock and appraise its safety practices and procedures for enhanced operational effectiveness and efficiency\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks at the meeting, the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, disclosed that as a highly technical service operating sophisticated aircraft, equipment, and military hardware, flight safety should be inherent in all NAF daily activities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

S.O. Bello, Commanding Officer of 65 Battalion, and Brig.-Gen. F.O. Omata actually went there with live ammunition \u2013 a claim totally in contrast with his earlier position on the issue.\n\nHe, however, said the live ammunition was for backup purposes and not used by soldiers deployed to the scene.\n\nBefore then, the Nigerian Army headquarters had lied on the day of the incident that soldiers were never at Lekki toll gate to attack protesters as claimed in the media, branding the story as fake news \u2013 a position they had since backtracked from.\n\nTaiwo is a son of a former military governor of Kwara State, Colonel Ibrahim Taiwo, infamous for his alleged involvement in the massacre of over 700 persons in Asaba, Delta State, during the Civil War.\n\nThe attack is coming a few days after the Justice Doris Okuwobi-led panel submitted its report to the Lagos State Government.\n\nTitled, \u2018Report of Lekki Incident Investigation Of 20th October 2020\u2019, the panel said at least 48 protesters were either shot dead, injured with bullet wounds or assaulted by soldiers.\n\nAccording to the report, nine protesters were confirmed dead, while four were presumed dead.\n\nThe panel listed 48 names as casualties of the incident.",

S.O. Bello, Commanding Officer of 65 Battalion, and Brig.-Gen. F.O.

          "text": "Femi Adesina, presidential spokesperson, says the federal government will act on parts of the #EndSARS reports that fall within its ambit after state governments are done with the procedural processes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn November 15, the Lagos judicial panel on police brutality submitted two sets of reports \u2014 a consolidated report on police brutality and the Lekki shooting incident.\n\nThis comes a year after the National Economic Council (NEC), chaired by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, directed state governments to establish judicial panels of inquiry across the country to investigate complaints of police brutality and extra-judicial killings.\n\nBut reacting to the submission of the reports on Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television programme, on Monday, the president\u2019s spokesperson said the states government are not bound by law to submit their reports to the federal government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdesina, who said the federal government does not have power to give directives to sub-nationals on judicial panels, added that the federal government will only handle parts of the reports that are of national interest.\n\nOn the #EndSARS Lekki tollgate incident, Adesina said it will be contrary to the country\u2019s law if the federal government looks into it, noting that it is the duty of the Lagos government.\n\n\u201cUnder the law, the federal government has no power to empanel a probe into anything happening in the states,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat would happen is that when the states come up with pronouncements on that panel report, that would then be of interest to the federal government.\n\n\u201cIt is not as if the states would bring it to the federal government. I\u2019m not quite sure if any states have submitted a report to the federal government but I know that areas that would affect the federal government, it will handle that.\n\n\u201cThe federal government does not have the power to give a directive to the state governments on the formulation of the judicial panel of enquiries.\n\n\u201cThere are some things that would be federal in nature, the federal will tackle that, there are things that are state in nature, the state governments will look into that. There is an attorney-general of the federation who would advice and the needful will be done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt would be contrary to the variant of the law if the FG is looking into the Lekki EndSARS incident, it is the duty of the Lagos state government and it is doing that.

          "text": "Afolabi Damilola Iyanuoluwa is a fictitious child\u2019s name but today, the imaginary four-year-old boy has four different birth certificates from four primary healthcare centres (PHC). The birth certificates were obtained during an undercover investigation which revealed a rampant lack of due diligence, open corruption and the indiscriminate issuance of the important document in Osun, Ogun and Oyo states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn October 18, 2021, when this reporter visited Isale Agbara PHC in Osogbo, Osun state, just a few workers waiting to resume their night shift duty were found on the premises.\n\n\u201cHow can we help you?\u201d asked one of them, a female, who had her glasses perched on her nose.\n\nAfter being informed of the intention to get a birth certificate, she said, \u201cgo there\u201d, pointing to a spot which an official of the National Population Commission (NPC) uses as a birth registration centre.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou will see the telephone number of \u2018Baba Ewe\u2019 on the wall. Just call him and tell him you want to obtain a birth certificate. He will tell you when he is going to be available and the cost,\u201d she added.\n\nWITH N1000, NO QUESTIONS ASKED\n\nWhen contacted on the phone, the official said he had closed for the day. But as soon as he heard that this reporter came from Lagos to obtain the certificate, he had a change of heart.\n\nLess than 10 minutes later, the official, who introduced himself as SA Alabi, arrived on a motorcycle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlabi was upset that the reporter came late to the hospital despite knowing that civil servants close between 4pm and 5pm.\n\n\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t pay us for extra time so you have to come very early tomorrow to do the registration and obtain the birth certificates,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe issue certificates on immunisation days and we already did that today. I will help you tomorrow since I know you travelled from Lagos but you have to pay for my kind gesture.\u201d\n\nWhen reminded that the next day, October 19, 2021, was a public holiday for the celebration of the Mawlid Nabi festival, he agreed to process the birth certificate that evening. All needed was a sum of N1,000 for a registration that is meant to be free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTell your friend to wait for you here. I will take you to my house so that I can get you the certificate,\u201d he said.\n\nAlabi\u2019s house is adjacent to the health centre. Asides from his work as an NPC official, Alabi also runs a tradomedical bone clinic.\n\nOn getting to the office in his house, he asked this reporter about his relationship with the child he came to get a birth certificate for. In response, the reporter said he\u2019s an uncle to the non-existent child.\n\nWithout requesting any hospital record as required, Alabi simply asked the reporter some questions about the child and his parents. After providing the necessary information and paying N1,000, Alabi issued an original birth certificate dated October 18, 2021. Just like that, the transaction was done. It was business as usual. It didn\u2019t matter that there was no official document proving the existence of the child.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nN500 IN OGUN\n\n\u201cWe are sorry, Today is Monday. You can\u2019t get it today. We give immunisations on Wednesday and that\u2019s when the officials of the NPC will be around to issue birth certificates,\u201d a nurse at Ijeun-Tuntun health centre, Abeokuta, capital of Ogun state, told this reporter on his first visit to the hospital.\n\nAsked if the process required any payment, she said: \u201cJust come with N500 and you will get it on Wednesday. Remember to come with the details of the child and his parents. The woman comes as early as 8:30am.\u201d\n\nTwo days later when this reporter returned, he met an NPC official who identified herself as Saka H. B. Again, the same information was provided for the issuance of a birth certificate for the non-existing Afolabi Damilola Iyanuoluwa.\n\nDespite informing the official that the child was born outside Ogun state, she said it was not a problem. Saka said the NPC clause, which says children cannot be registered in an area outside their place of birth, does not hold water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the blink of an eye, she issued a birth certificate and she offered prayers for the \u201cchild to grow old and become an important personality in future\u201d.\n\nWHATSAPP TRANSACTION IN OYO\n\nAt the two primary healthcare centres visited in Ibadan, Oyo state capital, it was much easier to obtain birth certificates by proxy. In one instance, details of the child were submitted via WhatsApp, without any visit to the hospital where it was issued.\n\nA source had earlier connected this reporter to a nurse at Ikumopayi primary healthcare centre in Lagelu LGA of Oyo. Over a phone call, the nurse, addressed as Iya Abiye, requested that details of the child and his parents be sent via WhatsApp.\n\nThe requested information was sent to Iya Abiye around 7:21 am on October 13, 2021, and by 12 noon on the same day, she called to say the certificate was ready. To make it more convenient, she offered to send a dispatch rider to deliver the birth certificate.\n\nSoon, a motorcyclist arrived with the certificate which had been duly stamped and signed by a registrar named Opaleke OA. Unlike the previous experiences with NPC officials, there was no form of physical interaction with the issuer nor was any evidence of the child\u2019s birth requested \u2014 yet a certificate of birth was delivered.\n\nThe experiences were the same at the primary health care centre at Elewi-Odo. The rowdiness at the health facility was overwhelming as nursing mothers filled up the section, waiting for their turns to have their babies immunised.\n\nWhen this reporter asked for the spot where officials of NPC attend to birth certificate applicants, he was directed to a right corner of the room where an official was sitting, swarmed by booklets and other stationery used for the birth registration process. On getting to her desk, the official told the reporter that \u201cyou have to wait behind because there are other people before you\u201d.\n\nWhen informed that the certificate was needed urgently, she asked our reporter to \u201cdrop something\u201d. After giving her N1,000, she fast-tracked the process and completed the birth certificate in less than ten minutes. The certificate dated October 12, 2021, was duly stamped and signed by the official named Tijani RB.\n\nPROCESS OF ISSUING BIRTH CERTIFICATES\n\nGiven the prevalent trend of issuing this all-important document without requesting proper evidence of birth, what exactly is the right process?\n\nThe documentation is often done at the local government headquarters of the child or at a primary health centre on a day set aside for immunisation. The data obtained are used to update the census figures on an annual basis for national planning purposes.\n\nAside from this, it also helps to establish the child\u2019s family ties and serves as a requirement for processing an international passport among other relevant documents.\n\nAfter a child is born, the midwife is expected to provide a certificate as proof before the issuance of a birth certificate. In a case where a child is born at home, his or her parents are required to go to the local government headquarters and get an affidavit to serve as the proof of birth.\n\nThe affidavit would then be submitted at any NPC office and a birth certificate would be issued to the child. But at the centres visited by this reporter, this process is not adhered to.\n\nWhile the NPC has on several occasions announced that the registration of children and persons under 18-year-old children is free, findings showed that officials in primary healthcare centres still charge for the issuance of birth certificates.\n\nIt was also discovered that the birth registration process is lax. Since there are no digitised records for the registration, it makes it easy to obtain certificates of birth for non-existent children \u2014 as long as applicants can dole out stipends for the service.\n\nIRREGULARITIES AMID RISING CHILD TRAFFICKING CASES\n\nChild trafficking is one of the worst cross-border crimes taking place regularly in Nigeria. A 2006 report by the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons Nigeria (NAPTIP) revealed that traffickers often travel with children using fake birth registration papers and posing as the parents.\n\nWhile there are no reliable statistics of child trafficking in Nigeria, the International Labour Organisation estimates that 1.2 million children are trafficked each year. Nigeria was listed as one of the countries with the largest number of trafficking victims overseas (particularly in Europe), with victims identified in 34 countries in 2018.\n\nAccording to the United Nations International Children and Emergency Fund (UNICEF), newborns are fast becoming victims of trafficking. And the ease with which anyone can obtain a birth certificate using a fictitious child\u2019s name in Nigeria all but encourages child trafficking.\n\nUNICEF\u2019s global database of 2021 also revealed that one in four children under the age of 5 do not officially exist, hence making trafficking of newborns easy, especially in countries like Nigeria where certificates can be issued without proper verification.\n\nIn 2017, security operatives rescued 135 minors in Jos, the Plateau state capital. The children \u2014 all male and within the age range of four to eight years \u2014 were found in a truck meant for transporting farm produce.\n\nIn May 2021, NAPTIP announced the bursting of a notorious child trafficking syndicate in the federal capital territory (FCT). The operatives of the agency were able to rescue four children from one Blessing-Nnena Eze, who allegedly stole them.\n\nTwo months ago, two suspected human traffickers, Ejiofor Izuchukwu and Nzube Okafor, were arrested for attempting to traffick 10 girls to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. This was after the duo had obtained birth certificates for the girls, taking advantage of the same questionable registration system. While NAPTIP and other relevant agencies have been able to rescue some of the children, a number of them remain missing, leaving their parents in a state of sorrow.\n\nThe police had in 2017 said child harvesting was a growing trafficking phenomenon. Frank Mba, the police spokesman, had described it as an organised crime, with medical doctors said to be involved in running baby factories where newborns are sold after the issuance of birth certificates.\n\nCHILD RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ADVOCATE DIGITISATION\n\nJoseph Igwe, an official of Child Rights Awareness Creation Organisation, said the findings of this investigation have proven that \u201cwe have fake figures on the population of Nigerians\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll of these fake babies would be recorded to our population. Is that not laughable? If we must fight trafficking, the government needs to take proactive measures that will make manipulation difficult,\u201d Igwe said.\n\nChild rights activists and ICT experts have advocated digital registration of birth as the solution to the menace. They argued that such an approach would help the country to keep track of its population statistics, trends and differentials.\n\nEbenezer Omejalile, coordinator, Advocate for Children and Vulnerable Persons Network of Nigeria, said trafficking is high due to a lack of accurate data.\n\n\u201cWe have rescued three children between last week and now. One of them is a young girl who jumped out of a moving vehicle,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShe was sold to Benin Republic for N500,000, to Mali for N5,000,000 and later to Ivory Coast for N2,000,000 before she eventually found her way back to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere is a conspiracy right from the community and children\u2019s destinies are being sold away. There is a need for digitalisation so that children will be duly captured during registration. You were able to get different birth certificates for a child that does not exist because the process is not digitised. There is no centralisation and this is contributing to child trafficking in the country.\u201d\n\nIbrahim Oredola, tech expert and founder of SkillNG, a solution-based platform that helps young people to learn digital skills, said he paid N100 to procure his birth certificate when he was 20-years-old.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria has refused to change from the analogue era to the digital age. There should be a database that validates the identity of a child. Your findings show that birth certificates even help create false identities.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t equitably share resources with false data. This is the time that NIN is critical and babies should also be allowed to have it. Maybe the government will do the needful with this kind of report.\u201d\n\nSalvation Aworanti, founder, Voices Against Rape and Sexual Harassment Foundation, believes that awareness is key to curbing the trend. \u201cPeople need to know that obtaining an illegal birth certificate is a problem and must be fought,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe should pressurise authorities to look at this problem as soon as possible to end harassment of children especially the females who are often victims of rape and other sexual molestation.\u201d\n\nNPC: WE\u2019LL LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION\n\nWhen contacted, Joseph Udi, director of public affairs at the NPC, admitted that officials at the grassroots perpetrate corrupt practices during the process of obtaining birth certificates for a child. He, however, said the NPC will launch an investigation to address the findings.\n\n\u201cIt is not as if we are not concerned about these complaints. Those officials are often told that what they do tarnishes the image of the commission. Corruption is a Nigerian factor and by the time people talk about this, they will point fingers at the entire NPC,\u201d he said.\n\nUdi dissociated the NPC from the irregularities, assuring that a digitised process would be launched soon.\n\n\u201cThere is no organisation that condones stupidity and irregularities. I think the officials whose names appear on the birth certificates you have need to be arrested and locked up,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is getting to the level where the commission must do something serious and I will pass this to the authorities immediately so that we can commence investigative actions that will be transparent.\n\n\u201cWe have said it times without number that birth registration is free. They (birth certificate registrar) want to mess up the image of the commission. We believe digitalisation will do and we are working with NIMC. We will ask applicants to submit their NIN so as to trace bad guys.\u201d\n\nThis is a special investigative project by Cable Newspaper Journalism Foundation (CNJF) in partnership with TheCable, supported by the MacArthur Foundation.

The data obtained are used to update the census figures on an annual basis for national planning purposes.\n\nAside from this, it also helps to establish the child\u2019s family ties and serves as a requirement for processing an international passport among other relevant documents.\n\nAfter a child is born, the midwife is expected to provide a certificate as proof before the issuance of a birth certificate. In a case where a child is born at home, his or her parents are required to go to the local government headquarters and get an affidavit to serve as the proof of birth.\n\nThe affidavit would then be submitted at any NPC office and a birth certificate would be issued to the child. But at the centres visited by this reporter, this process is not adhered to.\n\nWhile the NPC has on several occasions announced that the registration of children and persons under 18-year-old children is free, findings showed that officials in primary healthcare centres still charge for the issuance of birth certificates.\n\nIt was also discovered that the birth registration process is lax. Since there are no digitised records for the registration, it makes it easy to obtain certificates of birth for non-existent children \u2014 as long as applicants can dole out stipends for the service.\n\nIRREGULARITIES AMID RISING CHILD TRAFFICKING CASES\n\nChild trafficking is one of the worst cross-border crimes taking place regularly in Nigeria. A 2006 report by the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons Nigeria (NAPTIP) revealed that traffickers often travel with children using fake birth registration papers and posing as the parents.\n\nWhile there are no reliable statistics of child trafficking in Nigeria, the International Labour Organisation estimates that 1.2 million children are trafficked each year. Nigeria was listed as one of the countries with the largest number of trafficking victims overseas (particularly in Europe), with victims identified in 34 countries in 2018.\n\nAccording to the United Nations International Children and Emergency Fund (UNICEF), newborns are fast becoming victims of trafficking. And the ease with which anyone can obtain a birth certificate using a fictitious child\u2019s name in Nigeria all but encourages child trafficking.\n\nUNICEF\u2019s global database of 2021 also revealed that one in four children under the age of 5 do not officially exist, hence making trafficking of newborns easy, especially in countries like Nigeria where certificates can be issued without proper verification.\n\nIn 2017, security operatives rescued 135 minors in Jos, the Plateau state capital. The children \u2014 all male and within the age range of four to eight years \u2014 were found in a truck meant for transporting farm produce.\n\nIn May 2021, NAPTIP announced the bursting of a notorious child trafficking syndicate in the federal capital territory (FCT). The operatives of the agency were able to rescue four children from one Blessing-Nnena Eze, who allegedly stole them.\n\nTwo months ago, two suspected human traffickers, Ejiofor Izuchukwu and Nzube Okafor, were arrested for attempting to traffick 10 girls to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. This was after the duo had obtained birth certificates for the girls, taking advantage of the same questionable registration system. While NAPTIP and other relevant agencies have been able to rescue some of the children, a number of them remain missing, leaving their parents in a state of sorrow.\n\nThe police had in 2017 said child harvesting was a growing trafficking phenomenon. Frank Mba, the police spokesman, had described it as an organised crime, with medical doctors said to be involved in running baby factories where newborns are sold after the issuance of birth certificates.\n\nCHILD RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ADVOCATE DIGITISATION\n\nJoseph Igwe, an official of Child Rights Awareness Creation Organisation, said the findings of this investigation have proven that \u201cwe have fake figures on the population of Nigerians\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll of these fake babies would be recorded to our population. Is that not laughable? If we must fight trafficking, the government needs to take proactive measures that will make manipulation difficult,\u201d Igwe said.\n\nChild rights activists and ICT experts have advocated digital registration of birth as the solution to the menace. They argued that such an approach would help the country to keep track of its population statistics, trends and differentials.\n\nEbenezer Omejalile, coordinator, Advocate for Children and Vulnerable Persons Network of Nigeria, said trafficking is high due to a lack of accurate data.\n\n\u201cWe have rescued three children between last week and now. One of them is a young girl who jumped out of a moving vehicle,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShe was sold to Benin Republic for N500,000, to Mali for N5,000,000 and later to Ivory Coast for N2,000,000 before she eventually found her way back to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere is a conspiracy right from the community and children\u2019s destinies are being sold away. There is a need for digitalisation so that children will be duly captured during registration. You were able to get different birth certificates for a child that does not exist because the process is not digitised. There is no centralisation and this is contributing to child trafficking in the country.\u201d\n\nIbrahim Oredola, tech expert and founder of SkillNG, a solution-based platform that helps young people to learn digital skills, said he paid N100 to procure his birth certificate when he was 20-years-old.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria has refused to change from the analogue era to the digital age. There should be a database that validates the identity of a child. Your findings show that birth certificates even help create false identities.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t equitably share resources with false data. This is the time that NIN is critical and babies should also be allowed to have it. Maybe the government will do the needful with this kind of report.\u201d\n\nSalvation Aworanti, founder, Voices Against Rape and Sexual Harassment Foundation, believes that awareness is key to curbing the trend. \u201cPeople need to know that obtaining an illegal birth certificate is a problem and must be fought,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe should pressurise authorities to look at this problem as soon as possible to end harassment of children especially the females who are often victims of rape and other sexual molestation.\u201d\n\nNPC: WE\u2019LL LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION\n\nWhen contacted, Joseph Udi, director of public affairs at the NPC, admitted that officials at the grassroots perpetrate corrupt practices during the process of obtaining birth certificates for a child. He, however, said the NPC will launch an investigation to address the findings.\n\n\u201cIt is not as if we are not concerned about these complaints. Those officials are often told that what they do tarnishes the image of the commission. Corruption is a Nigerian factor and by the time people talk about this, they will point fingers at the entire NPC,\u201d he said.\n\nUdi dissociated the NPC from the irregularities, assuring that a digitised process would be launched soon.\n\n\u201cThere is no organisation that condones stupidity and irregularities. I think the officials whose names appear on the birth certificates you have need to be arrested and locked up,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is getting to the level where the commission must do something serious and I will pass this to the authorities immediately so that we can commence investigative actions that will be transparent.\n\n\u201cWe have said it times without number that birth registration is free. They (birth certificate registrar) want to mess up the image of the commission. We believe digitalisation will do and we are working with NIMC. We will ask applicants to submit their NIN so as to trace bad guys.\u201d\n\nThis is a special investigative project by Cable Newspaper Journalism Foundation (CNJF) in partnership with TheCable, supported by the MacArthur Foundation.

          "title": "The NFT artist who captured the global lockdown with 700 portraits",
          "text": "A few streets away from Eko Atlantic City, the doors to the exhibition halls of Gallery B57 are open, revealing a black and white portrait of Instagram Influencer, Sanchan.\n\nPortrait of Instagram influencer, Sanchan\n\nLast year, during the global lockdown, Nigerian-born international visual artist, Ade Adekola, made an open call on Instagram for people who were interested in having their photographs turned into portraits. He opened a sign-up form with a commitment to do 30 portraits, but when he opened the form two hours later, the number of requests had exceeded 80. He had to close the call immediately to avoid being overwhelmed.\n\nDuring the process of creating the portraits\u2014all 80 of them\u2014he was able to improve his creative process, developing new techniques that helped him optimise the way he worked. He took the original photographs shared by interested persons, stripped them of all colours, turning them into black and white. He then turned them into engravings, before shading, cutting, and colouring them. Optimising this process, coupled with the overwhelmingly positive feedback he received from his 80 selected muses, encouraged him to create more portraits.\n\nIn the end, Adekola created 700 portraits, but there are only 40 portraits with striking designs and a collage of all 700 portraits on display at the exhibition halls of the gallery.\n\nThe allure of the 40 portraits on display, chosen by Adekola for their unique poses, circumstance or personal resonance to the subject, was elevated by presenting it in lightboxes.\n\nNow titled Lockdown Portraits, his project would go on to form a part of his exhibition titled, Dislocation &\u2026 alongside Anthology of an African Wedding and Diaspora Axis.\n\nOpening up conversations for dislocated people\n\nDislocation &\u2026 is an exhibition featuring NFT art, 3D textiles and augmented reality and events that feature creators from Tokyo, Israel and Singapore on social media and other digital collaborative platforms.\n\nThe artworks in the exhibition were conceived, executed and completed during the year-long lockdown, exploring and amplifying the effects of dislocation on humanity.\n\nIn Diaspora Axis, Adekola took a blend of various nationalities and used it to create a textile design. Ade set out to give agency to people with double or more nationalities, who were confused about their \u201ctrue identities\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo, the inspiration for the anthology series, from that disability perspective, are people who had an emotional roadmap, and that roadmap was truncated. I just open up the space for you to enter and think about what may or could have happened.\u201d\n\nThe design was adopted by an Israeli company to create and display dresses. Using 3D, over 70 design patterns are shown to consumers. \u201cSo, when you buy it, they send the physical garment to you, all cut,\u201d Adekola explained.\n\nA pandemic is a form of dislocation to Adekola, who said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to explore the different kinds of dislocation forces. So, the pandemic is a kind of dislocation where people are in isolation\u2014a prolonged one.\u201d\n\nBuying African emotional entanglement\n\nA scene from Anthology of an African Wedding\n\nAnthology of an African Wedding collection explores dislocation from the angle of emotional entanglement in Yoruba wedding cultures. The Yoruba nation hails from the southwest region of Nigeria, and their wedding culture is colourful, vibrant, and in many ways, extravagant.\n\nViewable using augmented reality, Anthology of an African Wedding collection brings viewers a step closer to experiencing a Yoruba wedding with its traditional gowns, headgear and rings.\n\nAdekola has evolved his art using Photoshop for over 20 years, creating over 20,000 texture designs that he used to create Anthology of an African Wedding. Anthology of an African Wedding, which also sells as an NFT on OpenSea, consists of 18 art pieces\u20149 showing traditional wedding scenes and 9 white wedding ones.\n\nDislocation &\u2026 is on display at Gallery B57 until December 1st.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Chipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration may revolutionise Africa\u2019s creative hustle",
          "text": "Want to be a creator in Africa? Okay. But be wary; it\u2019s going to take time, thick skin, and a little bit of what we at TechCabal like to call \u201cthe creative hustle\u201d.\n\nFor years, Africa\u2019s creative industry has been hampered by poor returns, leaving creators at the mercy of sponsors and algorithm-manipulated trends.\n\nBut fintechs like Chipper Cash stand to be a driving force behind fan-sponsored content that may change the way Africans create and consume digital media.\n\nWhere the money resides\u2026\n\nTwitter has been a space for clapbacks, online discourse, and creativity since its inception. On the third most popular social media platform in Africa, the continent\u2019s Twitter users wield power so influential that Twitter began to build out its first Africa-based team in Ghana this year.\n\nWhile Twitter is an impactful platform for creators, it has not always been a lucrative one. In a world where creators are waking up to the value of their content, monetisation has become more essential than ever, and social media platforms are finally catching on.\n\nThe digital content industry is predicted to skyrocket to a value of $38.2 billion by 2030. But developing content in an increasingly competitive market requires funding and return on investment that Africa\u2019s creators are not seeing, which is \u201cthe quality of work creators produce,\u201d said David I. Adeleke, Communications Lead and Managing Editor at Nestcoin, in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nSo when TikTok, a newer entry into Africa\u2019s social media space, came on the scene, it offered a monetisation plan, out of necessity. To incentivise creators to pivot from the more popular social media platforms in Africa like Facebook, it rolled out its very own Creator Fund offering payouts to TikTok-ers once that reached 100,000 authentic views on the app.\n\nStill, in a world where creators like Ryan Kaji, a 9-year-old from the US, made an estimated $29.5 from YouTube and an additional $200 million from branded toys and clothing, Africa\u2019s creatives are making far less money from their work.\n\nThe funding divide\n\nYouTubers earn money directly from YouTube for ads inserted on top of their videos. They are paid on a cost-per-thousand-views (CPM) basis and accrue earnings when a viewer watches at least 30 seconds of a played ad or half the ad for a shorter advertisement.\n\nOf the 10 countries with the highest CPM per video, Algeria is the only African country on the list. Algerian YouTubers receive $24.50 CPM. And, after earnings are garnered, YouTube takes a 55% cut, further reducing take-home pay.\n\nAccording to Mike Otieno, co-founder of Wowzi, a seamless, Africa-focused, AI-driven influencer marketing platform, South Africa is the most mature market for paid creative content in Africa, with the nation\u2019s influencers earning more, on the whole than other influencers throughout the continent.\n\nBut, even with higher than average earnings, Caspar Lee, South Africa\u2019s most-watched YouTuber, earns around 10% of Kaji\u2019s YouTube earnings per year. Nigeria\u2019s highest-earning YouTuber, Mark Angel Comedy, earns around 12.2% of that same figure. And Uganda\u2019s most-watched creator on YouTube, musician Eddy Kenzo, earns around 1.6% of that.\n\nThe difference between creator revenues and earnings in countries like the US versus countries in Africa comes down to market size and potential, says Otieno.\n\n\u201cMarkets with many big brands making a lot of money means more allocation to advertising budgets, which trickles down to creators. Thriving markets also tend to be hyper-competitive, so brands want to outdo each other.\u201d\n\nWhen bigger brands enter growing markets, they do so with a long-term outlook of the markets\u2019 growth, spreading endorsement funding out over a longer period. Brands with smaller budgets, on the other hand, tend to place conversion as a top priority and aim to get a \u201cmaximum return for their buck,\u201d remarked Otiento.\n\nBut forecasting a market\u2019s potential growth does not account for the power and value that creators add to the creative ecosystem in the present.\n\nChipper Cash, an Africa-made cross-border payments company valued at $2 billion, is working to change this by giving creators the opportunity to receive direct revenue from the audience that loves and understands the true value of their creative content.\n\nTwitter sponsors\n\nTwitter joined the creator monetisation club in May with its very own Tip Jar function. Through the Tip Jar, users are now able to send money to their favourite online voices via PayPal, Venmo, or Cash App in-app integrations. But, as none of these payment apps is widely used throughout Africa, the region\u2019s Tweeters were still limited in their ability to sponsor their favourite creators.\n\nIn October, Chipper Cash announced its all-new seamless integration with Twitter\u2019s Tip Jar.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, Wiza Jalakasi, Vice President of Global Developer Relations at Chipper Cash, shared that the fintech company worked with Twitter to build out the platform\u2019s tech to create a \u201ccheap mechanism for tipping out creators\u201d.\n\nTwitter users will be able to receive payments via a QR code or direct link using their chipper.me link along with their username and an easily accessible button on mobile, using the Twitter Tips feature.\n\nThe integration will also support smaller microtransactions, with no charge for withdrawals.\n\nJalakasi believes that the app\u2019s integration with Twitter will change the \u201cfundamental misalignment of incentives\u201d by getting rid of \u201cunnecessary middlemen [such as brand sponsors] in the creative economy value chain\u201d and help \u201cexpand monetisation pathways for African creators\u201d at large.\n\nSo far, the Twitter-Chipper Cash integration is only supported for users in Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda.\n\nFunding the fandom\n\nIt\u2019s clear that fans of Africa\u2019s top creatives are willing and ready to fund their faves. On Wednesday, Nigerian singer-songwriter, Davido, raised more than $338,000 via social media after posting his bank account information and asking fans and friends to send him a little bit of birthday cash.\n\n\u201cFans funding creatives\u201d has been a tried and true method in other parts of the world.\n\nChipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration is reminiscent of similar models used on China-made live-streaming apps. Fuelled by digital payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay integrated into the social media app itself, users were able to tip their favourite creators without leaving the app. Live stream tip functions were so successful in China that the market reached an estimated $4.4 billion in revenue in 2018 before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014which led to an additional surge in live stream viewing.\n\nWhat user-generated tip culture has provided in China is a robust influencer culture with a robust, local, influencer economy that spans e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and education.\n\nChina\u2019s influencers wield so much power that, in a recent double-11 sale for the Chinese e-commerce giant, Taobao, a top influencer generated $1.67 billion in sales over a 12-hour period.\n\nTikTok, born from the Chinese short video app, Douyin, has attempted to replicate this metric abroad and is now also offering gifts in the form of tips in select regions.\n\nYouTube also began offering a similar system with its Super Chat function in 2021, from which it keeps around 30% of overall earnings gained. Payment also requires linking your credit card to Google Pay.\n\nTwitter-unfriendly\n\nBut before Chipper Cash further expands throughout Africa, ideas about Twitter in certain countries will need a revamp.\n\nKenya is one of the fastest-growing economies in sub-Saharan Africa and a hotspot for tech innovation. In the country, Twitter is used as a vibrant space for social discourse. The unstoppable force that is Kenyans on Twitter (or KOT) has resulted in the relocation of a New York Times East Africa Bureau Chief and a rally to stop IMF loans to the country.\n\nOtieno says that moments like this make popular creators on apps like TikTok and Instagram hesitant to shift towards using Twitter.\n\n\u201cTwitter guys are seen as noisemakers in Kenya, so it\u2019s not somewhere people go to show love.\u201d\n\nHowever, Otieno believes that the integration of new app add-ons like Twitter Spaces and a clear monetisation scheme like Chipper Cash provides, creates an added benefit for creators to tweet and speak.\n\n\u201cIf you speak to TikTok and Instagram influencers, they\u2019ll say, \u2018I don\u2019t have a Twitter account. I just don\u2019t understand that space.\u2019 But Spaces gave Twitter more life.

          "text": "Yesterday, African e-commerce giant, Jumia, released its earnings report for the third quarter of 2021.\n\nDespite sharing healthy numbers as a result of accelerated growth across core usage KPIs\u2014including orders, annual active customers and gross merchandise volume (GMV)\u2014the markets responded differently with the stock price dropping by 20%.\n\nBefore sharing details of the report, recall that Jumia changed the functional (default) currency of its financial report from euros to dollars in Q2 2021. This will continue into the foreseeable future.\n\nHighlights from the report\n\nJumia\u2019s adjusted EBITDA and operating losses in Q3 2021 went up by 94% and 93% year-over-year, respectively, to $52.5 million and $64 million. This increase in loss was driven by a hike in the company\u2019s investment in sales & advertising and technology.\n\nSales and advertising expenses reached $24.0 million, up 228% year-over-year, while technology and content expenses increased by 27% to $9.4 million. This is a continuation of its return to aggressive advertising which slowed during the pandemic.\n\nCommenting on this result, the company\u2019s Co-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec said, \u201cWe believe that these investments are long-term in nature and that accelerating growth will ultimately contribute to profitability, leveraging the strong efficiency gains achieved throughout 2020 and the first half of 2021.\u201d\n\nJumia ended the quarter with $185 million in cash and cash equivalents and $399 million in financial assets.\n\nHistoric number of quarterly orders\n\nA major highlight from the report was that orders made on Jumia reached an all-time quarterly high of 8.5 million, representing a 28% year-over-year growth. It\u2019s the fastest growth rate of the past seven quarters, according to the company. Closely related to that, Jumia\u2019s annual active consumers reached 7.3 million and its gross merchandise value (GMV) reached $238 million, both up 8% year-over-year.\n\nIn the third quarter, FMCG inventories overtook fashion inventories as the fastest-growing category in terms of items sold. The former posted the highest ever volume number, almost doubling on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe second-fastest-growing category was food delivery, growing by almost 40% year-over-year. This category posted its highest ever quarterly volume with over 2 million orders, surpassing the previous record registered in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nJumia noted that it saw growth momentum across all inventory categories, except phones & electronics. The company attributes this slowdown to a global supply disruption, including global chipset shortages.\n\nJumiaPay and its fintech ambition\n\nIn the second quarter, JumiaPay\u2014Jumia\u2019s financial and digital services\u2014posted its largest-ever quarterly GMV processed. The company followed by disclosing in its third-quarter report that JumiaPay processed 36% of all orders on Jumia, a significant feat considering that it competes with numerous payment options. Riding on that wave, JumiaPay has continued to grow as the company expands the range of services available to consumers on JumiaPay App.\n\nIn Nigeria for example, customers are now able to book bus tickets via the JumiaPay App, including a proprietary seat mapping selection that will be rolled out in other markets in the near future. In Egypt, JumiaPay added new consumers, including several universities which students can now pay their tuition fees online via the JumiaPay app as well as a major Arabic content streaming platform, Shahid.\n\nOptimistic about its fintech ambitions for JumiaPay, the company shared a picture of its roadmap. In the near future, it plans to launch payment cards, savings, insurance and \u2018buy now pay later\u2019 offerings to consumers of JumiaPay. For merchants, it\u2019s looking to roll out point of sale, QR Codes, consumer financing, and other offerings.\n\nSource: Jumia\n\nLogistics services\n\nFor its logistics service to third parties, Jumia reached a major milestone by recording $1 million revenue from this service. It delivered 2.9 million packages on behalf of 766 clients, this was a 123% increase on the 1.3 million packages that were delivered in Q2 2021.\n\nThe company also mentioned that it took part in impact initiatives such as Giga, a global initiative to connect every school in Africa to the Internet and every young person to information, opportunity and choice. It also partnered with Solar Taxi, a modern eco-friendly mobility company, to provide an affordable and eco-friendly delivery solution in Ghana.\n\nThe increase in losses incurred by Jumia in the third quarter wasn\u2019t good news to some investors but the company sees it as a necessary path to achieving its goal of profitability and scale.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "MTN, Airtel to face stiff mobile money competition in Nigeria",
          "text": "Since the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) granted MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa approval in principle for the operation of Payment Service Banks (PSBs), a lot of competitive realignment has been taking place.\n\nChinese-owned OPay, arguably the largest mobile banking provider in Nigeria, has announced the appointment of a president and co-CEO for its Nigerian unit. Also, Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payments company, which in October raised a $150 million funding round, is now pushing its visibility aggressively in Nigeria.\n\nOPay\u2019s new appointment is particularly telling, not just because of the timing but also because of the quality of the recruitment. Olu Akanmu, the new president of the company in Nigeria, is a former executive director for retail banking at FCMB.\n\nAkanmu also has extensive knowledge of the telecoms industry having held the position of chief marketing officer for Airtel Nigeria from 2012 to 2013. He moved from Airtel to Insights Communication as client service director and later to MTN, where he held the position of general manager for consumer marketing for five years.\n\nSo, it is possible that OPay not only got themselves, someone, to help them drive mobile retail banking, they also can keep an eye on the steps being taken by the likes of MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa. OPay already claims it has more mobile money agents than MTN and other competitors, with over 300,000 compared with 230,000 MTN\u2019s MoMo agents.\n\nWhile Chipper Cash, with a valuation of $2 billion, may only focus on cross-border payments and transfers, and may no less be a big competitor for MTN and Airtel. In recent times, Chipper Cash has intensified campaigns aimed at creating brand awareness across the country and signed Nigerian afrobeats artiste Burna Boy as its global ambassador.\n\nMTN and Airtel would also need to keep an eye on TeamApt, which is currently in the market seeking to raise $150 million to push valuation to $1 billion. TeamApt claims 150,000 mobile money agents, 70 million transactions carried out on a monthly basis with over 14 million users, and a $3.5 billion value transacted.\n\nWhile MTN may find it a lot easier to deploy by leveraging the 230,000 MoMo agents, Airtel would need to build its army of agents to the level of existing competition to have a chance of gaining any significant market share. The telco has recently been granted approval in principle (AIP) for the Super Agent licence. Like the AIP for PSB, Airtel would need to satisfy all the requirements of the CBN within a period of six months before it gets a final super-agent licence.\n\nHowever, if antecedent is anything to go by, Airtel and MTN may have to wait more than six months for final licences to be issued. 9Mobile and Globacom were granted approval in principle for PSB by the CBN in August 2019; the final licence was issued in September 2020, approximately a year ago.\n\nRead also: PSB: Why MTN, Airtel Africa unlikely to replicate mobile money success in Nigeria\n\nIt is important to note that the number of mobile banking agents does not equate to the number of PoS terminals. As of September 2021, data from the Nigeria Interbank Settlement (NIBSS) showed there were about 307,000 PoS machines and 30,000 ATM terminals in Nigeria. The telcos would need to facilitate the provision of infrastructure in the country, and access to them has to be as easy as possible to attract new agents into the market.\n\nFinancially, both telcos may seem sufficiently prepared. MTN\u2019s vast infrastructure deployment may even give it an upper hand in the competition. The telco owns the majority of the backbone infrastructure that powers the services of its competitors. It not only provides broadband connection, but it controls about 80 percent of USSD services. It therefore would have the competition paying it while it also reaps benefits from direct services.\n\nAlso, MTN and Airtel are publicly listed companies. The South African telco is currently planning to seek additional funding through the sale of 575 million shares in MTN Nigeria, by way of a bookbuild to institutional investors and fixed price to retail investors. The shares are reportedly worth around $241.7 million.\n\nMTN Nigeria also successfully completed the issuance of its N89.999 billion Series II 10-year bond with a fixed rate of 12.75 percent due by 2031.\n\nThe series II Bond is the second issuance this year by the telco following the debut in May 2021. This completes MTN\u2019s N200 billion bond issuance programme.\n\nAirtel has also been busy in the funding market. In April, the telco announced it had raised $100 million for its mobile money business. So far, the telco has received a total of $500 million cumulative proceeds from the minority stake sales in Airtel Money from three investors.\n\nStakeholders say the decision by the CBN to issue an AIP to the telcos has positive implications for financial inclusion in Nigeria.\n\nMTN Nigeria and Airtel combined boast 124.6 million voice subscribers and 96.1 data subscribers. Apart from that, MTN Nigeria through its MoMo Super Agent network has amassed 230,000 agents across the country, and given its experience as the second-largest mobile money operator in Africa, after Safaricom, deploying the same service in Nigeria would not be so difficult for the telco.\n\nAirtel Africa has also acquired massive experience operating mobile money in 14 African countries. The participation of telcos in PSB is expected to significantly impact the more than 40 million Nigerians that lack access to financial services in the country.\n\n\u201cThe CBN has finally taken a decision that is positioned to impact the implementation of financial inclusion in Nigeria. Financial inclusion is best driven by mobile networks operators because everyone has a phone that makes use of their networks,\u201d Ajibola Olude, general secretary, Association for Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria (ATCON), told BusinessDay.\n\nNevertheless, the biggest challenge for the telcos may lie in the limits of the PSB licence they are waiting to receive. While their competitors, TeamApt, Chipper Cash, OPay may decide to give loans to users or even secure a licence for digital insurance, the PSB holders are not allowed to.\n\nImportantly, Nigeria\u2019s version of mobile money is different from other markets the telcos are used to. In Kenya or Ghana, MTN MoMo or Airtel Money users do not need a bank account or Bank Verification Number (BVN) to conduct a mobile money transaction. This is the requirement in Nigeria, whether or not the operator wants to use the mobile phone numbers of users to carry out transactions.\n\nThe phone numbers are connected to a bank account. It, therefore, means that MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa cannot keep deposits even though they can accept. They are not allowed to deal in the foreign exchange market directly but through channels within Nigeria.\n\nThese regulatory hoops could be the difference in revenue between the telcos and the competition. OPay has a microfinance bank licence that offers it the opportunity to resume credit services. It had suspended the loan business OKash in January, as part of containing its super app ambitions. Experts say credit and insurance offer more financial rewards, which are why digital banks such as Kuda Bank have recently increased their attention in growing the loan business.\n\nDespite the limitation, getting their PSB licences presents MTN and Airtel a great opportunity of fulfilling their long-term ambitions and may be with time their impact in financial inclusion would convince the regulator to remove the barriers.\n\n\u201cA PSB licence is like an upgrade to the MMO or Super Agent licence, especially for telcos,\u201d Oluwaseun Ayansola, a fintech expert, says. \u201cWhat do I mean? MoMo already had a mobile money operation (MMO). With a PSB licence MoMo can do more including issuing debit and prepaid cards in its own name by entering into a direct agreement with a card scheme (Mastercard, Visa, etc).\u201d",

          "title": "How new PSBs will disrupt Nigeria\u2019s financial landscape",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s traditional banking system is exclusionary, leaving millions out of the financial mainstream. A September 2020 report by the global consulting firm, McKinsey & Co, noted that while banking in Nigeria remained an attractive sector, with over $9 billion in value pools, the vast majority of consumers are underserved.\n\n\u201cLack of access to services,\u201d the report said, \u201cespecially in rural areas, issues of affordability, and poor user experience all contribute to the frustration consumers experience right across the customer spectrum.\u201d\n\nFinancial inclusion in Nigeria is among the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, lagging behind its peer group as well as countries with lower income. Within Nigerian borders, financial exclusion is highest in the northeast and northwest regions at 34 percent and 27 percent, respectively.\n\nA significant proportion of the Nigerian population (about 90%), noted a 2019 USAID funded Power Africa report, has little or no knowledge of alternative means of accessing financial services, including the use of mobile money despite having fairly good mobile network coverage in some parts of the country and high mobile penetration.\n\nThus, low mobile money awareness has led to low mobile money uptake in Nigeria, as compared with other countries in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nWhile the 2020 EFInA Access to Financial Services in Nigeria survey showed that 51 percent of Nigerian adults were using formal financial services, such as banks, microfinance banks, mobile money, insurance, or pension accounts, up from 49 percent in 2018, largely driven by growth in banking, with 45 percent of Nigerians banked in 2020, up from 40 percent in 2018, Nigeria fell short of the National Financial Inclusion Strategy targets for 2020. The country had aimed to reach 70 percent of Nigerians with formal financial services by 2020; the actual figure was 51 percent.\n\nRead Also: MTN Nigeria, Airtel PSBs to create 1m direct jobs\n\nThere has been a long-standing and broad-based consensus on the part of Nigeria\u2019s government and the central bank about the importance of boosting the provision and uptake of digital financial services (DFS). This forms part of a broader strategy to scale-up financial inclusion and, through pass-through effects, potentially to improve underlying economic conditions.\n\nNigeria has a relatively well-developed banking sector by regional standards, with a regionally high level of banking penetration (45% vs. regional average of 17.8% for West Africa) and robust use of advanced financial instruments in the local economy. The country is also well connected to international financial markets.\n\nYet, several barriers exist to leveraging digital payments for scale and Nigeria\u2019s traditional banking sector\u2019s capacity to mediate high volume credit to retail and corporate customers to drive economic growth has consistently remained subdued.\n\nS&P Global in its 2021 Global Banking Outlook report notes that Nigerian banks face struggles on many fronts, and projected the country\u2019s banks will grow slower in 2021 on the back of a subdued economy, despite the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s introduction of a minimum ratio of loans to deposits in 2019. \u201cWe forecast subdued credit growth to the private sector of about 4-6 percent in 2020 and 2021, after a strong 13.9 percent rebound in 2019, as the foreign exchange market and consumer demand stabilises. Banks will likely focus on blue chips operating across the manufacturing, trade, and telecoms sectors,\u201d the ratings firm projected.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its latest Financial Access Survey disclosed that the number of borrowers from commercial banks decreased to 29.61 per 1,000 adults in 2020 from 25.42 per 1,000 adults in 2019, despite the outstanding deposits with commercial banks per percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) rising to 20.50 in 2020 against 16.31 in 2019.\n\nNigerian banks during this period closed 234 branches and 649 Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) between 2019 and 2020.\n\nThe report also showed a sharp decline in the number of registered mobile money agent outlets in Nigeria to 129,154 in 2020 from 145,800 in 2019, representing an 11 percent decline.\n\nEnter the new PSBs\n\nSeveral market forces are set to contest the market space with established commercial banks and could swing the balance of power in favour of these challenger banks for selective banking services. Two weeks ago, telecom giants MTN and Airtel, in separate statements, revealed that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had granted them approval in principle to operate payment service banks (PSBs).\n\nThis was in furtherance of the apex bank\u2019s efforts to leverage technology to promote financial inclusion and enhance access to financial services for the unbanked and underserved segments of the population.\n\nThe approval, when finally firmed, will allow both telecom giants\u2019 PSBs to accept deposits from individuals and small businesses, carry out payment and remittance services within Nigeria, issue debit and prepaid cards, operate electronic purses, and other activities prescribed by the CBN.\n\nWhile several barriers exist to leveraging digital payments for scale, Telcos\u2019 participation in mobile money payments will likely raise mobile money uptake, increase financial inclusion and simplify payment collection.\n\nPayments are fundamental to how banks interact with customers. They support most propositions and touch customers more than any other part of a bank. It is, says KPMG Nigeria, \u201cthe key battleground for the customer\u2019s primary relationship\u201d.\n\nThe new PSBs are likely to challenge the incumbents primarily on higher customer engagement, coupled with smooth transaction capabilities and volume-driven metrics.\n\nThe basic premise for the introduction of payments banks is to escalate penetration in the unbanked and underbanked population. As such, their offerings are niche and they are not allowed to provide the entire gamut of banking services, such as asset products and fixed deposits. Thus, the situation still provides traditional banks with significant headroom for growth and also an opportunity to partner with payments banks to offer their products to an unexplored customer segment.\u201d\n\nYet, the new PSBs have the potential to be swifter and dexterous, and hence more responsive to changing market trends. With a large captive customer base, few or no legacy constraints and greater responsiveness to customer needs, and with no pressure to offer full-service banking solutions, they are likely to attract a large pool of well-served, underserved as well as unserved customers.\u201d\n\nThe business of PSBs such as those promoted by MTN and Airtel, centres on providing last mile connectivity and payment facility through either physical points or through other digital interfaces, including mobile or internet-enabled platforms. Besides offering basic deposits and remittance services, the PSBs are likely to introduce smooth, real time, secure, on-the-go approaches for facilitating retail payments.\n\nIn addition, they will be entering the market with clear advantages, and are expected to operate on an asset-light premise compared to the traditional branch-based and asset-heavy model, prevalent with traditional banks in Nigeria.\n\nA KPMG\u2013UBS study indicated that the cost of effecting a transaction from a branch is 43 times, call-centre and ATM is 13 times, and internet banking is twice greater when compared to mobile transactions. Therefore, the PSBs would no doubt promote and incentivise adoption and usage of mobile and digital channels to all customer segments. Evidence from the annual KPMG in Nigeria\u2019s banking industry customer satisfaction survey (BICSS) suggests that this will be a viable strategy for PSBs. The findings from the research show that adoption rates for retail banking customers for app-based mobile banking and USSD channels rose significantly from 48 percent and 41 percent in 2017 to 55 percent and 59 percent in 2018, respectively.\n\nWhile the new PSBs would leverage existing assets and capabilities within their parent network, they would also leverage capabilities such as distribution footprint: physical footprints, established route-to-market (RTM) capabilities, mobile app platform for e-Wallets, etc. In addition, they would be igniting their business operations with a large captive customer base, existing ecosystem for sales and service: agents and distributors, and regulation and compliance skills/know-how\n\nUnlike the syncretic approach of digital/branch-based banking operations of traditional banks, the new PSBs with their digital background and experience are likely to engender positive customer experience and loyalty by facilitating digital interactions throughout the entirety of the banking value chain. Activities such as customer acquisition and onboarding, back-office operations, transaction processing, customer service, management reporting, employee engagement, etc., would also be digitally enabled. Therefore, the PSBs can offer a distinct digital experience to customers that traditional banks have been unable to.\n\nIn addition, the PSBs understand the value of the data they get access to and the insights these generate on the preferences of both individual customers and specific segments. These insights can be used to refine sales and marketing of existing products and to spur the creation of entirely new ones. These types of VAS can be powerful accelerators of digital payments by attracting customers to the platform and generating revenue outside of transaction fees.\n\nWith a combined subscriber base of some 96 million active users, both Telco\u2019s\u2019 PSBs have a strong customer base to create easy onboarding for customers. To encourage wide uptake and drive volume, both PSBs would likely take a relatively light approach to transaction fees, so as to not create the type of pricing or behavioural barriers that can otherwise be a significant challenge. This itself is a challenge to traditional banks that have made a culture out of the widely unpopular transaction fees and have been unresponsive to customers\u2019 complaints.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Ohen, Odionwere and the entire people of Okhuoromi Village in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State, have expressed disgust over the recent protest by some dissidents of Egbirhe Village who claimed that the suspended former Odionwere Omuada, Roland Ekhoe Ogbegbor, allegedly influenced the boundary dispute between the two villages in favour of Okhuoromi.\n\nThe people who did not only described the protest to the palace of the Benin Monarch as unfounded, baseless, assault on the revered authority of the Benin Oba, but antics of a drowning man who typically will want to hold onto a weak stroll for seemingly survival, hence the protesters should not be taken serious.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Ohen of the Village, Ohen Ovbokhan Igbinovia, Counsel to the Village, Prince Peter Uwadiae Esq, said \u201cThe Egbirhe people are behaving like a drowning man who will want to hold onto any available stick for survival\n\n\u201cFor the record, from the video evidence that was tended in court, it was His Royal Majesty in Council, seated himself that passed the judgment in relation to the case between Egbirhe and Okhuoromi Villages. We didn\u2019t know one Roland Ekhoe Ogbegbor as claimed by Egbirhe.\n\n\u201cBecause as at the time (2000) the case was even reported at the palace, Roland Ekhoe was a nobody in the palace. In fact, it was Egbirhe and those who they transferred parts of the Land to that time, particularly one Gen. Agbonlahor rtd, that influenced that the matter to stay stayed long in the palace.\n\n\u201cSo, the cry now by Egbirhe that Roland influenced the judgment is baseless, unfounded and even an affront to the revered Benin Monarch, and the judgment that we hard that was reduced into writing and signed by the Secretary to the Benin Traditional Council, Frank Irabor\u201d, maintained\n\nPrince Uwadiae, further averred that why the Egbirhe did not criy to the Oba that Roland influenced the case before going to the court, wherein the decision of the Oba was uphold by Honourable Justice Esther Edigin rtd. when the palace judgement was delivered.\n\nHe said that it was the Oba that sent his emissaries after delivering his judgement to go and demarcated the boundary between Egbirhe and Okhuoromi, adding that on the day of the demarcation, January 4, 2017, Douglas Igbinidu, was there, spoke to the press and thanked the Oba for bringing to an end the boundary dispute between the two communities.\n\n\u201cThe people of Egbirhe did not tell the court that somebody influenced the decision of the Oba. Is it now that they have failed in court that they want to use Roland issue to relaunched their case in the palace. They filed an appeal in Appeal Court and they should wait for the outcome as the crisis is over at the palace and the first instant court.\n\n\u201cSo, Let they not think that because Roland Ekhoe is having problem with the palace now, and they want to use it to rub all the villages in Edo, as the palace is not vindictive of anything and the records are straight in the palace\u201d, he warned.\n\nIn their separate reactions, Elders Joseph Igbinovia (Ozukpogieva), John Osagie Edosomwan, Charles Otasowie and Lucky Otasowie while corroborating the position of the Ohen, advised members of the public to ignore the allegations of Egbirhe, pointing out that anybody that contest what the Oba has carefully resolved is not only enemy of the palace but Edo people in general.\n\nThey stated that he Douglas Igbinidu, also went to the palace of his Royal Majesty and thanked the Oba for a well considered judgement, just as the elders of Okhuoromi made available copies of Palace ruling dated December 24, 2018, signed by BTC Secretary, Frank Irabor and Enrolment of Judgement of the Edo State High Court in Suit No. B/361/19, issued on April 28, 2021 signed by F.O. Odayande Esq which was accompanied with survey litigation plan.\n\nThe Enrollment Of judgment as sighted by our reporters read in part: \u201cHaving to considered the Claimants\u2019 case as it is before this court will amount to useless exercise.\n\n\u201cThe Claimants\u2019 suit is uncalled for, most unnecessary and a waste of precious time that this court would have channelled to other cases, Claimants\u2019 Suit is dismissed in its entirety\u201d.\n\n...",

          "title": "ANALYSIS: Nigeria, climate change, conflict, and COVID. Why Buhari\u2019s carbon emissions promise is inadequate",
          "text": "During fifty years from 1950 to 2000, progress in human development around the globe was unprecedented, and countries like Nigeria with the lowest human development indicators were making the fastest progress in health, education, and civil and political liberties.\n\nDuring these fifty years:\n\nLife expectancy rose by 10 years\n\nInfant mortality was nearly halved\n\nFood production outpaced population growth\n\nIlliteracy dropped by a third\n\nMore children, and particularly more girls, were enrolled in primary school\n\nFormer colonies became independent democracies\n\nIn the first two decades of this century, progress continued. Poverty reduction was unprecedented. Child malnutrition, maternal mortality and the per cent living in extreme poverty declined significantly in many countries.\n\nIn Poverty and Shared Prosperity, the World Bank reported in 2020: \u201cFor almost 25 years, extreme poverty was steadily declining. The number of extremely poor people has fallen dramatically from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 689 million in 2017. Global extreme poverty dropped by an average of one percentage point per year between 1990 and 2015\u2026\u201d\n\nSchooling also expanded significantly during this period. In 1970 the gross primary enrolment rate was 68 per cent in Sub-Saharan Africa and 47 percent in South Asia. By 2010, according to the World Bank\u2019s Learning to Remake Education\u2019s Promise, that rate was above 100 percent in both regions. (The gross enrolment rate can be above 100 per cent because of repetition and other factors).\n\nNigeria, too, made progress during this period. According to the 2020 Human Development Report, between 2005 and 2019, life expectancy in Nigeria increased by 8.8 years, average years of schooling by 1.4 years and gross national income increased by about 59 percent.\n\nBut now, for the first time in many decades, all of this progress around the world is at risk.\n\nExtreme poverty is growing again: the increase in extreme poverty from 2019 to 2020\u2013 the year before COVID struck\u2013is projected to be larger than at any time since the World Bank started tracking global poverty in a consistent manner. Why?\n\nThe world is confronting three major challenges\u2013climate change, conflict, and COVID 19.\n\nThe most obvious recent challenge is COVID. Nearly two years of COVID has wiped out economic growth and progress, increased poverty, and reduced school enrolments around the globe. \u201cOther than a world war,\u201d says the Gates Foundation, \u201cthis is the worst thing that\u2019s happened in over a century.\u201d\n\nHere in Nigeria, however, it isn\u2019t just COVID that threatens our progress. Here, violence has taken its toll. Conflict and kidnaping have resulted in over 600 schools being closed. Nigeria has the unhappy distinction of having more children out of school than any other country in the world. Over 13 million. Over 20 percent of the world\u2019s total.\n\nBut an even greater threat looms over progress in Nigeria. Climate change will dwarf the pandemic and local violence. It is an ongoing threat to lives and livelihoods, and it will intensify in years to come. From extreme heat and desertification in the north to flooding in the south, food insecurity, violence, increased poverty and migration will all worsen.\n\nGlobally, climate change, it is estimated, will drive 68 million to 135 million into poverty by 2030. In Africa, the impact may be the worst of all.\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s new Groundswell Africa reports find that Africa will be hit the hardest by climate change, with up to 86 million Africans migrating within their own countries by 2050. \u201cClimate change is a particularly grave threat for countries of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia \u2014 the regions where most of the global poor are concentrated. The impacts of climate change can also include higher food prices, deteriorating health conditions, and exposure to disasters, such as floods, that affect both the poor and the general population.\u201d\n\nClimate change will exacerbate conflict, as water, food, housing and jobs become scarcer.\n\nWhat is to be done? Nigeria\u2019s government must understand that climate change is real. It is already upon us, and it is the country\u2019s greatest existential threat. It threatens to deepen current economic, political and social problems; it threatens the economy and all hope for the future. This is no time for complacency.\n\nWe must all heed the words of Ousmane Diagana, World Bank Vice President for Western and Central Africa.\n\n\u201cFrom pastoralists travelling the Sahel to fishermen braving the seas, the story of West Africa is a story of climate migrants. As countries are experiencing rises in temperatures, erratic rainfall, flooding, and coastal erosion, Africans will face unprecedented challenges in the coming years.\u201d\n\nTimidity in the face of \u2018unprecedented challenges\u2019 will be disastrous. Nigeria\u2019s government must focus now on building a more diversified and green economy, one that reduces carbon emissions, financial dependency on petroleum, and adapts to the real changes in Nigeria\u2019s climate and the changing world economy. It can be done.\n\nUnfortunately, President Buhari, in an article in Newsweek written days before the just-concluded climate conference, continues to minimise the risk of climate change: \u201cDire warnings of the end of the world are as old as civilisation itself.\u201d\n\nInstead, he calls for a lifting of the moratorium on fossil fuel investment in Africa. His commitment at COP 26 to reach net Zero carbon emissions by 2060 is timid and tentative. Over 110 countries have committed to a 2050 timeline. Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy, can do far better.\n\nTHIS ARTICLE IS PART OF THE AUN-PREMIUM TIMES DATA HUB PROJECT. READ MORE ARTICLES HERE.",

          "text": "Osun State police commissioner, Wale Olokode, at the weekend said that the autopsy on the remains of Timothy Adegoke, the Master in Business Administration (MBA) student of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, who was killed last week for suspected ritual purposes, would be conducted today (Monday).\n\nAdegoke had gone to Ile-Ife to sit for an exam at the OAU Distance Learning Centre, Moro campus, when he was declared missing on November 7.\n\nHis body was later discovered with some body parts said to be missing after some suspects, including workers at the hotel at Hilton Hotel and Resort were arrested by the police.\n\nIt was learnt that Adegoke had lodged in the hotel located in Ile-Ife, Osun State between October 22 and November 5, 2021, before he was later declared missing.\n\nThe student was reported missing on Saturday, November 6 when he was not found at his exam hall and could not be reached by his wife and other family members.\n\nMeanwhile, he had earlier contacted his wife to inform her that he was staying in a hotel.\n\nFollowing a police investigation, money paid by Adegoke for lodging was traced to one Adesola, who worked in the hotel.\n\nA source had disclosed that the owner of the hotel, who also owns Oduduwa University, Ramon Adedoyin, and other workers initially denied that Adegoke was at the hotel.\n\nAdedoyin has since been arrested and is currently being detained by the police, but the family of the deceased say there is an attempt at cover-up.\n\nOlokode, who disclosed that the autopsy would be conducted today in Oshogbo, Osun State capital, also hinted that the Force Headquarters is not taking over the case as being rumoured in some quarters.\n\nOn the autopsy, the police boss said: \u201cThe autopsy would have been conducted last Friday at the UNIOSUN Teaching Hospital, Osogbo, but it was later shifted because the family of the deceased wanted a medical expert who would represent them during the procedure to be part of the medical team.\n\n\u201cThe person who was to represent the family did not show up on Friday, forcing the shift of the autopsy to Monday (today) to enable all the parties to be represented.\n\n\u201cWe planned to have the autopsy on Friday, but the family of the deceased said they would want an expert who would represent them to observe the procedure.\n\n\u201cWe expected them throughout Friday and we did not see them, that is why we chose Monday for the procedure. If not for that, it (autopsy) would have been conducted. We will do our best to ensure that justice prevails.\u201d\n\nWhile commenting on the rumoured taking over of the case by the Force Headquarters, the police boss said, \u201cThe headquarters is not taking over the matter. In any case, if the headquarters wants to take over the investigation, I don\u2019t have options. I can\u2019t stop them.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say they should not take over, but there is no letter asking us to transfer the matter. We are proceeding with our investigation into the matter and we assure everyone that the mystery will be unravelled.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the Postmaster-General of the Federation and Chief Executive Officer of the Nigeria Postal Service, Dr Ismail Adebayo Adewusi, at the weekend assured the family of the deceased that justice would be pursued to its logical conclusion.\n\nAdewusi, while visiting the mother of the deceased in the family compound in Eruwa, Oyo State on Saturday, appealed to the family to be confident that the death of their son would not be swept under the carpet. Adewusi said Timothy, who was his nephew, was a humble and focused professional and a pride to Eruwa.\n\nHe said the family would wait on the police to conduct its investigations diligently, but said that the case would be one of those the police would use to demonstrate to Nigerians that no crime is beyond its capacity to unravel.\n\nAlso, the senator representing Oyo South in the National Assembly, Senator Kola Balogun, called on the police to carry out thorough investigation into the murder.\n\nBalogun, in a condolence message he sent to the family of the slain chartered accountant, released by his Special Adviser (Media and Publicity), Mr Dapo Falade, described the killing of the late Adegoke as heinous and a great crime against humanity.\n\nIn the meantime, Adedoyin, has denied involvement in the death of Adegoke.\n\nAccording to him, the first time he heard about Adegoke was when police declared the student missing.\n\nAdedoyin, who spoke in Yoruba, stated that he worked hard for his wealth, urging people not to tag him as a \u201cmoney ritualist or murderer\u201d.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

Like everything about this administration, its budgeting process seems to have gone from bad to worse, and the 2021 budget represents the hallmark of its fiscal confusion and conflicts in the management of the economy.\n\nFor an economy that is already experiencing stagflation \u2013 economic stagnation and hyper-inflation, which has swelled the population of poor Nigerians \u2013 the budget, ironically termed \u201cBudget of Recovery and Growth\u201d, the policies enunciated in it do not convey such intentions. It is evident that the 2021 budget may end the way of others since this administration, characterised by padding, under implementation, high deficit and debt, and poor performance\n\nThe parameters are quite conservative, which suggested new thinking and orientation, but the borrowing component and planned taxation throw a spanner in the works. The budget of N16.3 trillion is based on the benchmarks of $58 per barrel oil price, 2.4 mbpd, 12 percent inflation rate, 4.5 percent GDP growth rate, and N6 trillion new borrowing.\n\nApart from the oil price benchmark, virtually every other parameter in the budget is too optimistic and almost unrealistic, as has been the case in the past six years of this government. Currently, oil price is in the lower $80s and the lower benchmark is pragmatic to ensure more accretion to the foreign reserves to cushion the cascading value of the naira and wedge rampaging imported inflation.\n\nAlthough the National Assembly has expressed intent to raise the oil price in a bid to reduce the debt component, wisdom should inform that the oil price be kept reasonably low to have at least a $10 buffer for the naira. Perhaps, this is the only positive in the budget, as other parameters send alarm bell ringing over their thoughtlessness and foolhardiness.\n\nThe biggest danger in the budget is the N6 trillion new borrowing to finance infrastructure, but it has become evident that some parts of the borrowing go into recurrent expenditure, as we spent 97 percent of revenue on debt service in the first half of 209021.\n\nWe agree with the House of Reps members in the debate on the general principles of the budget that it sounds quite contradictory to have low oil price benchmark and a huge debt portion. The purpose of a conservative oil price is to have a modest and moderate budget with small deficit.\n\nHowever, the massive deficit of N6 trillion negates the idea of a lower oil price, which the Reps insisted does not make sense. So the intended increase in the oil price is to reduce the humongous deficit and borrowing, which has remained contentious under this regime. This government has borrowed more than any other government in history.\n\nNigeria\u2019s debt stock has already ballooned from N12 trillion in 2015 to N35 trillion and experts believe it will each N50 trillion by the exit time of the government. Government insistence on basing its borrowing on GDP, rather than revenue is plunging the nation into debt trap. An economy in deep debt and without strong revenue earning capacity can experience neither recovery nor growth.\n\nWith inflation still at 17 percent, and naira under the bus, as a result of foreign exchange pressure, the inflation rate of 12 percent is far-fetched. Inflation reduces purchasing power, which discourages demand and eventually reduces production and capacity utilisation. To achieve 12 percent inflation would be positive, but this is not likely to happen with the plan to raise tax.\n\nAlthough, government argued that many Nigerians evade tax, imposing tax in a recessed economy is a death sentence. According to government, the budget is based on bringing more Nigerians into the tax bracket to ensure more revenue outside of oil. Ordinarily, this is a good proposition.\n\nGovernment believes that only four million out of the 40 million eligible Nigerians pay tax and increasing the figure to about 20 million will solve the revenue crisis of government. In comparison, 14 million South Africans pay tax, which is triple the number in Nigeria with four times South Africa\u2019s population. Government must recognize the reason for the high rate of tax evasion in Nigeria.\n\nThe economy is unproductive and more tax will exacerbate its unproductivity. Tax will raise inflation because companies would pass the cost to the consumers. With high prices, demand would fall, and companies would cut production and ultimately lay off workers. So the very idea of tax is like the deficit of N6 trillion.\n\nSimilarly, the 2.4 mbpd output and 4.5 GDP growth rate are at best mere intentions devoid of concrete economic fundamentals to make them realisable. In the past six years, production output has remained at 2mbpd on average and the GDP has only reached 2.8 percent at peak. It would be great to achieve 4.5 percent growth rate, but the policies do not support such projections.\n\nIn our opinion, this budget does not provide much hope for the recovery and growth of the economy. All the optimism and confidence expressed by government on the budget seem misplaced and impracticable. A budget as an expression of intentions should also be based on facts that not only agree, but should also give a glimmer of hope.\n\nBoth we find absent in the 2021 budget and we are constrained to place any hope of improvement in the economy on it, because it is a badly coupled expenditure plan that sounds big on amount but projects very little on reality and result. It is another disappointment coming from this administration that promised so much to Nigerians, but sadly, has delivered very little.",

          "text": "At least, 366 soldiers, policemen and members of the civilian joint task force were killed in ambushes laid by terrorists in the North-East and the North-West between 2019 and 2021.\n\nA breakdown of the figures released by SBM Intelligence states that 337 soldiers, 29 cops and civilian JTF members were killed, while 111 others were eliminated by the terrorists.\n\nThe report added that 92 terrorists were eliminated, while in all, 569 persons were killed in several ambushes within the same period.\n\nA breakdown of the statistics showed that the biggest single onslaught against the military was in the Goniri area of Yobe State on March 23, 2020, wherein about 70 soldiers were killed.\n\nOn July 7, 2020 in the Damboa Local Government Area of Borno State, 30 soldiers and 12 policemen were killed along with three terrorists.\n\nBetween September 16 and 24, a space of eight days, about 49 soldiers and two policemen were killed in the Monguno and Marte local government areas of Borno State.\n\nThe report added that 18 soldiers and six policemen and members of the civilian JTF were killed in the Kukawa Local Government Area of Borno State on September 2 and 3, 2020.\n\nDespite the killing of soldiers, however, many of the terrorists are reported to have surrendered in recent times due to the attack on Boko Haram strongholds, while the sponsors of the terrorists remain unknown.\n\nThis is just as The PUNCH learnt that at least 15,000 terrorists, who surrendered to government forces had begun undergoing de-radicalisation.\n\nThe National Security Adviser, Maj, Gen. Babagana Moguno (retd.), had said last week, \u201cIn recent months, there has been an endless mass surrender of terrorists and their sympathisers in the North-Eastern part of Nigeria. Currently, over 15,000 people have been received.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the combination of kinetic and non-kinetic measures largely contributed to this wave of surrender.\u201d\n\nThe Head, Strategic Communications in the Office of the NSA, Mr Zakari Usman, told The PUNCH that all 15,000 persons, who surrendered, would be rehabilitated, including some who might be prosecuted.\n\nHe said, \u201cYes, everybody will undergo rehabilitation. Even those who are going through the criminal justice process undergo rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cAt the state level, together with the MDAs that are involved, there is already a process on the ground. For everybody who surrenders, there is some form of rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cThe rehabilitation, reintegration and de-radicalisation programme is for low-risk associates. That is women, children and conscripts.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, human rights lawyer, Mr Femi Falana (SAN), says he will be suing the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation for refusing to arraign 400 Boko Haram sponsors over six months after he promised to do so.\n\nFalana, who had written a Freedom of Information request to Malami in August to know the state of the case, said the request was based on Malami\u2019s claim of May 4, 2021 that the Federal Government had concluded arrangements to prosecute about 400 alleged sponsors and financiers of terrorism in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI have not received any response from the AGF since I wrote the FoI. So, we are now constrained to go to court. The AGF said publicly that 400 terror sponsors would be arraigned once the court workers called off their strike. That was over four months ago,\u201d he said.\n\nAttempts to get a response from the AGF\u2019s office proved abortive as his spokesman, Dr Umar Gwandu, did not respond to inquiries.\n\nThe Federal Government has come under fire in recent months for failing to name terror sponsors despite the assistance given to Nigeria by the United Arab Emirates and other countries, which provided lists of alleged terror sponsors\n\nHowever, in a statement in September, Malami defended the decision of the government not to name the terror sponsors, saying doing so could jeopardise investigations.\n\nMalami had said the Federal Government had been vigorously and intensively working to leave no stone unturned in the prosecution of Boko Haram financiers and win the fight against terrorism in the country.\n\nThe AGF had stated, \u201cThe time is not ripe for holistic disclosures so as not to pre-empt the investigation process. The prime objective remains the attainment of peace and security of our dear nation.\n\n\u201cAs far as terrorism funding and financing is concerned, we have succeeded in identifying those that are allegedly responsible for funding same and we are blocking the leakages associated with funding, while embarking on an aggressive investigation that is indeed impacting positively in terms of the fight against terrorism.\u201d\n\nIn October, the AGF had also linked the Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, to a convicted Boko Haram financier.

          "text": "At least, 366 soldiers, policemen and members of the civilian joint task force were killed in ambushes laid by terrorists in the North-East and the North-West between 2019 and 2021.\n\nA breakdown of the figures released by SBM Intelligence states that 337 soldiers, 29 cops and civilian JTF members were killed, while 111 others were eliminated by the terrorists.\n\nThe report added that 92 terrorists were eliminated, while in all, 569 persons were killed in several ambushes within the same period.\n\nA breakdown of the statistics showed that the biggest single onslaught against the military was in the Goniri area of Yobe State on March 23, 2020, wherein about 70 soldiers were killed.\n\nOn July 7, 2020 in the Damboa Local Government Area of Borno State, 30 soldiers and 12 policemen were killed along with three terrorists.\n\nBetween September 16 and 24, a space of eight days, about 49 soldiers and two policemen were killed in the Monguno and Marte local government areas of Borno State.\n\nThe report added that 18 soldiers and six policemen and members of the civilian JTF were killed in the Kukawa Local Government Area of Borno State on September 2 and 3, 2020.\n\nDespite the killing of soldiers, however, many of the terrorists are reported to have surrendered in recent times due to the attack on Boko Haram strongholds, while the sponsors of the terrorists remain unknown.\n\nThis is just as The PUNCH learnt that at least 15,000 terrorists, who surrendered to government forces had begun undergoing de-radicalisation.\n\nThe National Security Adviser, Maj, Gen. Babagana Moguno (retd.), had said last week, \u201cIn recent months, there has been an endless mass surrender of terrorists and their sympathisers in the North-Eastern part of Nigeria. Currently, over 15,000 people have been received.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the combination of kinetic and non-kinetic measures largely contributed to this wave of surrender.\u201d\n\nThe Head, Strategic Communications in the Office of the NSA, Mr Zakari Usman, told The PUNCH that all 15,000 persons, who surrendered, would be rehabilitated, including some who might be prosecuted.\n\nHe said, \u201cYes, everybody will undergo rehabilitation. Even those who are going through the criminal justice process undergo rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cAt the state level, together with the MDAs that are involved, there is already a process on the ground. For everybody who surrenders, there is some form of rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cThe rehabilitation, reintegration and de-radicalisation programme is for low-risk associates. That is women, children and conscripts.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, human rights lawyer, Mr Femi Falana (SAN), says he will be suing the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation for refusing to arraign 400 Boko Haram sponsors over six months after he promised to do so.\n\nFalana, who had written a Freedom of Information request to Malami in August to know the state of the case, said the request was based on Malami\u2019s claim of May 4, 2021 that the Federal Government had concluded arrangements to prosecute about 400 alleged sponsors and financiers of terrorism in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI have not received any response from the AGF since I wrote the FoI. So, we are now constrained to go to court. The AGF said publicly that 400 terror sponsors would be arraigned once the court workers called off their strike. That was over four months ago,\u201d he said.\n\nAttempts to get a response from the AGF\u2019s office proved abortive as his spokesman, Dr Umar Gwandu, did not respond to inquiries.\n\nThe Federal Government has come under fire in recent months for failing to name terror sponsors despite the assistance given to Nigeria by the United Arab Emirates and other countries, which provided lists of alleged terror sponsors\n\nHowever, in a statement in September, Malami defended the decision of the government not to name the terror sponsors, saying doing so could jeopardise investigations.\n\nMalami had said the Federal Government had been vigorously and intensively working to leave no stone unturned in the prosecution of Boko Haram financiers and win the fight against terrorism in the country.\n\nThe AGF had stated, \u201cThe time is not ripe for holistic disclosures so as not to pre-empt the investigation process. The prime objective remains the attainment of peace and security of our dear nation.\n\n\u201cAs far as terrorism funding and financing is concerned, we have succeeded in identifying those that are allegedly responsible for funding same and we are blocking the leakages associated with funding, while embarking on an aggressive investigation that is indeed impacting positively in terms of the fight against terrorism.\u201d\n\nIn October, the AGF had also linked the Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, to a convicted Boko Haram financier.

The signals are not strong enough to enable NAHCON make decisive statements or to give definitive directives.\n\n\u201cThus, ordinarily, an annual Hajj calendar of events would have been released by the Commission by now as a guide towards preparations for the next year\u2019s Hajj.\n\n\u201cHowever, with the uncertainties surrounding Hajj and COVID-19 constraints, developing a calendar of events presently has become a dilemma compared to past years. Firstly, no one can predict the new guidelines; policies that would shape the conduct of next Hajj talk little of setting a timeline to accomplish them.\n\n\u201cBy the way, Hajj calendars are tentative milestones for activities the Commission wishes to accomplish within a certain period before Hajj, during Hajj and after Hajj. For example, setting a date for when registration of pilgrims is expected to start and end, when pilgrims\u2019 accommodation is expected to be ready, when selection of airlines for airlifting of pilgrims is expected to be completed, selection and orientation of pilgrims officials, when caterers will be selected, setting inaugural flight dates, pre-Hajj preparations and post return journey etc.\n\n\u201cAnyone would agree that the times are yet unripe for such a calendar of events. Until a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is signed with Saudi Arabia on 2022 Hajj, NAHCON cannot circulate a speculative Hajj calendar that might be misconstrued as a binding document. Especially with the reality of social media consequences. In fact, until the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia provides an insight on what shape the Hajj would take, every nation is still in the dark.\n\n\u201cAnd would be suicidal for NAHCON to release what it has. Conversely, these uncertainties have not deterred the Commission from developing a tentative framework of action on Hajj preparations pending when the coast will be clear.\u201d\n\nUsara said, notwithstanding the uncertainty surrounding next year\u2019s Hajj, the commission was still on top of its game so it\u2019s not caught unawares.\n\n\u201cWhile waiting though, the Commission is test running some of its newly developed digital applications that would be launched when the fine-tuning is completed. Similarly, the Commission has been whetting knowledge of its staff through variety of trainings, capacity building workshops etc.\n\n\u201cThis is to keep its workforce abreast with modern operational techniques in various fields of human endeavor to meet up with challenges of the current period. At the right time, the Commission plans to dispatch a team of trainers to various states to sensitize them on the use of modern applications in the conduct of Hajj, and with a template on how best to organize pilgrimage under the influence of modern technology.\n\n\u201cIt is this writer\u2019s believe that many states are not docile and some are already brainstorming on best strategies in managing pilgrims that are not technology savvies in this age of Covid-19 technological innovations. These patterns of enlightened brainstorming would ease the task of coordinating Hajj and Umrah operations within a short notice if it so happens,\u201d she further wrote.\n\nUsara further said: \u201cHowever, it is heartwarming knowing that as at today, most states already have a list of registered Hajj hopefuls waiting to participate in the Hajj. Apart from that, some states are decisive on termination of registration of new pilgrims. And among all these anticipatory steps, Kogi state has made history as a pioneer in migrating all its registered pilgrims into the Hajj Savings Scheme.\n\n\u201cThis gives deposits of its pilgrims the added advantage of accumulating profit while waiting. This also means that by the time the Hajj fare is determined, the Kogi state pilgrims would pay additionally lesser than non-Hajj Savings Scheme intending pilgrims might have to pay.\n\n\u201cOne of the moves the Commission has made in recent times is to persuade government to intervene in some of the charges that might accrue on pilgrims as a result ofCovid-19 test protocols. This is with a view of alleviating the extra burden that might be placed on the pilgrims.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the Commission would continue to work with all stakeholders for the common interest of Nigerian Muslim intending pilgrims to Makkah.\u201d",
          "summary": "The National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) has said it still remains in the dark as to the certainty or otherwise of the 2022 hajj exercise.\nShe said: \u201cLike any other nation with a Muslim population going on Hajj, the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria, NAHCON, is hopeful that foreign pilgrims will participate in Hajj 2022.\n\u201cThus, ordinarily, an annual Hajj calendar of events would have been released by the Commission by now as a guide towards preparations for the next year\u2019s Hajj.\n\u201cBy the way, Hajj calendars are tentative milestones for activities the Commission wishes to accomplish within a certain period before Hajj, during Hajj and after Hajj.\nUntil a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is signed with Saudi Arabia on 2022 Hajj, NAHCON cannot circulate a speculative Hajj calendar that might be misconstrued as a binding document.",

          "text": "In yet another invasion of Zagzaga community in Munya local government area of Niger state, the third within one week, 10 more villagers were abducted bringing the total number of persons with the bandits to 80.\n\nSeventy of the residents were abducted last week at different times in the local government area.\n\nThe incident happened Saturday with the bandits placing a N150 million ransom on the victims to regain their freedom.\n\nA local source said: \u201cThe bandits returned to the community at about 8:00am riding on 10 motorcycles and started shooting anyhow after which they abducted ten of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey parked their motorcycles about 500 meters from the community, came on foot and began to select those that they wanted to take along. They were asking for the names of some particular people, suggesting that they were working with some informants.\n\n\u201cLater that day, the bandits reached out to the community leaders to demand for N150m for the release of the 70 people they abducted. They told us that the money was for the 70 people, including three nursing mothers that were freed because of their babies and a man who escaped from their den on Monday.\n\n\u201cThey even told us to go and sell our yams and other farm produce to raise the money. They told us too that they decided not to disturb the community since April this year after dislodging the military from the area so as to enable us to farm very well to be able to pay the ransom.\n\n\u201cTheir commander asked me that whether the community is not happy that they even allowed us to farm this year. He was even boasting that no amount of security could prevent them from invading any community they wanted to invade, so we should just go and look for the money,\u201d the source further added.\n\nAccording to him, the bandits said they allowed the villagers to farm during the last cropping season because of a day like this.\n\nIt was gathered that \u201cpeople are now leaving Zagzaga in droves as a result of the activities of the bandits who have set up a camp at Sohon Kabula with not less than 30 motorcycles at their disposal.\u201d\n\nSecretary of the local government council, Mr James Jagaba, and Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, DSP Wasiu Abiodun could not be reached for comment as at the time of this report.\n\nMonarch\u2019s brother abducted\n\nIn related development, some gunmen abducted Olujala Adegboja, an indigene of Olla town in Isin local government area of Kwara state.\n\nIt was gathered that the victim, who was in a van on his way home, was whisked away to an unknown location from the farm at about 7 pm.\n\nSpokesman of the state Police command, Okesanmi Ajayi confirmed the incident in a statement issued in Ilorin, the state capital.\n\nThe command said the anti-kidnapping and other tactical teams in conjunction with local hunters and vigilantes, acted swiftly to rescue victims as directed by the state police commissioner.\n\nHe said the captors stormed the Olla community shooting sporadically and ambushed the victim, said to be a brother of the monarch in the town.\n\nIt was gathered that the kidnappers had demanded N200 million as ransom for the release of the victim but later reduced it to N10 million.\n\nAccording to reports, the abductors attacked the victim with a machete before whisking him away to an unknown destination.\n\nThe kidnap operation, sources said lasted about one hour with consistent gunshots which enveloped the entire community.\n\nAbuja\n\nAlso, operatives of the anti-kidnapping unit of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command have foiled the kidnap of a cleric, Ayuba Samuel, at Nuku community in Abaji area council of Abuja.\n\nFCT Police Commissioner Sunday Babaji disclosed this to newsmen at the command\u2019s headquarters in Abuja over the weekend.\n\nHe said: \u201cA notorious kidnapping gang leader, Malam Bala and one Abdullahi Aruwa a.k.a Juli were arrested during a covert operation at Atako forest, a neighbouring village in Kuje area council of the FCT.\n\n\u201cThe suspects were arrested while perfecting plans toward executing the criminal act on how to abduct the clergyman at Nuku community in Abaji area council of Abuja.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the suspects equally revealed to the police team on how they had carried out several kidnapping for ransom operations in the territory.\n\nBabaji said two mobile phones with special lines were recovered from Malam Bala, which he said the suspect used in communicating with other gang members while perfecting their plans.\n\nThe police chief said two Gionee mobile phones which, according to him, the gang also used in contacting the families of their victims for ransom were also recovered from the second suspect, Abdullahi Aruwa.\n\nCP Babaji further disclosed that another suspected member of kidnapping syndicate that had been on the command\u2019s watch list, Awwal Abdullahi, has also been arrested.\n\nHe said the suspect was arrested by the police operatives from Dawaki Division, adding the suspect revealed how he recently participated in two kidnap operations carried out by his gang.\n\nThe CP said it was during further investigations that led to the arrest of one Isah Yusuf and three other members of the syndicate, even as he said efforts were being intensified to arrest other fleeing members of the gang in the two operations.\n\nHe said the suspects would be charged to court upon conclusion of investigation.\n\nBabaji urged residents of the FCT to remain calm, while reaffirming his unflinching commitment to rid the territory of every form of crimes and criminality and protect the lives and property of residents.\n\nNasarawa\n\nIn a similar feat, the Nasarawa state Police Command has foiled an attempt to abduct Mr Umar Nasiru-Black, Nasarawa-South Zonal Chairman of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, Rahman Nansel, said the police received a distress call November 20 at about 8: 30 p.m. that six gunmen had invaded Nasiru Black\u2019s residence in Lafia and attempted kidnapping him.\n\n\u201cUpon the receipt of the information, the Commissioner of Police, Mr Adesina Soyemi, immediately mobilised police patrol teams to the scene.\n\n\u201cThe abduction was foiled due to the prompt intervention of the team mobilised by the commissioner and members of the community,\u201d the PPRO said.\n\nNansel said in the bid to escape, the hoodlums hit Nasiru-Black with a stick on his forehead.\n\nJet fighters hit North-west\n\nMeanwhile, airstrikes conducted Saturday by aircraft of the Operation Hadarin Daji Air Component have led to the deaths of an undisclosed number of bandits.\n\nPRNigeria gathered that the precision airstrikes, which were executed at Dangwandi and Tsakai areas of Isa local government area of Sokoto state, resulted in the elimination of key bandits\u2019 leaders, and their foot soldiers.\n\nThe sustained aerial bombardments in parts of Zamfara state destroyed the logistics facilities and properties of the bandits.\n\nLocal sources confirmed to PRNigeria that bodies of neutralized bandits were seen all over the camps, just as the bandits\u2019 means of economic sustenance were destroyed.\n\nAccording to the sources, fleeing bandits were also trailed and neutralized by ground troops.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, the locations of bandit kingpins, Bello Guda Turji, and his subordinate commander, Bello Buzu, along with their cohorts operating within Sokoto and some parts of Zamfara State have been struck by the military aircraft,\u201d a military intelligence officer told PRNigeria.\n\n\u201cThe successes being recorded especially through air strikes by NAF aircraft in the Northwest as well as in the North East Theatres of Operation is indicative that new strategies adopted by the Armed Forces of Nigeria are beginning to yield requisite results.\n\n\u201cIndeed, despite the loss of a senior military officer and some soldiers recently, it is clear that the military is living up to its promise to rid the north and the nation of all criminal elements and their activities,\u201d the source further added.\n\nArmy tasks troops\n\nIn a related development, Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-General Faruk Yahaya has commended Nigerian Army for sustained attacks on the criminals disrupting the nation\u2019s peace.\n\nHe also charged troops to get at the bandits, kill them and bring forth their corpses and weapons..\n\nCAS Yahaya spoke Sunday in Minna during a familiarisation visit to 31 Artillery Brigade and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Minna and commissioning of the TRADOC Officers\u2019 transit accommodation.\n\nYahaya said: \u201cI am here in Niger today as part of my operation visit to 31 Artillery Brigade and TRADOC. I commend the troops for the job they are doing. Don\u2019t relent but continue and be more resolute and more decisive in dealing with criminals.\n\n\u201cWhen we engage the criminals and bandits, we kill them and bring their corpses and their weapons and that is what we will continue to do.\u201d\n\nHe said the Army would continue to motivate the troops by providing necessary supports to enable them provide security in the state and country as a whole.\n\nThe visit, he said, was to interact and ginger the troops to do more in the area of ensuring security for residents of the state. .\n\nThe CAS appealed for accurate and timely information to the Nigerian Army and other security agencies for immediate action.",

Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) commended the officers and men involved in the operations across the commands for sustaining the heat on drug cartels in the country.\n\n\u201cWe are proving to the bad guys and merchants of death that we\u2019ll not stay a step ahead of them but two steps in this game, and this we must sustain as we prepare to go into the new year,\u201d he declared.",

I think he would absolutely come to Manchester United on a five-year deal, with backing behind him.\u201d\n\nPochettino has also been said to be increasingly frustrated at managing a dressing-room with big egos like Lionel Messi, Neymar, and Kylian Mbappe and would love out of the club.\n\nLeicester City boss, Brendan Rodgers, has been heavily linked with the United job with the club willing to pay \u00a38 million in compensation to the Foxes.\n\nRodgers also has a contract clause allowing him to speak to certain clubs if they require the Scottishman\u2019s services.\n\nAlso in the running are Ajax boss, Erik ten Hag, who has been reported to be unavailable until the summer and Ralf Rangnick, the current head of sports and development at Lokomotiv Moscow.",

There are five children in the group of 16 U.S. citizens and one Canadian, including an 8-month-old. Their Haitian driver also was abducted, according to a local human rights organization.\n\nThe leader of the 400 Mawozo gang has threatened to kill the hostages unless his demands are met.

          "text": "A political slugfest seems to be in the offing between Nigeria\u2019s Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and his godfather, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, as an Osinbajo support group made public and formal their principal\u2019s intention to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 with the launch of a campaign office at the weekend in Abuja.\n\nCuriously, after months of equivocation and outright repudiation, Osinbajo appears finally ready to emerge from the shadows of doubt and throw his hat in the ring for the country\u2019s top job.\n\nA major pointer to this suggestion is the opening of a campaign office by a motley coalition of his supporters.\n\nThough some of the vice president\u2019s supporters denied the office launched was Osinbajo\u2019s campaign office, they said it was merely the office of a coalition aiming to draft him into the 2023 presidential race.\n\nOsinbajo\u2019s spokesperson, Laolu Akande, also denied the opening of a campaign office by his principal, in a chat with a national daily (not THISDAY), describing the report as \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\nThe campaign office, located at No. 15b, Buchanan Crescent, off Aminu Kano, by Emab Plaza, Wuse 11, Abuja, was inaugurated on Saturday in Abuja. It was decorated with Osinbajo\u2019s banner, bearing the inscription, \u201cFace of Hope.\u201d\n\nPublicity Secretary of the group, Mr. Emmanuel Pippa, in a statement Sunday, reiterated that the office belonged to the support group.\n\nPippa said in the statement, \u201cOur attention has just been brought to online publications, which allege that the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, has opened a campaign office in Abuja ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cWe wish to clarify that the said office belongs to our coalition of support groups, which strongly believes in Professor Osinbajo as the leader Nigeria needs in 2023, and is determined to get him to declare an interest in running for the office of President as early as possible.\u201d\n\nThe group said to actualise the objective of bringing the vice president into the presidential contest, they recently acquired an administrative office in the heart of Wuse 2 area of Abuja.\n\nThey added that though Osinbajo was yet to be acquainted with their activities, they intended to operate through a new organ, The Progressive Project (TPP), to coordinate the youth, women, and other groups across the federation.\n\nThe group declared: \u201cOurs is, therefore, not a campaign office but a venue for coordination, handling of increasing volume of correspondence, and meetings in readiness for the time, when Vice President Yemi Osinbajo accedes to our request for him to run and consolidate gains made under President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nThe group stressed that party chieftains would lead the real campaign in the fullness of time. It also stated that being a heartbeat away from the number one job, there were countless members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and even non-partisan citizens across the federation, who were pushing for Osinbajo to succeed Buhari in the interest of the country.\n\nThe group said it was convinced that Osinbajo\u2019s level of familiarity with the vision, achievements and challenges being handled by Buhari was second to none and that such insight would enable a new APC administration hit the ground running in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tinubu Support Group refused to give an opinion on the development. Acting Director, Media and Publicity of the group, Mr. Tosin Adeyanju, when contacted for his reaction, declined comment on the latest development coming from the Osibanjo camp.\n\nThough the vice president has not officially announced his intention to contest the 2023 presidency against his political godfather and former governor of Lagos State, Tinubu, the opening of the campaign office at the weekend in Abuja was a strong indication that he might have decided to throw his hat in the ring.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2015 elections, recall that Tinubu wanted to be Buhari\u2019s running mate and had done everything possible to get the ticket, including stalling the nomination process, after he was initially appointed by the party leadership to head a selection committee.\n\nBut Tinubu\u2019s ambition of becoming Buhari\u2019s deputy hit brick wall because the mood of the nation at the time was believed to be averse to a Muslim/Muslim ticket, a situation that eventually paved the way for the nomination of Osinbajo by Tinubu, in the presence of the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor E.A Adeboye.\n\nIt is, therefore, believed that for yielding the position of the number two citizen to him in 2015, despite wanting it for himself, it is only morally and politically imperative that Osinbajo would seek and secure Tinubu\u2019s blessing if he truly intends to run in 2023. But some Tinubu supporters believe he should not even seek the office of President since he knows Tinubu is nursing similar ambition.\n\nUnfortunately, those who believe Osinbajo should seek Tinubu\u2019s endorsement have another thing coming, because Tinubu is not about to make that sacrifice a second time. Since he too now wants the big prize for himself and has not relented in his push for the presidency in 2023, even though largely by support groups.\n\nHowever, prior to the inauguration of the campaign office, the Osinbajo group had in July lobbied some highly-placed members of APC to join forces towards mobilising support for Osinbajo.\n\nThe group, in a letter dated July 14, 2021, titled, \u201cAPC and The Future of Nigeria: Why We Must Get It Right and Consider the Osinbajo Option in 2023,\u201d and jointly signed by its National Coordinator, Mr. Ahmed Mohammed, and National Secretary, Dr. Eberechukwu Dibia, said there was need for early preparations towards ensuring that Osinbajo and some elements within the current administration emerged to deepen APC and Buhari\u2019s legacies after 2023.\n\nThe letter, which was addressed to the Senate President, Senator Ahmed Lawan, and other top party leaders, indicated that several APC governors, principal officers in the Senate, and House of Representatives, members of the APC National Caretaker Committee, former and serving federal legislators, other stakeholders, as well as the political aides of Osinbajo were being lobbied to partake in the mobilisation process.\n\nIt said, \u201cWith history in mind, we, members of the Progressive Consolidation Group (PCG), hereby solemnly join our voices with that of many others in appealing that you throw your weight behind our call for consideration of an Osinbajo successor administration after that of President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR), would have run a full course in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe believe \u2013 without any iota of doubt \u2013 that giving a worthy element within the system such as Vice President Osinbajo the chance to lead would not only enrich the system; it would certainly be the best assurance of stability and progress for extant developmental objectives.\u201d\n\nThe group expressed conviction that the task of inspiring party members \u201ctowards a shared consciousness of insightful search for Buhari\u2019s successor come 2023 should not be left to chance or last minute \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019 contests,\u201d stressing that Osinbajo should be collectively adopted as the right successor.\n\nThe group took it a step further, when it inaugurated the campaign office. Though the support group has denied Osinbajo has a hand in it, analysts wonder where the group is getting the funding to bankroll its activities.\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja",

          "title": "Security Experts Fault US Arms Embargo Threat against Nigeria",
          "text": "With some 100,000 civilians, security personnel, members of paramilitary groups, and aid workers killed, and over three million people displaced, with about N3.6 trillion property destroyed in a 12-year insurgency waged by the Boko7 Haram terrorist group in Nigeria\u2019s North-east, a threat by the United States to impose an arms embargo on Nigeria has ruffled feathers. Many are wondering whose interest is served to deny arms sale to Nigeria. Is it the interest of terrorists? Does the United States and its Western allies want to cripple the country on the pretext of rights abuse so terrorists and bandits can ride to power?\n\nNonetheless, Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Farouk Yahaya, told officers and men of the Nigerian armed forces and other security agencies engaged in the battle against insurgents to deal decisively with them in order to restore peace to the troubled areas. Yahaya said this on Sunday in Minna during a chat with journalists, after a closed-door meeting with officers and men of the armed officers at the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) headquarters.\n\nA recent research paper prepared for the European Peace Facility (EPF), an European Union project for peace support operations across the globe, stated that terrorist groups, Boko Haram and the Islamic State for West African Province (ISWAP), had launched 500 attacks on military bases and formations of the Multi-national Joint Task Force (MNJTF) between 2015 and 2020\n\nThe paper noted that between 2015 and 2020, 2,368, \u201cuniformed personnel fatalities were recorded.\u201d\n\nYet, the United States threatened that Nigeria risked arms embargo for alleged violations of the laws on armed conflicts in the fight against banditry, terrorism, and other forms of violence in different parts of the country.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with CNN International released by the US Department of State, the US Secretary of State, Antony J. Blinken, had threatened that his country could apply the Leahy Laws against Nigeria if the allegations of rights violations were found to be credible.\n\nWhile the US has demonstrated considerable commitment in partnering with Nigeria to contain terrorism, especially with the recent delivery of 12 A-29 Super Tucano fighter jets purchased by Nigeria and the training of military personnel, the comment by the US top official left security experts wondering the actual position of the US in the war against insurgency.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY yesterday, a former army spokesman, Brigadier-General S.K. Usman (rtd), advised the US government to withdraw the threat of imposing arms embargo on Nigeria.\n\nUsman said, \u201cI do not think that arms embargo is advisable. The US should rescind its threat to impose arms embargo on Nigeria. The Nigerian government should also review its relations with the US.\n\n\u201cCameroon, Niger, and Chad are steeped in human rights abuses, yet they have good relations with them. Nigeria has done a good job fighting insurgency for 12 years. Sometimes it looks as if there\u2019s something else behind all these issues about human rights violations. Nigerians who are providing all these information to US from which they reach such decisions should also have a rethink.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cPeople should know that once Nigeria as the most populous black nation is in trouble, the rest of Africa is in trouble. It is important that we solve our problems ourselves.\u201d\n\nA top military official, who pleaded to remain anonymous, also faulted the comments by Blinken, saying a lot is on-going between the two countries presently that should not have warranted an embargo threat from the US official.\n\nThe official stated, \u201cThere is a lot going on between US and Nigeria not to warrant such an embargo. We recently inducted 12 fighter aircraft; there are training programmes on-going.\n\n\u201cOur relationship with the US has improved greatly. A lot is going on presently. I am not saying nothing is happening but I don\u2019t see that (arms embargo) happening.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government recently commenced a subtle celebration of an impending victory over terrorists in the North-east, following the surrender of 17,000 fighters of Boko Haram and ISWAP.\n\nUnder the President Good luck Jonathan presidency, the US government led by then President Barrack Obama and other Western nations had denied Nigeria access to arms on the allegation of human rights abuses. That had led to resort to self-help and black market procurement of arms that turned out inferior to the arms wielded by terrorists.\n\nIn a recent interview with THISDAY, Defence Spokesman, Maj Gen Olufemi Sawyerr, said the Armed Forces of Nigeria were winning the war against insurgency and armed banditry.\n\nSawyerr said, \u201cWe are winning the war in the North-east and North-west and the terrorists are surrendering in large numbers.\n\n\u201cWhy is it that it is now that we are clearly winning the war that such report is coming up to drag us back? We are winning the war and thousands of them are surrendering with their families. What else are we saying?\u201d\n\nThe US Embassy in Abuja had, last week, following the submission of the panel report on last year\u2019s #EndSARS protests in Lagos State, urged the state and federal governments to take steps to address the allegations of abuses raised in the report.\n\nMeanwhile, Yahaya told officers and men of the security services engaged in the battle against insurgency to deal decisively with those causing problems for the country in order to restore peace to troubled areas of the country.\n\nThe army chief stated, \u201cWe should be more resolute and decisive when dealing with criminals.\u201d\n\nYahaya told soldiers on the frontlines not to be lenient with the insurgents because, \u201cit is like fighting a war.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen we engage the bandits it is just like in a war, We kill them and take their weapons, that is what we will continue to do.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged there were challenges, but said the bottlenecks had been identified and would be addressed.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI have gone round all the states in Nigeria to assess the security situation and now that I came here, I have been briefed by my officers on ground.\n\n\u201cI commend them for the job they are doing\u2026\n\n\u201cThe essence of the visit is to interact with the troops, to ginger them more to do better. The challenges across the nation have been unfolded and we are doing our best. In war like this, you can have surprises sometimes.\u201d\n\nYahaya said many people had acknowledged there was much improvement in the security situation across the country when \u201ccompared to the beginning\u201d. He assured that military would continue in that drive.\n\nYahaya promised that the army would collaborate with other security services, agencies, and stakeholders to ensure the fight was won. He urged relevant institutions and individuals to lend the security agencies a helping hand, particularly with respect to intelligence information.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThese criminal elements are living with us and if we all join hands together, we will eliminate them. Now we are making progress we have improved results. The others (other security agencies) are already collaborating with us in the area of information sharing.\u201d",

This was disclosed in a statement on Sunday.\n\nSave the Children stated, \u201cMr. Femi Otedola\u2019s addition to the Vice Presidents group is a testament to his long-standing support to the organisation. Since 2019, Mr. Femi Otedola has supported Save the Children\u2019s programmes on the prevention and treatment of malnutrition and on advocating for access to quality education for Nigerian children, impacting over 6,000 children in the states of Adamawa, Borno, and Katsina.\n\n\u201cIn November 2019, Mr Otedola hosted a Gala in Abuja where he made a personal donation of N5 billion.\u201d\n\nThe statement revealed that Save the Children had been working in Nigeria since 2001, and was currently present in 13 states of the country.\n\nSave the Children said, \u201cIt was one of the first organisations that responded to the humanitarian crisis in the North-east, reaching 1.2 million people since the start of our response.\n\n\u201cSince then, Save the Children is providing food assistance and protection services to more than 320,000 internally displaced children and families on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nIt pointed out that Otedola\u2019s global influence and rich experience of the African continent would advance Save the Children\u2019s efforts in building sustainable partnerships with stakeholders across Africa to create more impact for children on the continent.\n\nResponding to the appointment, Otedola said, \u201cI am elated to be associated with the organisation. We have to save our children from all manner of challenges and deprivations. And giving to the needy, particularly children, is the greatest love of all.\u201d\n\nSave the Children\u2019s Vice Presidents are a group of high-level supporters and critical friends of the organisation, actively involved in advancing the work of Save the Children, through advocacy, volunteerism, introductions, and philanthropy.\n\nSave the Children works in 120 countries around the world in both humanitarian and development settings.\n\nIt was established in the United Kingdom in 1919 to improve the lives of children through better education, health care, and economic opportunities, as well as providing emergency aid in natural disasters, war, and other conflicts.\n\nAfter a century, which it celebrated in 2019, it is now a global movement made up of 29 national member organisations, which work in 120 countries.\n\nThe organisation promotes policy changes to gain more rights for young people, especially by enforcing the UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child.\n\nIt assists children through coordinated emergency relief efforts, helping to protect children from the post effects of war and violence. It has a general consultative status in the United Nations Economic and Social Council.\n\nThe organisation works in partnership with philanthropists, governments, the United Nations, and other non-governmental organisation (NGOs) in pursuit of its global mandate to support children and their families in crisis and to ensure children are given opportunities to learn, survive and enjoy a protective environment so that they can reach their full potential in life\n\nPeter Uzoho",
