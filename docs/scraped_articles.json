Your expertise, foresight, and prudence have been very evident in the results of the good works that are spread across this nation,\u201d the LCCI deputy president added.\n\n\u201cYou are a pride of this nation, pride of Africa,\u201d the LCCI deputy president stated.\n\nCommending the VP\u2019s leadership of the ESP and other interventions that mitigated the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, Dr Cole said, \u201cwe are indebted to God for your dynamic strategy and dexterity in effectively managing the hydra-headed COVID-19 pandemic and the post-COVID Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cHaving known you for over 35 years as I said earlier, you are doing an exemplary work, your integrity remains untainted, and your impact and service to humanity transcends Nigeria to the continent of Africa and beyond.\u201d\n\nDr Cole then recalled a comment made about the VP\u2019s leadership qualities in 2018, noting that \u201cwhen we had a programme like this, the fellow that came from the US who later became our President was so impressed by the quality of the delivery by this our fine Vice President. He said that is a Vice President that any country should look for, and also a President that any country should look for.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further about Osinbajo\u2019s support for the President in the actualization of the administration\u2019s objectives, he noted that \u201cyour loyalty as the number two citizen of this great country, your very uncommon intelligence and sagacity in conjunction with that of Mr President, have made Nigeria to witness improvements in Agriculture, Education, Manufacturing, Healthcare, Energy and other sectors of the economy.\n\n\u201cWe know that people are clamouring for more (from this administration) but there is no doubt you have been a major contributor to the confidence level of this administration,\u201d the LCCI official said.\n\nOther speeches delivered at the Presidential Policy Dialogue were the Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the President of the LCCI Mrs. Toki Mabogunje, and Otunba Abimbola Ogunbanjo, Nigeria Exchange Group Chairman.

This is my reason for advocating for curriculum review,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nDr Abdul-Majeed Dahiru, the keynote speaker at the conference who is also a newspaper columnist and a public affairs analysts, urged the government to ensure that Nigerian education system is restructured to promote growth of the country.\n\nHe said that Nigerian education is no longer seen to push for development which the country is currently yearning for.\n\nHe called for more allocation of resources to the education sector to drive development, adding that there is the need to review the 6-3-3-4 system, adding that the system has failed the country.\n\nMr Agba Jalingo, a renowned journalist and activist, called on the government to eliminate the issue of bribing and sorting in the school system, which he said has lowered the standard of education.\n\nHe suggested ways of tackling this menace by first discouraging parents from giving bribes and encouraging their children to put in their best in whatever field they find their selves in school.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Milan and Sweden player talks about barging C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, the Premier League and the secret of his longevity\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy. Every day I wake up, I have pain everywhere,\u201d Zlatan Ibrahimovic says as he resists the inevitable end on a beautiful afternoon at Milanello. The mighty Swede grimaces before fixing me with his familiar stare of cocky intensity at Milan\u2019s famous old training ground. This is how much it takes to remain an elite footballer at the age of 40.\n\nIbrahimovic continues to inspire a young Milan squad and to play football at the highest level while sparking controversy and embracing the wonder of being Zlatan with amusing gusto. He knows we are all going to die, or retire, but here is the defiant Ibrahimovic mantra:\n\n\u201cThis morning I had pain everywhere but as long as I have objectives, as long as I have adrenaline, I keep going. I know I\u2019m coming to something good. I\u2019m coming to somewhere I need to work to keep myself at the top.\n\n\u201cI will keep doing it as long as I can. I don\u2019t want to have that regret if I stop and then, in a couple of years, I\u2019m sitting with you and saying: \u2018I could have continued because I was feeling good.\u2019 It\u2019s better to be totally finished and say: \u2018I cannot do it any more.\u2019 But I can still do it and I am doing it.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOn Saturday, away against Fiorentina, Ibrahimovic scored two and set up a third goal. But Milan remain a work in progress as they lost 4-3 and are second in the table behind Napoli on goal difference.\n\nHe returned to Milan for his second spell with the club in late December 2019. After a serious knee injury hastened his departure from Manchester United in 2018, he spent two years playing for LA Galaxy. Such a stint in the US usually marks a lucrative swansong for a feted European player. But Ibrahimovic is different and he came back to Milan with a new goal. He wanted to transform the youngest squad in Serie A and instil his formidable fight into players who revere him.\n\nHe continues to stoke his own fire and as he proved just over a week ago when barging into C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta during Sweden\u2019s final World Cup qualifying group match, Ibrahimovic still adheres fiercely to his beliefs. Before we reach this contentious point, the middle-aged maverick reiterates his worldview. \u201cIt\u2019s not about contracts or being famous. I don\u2019t need that. The only thing that keeps me going is the adrenaline because every morning I have pain everywhere. But getting two more followers will not heal you. Getting more money will not heal you. Getting attention will not heal you. What will heal you is adrenaline.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have problems suffering. For me, to suffer is like breakfast. But many people don\u2019t understand suffering because the new generation, with all these platforms, have to do little to get credit. The generation before that you had to do a lot to get a little. I\u2019m very proud I came from the old generation.\u201d\n\nIn their Champions League group with Liverpool, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Porto, Milan are struggling. But they have the youngest squad in Europe\u2019s premier competition. \u201cEven if I\u2019m there,\u201d Ibrahimovic says. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible. They make me look young. It has this effect, like Benjamin Button. After six months here you will have dark hair, trust me.\u201d\n\nIbrahimovic points to my white hair and laughs before becoming serious. \u201cI\u2019m very proud because I see these young players taking more responsibility, the mentality changing. That is my happiness now. That is my adrenaline. I go out and run as much as them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing it for 20 years. People think: \u2018No, Ibrahimovic, you need to stop.\u2019 My mentality says different. I do it because when the young players see me work they say: \u2018After all he has done he is still [working]. I have to do it because he has done everything.\u2019 It\u2019s a bit of \u2013 not manipulation \u2013 but showing them by example.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that dog that barks and does nothing. I\u2019m the opposite. When I was first here [from 2010 to 2012] we were superstars. Now it\u2019s full of talent, the youngest team in Europe, but we\u2019re on top. So it\u2019s a different project and it\u2019s more satisfying because if you succeed with superstars, it\u2019s expected. This is not expected.\u201d\n\nOne measure of Ibrahimovic\u2019s longevity is that he played against Paolo Maldini who was a giant in the Milan defence from 1984 to 2009, when he retired at 41. Maldini epitomised Milan\u2019s reputation for extending the careers of great players and it is striking that his 20-year-old son, Daniel, plays alongside Ibrahimovic. Are father and son similar?\n\nRead Also: Napoli to pay tribute to Diego Maradona\n\n\u201cOne is Mr Nice Guy. The other one, if he wants to kill you, he will kill you. I\u2019m happy they\u2019re not the same because it\u2019s not easy for the son to be compared with the father, especially when the father has the career he had. We are helping the son in every way. He\u2019s a big talent, but I tell him: \u2018Just play your game, fight, then you will lead the way yourself.\u2019 I\u2019m happy. I played against the father and today I\u2019m playing with the son. Maybe [Daniel] will have a son \u2026\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s an ambition, I say, to keep going until the next Maldini arrives at Milanello. The miracle of Zlatan will be complete. \u201cIt\u2019s already a miracle,\u201d Ibrahimovic says with a grin before he picks up my notebook. He studies my scrawled 48 questions that stretch across three pages. \u201cYou brought a whole book with you. My time is very expensive. But you take your work very serious and there\u2019s a lot to talk about.\u201d\n\nI ask Ibrahimovic if he is almost glad he came from a difficult past in Sweden, when he was \u201ca punk from Roseng\u00e5rd\u201d, an immigrant neighbourhood in Malm\u00f6, and the son of a Bosnian caretaker and a Croatian cleaner. \u201cI\u2019m not here to say I\u2019m cool because I came from the ghetto or that you should feel sorry for me because I came from there. You make the best of it and then it depends on you.\u201d\n\nIbrahimovic leans forward. He is in full flow now. \u201cLife is up and down. If everything was perfect, we have nothing to talk about. We still do mistakes. Nobody is perfect. On digital platforms you put out a picture with 20 filters and you look perfect. But when I see you in reality you\u2019re not perfect. You look normal like everybody else. People pretend they are perfect. I say: \u2018I am perfect when I\u2019m myself.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t mean I will not do mistakes. But I learn from them.\n\n\u201cThe other day in the national team, I gave a tackle to [Spain\u2019s Azpilicueta]. I did it on purpose. I\u2019m not ashamed to say it because he did something stupid to my player. Acting big to my player. It was a stupid thing but I would still do it to make him understand: \u2018You don\u2019t fucking do that. You don\u2019t have balls to do it against me. But I will show you what happens if you do it to me.\u2019 That\u2019s why I did it.\u201d\n\nSweden conceded the only goal of the game in the 86th minute and Ibrahimovic set about his lesson deep into added time. As a corner was taken he careered into Azpilicueta, hitting him with his shoulder as he sent the defender crashing to the ground. It looked brutal.\n\nDid Azpilicueta say anything after the game, which sealed Spain\u2019s World Cup qualification ahead of Sweden? \u201cWhat can he say? He will not say it to me but he will say it to my player \u2013 who will do nothing because he\u2019s too nice. It was not a good thing by me, but I would still do it. That\u2019s me. I\u2019m not ashamed to say it.\u201d\n\nHe was booked and Ibrahimovic will miss Sweden\u2019s first play-off match in March. \u201cIt\u2019s not about missing the play-offs. It\u2019s about making the guy understand you don\u2019t take the piss out of somebody laying [on the ground]. You don\u2019t attack a dog that doesn\u2019t talk. Attack the one able to do something. It\u2019s too easy to pick on my teammates who are 20 years old and very nice guys. I hope he understands now.\u201d\n\nTwo of Milan\u2019s charming media team, who sit in on our interview, take notes at speed. Ibrahimovic doesn\u2019t care. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to say it to you,\u201d he stresses, concentrating on our conversation. \u201cI did a stupid thing. [But] I will do it again. 100%.\u201d\n\nIs he being true to himself? \u201cExactly. That is what I say about being \u2018perfect\u2019. Being myself is perfect for me. I don\u2019t need filters to ask them what kind of questions you will give me.\u201d\n\nHis two seasons at Manchester United were partially successful and Ibrahimovic says: \u201cI had a great experience in England. Manchester United are an amazing club and we won a couple of trophies [the League Cup when he scored two goals in the final and the Europa League].\u201d\n\nConsidering the ongoing travails of United, who remain in thrall to the Ferguson years, Ibrahimovic says: \u201cThey talk too much about the past. When I went there I said: \u2018I\u2019m here to focus on the present and to make my own story.\u2019 But when you have too much it becomes like a loop. You have to think about the present or you should go to a hospital and clean your head.\u201d\n\nThe Premier League is an addictive soap-opera but did it seem overrated? \u201cThe quality is overrated in a technical way. But the Premier League has different qualities \u2013 the pace, the rhythm. You can be the best player in the world but if you cannot handle that pace and rhythm [you won\u2019t succeed].\n\n\u201cIn Spain, France, Italy, the technique is better. That\u2019s why there are so many foreigners in the Premier League. They bring the technical [aspect].\u201d\n\nI also interviewed Ibrahimovic on 6 October 2014 \u2013 his 33rd birthday. We met in Paris, as he played for PSG then, and his sons Max and Vincent had woken him by singing Happy Birthday. \u201cThey\u2019re 13 and 15 now,\u201d he says, almost wistfully. \u201cTime flies.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the first time Ibrahimovic has been separated from his family because he and his wife want their boys to be settled at school in Sweden. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy but my wife takes good care of the children. We make it work. When there is free time we see each other and we are all happy.\u201d\n\nIn March 2020, six weeks after returning to Milan, the whole of Lombardy was in the grip of Covid. Ibrahimovic remembers how the eerie silence was broken only by the ambulance sirens. He donated \u20ac100,000 to the fight against coronavirus and led campaigns to spread awareness and encourage the wearing of masks. But without his family and football how did he feel at the start of the pandemic? \u201cI was lonely. Things were very strict and you couldn\u2019t travel. It was strange because in those moments you stay with your close ones and I couldn\u2019t. But then they opened up a little and I travelled home and stayed with them for two months.\u201d\n\nThe virus remains and he still gets caught up in controversy. I have interviewed LeBron James twice before and I tell Ibrahimovic I was disappointed that he and the NBA giant have fallen out. They have much in common but Ibrahimovic chose to criticise James for making political statements. I believe James is America\u2019s most significant sportsman because of his readiness to call out racial injustice and brutality.\n\n\u201cSport unites people. Politics divide people,\u201d Ibrahimovic says. He listens carefully when I explain that I grew up in South Africa and the sports boycott against apartheid in the 1970s offered my first lessons in how racism deforms society. \u201cIf we talk about racism, it\u2019s something else. That\u2019s something I don\u2019t agree with. But I don\u2019t do politics. If I did, I would be a president now.\u201d",

          "title": "Travails of children infected by mothers living with HIV",
          "text": "UNICEF early this year put the number of children infected with HIV at a staggering 22,000 annually. Apart from living with the virus, many of the children also contract myriad of diseases that impact negatively on their day to day life, while in extreme cases, the virus claims their lives together with their parents\u2019. INNOCENT DURU.\n\n\u2022 How some, including parents, were killed by virus\n\n\u2022 Mother-to-child transmission spikes over expectant mothers\u2019 failure to go for screening\n\n\u2022 HIV-positive mothers reveal how they gave birth to HIV-negative babies\n\n\u2022 22,000 Nigerian children infected annually \u2013 UNICEF\n\nTobi in his infantile innocence had no faintest idea of the misery that awaited his life when his mother was delivered of him some years ago.\n\nThe family was ecstatic at his birth, rejoicing that they had been blessed with a bouncing baby boy. The innocent boy was not left out of the happiness that had pervaded the family as he smiled endlessly and kicked the air with his legs as his parents played with him.\n\nBut the joy that pervades the family turned out to be only momentary as the vicissitudes of life set in barely ten months after his birth. First, he became an orphan as his parents died from HIV complications.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cHe also tested positive and I have been the one taking care of him since then,\u201d the grandmother who was suffering from leg pains said in Yoruba.\n\nAnd as if the burden of living with HIV was not enough, life dealt another blow on the young boy as he was afflicted by epilepsy.\n\n\u201cHe also suffers from epilepsy and that requires a different medical attention. The drugs for epilepsy are not free and they are quite expensive. They cost about N7, 000 monthly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the cause of the epilepsy, but it also started from childhood.\u201d\n\nThen came the challenge of stigmatisation which has robbed him of his right to basic education.\n\nThe distraught old woman said: \u201cHe is no longer going to school because I can\u2019t afford to be taking him to school every day. I have a challenge with my legs.\n\n\u201cThere is also no special school close to us.\n\n\u201cI have tried putting him in a boarding school but they refused to admit him. Once the school authorities see the medications he is using, they would ask us to come and take him. About two schools have rejected him already.\n\n\u201cI am a petty trader. It is hard for me to eat not to talk of having enough money to take care of him.\u201d\n\nEmma is another child for whom the world would for long remain a sad place to be. His mother had tested positive to HIV around the period he was born without medical assistance to prevent her from transmitting the virus to him. He tested positive and was later on diagnosed with tuberculosis of the spine.\n\nHis distraught mother said: \u201cI tested positive on October 2, 2001 at St Mary\u2019s Catholic Hospital, Ibadan when I heard my first born (Emma).\n\n\u201cAt that point, my husband did not believe the report and wondered how I contracted it.\n\n\u201cIn January 2004, I lost my husband and I was carrying the pregnancy of our second child then.\u201d\n\nThe pains of losing the breadwinner of the family untimely was assuaged when Emma\u2019s mother gave birth to her second child who, unfortunately, also tested positive to HIV.\n\nShe said: \u201cI gave birth in February shortly after my husband died. The baby tested positive.\n\n\u201cBoth children became seriously sick after their father\u2019s death. Later, I lost my second child.\n\n\u201cIn September of that same year, they admitted my first child at the University Teaching Hospital, UCH. He had Tuberculosis of the spine.\n\n\u201cSince then, he hasn\u2019t walked again. I was carrying him to the hospital every blessed day. They bandaged his whole body and I will carry him to physiotherapists.\n\n\u201cHe spent about two to three months in the hospital at a time, and before we came back, my late husband\u2019s family had taken away everything in the house.\n\n\u201cDoctors had even lost hope in him but I kept expressing faith that he would be fine.\n\n\u201cTo the glory of God, he is fine now, but he has hunchback.\u201d\n\nIt has also been a life of misery and discomfort for Amara. According to her mother, she tested positive when she was four years old and has been living in denial because she could come to terms with having to live with the virus.\n\n\u201cI am going through a lot with her,\u201d the mother, who is also living with the virus, said despondently.\n\n\u201cShe was four years old when we tested her and found she was positive.\n\n\u201cAs she was growing up, I was telling her about HIV/AIDS but she was in denial of it.\n\n\u201cShe was at that denial stage. It was not until she started taking ARV (anti-retroviral) drugs that she realised what I was saying, and that was what brought her down. We have been battling with panic attacks up till now.\n\n\u201cIt has not been easy for me taking care of my child. Presently, she has to go for physiotherapy, and it requires money which I don\u2019t have.\n\n\u201cShe was only discharged from the hospital recently and the doctors advised that we should look for a psychologist that would be attending to her. \u201cWhat I learnt is that it would cost N30,000 a week to see a physiotherapist.\n\n\u201cIt has to be something that would be ongoing before she would be stable and come out of it.\n\n\u201cI earn N20,000 monthly and still have to take care of myself and the other children.\u201d\n\nHer pains were compounded by the scarcity of some of the drugs that are supposed to be taken to reduce the viral load.\n\n\u201cThey are telling us that the government cannot afford some of the drugs that we are taking. We have only a drug in circulation now, and that is BCG, and people are complaining that they have been coming down with one illness or the other since they started taking it. \u201cSome men are coming down with liver problems or diabetes as a result of the drugs\u201d\n\nThe words of the late Catholic nun, Mother Teresa, that there is nothing more calming in difficult moments than knowing there\u2019s someone is fighting with you, resonate in the condition of Ola.\n\nThe father, on whose shoulder he could have leaned on in his trying period abandoned him, compounding his pains and that of her mother.\n\n\u201cIn 2005, I got tested for HIV when I was pregnant and the result came out positive. I did surgery along the line and lost the twins that I was carrying in my womb.\n\n\u201cShortly after that, my husband abandoned me and my first child who is also positive,\u201d the mother said.\n\nOla, according to the mother, was also tested and found to be suffering from tuberculosis along the line.\n\n\u201cHe was admitted at the University Teaching Hospital, UCH, Ibadan at a time, and that was an additional burden for me.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how he contracted TB because I don\u2019t have it. I guess he got it from school. He has been treated and he is free from TB now.\u201d\n\nHow medical help saved other children from being infected\n\nMany innocent children who would have been infected and subjected to a life of misery have been saved by their mothers\u2019 decision to go for screening and adhere to treatment plans.\n\nBeatrice, who was infected through blood transfusion at the age of 11 and has been on treatment since 1999, recently gave birth to a set of twins who tested negative.\n\nShe said: \u201cI got married, took in and took pay in the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) in the hospital.\n\n\u201cThey have a mentor mother in the facility. I joined the mentor mother and followed all the instructions. I just gave birth to a set of twins and my babies were negative when the results came out.\u201d\n\nAfter joyfully delivering the babies, she said, she was seized by anxiety when nurses came to test her bundle of joy for the virus.\n\n\u201cI feared that the babies would test positive. At first I was scared because I thought that was what my children would also pass through.\n\n\u201cAnd that is where the role of mentor mother comes in, because the fear of having a positive child is always there. \u2018Oh, so my baby is going to die. Oh, they will have to take drugs for life\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe role of a mentor mother says no. They carried out a test called viral load test and found that I was undetectable and with my undetectable viral load I could give birth to a child who would come out negative.\n\n\u201cBut the fear had been there that I could give birth to a child who would test positive.\n\n\u201cAt a point, I felt reluctant until a follow up came assuring me that I would put to bed and all would be fine.\n\n\u201cEven at the point where I was undergoing the test, I missed the appointment two to three times because of the fear that the result might come out positive.\n\n\u201cBefore the result came out, I could not sleep. I was so worried. I kept calling to know what the result would look like. But at the end of the day, the result came out well.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the result, I started calling everybody to share the testimony.\u201d\n\nContrary to the fear that HIV-positive mothers cannot breastfeed to avoid transmitting the virus to their babies, she said: \u201cI breastfed. But before I did that, they placed me on some drugs.\n\n\u201cI was one of the first persons in Nigeria that ARV drugs were tried on, I think in 1999. We were placed on trial to know if the drug would work.\n\n\u201cI was told that it was through blood transfusion in the hospital where I was admitted that I was infected. I was between 10 and 11 years old at that time.\n\n\u201cIt was with my case that they said let us do something and bring the drugs to Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cBefore I got married, my husband already knew my status through my field.\n\n\u201cI told him that he would never be a barrier to my carrier. I told him that because I am positive you are not getting married to me, let me find my way and you find your way.\n\n\u201cHe said no he was going to support me, that he had watched my programme and all that.\n\n\u201cI gave him time to go and read and know about HIV, and see if it was something he could cope with as a man.\n\n\u201cHe came back and said he had been following me and my programme.\u201d\n\nLizzy, who is also living with HIV, shared the joy of her children who were born free of the virus.\n\nShe said: \u201cI knew my status in 2009. When I became pregnant, after the first trimester, I was placed on ARV. But as at that time, it was CRV, to protect the baby.\n\n\u201cWhen I gave birth, after six weeks, samples were taken from my baby.\n\n\u201cI gave my baby breast milk for six months. After six months, I started complementary feeding.\n\n\u201cAfter 18 months, another sample was taken from my baby. This time around, it was rapid testing and there was nothing like HIV in my child. My child is free.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t joke with my medication. I visit a health facility when I am not feeling fine, to know whether I have malaria or typhoid.\n\n\u201cMy husband knows that I am positive and he supports me and the baby.\n\n\u201cWhen they wanted to carry out the test on my baby, I had no anxiety because I was trained on how to handle my baby during anti-natal care. I knew my baby was going to be negative.\n\n\u201cSome of my friends didn\u2019t know they were positive before they gave birth. Some said it is not their portion, that their children would come out fine, and that no matter what you did to them, they would not take their medication. \u201c\n\nElated that her chdren are HIV negative, Imelda, a mother living with HIV, said: \u201cWhen I got pregnant in 2007, I went to the hospital where they carried out a test and found that I was positive. I was thereafter sent to meet a counselor. I was given some drugs which I kept taking.\n\n\u201cWhen it was time for me to give birth, I was asked to do so in the hospital for safety purpose. Immediately after, delivery drug was given to the baby for six weeks.\n\n\u201cAfter that, a test was conducted on the baby and it came out negative. Another test was conducted after sometime and it still came out negative.\n\n\u201cI have had three children after that and they are all negative.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t augur well at the initial stage between my husband and I when I told him of my status. But after some time of counselling and intervention, he calmed down.\n\n\u201cBoth of us started taking medication after then.\n\n\u201cGoing for test and detecting the virus early is a good thing that has come to be in the world.\n\n\u201cInitially, there was no awareness, and when one tested positive, it would look as if that was the end of the world.\u201d\n\nFresh danger looms\n\nIn spite of the gains that improvement in early detection and prevention has brought to managing HIV, people living with the virus are worried that the country is returning to the dark days, which could spell doom for the nation and the people.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing the challenges we were running away from back then coming back again. I pray that in the next two to three years we would not cry because we are really going out of drug stock and the children that we are hoping are coming out negative are about coming out HIV positive because of the attitude in the facility,\u201d Beatrice said.\n\nShe added: \u201cThe right people are not being placed at the facility. You will see somebody who does not know anything about HIV working in the field, and at the end of the day, they give out wrong information.\n\n\u201cThey use their words to stigmatise patients, so patients don\u2019t like coming back to the hospital, especially the pregnant women. They end up patronising the traditional birth attendants\n\n\u201cComing to this COVID 19, the pandemic is really affecting PMTCT programmes because by the time you are coming to register for ante- natal, the hospital will tell you they can\u2019t register you until you are seven month pregnant.\n\n\u201cWhat happens during this period that the expectant mothers are at home? What happens to their medication? What happens to the mentor mothers that are taking care of you?\n\n\u201cIf you watch the rate of HIV infection now, it is coming up higher than before. \u201cBefore, the virus was sleeping because everybody was taking medication and it was being suppressed. But now, the challenge is that people don\u2019t come to register for ante-natal because of COVID-19 and we are also experiencing drug stock out in some areas.\n\n\u201cNow the issues of user fees came back again and it is making people not to go and access their treatment, because before they will start picking up drugs, they will have to pay for consultation. \u201cSometimes the kids they are going with are positive and the mother is also positive. The mother will end up paying for herself and also paying for the child.\n\n\u201cSometimes you might see more than two to three doctors and you have to pay for consultation fee to see each of the doctors.\n\n\u201cIt is another challenge that is coming into being now and we don\u2019t know what to do in the next two to three years.\n\n\u201cThe phase of 2003, 2004 and 2005 is about coming back now because we are seeing drug stock out in so many areas.\n\n\u201cSometimes they misplace your treatment because they don\u2019t have your regimen in the hospital. They will tell some that the second line treatment is not available and they will end up giving you first line treatment because they cannot allow you go without drugs.\u201d\n\nPoor enlightenment campaign worsening menace\n\nA mentor mother to women living with HIV, Okubanjo Abiola, blamed the challenge of mother to child transmission which appears not to be abating to low level of awareness among the people and patronage of traditional birth attendants.\n\n\u201cMany public and private hospitals would insist on HIV screening before taking delivery of a baby, but many traditional birth attendants don\u2019t. There is an urgent need to educate them about this.\n\n\u201cAwareness should also be improved upon because in the rural community that I am at the moment, the people are not aware of it.\u201d\n\n22,000 Nigerian children infected with HIV annually\n\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, UNICEF, said about 22,000 Nigerian children get infected with HIV annually.\n\nUNICEF\u2019s Chief of Management for Results, Claes Johansson, who disclosed this at the national dialogue meeting for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, PMTCT, of HIV in Nigeria, regretted that about two-thirds of the infected children do not get treatment.\n\nHe described the meeting as a crucial one for Nigeria to discuss ways of eliminating vertical transmission of HIV, also known as mother-to-child transmission.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are working within a framework to map out a strategy that we will work with for the next five years along with Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEnding the vertical transmission of HIV/AIDS is one of the key actions that will also help end pandemics, which is what the global world is looking forward to.\n\n\u201cHowever, we have so much to do and a long way to go, especially with mother-to-child-transmission taking about 32 per cent and one out of seven being infected on a monthly basis is a Nigerian with about 22,000 infected yearly.\n\n\u201cThis is a situation that is simply not acceptable. And for all these children who get infected, about two-thirds of them do not get treatment.\n\n\u201cSo, we in the global community want the Nigerian government to tell us what their sustainable strategic plans are and what they need to eliminate vertical transmission.\n\n\u201cThe UN and its affiliated agencies and bodies are always willing to help Nigeria put an end to PMTCT.\n\n\u201cLet us know your priorities so that we can assist and help map out strong, sustainable ways to eliminating vertical transmission.\u201d\n\nA report by UNICEF in 2020 revealed that over 15 per cent of AIDS-related deaths in children and adolescents globally occur in Nigeria.\n\nIn his remarks, the Director-General of the National Agency for the Control of AIDS, NACA, Gambo Aliyu, emphasised the need for a better strategy to deal with PMTCT.\n\nHe explained that in 2016, there were about 13,000 infected pregnant mothers who were not getting treatment, which had risen to 421,000 as of 2019.\n\nNACA had early in the year decried what it described as the country\u2019s over-dependence on foreign funding for the campaign against HIV and AIDS.\n\nThe agency\u2019s Director General, Gambo Aliyu, who spoke at the launch of his agency\u2019s National Domestic Resource Mobilisation and Sustainability Strategy, noted that about $6.2 billion was spent to identify and treat 60 per cent of PLWHIV in Nigeria between 2005 and 2018.",

          "text": "From Gyang Bere, Jos\n\nA Plateau State High Court presided over by Justice Christy Dabup \\on Thursday refused to grant an application seeking to return the case file of former Governor of Plateau State, Jonah Jang to the State Chief Judge for onward reassignment to a new judge.\n\nJang is standing trial alongside Yusuf Pam, an ex-cashier in the Office of the Secretary to the Plateau State Government on an alleged N6.3bn fraud charges brought before the court by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The anti-graft agency first arraigned the duo before Justice Daniel Longji on 17 counts bordering on criminal breach of trust and misappropriation of public money in March 2015.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nHowever, after Justice Longji retired in December 2019 after hearing the matter for 34 times, the state Chief Judge, Justice Yakubu Dakwak reassigned the case to Justice Christie Dabup who started hearing on the matter afresh. Since the re-arraignment of the former governor, the court had not made any meaningful progress with the case due to stalled proceedings occasioned mostly by the absence of the prosecution until Thursday when the Lead Prosecution Counsel, Rotimi Jacobs (SAN) sought the order of the court for a new judge to take over the case. Moving the application for the reassignment of the case, the EFCC counsel told the court that the national lockdown occasioned by COVID-19 as well as the recent national strike by judiciary workers had prevented the case from being heard expeditiously . He also argued that given the fresh commencement of the case due to the retirement of the former judge handling the matter, there was the need to avoid wastage like in the first trial especially as the current trial judge might not be able to conclude the case before her own retirement. But counsel to Jang, Edward Pwajok (SAN) opposed the EFCC application, arguing that the anti-graft agency was only a party to the case and therefore could not determine how the court manages its affairs. Pwajok insisted that the court would be able to dispose the rest of the case in good time if the EFCC is serious with the prosecution.\n\nCounsel to the second defendant, SO Oyewale also opposed the EFCC application and urged the court to continue with the case or strike it out for lack of diligent prosecution. After listening to the argument by both parties, Justice Christie Dabup, in her ruling, said since there was no other court designated yet to handle such criminal matters, it would be absurd for her to recuse herself from the case. She therefore ordered the EFCC to go ahead with the presentation of more witnesses to enable the court make progress in the case.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "By Chukwudi Nweje, Vivian Onyebukwa, Oyinlola Pelumi Adewale (Lagos) Chijioke Agwu (Abakaliki); Timothy Olanrewaju (Maiduguri); Obinna Odogwu (Awka); Jude Chinedu, (Enugu); Sylvanus Viashima (Jalingo); Rose Ejembi (Makurdi); Tony John (Port Harcourt) and Oluseye Ojo (Ibadan).\n\nDon\u2019t ever try it! Don\u2019t even contemplate it! That\u2019s the message that Nigerians from all walks of life across the country are sending to the Federal Government on its proposed increase of fuel pump price from its present price to N340 per litre, as from next year. They include civil servants, the self-employed, unemployed, civil rights advocacy groups, lawmakers and political pressure groups, from Lagos to Lafia, Port Harcourt to Potiskum, Jalingo to Jamare, Maiduguri to Makurdi, Abakiliki to Abak and Ibadan to Bida.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nWhile expressing its view on the matter, Afenifere, the Pan-Yoruba group, through its National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, warned that the plan, if implemented, could plunge the country into social, economic and industrial crises whose outcome nobody can predict. Noting that the fuel subsidy has been a mantra used by the political elite to siphon state funds into private pockets in the past, he wondered why the Federal Government couldn\u2019t wait for the refineries to come on stream before removing the so-called petroleum subsidy.\n\nAuwal Musa Rafsanjani, Executive Director, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) said the proposed fuel price increase exposes the policy inconsistencies, somersaults, as well as lack of honesty and transparency on the part of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) Federal Government. The activist, who is also Chairman Transition Monitoring Group (TMG) picked holes in the proposed N5, 000 monthly palliative to 40 million Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIf you calculate the N5, 000 to be given to each of 40 million Nigerians, you will see that there is a huge inconsistency in it. If you replace fuel subsidy with N5, 000 to 40 million, it will give you N200 billion monthly and N2.4 trillion annually, which is higher than the N1.8 trillion the government claims is the fuel subsidy. So how can the government replace N1.8 trillion with N2.4 trillion if they are honest?.\u201d\n\nVice Chairman of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Ebonyi State Council, Mr. Benjamin Nworie, berated the Federal Government for being insensitive to the plight of poor Nigerians, and called on Nigerians to stand up and resist the hike when and if it is eventually implemented.\n\nFormer Deputy Chief Whip of the Anambra State House of Assembly, Nze Tony-Uche Ezekwelu, said that while he is in support of allowing the market forces to determine the prices of petroleum products, he is wondering how the Federal Government arrived at N340 per litre. His words: \u201cIf you calculate everything, including the gain, the petroleum production will sell at about N287 at the petrol station with between N16 and N25 gain per litre. So, how they arrived at N340, I don\u2019t really know. When the fuel pump price increased to N87 per litre, at the time of Goodluck Jonathan administration, the opposition party led by Tinubu and Buhari called the subsidy fund a fraud. They said that if they\u2019re voted into power, they would revert the fuel price to N45 per litre. To me, the issue of subsidy is a fraud. As far as I am concerned, there is actually little or no subsidy for fuel in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nCharles Okeke, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Tshabron, and MTN Connect warned that increasing fuel pump price to such astronomical height will see life coming to a halt for majority of Nigerians. \u201cI don\u2019t see how Nigeria will survive except the people that are in the corridors of power, like the governors who are all supporting this for whatever reason they think.\u201d He also pooh-poohed the idea of giving N5, 000 to 40 million Nigerians, calling it a political gimmick. \u201cIf they are going to implement it, it will be the worst policy that a government had ever made. Everything will just crumble,\u201d he said. Roseleen Folarin, a Reel Estate developer believes that doing so will be the height of wickedness and insensitivity any government can unleash on its already suffering people.\n\nYunusa Abdullahi, an office assistant, and Hajiya Halima Mohammed, a widow and a schoolteacher, both based in Maiduguri, Borno State, noted that increasing the prices of fuel will only increase the present economic suffering and hardship that almost everybody is passing through. Ejike Nnamani, Enugu-based commercial driver noted that it will be like pouring fuel on a burning fire, in a situation where everybody is crying over the increase in the prices of gas, foodstuffs and public electric power tariff. A civil servant and resident, Onyema Amujiri, asked: \u201cHow will salary earners like us cope? The N5000 they said they\u2019ll pay some people is just a joke taken too far. How are they going to achieve that and even if they do, what effect will it have? Will the money be enough to ameliorate the suffering of the people? How much is N5000? What can it buy in the market? What problem can it solve? As I am talking to you now, I\u2019m angry. That\u2019s why I always avoid talking about anything that has to do with this country. Our leaders are just too insensitive.\u201d\n\nBishop Nath Ofor, General Overseer, Jesus Campaigners Ministry sees the proposed sharing of N5, 000 as nonsensical. \u201cWhat can 5,000 do in a life of an individual?,\u201d he asked. Gabriel Yough, a civil servant, warned the government to expect possible backlash if they try it.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t push the people to the wall and expect them not to turn back and do something rash. We should learn from the palliative experience during the ENDSARS protest that Nigerians can be very angry and reactive.\u201d Sarah Danjuma, a trader and dealer in grains called on government to think of the worsening impact it is going to have on Nigerians in the face of increases in house rent, electricity tariff, school fees, charcoal, gas and food prices. \u201cIf you increase the fuel price, it means that every other item will double their price,\u201d she said. \u201cA bag of maize will end up selling for over N30, 000.\u201d\n\nChairman, Human Rights Defenders, Ebonyi State Chapter, Mr. Sampson Nweke described the move as harsh and oppressive, adding that doing that will amount to an overkill in the light of the increasing cost of food items and cooking gas. \u201cAny increment will be resisted because it\u2019s anti-people and unacceptable,\u201d he warned. \u201cThe Federal Government should not add to the anger of its mis-governance.\u201d\n\nMr. Livingstone Wechie, a prominent social crusader and public analyst and Solomon Lenu, spokesman for Civil Society Organisations in Rivers State, expressed similar view. Wechie believes that \u201cthe N5, 000 announced by the Federal Government comes as a huge distraction and too unrealistic to serve a palliative for Nigeria. Under what economic indices and data are they paying Nigerians? Lenu, in his view, sees it as an insult and vows to resist it. He declared: \u201cWe, members of the civil society will resist this injustice (fuel hike). We won\u2019t accept it.\u201d\n\nTagher Ushahemba, a driver and Tina Nyiyongo, a self-employed person believe that increasing the fuel price to N340 per litre will turn their worlds upside down.\n\nWhile Ushahemba insists that it is not \u201ceven an option that should be considered at all by any responsible government,\u201d Nyiyongo fears that \u201cprices of other commodities including foodstuffs will also increase.\u201d Dr Ahmed Sanusi, a retired lecturer, from Bauchi State University, warned with a voice laden with anger: \u201cwe are about to enter an unbearable situation where you will need four or five other sources of income to survive. May God help us.\u201d Kevin Umeh, a lawyer, foresees a situation where, from next year onward, living will no longer be a matter of survival but survival of the fittest. Ayomide Mayowa, an Uber driver who has been in the business for about three years said although there had been increases in the prices of fuel in the past, this one, N340 per litre, will be the mother of them all. \u201cWhat are we Uber drivers meant to do? How do we survive after each ride?,\u201d he asked before adding: \u201cPeople will soon toss Uber aside and start jumping into buses because they might not be able to afford our fares again.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze and George Onyejiuwa, Owerri\n\nThere was a harvest of tributes in celebration of Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu at the 10th edition of the memorial of the late Igbo hero, in Owerri, Imo State, yesterday.\n\nThe event took place at the expansive grounds of the Ojukwu Memorial Library built by the leader of BIM-MASSOB, Chief Ralph Uwazuruike.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nThis is as Ojukwu\u2019s wife, Bianca, declared at the event that the clamour for secession, which according to her, had reached fever pitch in the country today, was a direct consequence of the inequities of the Nigerian state as presently constituted.\n\nShe maintained that the Igbo have continued to feel the pains of marginalization and exclusion on a daily basis, adding that for as long as this was not addressed, and in so far as the Federal Government continued to exclude the South East from certain political positions and critical development projects such as the National Railway plan, and the zone continued to suffer the ravages of the deteriorating conditions of existing federal infrastructure, most especially roads, the feelings of collective victimization can only be reinforced and will continue to sustain the agitations for a separate state.\n\nThe former Nigerian Ambassador to Spain decried the continued detention of leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, and called on the Federal Government to consider the pleas for his release.\n\nThanking the Igbo leaders who visited President Muhammadu Buhari recently in pursuance of this objective, she appealed to the president to consider the calibre and age of these Igbo statesmen and grant their request in order to demonstrate a genuine commitment to healing the wounds of the past.\n\nShe regretted that the Igbo have been continually denied equal sense of belonging and legitimate citizenship rights in Nigeria. She, however, noted that no sacrifice was too much to promote and sustain a peaceful coexistence of all the ethnic nationalities in the country.\n\nDeputy governor of Anambra State, Dr Nkem Okeke, who was special guest at the event, said for the Igbo to get what they want as a people, they must act with unity of purpose.\n\nHe said that the Igbo as a great nation must begin to speak with one voice if they must achieve their aspirations in an ethnic country like Nigeria as according to him, without unity they will continue to lose their rightful place in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNdigbo are a great people, but they are divided and I am saying this because we need unity and without it, we cannot achieve anything. But with unity, we can achieve whatever we set our minds on. We must stand together and if we don\u2019t do that, we will never get our rights or political aims. So, we must unite and stand together for our rights,\u201d Okeke said.\n\nThe deputy governor added: \u201cOjukwu, while alive, stood for the unity of Ndigbo and was a man of integrity and we are here today to honour his memorial. And the only way Ndigbo can continue to honour the memory of this great man who sacrificed his personal wealth and comfort for the cause of Ndigbo is to be united and continue to speak with one voice.\u201d\n\nHe also lauded the leader of BIM-MASSOB, Uwazuruike for organising the annual Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu Day in memory of the late Igbo sage.\n\nIn his remarks, son of the late Biafra leader, Afamefuna Ojukwu, a young United States-trained engineer, also thanked Uwazuruike for consistently hosting the event every year since the demise of his father.\n\nThe event was a cultural festival, featuring a brief interdenominational service, traditional dances and masquerade display, colourful parades, drama sketches and a live band eulogizing in music, the exploits of the Biafra hero.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "CBN to Set up International Financial Centre in Eko Atlantic City by Q2 2022",
          "text": "James Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Friday said it would establish an International Financial Centre (IFC) at the Eko Atlantic City by the second quarter of 2022.\n\nThe apex bank said the centre would among other things serve investors seeking to invest in critical sectors of the economy.\n\nCBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, announced this at the 56th Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) Annual Bankers Dinner in Lagos.\n\nHe also said stressed that the proposed centre would serve as a gateway for funds and investments into the country adding that it will be driven by technology and payment system infrastructure.\n\nHe identified lack of access to large pools of cheap investment capital as a key constraint to supporting growth in critical sectors of the Nigerian economy, pointing out that the IFC will seek to address this challenge.\n\nEmefiele, in his address to the August gathering said, \u201cToday over $100 trillion is held by institutional investors in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, most of it invested in low-yielding assets relative to high-yielding opportunities in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWorking to tap into this pool of funds will require the set-up of an investment framework that offers comfort and security to investors seeking to invest in critical sectors of our economy.\u201d\n\nHe said,\u201cIn this regard, the Central Bank of Nigeria is working to set up an International Financial Center at the Eko Atlantic City in Lagos that will serve as a hub for attracting domestic and external capital which is needed to strengthen our post-COVID economy.\n\n\u201cThe International Finance Center, when fully operational in the 2nd quarter of 2022, will help to position Nigeria as a key destination for investment in Africa.\u2019\u2019\n\nEmefiele had in September hinted that the Nigerian International Financial Centre (NIFC) which will act as an international gateway for capital and investments, driven by technology and payment system infrastructure, would be established within the next 12 months.\n\nThe said NIFC, which he termed the new financial hub, would consolidate on the growth and resilience of Nigerian banks and will curate local and international banks to make them global champions.\n\nHe further explained that the NIFC will be a 24/7 financial centre that will complement London, New York and Singapore financial centers and enable an acceleration of home grown initiatives including the Infracorp plc.\n\nHe added that the NIFC will also complement initiatives on the Nigerian Commodity Exchange and the National Theatre creative hubs for youths as well as the e-naira project which also debuted in October.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, the NIFC will take advantage of existing laws particularly the BOFIA 2020, Nigerian Export Processing Zone Authority (NEPZA) and other CBN regulations to create a fully global investment and financial hub where monies, ideas, and technology will move freely without hindrance.\n\nEmefiele also said that about $500 million had been invested in indigenous payment systems companies between 2015 and 2020 adding that the platform had continued to evolve towards meeting the needs of households and businesses in the country.\n\nNevertheless, the apex bank boss said despite the various progress recorded in the banking and financial sector, about 36 per cent of the adult population currently lacked access to financial services in the country.\n\nHe said that improving access to finance for individuals and businesses through digital channels could help to improve financial inclusion, lower the cost of transactions, and increase the flow of credit to businesses.\n\nMeanwhile, on the CBN\u2019s policy focus for 2022, Emefiele said the continued implementation of intervention efforts by the bank would sustain the recovery efforts and stimulate further growth of the economy.\n\nHe noted that notwithstanding the positive indicators so far recorded as the economy recovers from the impact of COVID-19, growth had remained fragile, as unemployment and inflation rate remained at levels that were not supportive of growth.\n\nHe said given population growth at about 2.7 per cent annually, it is important to continue to deploy measures that will enable the economy to attain annual growth rates of over 5 per cent.\n\nThe CBN governor said,\u201dThrough the pandemic we are aware that our policy responses are often more effective when we work with the private sector.\n\n\u201cFor example, the CACOVID alliance played an instrumental role in reducing the negative effects of the pandemic, by providing palliative support to families affected by the virus and in rebuilding our healthcare institutions.\u201d\n\nHe said leveraging the strength of the private sector will be critical in mobilising funds that are needed toward building a more resilient and stronger economy.\n\nHe said the apex bank would strengthen collaborations with the private sector in order to support investments in critical sectors such as infrastructure, and ICT, in addition to ongoing efforts to build a stronger agriculture and manufacturing base in the country.\n\nEmefiele said:\u201dAs a result, all efforts in 2022 must be made to ensure that we maintain our focus on improving access to finance and credit for households and businesses, mobilizing investment to boost domestic productivity, enabling faster growth of non-oil exports, and supporting employment generating activities.\u201d\n\nHe said that in an effort to implement policies that would engender growth and employment, the CBN recently unveiled the 100 for 100 policy on production and productivity.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cEligible firms must show evidence of their efforts to harness available local raw materials towards the realization of their intended investment.\n\n\u201cEfforts will also be made to support firms that are geared towards producing goods for the export market. The Central Bank of Nigeria is committed to supporting eligible firms with foreign exchange to import machineries and equipment.\n\n\u201d Let me add that routine audits will be conducted on firms that receive funding, to ensure that they are complying with the terms of the program. We believe this programme will significantly help to catalyze growth in critical sectors of our economy, while aiding our efforts to create employment opportunities and reduce our dependence on imported goods.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Malami: Judgement will embolden Nigerian government to crush bandits\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nA Federal High Court in Abuja under trial Justice Taiwo Taiwo has ruled that activities of bandits, as well as other similar groups, by whatever names they are called, in any part of the country, amounted to acts of terrorism and subsequently declared them terrorists.\n\nJustice Taiwo further held that the federal government must publish the order in the official Gazette and two national dailies in the country.\n\nReacting to the ruling, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami said it would now embolden the federal government to go all out to crush all forms of banditry in the country.\n\nThe order declaring bandits terrorists was sequel to an application filed on behalf of the federal government by the Director of Public Prosecution, Federal Ministry of Justice, Mohammed Abubakar, regarding the activities of Yan Bindiga, Yan Ta\u2019adda and other groups of bandits in the country.\n\nIn the exparte application, the federal government had prayed the court to outlaw the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups, as well as other terrorist groups in the country.\n\nThe request, according to the federal government in a supporting affidavit, was to checkmate the activities of the group, which the government claimed were responsible for killings, abductions, rapes, kidnappings, and other criminal acts in the North-east, North-central, and other parts of the country.\n\nThe federal government blamed the groups for \u201cbanditry, incessant kidnappings for ransom, kidnapping for marriage, mass abductions of school children and other citizens, cattle rustling, enslavement, imprisonment, severe deprivation of physical liberty, torture, rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, and other forms of sexual violence, attacks and killings in communities and commuters, and wanton destruction of lives and proper property.\u201d\n\nIt went on to say that the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups, as well as other similar groups, were responsible for the deaths of soldiers, police officers, and other security agents across the country.\n\nCommercial, educational, and farming activities in the North-west and North-central have been disrupted as a result of the groups\u2019 activities, the federal government said.\n\n\u201cThe activities of the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups, as well as other similar groups, constitute acts of terrorism that can lead to a breakdown of public order and safety, as well as a threat to Nigeria\u2019s national security and corporate existence,\u201d the FG said in the supporting affidavit.\n\nThe DPP said President Muhammadu Buhari gave approval for his action, which objective is the proscription of Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups and other terrorist groups in the country.\n\nThe Ruling\n\nSpecifically, the court declared the activities of the \u201cYan Bindiga Group\u201d and the \u201cYan Ta\u2019adda Group,\u201d as well as other similar groups, in any part of the country, particularly in the North-west and North-central geopolitical zones, to be \u201cacts of terrorism and illegality.\u201d\n\nThe judge ruled that \u201csimilar groups, either in groups or as individuals by whatever names they are called, in any part of Nigeria, particularly in the North-west and North-central geopolitical zones\u201d are terrorists and banned.\u201d\n\nJustice Taiwo said in the light of the nefarious activities of bandits and their effects on the people and the nation\u2019s economy, he was convinced that such orders were required.\n\nHe extended the proscription order to all other groups in the country, regardless of their names, whose activities and goals are similar to those of the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups.\n\nAccording to the ruling, terror activities \u201cinclude, but not limited to banditry, kidnappings for ransom, kidnapping for marriage, mass abductions of school children and other citizens, cattle rustling, enslavement, imprisonment, severe deprivation of physical liberty, torture, rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, other forms of sexual violence, attacks and killings in communities and commuters and wanton destruction of lives and properties in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe judge held further that the federal government must publish the prosecution order in the official Gazette and two national dailies in the country.\n\nFG Welcomes Ruling\n\nThe federal government has welcomed the declaration of Justice Taiwo and said it would go ahead to gazette the proscription order in line with the ruling of the court.\n\nReacting to the ruling, Malami said it would now embolden the federal government to go all out to crush all forms of banditry in the country.\n\nMalami said the declaration \u201cis a demonstration of this administration\u2019s determination to do things in accordance with the rule of law.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cThe development is a pointer to the commitment of the federal government to adhere to the international standards in respecting the rules of engagement in the fight against terrorism, separatist organisations, insurgency and banditry in the country.\u201d\n\nHe said by this declaration, the Federal Government of Nigeria has taken a bold step to deal ruthlessly with all terrorists groups and their sponsors in efforts to bring lasting solution to the myriad of security challenges in the country.\n\n\u201cThe office of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice in collaboration with relevant government agencies, including security operatives are working assiduously to do the needful to take full advantage of this declaration.\n\n\u201cThe government will gazette, publish the proscription order,\u201d Malami said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

They also set their houses on fire.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have just counted the bodies of 10 persons who were shot dead by the attackers. They are being taken to the mortuary. Our people are still searching for more victims. We will let you know when we are done with the search and rescue operation.\u201d\n\nAlso lamenting, the Secretary of Irigwe Development Association (IDA), Mr. Danjuma Auta said, \u201cJust last week, we read on social media the threat chats sent by Fulani herders to the military stationed at Ancha, a neighbouring community, asking them to allow free grazing in and around all communities in Irigwe land or be made to face their wrath.\n\n\u201cAlthough the military dismissed the threat, Fulani have carried out their plans as they attacked Ancha village on Tuesday, 23th November, 2021 and killed two persons.\n\n\u201cAgain, these same Fulani herders attacked the village of Ta\u2019agbe and, as of now, we have already confirmed the death of 11 people, while the search is still ongoing. We are worried because times without number, we have met at different fora with the Fulani community that we know and have promised to embrace peace, but with the renewed attacks on our innocent citizens we wonder if the peace accord entered is anything to hold to.\n\n\u201cIf those who\u2019re saddled with the constitutional responsibility of protecting us feel overwhelmed and can no longer guarantee our safety, they should come out publicly and tell Nigerians. Our people are beginning to lose confidence in any security agent since their presence could not stop, arrest, or neutralise the attackers.\u201d\n\nLalong Mourns\n\nMeanwhile, Lalong said the attack yesterday remained condemnable and unacceptable to the government.\n\nIn a statement by his Director of Press and Public Affairs, Macham Makut, the governor described the attack as \u201canother sad incident which is clearly the handiwork of criminals that are bent on instilling fear, pain and sorrow among the people with a view to destabilising the state and making fortune from their criminality, as well as rupturing the substantial peace attained.\u201d\n\nThe statement partly read, \u201cThe Governor totally condemns the attack and says there is no explanation that can justify it. He therefore directs security agencies to take immediate and drastic steps to apprehend the perpetrators and ensure that they pay for their crimes.\n\nIt further quoted the Governor as saying \u201cThe persistent attacks in this general area remain condemnable and unacceptable to Government. As such, no resources and efforts will be spared in painstakingly following up on the trail of those who derive joy in attacking and killing innocent citizens and destroying their homes and means of livelihoods.\n\n\u201cI expect the security agencies to deploy everything at their disposal to arrest those who carried out the crime no matter how long it takes. Government will not take any excuse for failure to achieve this directive.\u201d\n\nLalong while commiserating with the victims and families of those killed, assured that they would get justice as Government will stop at nothing to unravel those behind this ugly incidences that continue to disrupt the livelihoods of the people of the local government.\n\nLalong also directed the Plateau State Emergency Management Agency and the Peace Building Agency to immediately visit the area and assess the level of damage with a view to carrying out immediate intervention and bringing succour to people who are in need as a result of the barbaric attack.\n\nHe also called on the people to assist the security agencies with relevant information that would enable them crack the identity of the attackers and know their motives.\n\nPlateau State Police Confirm Killings\n\nThe Plateau State Police Command has confirmed the attack at Te\u2019egbe Community.\n\nIn a statement issued by its Spokesman, Ubah Ogaba, the Police Command said, \u201cOn 26/11/2021 at about 0130hrs, the Command received a report of an attack by yet to be identified gunmen at Te\u2019egbe Village of Bassa LGA of the state.\n\n\u201cUpon receipt of the report, the Commissioner of Police, Plateau State Command, Bartholomew Onyeka, immediately drafted a tactical team of the Command to the scene to avert further attack.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police further led other Senior Officers of the Command to the scene for an on-the-spot assessment and to console the victims of the attack.\n\n\u201cThe CP has directed that discreet investigation be carried out and assured the community of his readiness to fish out the perpetrators of this barbaric act.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, indigenous natives of the attacked community, the Irigwe ethnic nationality, have expressed disappointment with the security agents who they accused of failing to protect the people despite having prior knowledge of the attack.\n\nThe statement further pleaded with the President Muhammadu Buhari to come to their rescue before it is too late, adding that security operatives \u201cmust be made to quickly investigate Fulani settlements fingered to be hosting and training these attackers.\u201d\n\nTerrorists Demand N99m Ransom for Release of 66 Abducted Baptist Church Members\n\nAbductors of 66 members of Baptist Church, Kakau Daji, Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State are demanding N99 million ransom for their release.\n\nThe Vice Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the 19 Northern States and Abuja, Rev. John Hayab, disclosed this yesterday in an interview with journalists in Kaduna.\n\nThis is the first time the abductors will be making contact with the families of victims, 27 days after the abduction.\n\nThe worshipers were abducted on October 31, 2021, when the terrorists invaded the church during Sunday service.\n\nThe terrorists were said to have taken five of the victims close to the community and shot three dead while two others had gunshots wounds and were taken to the hospital.\n\nHayab also said one of the remaining four students of Bethel Baptist High School, Damishi, Kaduna, who were abducted on July 5, 2021, had been released, while three were still being held by the bandits.\n\nHe said N5 million was paid to the terrorists for the release of the student. The bandits had on July 5, invaded the school and abducted 121 students. A total of 117 of the students were later released while others escaped.\n\nSources said over N200 million was paid to the bandits for the freedom of the students who were released in four batches.

          "text": "*Celebrates Presidential Library\u2019s 2MW solar power project\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo yesterday demanded that Nigeria must commit to generating power from renewable energy and clean carbon-free sources, in order to build a future for the country.\n\nHe stated this during the inauguration of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library\u2019s 2MW solar power project in Abeokuta, Ogun State.\n\nObasanjo said renewable energy \u201cis cheaper and good for the environment.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cToday, I am speaking to you in a facility powered by the sun \u2013 solar energy. It is the way of a future (Jimmy) Carter envisioned all those years ago. It will help build the future we want. The Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library solar power project is a reflection of our commitment to clean and renewable energy and is the single largest investment this not-for-profit organisation has made.\n\n\u201cAs large an investment as it is, it is remarkably cost effective. It costs less than two and half years supply of diesel to power our generators. So, in diesel terms, it pays for itself in less than three years. So in effect, the electricity it produces after three years is almost at no cost.\n\n\u201cIn addition, because it is not emitting any greenhouse gases that diesel generators do, it has the potential to earn carbon credits which are currently priced at US$40/ton.\n\n\u201cBased on estimated annual production of 2,307,000 kilo Watt hours per year, we can expect to earn nearly US$39,589 in carbon credits per year.\n\n\u201cBy monetising this facility with strategic sponsorships and marketing alliances, we will be able to generate revenue.\n\n\u201cCombined, this solar facility can generate electricity, generate revenues that contribute to the upkeep of the library, help save the planet making a small contribution to climate mitigation and adaptation, provide shade for parking, and be an inspiration for future generations. Who says you can\u2019t make a profit out of saving the planet?\u201d\n\nObasanjo, 84, said he \u201cis a responsible steward for nature,\u201d adding, \u201cthe facility marks one of the enduring personal legacies I am proud to call my own.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the former president said, \u201cThe recently concluded UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) was attended by over 1,000 universities from 68 countries, who witnessed powerful speeches and renewed commitments to reach Net Zero emissions by 2050, in some cases 2060 and in Nigeria\u2019s case 2070.\n\n\u201cThis is the best time for all Nigerian universities to sign-up to the United Nations\u2019 Race to Zero campaign, and commit to reducing their carbon emissions to zero by 2050 at the latest.\n\n\u201cWe hope that by committing to consume renewable energy we inspire others to follow and still inform others to do their bit for the environment. Our great nation also needs to commit to producing our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon-free sources. This goal is achievable, affordable and transformative. It represents a challenge to all Nigerians \u2013 in every walk of life, to our political leaders, entrepreneurs, innovators, engineers, and to every citizen.\n\n\u201cThis is a generational moment. I\u2019m asking each of you to join me and build this future. Our success depends on our willingness as a people to undertake this journey. We have a duty of care for the planet and for every person upon it. We must fulfill it by making our energy system clean, efficient, affordable and sustainable.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Most of the findings by the Judicial Panel of Inquiry set up by the Lagos State Government to investigate police brutality and also the shooting of unarmed protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020 by personnel of the Nigerian Army and policemen, have been validated by a new report.\n\nThe 12-page document containing testimonies of victims and witnesses including detailed analysis of the events surrounding the massacre by experts in various fields, was carried out and released by Olukayode Dada, a partner with Udo Udoma & Belo-Osagie law firm based in Lagos.\n\nFile Photo\n\nDada, who is an expert in dispute resolution, compliance and investigations, in the report stated that the Lagos State Government, Federal Government and military authorities all knew of the brutal killing of young Nigerians at the Lekki Toll Gate ahead of the incident.\n\nAccording to the report, the activities of soldiers deployed to the scene of the peaceful demonstration and later policemen from the Maroko Division on the night of October 20, 2020, sufficiently qualified as crimes against humanity and therefore should be investigated by the International Criminal Court in light of the Nigerian Government's unwillingness to act on the findings and recommendations of the Lagos Judicial Panel of Inquiry.\n\nThe report stated that though a Nigerian court can try soldiers indicted in the panel's finding, the military authorities in the country are unlikely to offer the type of cooperation needed for such to take place.\n\nAt least nine persons were confirmed to have been killed by security agents deployed to the scene while several others were left with life-threatening injuries, according to the panel's findings.\n\nSaharaReporters had exclusively reported how soldiers moved several bodies away from the scene of the massacre in their vans to a hospital in Lagos in order to conceal the killings.\n\nSoldiers deployed for the mission told relatives of victims that they were sent by the Lagos State governor to violently quell the protest.\n\nThe document released by Dada partly read, \"While there had been killings and harassment of #EndSARS protesters demonstrating police brutality and bad governance by Nigerian security forces across the country prior to the toll gate killings, the Lekki Toll Gate attacks/killings stood out because of the brazenness of the killings and bravery of protesters (including DJ Switch, a popular Nigerian disc jockey) who risked their lives to provide live feeds of the attacks.\n\n\"Without question, the killings and brutalisation of unarmed protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate constitute crimes against humanity. The totality of the circumstances regarding the #EndSARS protests, and the toll gate killings/attacks validate this conclusion.\n\n\"Government actions to stop the protests culminated in the attacks on unarmed protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate, a location where the protests had been peaceful since the commencement of the nationwide protests.\n\n\"It is unlikely that the Nigerian Government (whose officers and agents are the accused in this matter) would refer those officers and agents to the ICC.\n\n\"The Lekki Toll Gate killings is not also the subject of any deliberations before the UN Security Council. The ICC Prosecutor, is therefore, entitled to initiate an investigation into the killings proprio motu. There are sufficient grounds for the Prosecutor to initiate a proprio motu investigation in respect of the Lekki Toll Gate killings. The ICC has both subject matter and personal jurisdiction in this matter.\n\n\"The investigation, prosecution and trial of crimes against humanity fall within the jurisdictional purview of the ICC, and the accused persons are natural persons. The scale, nature, manner and impact of the crimes are of such severity that an investigation by the ICC is warranted.\n\n\"Based on the totality of the circumstances, it is in the interests of justice for this matter to proceed at the ICC.\n\n\"Despite ample evidence, the Federal Government of Nigeria has not initiated any formal investigation or prosecution of the soldiers and policemen involved in the killings at the Lekki Toll Gate.\n\n\"While the Lagos State Government set up the JPI to investigate the killings, the Lagos State Government does not control the Nigeria Army and the Nigeria Police. The Lagos State Government cannot, therefore, impose and enforce sanctions against the erring soldiers and policemen.\n\n\"Although under Nigerian law, civil courts (e.g., the High Court) may try criminal law offences committed by a serving member of the military, in reality, the likelihood that a serving member of the military would be tried in a civil court depends largely (if not, solely) on the cooperation of military authorities.\n\n\"It appears that the military authorities and the Federal Government of Nigeria have little or no interest conducting any meaningful investigation in this matter and/or achieving justice for the victims of the killings.\n\n\"Crimes against humanity occurred at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020. Reports of several investigations including the investigations conducted by CNN, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Judicial Panel of Inquiry set up the Lagos State Government to investigate the incident, as well as eyewitness accounts and ample photographic and video evidence clearly establish that soldiers and policemen engaged in coordinated, systematic and premeditated attacks against unarmed civil population, which led to deaths and injuries.\n\n\"Despite the evidence, the Federal Government of Nigeria has failed to initiate any meaningful investigation of the incident, but has instead engaged in efforts to discredit the reports issued by the organisations, while not offering any evidence in rebuttal of the facts set out in those reports.\n\nThe Killings of Unarmed Endsars Protesters at Lekki Toll Gate Were They Crimes Against Humanity by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\n\"It is evident that the Federal Government of Nigeria is unwilling to investigate, and/or achieve justice for the victims of the attacks/killings.\n\n\"Nigeria is a party to the Rome Statute, and all the conditions for the ICC to assume jurisdiction in this matter, and to, in the least, conduct a preliminary examination and a formal investigation are present.\n\n\"Unless the international community brings pressure to bear on the Federal Government of Nigeria, it is unlikely that there will ever be accountability for the persons who attacked and killed unarmed protesters at the Toll Gate, and for the persons who gave the orders for the attacks.\"\n\nThe Nigerian Government and officials of Lagos Government have been working tirelessly to discredit the findings of the panel that investigated the massacre of unarmed protesters at Lekki last year since the report surfaced.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, described the report as \"fake and full of errors\" earlier in the week while a member of the panel, Ebun Olu-Adegboruwa, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, has alleged threat to his life by agents of Lagos State Government.\n\nEarlier this week, Miss Kamsiyochukwu Ibe, who took active part in the nationwide protest last year, was attacked for testifying before the #EndSARS judicial panel in Lagos State.\n\nOther persons in support of the panel report and calling for the prosecution of perpetrators have also alleged threat to their lives.\n\nThe United States, United Nations, European Union, Amnesty International and several other groups around the world have all called for persons indicted by the panel report to be punished for their role in the killing of peaceful demonstrators at Lekki in October 2020.",

The totality of the circumstances regarding the #EndSARS protests, and the toll gate killings/attacks validate this conclusion.\n\n\"Government actions to stop the protests culminated in the attacks on unarmed protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate, a location where the protests had been peaceful since the commencement of the nationwide protests.\n\n\"It is unlikely that the Nigerian Government (whose officers and agents are the accused in this matter) would refer those officers and agents to the ICC.\n\n\"The Lekki Toll Gate killings is not also the subject of any deliberations before the UN Security Council. The ICC Prosecutor, is therefore, entitled to initiate an investigation into the killings proprio motu. There are sufficient grounds for the Prosecutor to initiate a proprio motu investigation in respect of the Lekki Toll Gate killings. The ICC has both subject matter and personal jurisdiction in this matter.\n\n\"The investigation, prosecution and trial of crimes against humanity fall within the jurisdictional purview of the ICC, and the accused persons are natural persons. The scale, nature, manner and impact of the crimes are of such severity that an investigation by the ICC is warranted.\n\n\"Based on the totality of the circumstances, it is in the interests of justice for this matter to proceed at the ICC.\n\n\"Despite ample evidence, the Federal Government of Nigeria has not initiated any formal investigation or prosecution of the soldiers and policemen involved in the killings at the Lekki Toll Gate.\n\n\"While the Lagos State Government set up the JPI to investigate the killings, the Lagos State Government does not control the Nigeria Army and the Nigeria Police. The Lagos State Government cannot, therefore, impose and enforce sanctions against the erring soldiers and policemen.\n\n\"Although under Nigerian law, civil courts (e.g., the High Court) may try criminal law offences committed by a serving member of the military, in reality, the likelihood that a serving member of the military would be tried in a civil court depends largely (if not, solely) on the cooperation of military authorities.\n\n\"It appears that the military authorities and the Federal Government of Nigeria have little or no interest conducting any meaningful investigation in this matter and/or achieving justice for the victims of the killings.\n\n\"Crimes against humanity occurred at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020. Reports of several investigations including the investigations conducted by CNN, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Judicial Panel of Inquiry set up the Lagos State Government to investigate the incident, as well as eyewitness accounts and ample photographic and video evidence clearly establish that soldiers and policemen engaged in coordinated, systematic and premeditated attacks against unarmed civil population, which led to deaths and injuries.\n\n\"Despite the evidence, the Federal Government of Nigeria has failed to initiate any meaningful investigation of the incident, but has instead engaged in efforts to discredit the reports issued by the organisations, while not offering any evidence in rebuttal of the facts set out in those reports.\n\nThe Killings of Unarmed Endsars Protesters at Lekki Toll Gate Were They Crimes Against Humanity by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\n\"It is evident that the Federal Government of Nigeria is unwilling to investigate, and/or achieve justice for the victims of the attacks/killings.\n\n\"Nigeria is a party to the Rome Statute, and all the conditions for the ICC to assume jurisdiction in this matter, and to, in the least, conduct a preliminary examination and a formal investigation are present.\n\n\"Unless the international community brings pressure to bear on the Federal Government of Nigeria, it is unlikely that there will ever be accountability for the persons who attacked and killed unarmed protesters at the Toll Gate, and for the persons who gave the orders for the attacks.\"\n\nThe Nigerian Government and officials of Lagos Government have been working tirelessly to discredit the findings of the panel that investigated the massacre of unarmed protesters at Lekki last year since the report surfaced.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, described the report as \"fake and full of errors\" earlier in the week while a member of the panel, Ebun Olu-Adegboruwa, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, has alleged threat to his life by agents of Lagos State Government.\n\nEarlier this week, Miss Kamsiyochukwu Ibe, who took active part in the nationwide protest last year, was attacked for testifying before the #EndSARS judicial panel in Lagos State.\n\nOther persons in support of the panel report and calling for the prosecution of perpetrators have also alleged threat to their lives.\n\nThe United States, United Nations, European Union, Amnesty International and several other groups around the world have all called for persons indicted by the panel report to be punished for their role in the killing of peaceful demonstrators at Lekki in October 2020.",

          "title": "African female founders need access to high-impact mentors",
          "text": "Beyond funding, African female entrepreneurs need access to high-impact mentors and who are willing to open up their network and teach what they know.\n\nA few weeks into January this year, Eloho Omame and Odunayo Eweniyi announced their female-focused angel investment fund. Aptly named FirstCheck Africa, the angel fund is on a mission to \u201cadvance equity, capital and leadership for a generation of women in Africa through technology & entrepreneurship\u201d. While FirstCheck argues that African women in tech are \u201cover-mentored\u201d and \u201cunder-funded\u201d, early-stage female founders need some handholding. Our ecosystem is still male-dominated, and female entrepreneurs need experienced mentors to guide them on their journey to success.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to not have a cart-before-the-horse mentality when it comes to helping African female entrepreneurs succeed. Of course, funding women-led businesses is important because entrepreneurs need capital to scale. But it\u2019s also important to level the playing field, invite female founders to join active networks, and connect them to successful high-impact mentors.\n\nFor Africa to build a more equitable tech ecosystem, mentoring and funding African women in tech must work hand-in-hand, not one after the other. Local and global investors must do the work of creating short-term or long-term mentorship programs that cater to underrepresented female founders. These mentorship programs should teach African women in tech how to network, grow their social equity, pitch to accelerators or funds with larger check sizes, and much more.\n\nThe conversation about mentorship is tricky because most female entrepreneurs are interested in getting the capital they need to run their businesses. But venture capitalists like Sohaila Ouffata believe that working with highly trained and experienced mentors is just as important as applying to receive funding from accelerators and venture funds. So Ouffata founded The African Tech Vision (ATV) to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for ambitious African female founders and executive leaders.\n\nEmpowering African female entrepreneurs at scale\n\nThe African Tech Vision is a free entrepreneurial programme designed to support early-stage African female founders and help them achieve their goals. Over six weeks, selected female founders are paired with mentors and industry experts from local and international startup scenes and technology hubs. During the programme, participants gain access to hands-on mentoring and coaching sessions provided by vetted ATV mentors. While most accelerator and mentorship programs are held in-person at specific locations, ATV kicked off its inaugural program online in April of this year. Hosting virtual mentoring sessions means more African female founders can apply to the programme without worrying about visa applications, travel fees, and sourcing for accommodation.\n\n\u201cThe style of the hands-on mentoring session is based on virtual interactions. Most mentors prefer video calls and structure the session based on the needs of the entrepreneur,\u201d said Ouffata in an emailed response to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe spent time with each entrepreneur at the beginning of the programme to define areas in which they are looking for mentorship. This is also the basis for matchmaking with selected mentors. For example, some founders prefer to speak multiple times a week with some of their mentors. Others prefer to ping their mentors with questions over WhatsApp. As we are a founder-friendly programme, we leave the decision to the founders and their mentors.\u201d\n\nATV offered its inaugural cohort a mix of recorded and live workshops, founder stories (events where experienced founders shared stories of success, challenges, and failures in their fields), and social activities every week. In the last programme, some of the content models made available to the cohort of African female founders include \u2018Engaging with Mentors\u2019, \u2018Elevator Pitch\u2018, \u2018Investors 101\u2018, \u2018Product Market Fit\u2019, and \u2018Sales Fundamentals\u2018.\n\nSome of the previous cohort\u2019s early-stage female founders were from Ghana, Rwanda, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Therefore, Ouffata and her team need to pull as many female founders from different African countries as possible before their next program kicks off in 2022.\n\nSource: TechCabal Insights\n\nWhy is The African Tech Vision betting on African women?\n\nFor Ouffata, betting on African female founders is a personal decision that fits into the larger vision of The African Tech Vision program.\n\n\u201cThe African Tech Vision was born out of a desire to honour my African heritage and to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for other African women,\u201d said Ouffata. \u201cOur vision is to connect female entrepreneurs with experienced international role models and aim to inspire and nurture the next generation of purpose-driven African female entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nNo doubt ATV\u2019s vision is audacious, but Africa\u2019s male-dominated technology and business ecosystem is a reality that can longer be ignored or explained away. ATV\u2019s model is designed to spotlight, empower, and back high-impact female founders in Africa.\n\nBeyond sentiments and national pride, ATV\u2019s reasons for backing female entrepreneurs are also rooted in profitability and nation-building. Businesses owned or founded by women are said to deliver higher revenue and better bet to a group of niche investors. Additionally, women typically reinvest up to 90% of their income back into their families and extended communities. This means that more girls and women need to be included in the global economy through education, employment, and mentorship.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Nigeria, insufficient purchasing power among middle-class citizens, coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing, puts car purchases out of reach for over 90% of the population. Also, most taxis and public transport buses in Nigerian cities are leased by drivers, who have to deliver rental fees to the owners periodically.\n\nThat means ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Bolt that launch in Nigeria are likely to face a shortage of driver-partners, especially if they\u2019re looking to cover all of the country\u2019s major cities.\n\nEarlier this year, Bolt launched a vehicle financing programme that offered drivers a flexible plan through which they could purchase their own vehicles. The scheme allows drivers to own a car or motorbike with low equity repayment for about four years and no interest.\n\n\u201cAs we expand our presence into more cities across the country, it is important to provide solutions that ensure working with Bolt is more flexible and profitable for drivers,\u201d Bolt\u2019s Country Manager, Femi Akin-Laguda, said at the time.\n\nAfter a pilot phase, which Akin-Laguda tells TechCabal \u201cenjoyed great success\u201d, the company has now partnered with Metro Africa Xpress (MAX), a Nigerian mobility company with a fintech play, to expand the program in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMAX originally started out as a motorcycle-based operator for delivery services. With its mobile app, users could order pickup riders who could fulfil deliveries quickly in the congested city of Lagos. By 2017, MAX had expanded into bike hailing, becoming the first company to pioneer the innovation in Nigeria. But in February 2020, the Lagos government\u2019s restrictions on passenger motorcycles threatened the company\u2019s growth in Nigeria\u2019s largest city.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, MAX\u2019s CFO, Guy-Bertrand Njoya, explains that the company has had to double down on its other mobility solutions since the ban. One of these is a subscription platform for low-to-zero emission vehicles in five cities across Nigeria, and Ghana. The subscription product includes credit and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) services, which the more than 13,000 drivers on its platform opt into.\n\nFor the partnership with Bolt, the company\u2019s alternative credit-scoring technology will allow access to proprietary performance and revenue analytics to underwrite the Bolt car loans for drivers.\n\n\u201cMAX is a renowned vehicle subscription platform with the capacity to support a truly wide placement of this type of partnership,\u201d Akin-Laguda said on Bolt\u2019s preferred car financing partner in Nigeria. \u201cTheir approach and insight to meet our goal of empowering drivers suited our desired proposition.\u201d\n\nMAX motorcycle riders.\n\nThe car financing programme is currently open only to drivers in Lagos and Abuja, with Bolt planning to expand the offer to all active drivers across Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Bolt, an agreement can be reached for up to 100% of the purchase, both for new and used cars, within 24 hours of signing up. This is given that drivers have provided all the information required. They can choose to pay back their loans using a percentage of the weekly revenue generated while driving on Bolt for up to five years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to expand our commitment to helping those on the Bolt platform to earn more and at their own pace, either driving full-time or part-time,\u201d Akin-Laguda said. \u201cImproving the earnings of drivers is fundamental to our business operations.\u201d\n\nFor drivers, Bolt\u2019s loan repayment process is more flexible than what traditionally exists in the market. Loan tenors from Nigerian banks often don\u2019t exceed two years whereas Bolt\u2019s repayment duration ranges from two to five. In the long run, Yamaha-backed MAX plans to add electric vehicles to the financing mix.\n\nIn addition to extending the lease-to-own framework to more e-hailing drivers, the partnership is expected to enable drivers access value-add services provided by MAX. These include licenses and permits, insurance, health coverage, and other financial products.\n\nThe low rate of vehicle ownership in Nigeria is similar across Africa, a continent with the lowest per capita vehicle ownership in the world.\n\nWith the majority of Africa\u2019s more than one billion population having limited or no access to vehicle financing, the continent recorded fewer than 900,000 new vehicle sales in 2019, compared to more than 17 million in the United States alone.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

We\u2019re currently prospecting those regions for opportunities to expand safely,\u201d he said.\n\nThe startup recently launched a revamped version of its app that allows users to buy crypto for less than $1 (\u20a6550) while offering features such as one-click limit orders and automated recurring buys.\n\nIt intends to launch a savings feature that would allow users to earn interest on their crypto next month and early next year, another for users to spend cryptocurrencies at select online and offline retail outlets. The latter is being developed in partnership with SureGifts, a gift card company.\n\nThe Busha team.

          "title": "Ex-DealDey managers reunite to launch ThankUCash deals",
          "text": "The collapse of DealDey, a Nigeria-based online deals aggregator, three years ago, laid bare the difficulty of operating an internet-based commerce business in the country, especially with the similar failures of Efritin and OLX at the time.\n\nMuch like Groupon, DealDey connected customers with merchants that offered goods and services at slashed prices, a proposition that appealed to a largely low-income population. In some cases, consumers could purchase items at discounts of more than 90%.\n\nFounded in 2011 by Sim Shagaya, DealDey was a precursor for many e-commerce platforms in the country. And at its peak, the startup could claim to be sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest online deals platform.\n\nIt had more than 400 employees, over one million users, 15,000 active merchants, and 20,000 verified listed businesses, raised millions in equity funding, and looked set to play a big role in the Nigerian e-commerce space for decades to come.\n\nThat was before things went south. As Nigeria\u2019s 2016 economic recession bit hard, DealDey cut over 60% of its staff and reportedly owed merchants for months. In less than a year, the platform was sold to Ringier Africa Deals Group reportedly for $5 million, rather than the $75 million at which it valued itself, before eventually shutting down in late 2018.\n\nSo much has changed in the country since then. For one, more Nigerians now shop online, and arguably, younger populations in urban areas have more spending power. Interestingly, some of DealDey\u2019s former managers\u2014including Mohammed Abubakar, Juwon Ajao, and Joy Amadi\u2014now have an opportunity to take another shot at building the continent\u2019s largest online deals platform, but this time under the ThankUCash brand.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA multi-merchant rewards platform\n\nSince its founding in 2018, ThankUCash\u2014a service that helps companies grow customer loyalty and increase revenue with data analytics and customer rewards\u2014has become a household name among bargain hunters.\n\nThe platform is the brainchild of Connected Analytics, a company founded by Simeon Ononobi (CEO), Suraj Supekar (CTO), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP). The founding members of ThankUCash, a kind of rewards platform hardly seen in African markets, were inspired by the need to address a significant market gap Simeon Ononobi and his team observed: the lack of consumer data and loyalty among businesses.\n\n\u201cWe saw that there were no records on buyers, which affected customer retention as people only bought what they needed and never came back. So we moved to solve this problem, and that\u2019s what brought about ThankUCash,\u201d he told TechCabal. \u201cWe also realised the need to make consumers happy and excited about spending.\u201d\n\nThankUCash enables merchants to give rewards (in the form of cashback, discounts, and points) seamlessly to their customers via a data analytics-powered reward system. Within the ThankUCash app, customers can use the rewards to buy deals, airtime, pay for utility bills, and cable TV subscriptions.\n\nBy giving such rewards, the startup hopes to help build customer loyalty and increase revenue for merchants while also collecting customer data for analytics, targeting, and decision-making purposes.\n\nIn this sense, Connected Analytics generates revenue by using one of the most common business models available: being a middleman. It charges a 30% commission on customer rewards, a monthly SaaS fee from merchants using its predictive analytics platform, and an upfront partnership fee for partners looking to use the platform, and commissions on future transactions.\n\nAs of March this year, ThankUCash had over 500 merchants it was helping to grow their businesses. These include Trebet, Dana Airlines, Gleeword, ENYO Retail, MedMart, PriceRite, Choplife, and CET Energy, among others. The startup claims to have also secured strategic partnerships with major banks and financial institutions in the country, such as UBA, Sterling Bank, First City Monument Bank (FCMB), and Wema Bank.\n\nWith 734,000 users, 90,000 of which are active monthly, the multi-merchant rewards platform has clearly gained significant traction across key indicators so far. But Connected Analytics is not resting on its laurels as it plans to add a new segment to its business offerings: Groupon-like deals.\n\nJuwon Ajao, Mohammed Abubakar, Simeon Ononobi and Joy Amadi.\n\nSucceeding where DealDey struggled\n\nBy expanding its service to include daily deals, Connected Analytics is stepping into a territory where very few Nigerian companies play, ever since the collapse of DealDey three years ago. Some platforms currently offer deals but not on the same scale as the pioneering startup did.\n\nThe decision to re-assemble the DealDey team, according to Simeon Ononobi, was necessitated by the need to tap their experience in achieving the startup\u2019s goals. \u201cWe realised we couldn\u2019t do this on our own and resorted to bringing on the team that had done it in the past,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nBut how does the company plan to avoid the pitfalls that brought down DealDey after seven years of operations?\n\nDealDey\u2019s collapse was based largely on the economic downturn of 2018 when the country\u2019s budget was approved late and consumers\u2019 buying power was affected. Customers wanted to get the same price points and same value. \u201cWith thin margins, we needed to sell more to cover overhead, and at that particular time, it was a tall order,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nThankUCash intends to leverage its existing analytics capabilities in order to do things better now, according to Simeon Ononobi.\n\nAbubakar, who was the city manager at DealDey, and now serves as ThankUCash\u2019s deals manager, believes the surge in online commerce activity among Nigerians bodes well for the foray into daily deals by Connected Analytics.\n\n\u201cThings are different now compared to when DealDey shut down. More people are inclined to shop online and e-commerce numbers are increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, there are many online platforms doing food delivery, event ticketing, hotel bookings, and other professional services that were not there three or four years ago.\u201d\n\nConnected Analytics plans to hire even more ex-DealDey staff and has also poached top employees from companies like KPMG, Jumia, and Econet Media.\n\nAccording to Simeon Ononobi, some failed businesses could have had better chances of survival if they had a better knowledge of their customers and leveraged that data to make decisions. ThankUCash\u2019s analytics platform solves this problem, and with the addition of the daily deals vertical, it can help businesses, from banks to airlines and hotels, boost sales.\n\nTake a hotel with a 70% occupancy rate during holidays, for instance. Instead of having vacant rooms while overhead costs remain constant, the company could salvage some revenue by offering discounts on bookings via ThankUCash.\n\nSimeon Ononobi is bullish on ThankUCash\u2019s chances of becoming a super aggregator of such deals, helping businesses grow and consumers access bargains. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d the CEO said of his company\u2019s ambitions in the online deals space. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a lot of things and intend to cover a wide range of product categories like DealDey did.\u201d\n\nFor Abubakar, he and his former (and now current) colleagues have a chance to \u201cfind our mistakes, fix them, and then innovate more\u201d at ThankUCash.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "The next frontier for fintech: Disruptive business models",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, we introduced our latest series, The Next Frontier, and talked about the shape of the edtech industry in the future. This week, as you\u2019ve probably guessed, we\u2019ll be talking about fintechs.\n\nAfrica\u2019s fintech industry is one of the largest and probably the most advanced. Having produced five of Africa\u2019s seven unicorns and some of the largest funding rounds we\u2019ve seen, that\u2019s probably a safe assumption.\n\nBut what\u2019s the next big thing? What kind of models can we expect to see? This week, we talked with Adedeji Olowe (Trustee, Open Banking Nigeria) and Abdul Hassan, Mono Founder and CEO.\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t necessarily tell the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next big thing\n\nThe very first question we asked Olowe was the level of growth the industry has achieved so far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had significant growth so far. But the interesting bit to me is not where we are coming from, it\u2019s how far we still have to grow. So whatever is exciting you about fintech right now, you haven\u2019t seen anything. I don\u2019t think the space has grown up to 2-3% of its capacity.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, using the example of Nigeria\u2019s average transaction size for transfer, he believes transfers would be free.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get to a level where transfers of a certain amount would be free, and after that, we can actually bring in financial inclusion for everybody. So you will now see transactions like, \u2018Oh, I want to send \u20a650 to Ogheneruemu,\u2019 \u2018 I want to spend \u20a6100 to buy bole,\u2018 and then it would be free.\u201d\n\nOf course, he agreed that there would be a limit to transferable amounts, putting the benchmark at \u20a610,000 weekly. But in his words, \u201cat that level, it would just become explosive.\u201d\n\nHow soon will this happen? Well, he believes this could happen as soon as next year, helping to drive Nigeria\u2019s sluggish cashless policy.\n\nOn the other hand, the first question Techpoint asked Hassan centred around the direction the industry would be going in. His answer, three phases of growth.\n\n\u201cI believe that there will be a lot of regulatory involvement in the next two to three years. And what this means is that we would see the regulators actually actively helping the ecosystem. I\u2019m someone that supports regulation because where there\u2019s regulation, I feel like there would be a lot of innovation as well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlowe had a similar opinion, albeit somewhat different. \u201cI know that people don\u2019t like CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria) regulating prices. But the funny thing is that CBN\u2019s pricing has done more to expand the market than anything else.\u201d\n\nFor some context, at some point, transfers in Nigeria cost \u20a6100; now, they cost between \u20a610 and \u20a650.\n\nThe second phase, according to Hassan, however, would be a hotbed of mergers and acquisitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Nattanan Kanchanaprat from Pixabay\n\n\u201cI think there will be a lot of mergers and acquisitions coming up next year because I feel like there are a lot of companies doing similar things. And it doesn\u2019t really make sense to have about 20 companies doing the same thing when they can all put together the demand power, the resources, and the talent to build something that is really massive out of Africa.\u201d\n\nThe third phase is a companies-funding-companies stage.\n\n\u201cWe would see more fintech companies, funding more fintech companies. And what this means is that you could see a company like Mono investing in other interesting companies that are, for example, using our infrastructure. We\u2019ve seen this happen with Visa and Mastercard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already happening, but people are not talking about it. But I think it will be more public next year, and this is mostly because of the traction we\u2019ve seen in the fintech industry.\u201d\n\nFor him, all of the attention the fintech industry is and would be getting would be very helpful to aid other industries in getting more funding. Olowe agrees.\n\nNew technology or new business models?\n\nCurrently, the fintech industry is very API and cloud computing driven. However, Olowe and Hassan believe that rather than disruptive technologies, it would be a more disruptive business model.\n\nCiting companies like Inflow Finance and Sproutly Nigeria, Hassan says infrastructure like Mono\u2019s would be the base of novel business models.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy sense is that we would see more business models, more developers, and more interesting companies coming up because of infrastructure like us. I mean, if you look at it, in 2016 and 2017, Paystack made PiggyVest possible. Without Paystack, PiggyVest wouldn\u2019t be a company.\n\n\u201cThat was a new business model that wasn\u2019t available in Nigeria before Paystack. So I think that kind of emergence of new business models and successful companies is what we will see in the next couple of years. And that\u2019s what excites me most.\u201d\n\nFor example, a business model that enables seamless confirmation of transactions or rounds up the remainder of every transaction made into money that can be put into savings.\n\nBut maybe some technology\n\nFor Olowe, apart from free transfers, one aspect he believes has been severely overlooked is contactless cards. Interestingly, according to him, banks have been given out contactless cards in the past year.\n\nA quick Google search reveals that a contactless card would look something like this with a sideways WiFi signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by kreatikar on Pixabay\n\nTo confirm this, we did a quick experiment using both old and new debit cards. We found that the new cards had sideways WiFi signals while the old cards didn\u2019t.\n\nEssentially, a contactless card can be used without being handed to PoS merchants or shop attendants. You can place it directly on the machine, and your transaction is immediately approved.\n\nSo, why are they not being used? Olowe gives two reasons: acceptance and payments.\n\n\u201cThe only challenge is that the amount to spend is not on those cards. Number two, the PoS needs to accept contactless cards, and those two things need to meet each other.\u201d\n\nAccording to Olowe, these contactless cards are supposed to act as a limited store of value. For example, the Cowry cards used for payment in the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Lagos State. You have to put some money in the card to use it, essentially transferring a specific amount to be used for payment.\n\nSo, for this to work, you need to transfer money for use into the card itself and not your bank account, and then readers for these cards must be available.\n\nMerging the old with the new\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2021, Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) changed its name to Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO). According to Group CEO Segun Agbaje, \u201cWe believe that a holding company structure will allow us to take advantage of new business opportunities in the emerging competitive landscape and strengthen our earnings base.\u201d\n\nWhile there have been no outright moves, there have been speculations that this signals the company\u2019s shift into a more technological arena.\n\nWe asked Olowe what he thought of banks playing in the fintech space in the future, and he believes it would be pretty impossible.\n\n\u201cTraditional banks would go into fintechs, and they would fail miserably, and that is not a guess. Why? Because they don\u2019t have the DNA to run a fintech. Banks can\u2019t be agile. Banks don\u2019t place customer service, user experience as paramount. Forget about them talking about it. It\u2019s not just part of them.\u201d\n\nHe says it is doubly worse for traditional institutions in the insurance space.\n\nInterestingly, Hassan disagrees, and he believes this could mean better and stiffer competition and even more acquisitions.\n\nOther predictions\n\nEvery week, I receive a newsletter from Samora Kariuki called Frontier Fintech. I first subscribed in August 2021. Since then, he has talked about several things like the modernisation of banks, the possibility of an African super app \u2014 one of my favourites \u2014 and digital bank valuations.\n\nIn last week\u2019s newsletter, Kariuki made some interesting predictions, which you can find here.\n\nIntrigued? Then you\u2019d love to be at Techpoint Build 2021, where discussions like this and concerning other industries would be held.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021 has been a good year for African startups. This year, the continent has already minted five unicorns. After the lull in investment activities in 2020, investments in African startups are on track to exceed the $2 billion record set in 2019.\n\nAs has been the case in previous years, the bulk of the funding has gone to fintech startups with the fragmented nature of the continent\u2019s financial system providing an opportunity for innovative founders and investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurin Hainy, CEO and Co-Founder of FairMoney\n\nAs of October 2021, Africa: The Big Deal reported that 57% of the amounts raised which was slightly above $1.6 billion has gone to fintech startups. One such fintech is FairMoney, a digital bank that currently offers lending services in Nigeria, India, and France.\n\nIn July, the startup raised a $42 million Series B led by Tiger Global to consolidate its position in India and Nigeria. This follows its $10 million Series A round raised in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, November 18, 2021, the company hosted investors, the media, and industry leaders at its first investor conference. Following a brief introduction, the CEO and co-founder, Laurin Hainy took to the stage to share the startup\u2019s journey since inception.\n\nIn his welcome address, Hainy revealed that the conference was \u201cconceived to provide an avenue for capital market operators, investors, fintech players, regulators, industry associations, and other financial industry participants to discuss the role of digital financial models in providing meaningful financial inclusion for Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL \u2013 R: Patryk Kalisz, Head of Controlling and Reporting, FairMoney; Siddharth Kulkarni,\n\nExecutive Sponsor, Lending, Nigeria at FairMoney; Nicolas Berthozat, Co-Founder\n\nFairMoney and Juris Rieksts-Riekstin\u0161, Head of Risk, Nigeria, at the FairMoney investor\u2019s\n\nconference.\n\nIn Nigeria, traditional banks have typically shied away from offering loans to individuals and small businesses without collateral. This is the segment FairMoney serves and Yaw Mante, the startup\u2019s Head of Finance revealed that not only have they been able to offer loans to these people, but they have also had a very low default rate.\n\nHe disclosed that in order to do this, the startup makes use of data science and underwriting algorithms to predict how likely an individual is to default on their loan before deciding how much risk they are able to take.\n\nIn the absence of data on users, the startup may initially give such customers smaller amounts to gauge their ability to repay the loans. Depending on how the borrower performs, they are then able to offer higher amounts to them. So far, in 2021, the startup has given out loans worth more than \u20a670 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL \u2013 R: Oluwatomide Oluwole, Finance Manager, FairMoney; Henry Obiekea, VP Capital\n\nMarkets, FairMoney; Yaw Mante, Head, Finance \u2013 FairMoney and James Edeh, Head,\n\nCompliance, FairMoney, at the FairMoney investor\u2019s conference.\n\nHaving recently acquired a microfinance license, Mante explained the reason for that, \u201cLoans are not the only products that our customers need. They need to be able to pay, they need to be able to save, they need to be able to invest. The way that we think about our business is that we look at our customers, we look at what they need and we try to work with them to provide that.\n\nIn order to do all of these things, we need to upscale our license and hence why we acquired the microfinance license. Over time, we\u2019ll look at our options to continue to provide more complex products and services to our customers.\u201d\n\nWith several players in the fintech industry, Mante discussed the startup\u2019s evolution towards a multi-product full-fledged digital bank. \u201cOur unique selling point is we want to be able to provide all of the banking needs of our customers but we start with the product we think is the most pressing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a lot of startups, a Series B is often followed by expansion. However, Hainy says FairMoney would consolidate its position in its current markets. \u201cI think we\u2019re very excited about the opportunities in Nigeria and India. They are two out of the four biggest countries in the world and they\u2019re very underserved.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Obiekea, VP Capital Markets, FairMoney\n\nHe also pointed out that while the fintech space in India and Nigeria possess some similarities, there are more people in India who possess some level of digital identification compared to Nigeria.\n\nThere was also a panel session on the role of fintech startups in financial inclusion in Nigeria. It featured Nicole Yembra, Founder and Managing Partner of Chrysalis Capital, Sonnie Ayere, GMD/CEO, DLM Capital Group, Yaw Mante, Head of Finance, FairMoney, and Bayo Rotimi, Managing Director of Greenwich Merchant Bank.\n\nDespite the progress recorded by fintech startups in the country, the jury is still out on how much impact they really have with the vast majority of the country still lacking access to the financial system. Hainy sees this as a challenge and believes that FairMoney is perfectly positioned to solve this challenge.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This is just above the global average of 11.7%.\n\nThe report was based on a survey conducted on 1,205 Nigerian Internet users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Nigeria is the sixth country with the highest rate of NFT adoption out of the 20 countries surveyed. The top five countries were the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam.\n\nSurprisingly, the US, UK, and Japan, were the bottom three. The survey also went on to estimate that Nigeria\u2019s NFT ownership rate could reach 35% as 21.7% of the surveyed Internet users, plan to own NFTs.\n\nHold on a minute. Can 1,205 Internet users out of 101.72 million tell the true story about NFTs in Nigeria?\n\nHowever, if we consider the fact that Nigeria also ranked sixth in the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis maybe Finders.com\u2019s report isn\u2019t too far fetched.\n\nWhat do you think?

Source: TechCrunch\n\nAfrican fintech startup, Asilimia, has raised $2 million to help African Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), digitise their operations and connect them to the formal financial economy. The funding comprises a $1 million pre-seed and $1 million in debt financing.\n\nThe round saw investment from serial entrepreneur, Fredrik Jung Abbou, Co-founder of two unicorns \u2014 Kry, a telemedicine startup and fintech startup, Lendo. Other investors include Norrsken Impact Accelerator, Bpifrance and GreenTec Capital Partners\n\nHow does Asilimia work? The startup helps MSMEs digitise and formalise their operations \u2014 payments, revenue collection, and accounting \u2014 with its digital platform while providing them with credit facilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounded by Tekwane Mwendwa and Morgane Kablan, it helps business owners track expenses, payments, and get financial insights on their mobile phones.\n\nWhile Asilimia\u2019s mission could formalise MSMEs on the continent, in sub-Saharan Africa, only 45% were subscribed to mobile services by the end of 2019 according to the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA). That number, however, is expected to reach 50% by 2025.\n\nThe startup plans to grow its team and expand into more East African markets with the funding.\n\nOnePipe\u2019s $3.5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnePipe team\n\nNigerian fintech API, OnePipe, has closed a $3.5 million seed, co-led by Atlantica Ventures, Tribe Capital and V&R Associates.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe two modular refineries in Edo State have the capacity to end the importation of petroleum products in South-South region of Nigeria. The two modular refineries will end fuel subsidy in the South-South region of Nigeria. They will start operation very soon. We are expecting President Buhari to commission them very soon. Edo Modular Energy refinery is set to increase crude oil production from 6,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 60,000 bpd. The project will enhance fuel sufficiency in the country and reduce the sufferings of Nigerians in every facet. Projections are that some of its products will be exported to boost foreign exchange earnings and by the time it extends operations into different phases, the firm would be able to take care of more than 80 per cent of diesel requirement in Nigeria. The investment is also expected to benefit Edo people through job creation, increased revenue and ease of pressure on other refineries.\n\nThe continuation of subsidising of petrol is not sustainable in the light of current economic realities. The 2022 deadline is realistic and its impact might be mitigated with the coming on stream of the Modular Refineries project at Ologbo in Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area of the state and Dupot Oil Modular Refinery, Egbokor Village, Iyoba Ward, Orhionmwon Local Government, Edo State, 650,000BPD Dangote Refinery, Bua Group Refinery, Waltersmith Refinery and other modular refineries. The modular refineries in Edo State are capable of eliminating petrol subsidy in the South-South region of Nigeria. President Buhari should allow these refineries to come on stream before the removal of fuel subsidy.\n\nThe removal of petrol subsidy is in the interest of development of the downstream sector. The decision of the government to stop subsidising petrol by 2022 and it will attract more investments to the sector, especially with the passage of PIA. I want a level playing field to be provided for everyone in the sector to encourage competition once the subsidy is removed.\n\nGovernor Obaseki and two modular refineries will drive industrial revolution in Edo State. The petroleum industry in Edo State received a new boost as the Federal Government reduced the cost of obtaining a refinery license from $1,000,000(one million dollars) to $150,000 (one hundred and fifty thousand dollars) among other things. The ongoing Modular Refineries project at Ologbo in Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area of the state and Dupot Oil Modular Refinery, Egbokor Village, Iyoba Ward, Orhionmwon Local Government, Edo State will on completion, drive the state\u2019s industrial revolution quest.\n\nIn the last 5 years in Edo State, production capacity of PSC\u2019s has steadily increased, averaging 3% growth, to account for about 35% of total production. JV arrangements contributed about 55% of aggregate production in the preceding year. Indigenous Oil Companies\u2019 production capacity accounts for about one-eighth of aggregate production. The depletion and reserves replacement rate y-o-y averaged 2.04% and 4.00% respectively. Currently, the reserves life index stands at about 49.03 years. Edo is one of the lucky states to be an oil producing state. This state contributes 2.06% of the total crude oil output in the country. Benin City is currently the capital of Edo and the state has a human strength of more than 3.3 million spread across the state\u2019s Local Government Areas.\n\nDupot Oil Modular Refinery, Egbokor Village, Iyoba Ward, Orhionmwon Local Government ,Edo Modular and Refinery Company Ltd. and AIPCC Energy, were on the verge of completing the 5,500bpd Edo Modular Refinery, now at 70 per cent completion stage.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Edo Modular Energy refinery is set to increase crude oil production from 6,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 60,000 bpd. The project is being developed by two Chinese firms; AIPCC Energy Limited and the Peiyang Chemical Equipment Company Limited.\n\nOperations are expected to commence between mid-October and december. The first phase will produce 1,000 bpd, while the second phase will produce 6,000 bpd; with a long-term goal of producing 60,000 bpd. Phase one \u2013 which is completed \u2013 will target a production ratio comprising 55% diesel, 38% fuel oil and less than 10% naphtha. \u201cSome of the products will be exported to boost foreign exchange earnings and by the time we extend it into different phases. We would be able to take care of more than 80% of diesel requirement in Nigeria. That is the vision we have for the next five years,\u201d says Segun Okeni \u2013 AIPCC Energy Limited Head of Quality, Health and Safety/Community Relations.\n\nThe investment will benefit the Edo people through job creation, increased revenue and ease of pressure on other refineries. This is a key legacy project by the Gov. Godwin Obaseki-led administration to recalibrate the state\u2019s industrial base, birthed through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).\n\nThe project, sited at Ologbo in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area, would produce from its feedstock 50 per cent of diesel (500,000 litres), 25 per cent of naphtha (300,000 litres) and 20 per cent of fuel oil (200,000) litres. The crude is to be sourced from the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company\u2019s (NPDC) facility \u2013 oil mining lease (OML) 111, near Benin City.\n\nThe modular refineries project were among the growing list of ongoing legacy projects of Governor Obaseki through MoU with local and international private investors, which included the 55MW CCTEC Ossiomo Power Plant, which had been completed and ready for use. The Benin Enterprise and Industrial Park, which development is ongoing and the Benin River Port, for which preliminary works are ongoing,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernor Obaseki is committed to resetting the economy of the state for prosperity and industrial growth. According to Obaseki, the local content component of the refinery project ensures that Edo citizens are trained in welding, refinery operation and fabrication works to enable them participate in the construction of the refinery as well as its operation, post-commissioning.\n\nA modular refinery is a prefabricated crude oil processing plant constructed on skid mounted surfaces, with each structure containing a portion of the entire refining process plant, with by interstitial piping to form an easily manageable process. Technically, a modular refinery could be either simple or complex, with capacity ranging from 100 bpsd to 10,000 bpsd. They are however not defined by size. They can be transported in modules across distances and put together at the location desired. The other advantages of modular refineries include short project completion time, relatively small overall project cost, provides quicker investment return, can be installed in small space and could be designed towards petroleum product need around its location.\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes from Ologbo, Edo State\n\n...",

This has been taken into consideration as we design the 30-year developmental plan for Edo State, which will be the blueprint that provides direction for intentional and targeted growth across all sectors of development in our state over the next three decades.\n\n\u201cIn this plan, we are very particular in transforming our state to an educational hub. We currently host the largest concentration of higher educational institutions in the South-South of Nigeria. Our commitment to supporting these institutions to reach the peak of their growth and impact on society is not hindered by virtue of their ownership status.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to us if they are federal, state or privately-owned institutions, as long as we see them forming critical eco-system of knowledge to produce human capacity that will drive economic growth in our state,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cUNIBEN plays a critical role in the education eco-system, because they have the advantage of experience and history, and host world-renowned scholars who continue to make indelible marks in the sands of time with innovation and advances in science and technology, economy, agriculture and the humanities.\n\n\u201cWe have provided support to the university community and will continue to do so in extending infrastructural projects, not only to the university alone, but also to the host community around the university.\n\n\u201cAs a state, we believe we should strengthen the basis of education because without a strong basic foundation for education, the product that ends up in our universities will struggle when they get in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have emphasized and continued to invest in EdoBEST and also continue to revamp our technical schools and other tertiary institutions,\u201d Obaseki stated.\n\nDeclaring the convocation ceremony open, the Chancellor of the institution, HRM Orcivirigh Prof. James Ortese Iorzua Ayatse lauded Governor Obaseki for his dynamic leadership and continuous support for the federal government-owned institution.\n\nHe further noted, \u201cNigerian universities are encouraged to engage in profitable ventures without compromising on the core objectives of setting up of the institutions, which are teaching, learning and research. UNIBEN has been at the forefront in meeting these core objectives.\u201d\n\n...",

The epidemiological situation in South Africa has been characterised by three distinct peaks in reported cases, the latest of which was predominantly the Delta variant.

Several labs have indicated that for one widely used PCR test, one of the three target genes is not detected (called S gene dropout or S gene target failure) and this test can therefore be used as marker for this variant, pending sequencing confirmation.

          "text": "As the Federal Government continues building a more resilient and competitive economy, the private sector\u2019s strong partnership has been restated, especially to drive the success of Nigeria\u2019s new National Development Plan.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) stated this on Friday at the 2021 Presidential Policy Dialogue of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI).\n\nWhile highlighting the importance of the private sector in driving Nigeria\u2019s economy on the path of sustainable growth and job creation, Prof. Osinbajo noted that \u201cthe private sector on which so much depends and so well represented here, will rise up to help Nigeria achieve these noble objectives by working closely with Government.\u201d\n\nAccording to a statement by his media aide, Laolu Akande, he disclosed that the collaboration of both government and the private sector \u201cmust promote productivity and value addition and move away from the despair of managing limited resources to producing and creating more in a competitive and sustainable manner.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President further said through the new National Development Plan, the Federal Government was placing particular focus on job creation, value addition, and promoting a business-friendly environment.\n\nExplaining how the collaboration would be implemented, the VP stated that the Plan \u201cenvisages an investment commitment of N348trillion over the plan period of which it is expected that Government at all levels will come up with about N49.7trillion or about 14%, while the private sector is expected to invest N298 trillion or about 86%.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the Federal Government has continued to take deliberate steps to encourage the private sector in improving the country\u2019s business environment, by enabling more speedy transactions and removing bureaucratic obstacles.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the very first Executive Order issued by this Government, EO 001 was on promoting transparency and efficiency in the business environment. Executive Order 003 promoting support for local content in public procurement had a similar objective in mind,\u201d Prof. Osinbajo recalled.\n\nHe then stated that when fully implemented, the National Development Plan\u2019s strategy of becoming a value-adding economy will help create many jobs.\n\nAccording to him \u201cthe strategic objectives of the Medium-Term Plan include establishing a strong foundation for a diversified economy, investing in critical infrastructure, enabling human capital development and improving governance and strengthening security. The implementation of the Plan is expected to be supported by a range of measures of fiscal, monetary, and trade measures, including reformation of subsidy regimes and a better functioning foreign exchange market.\n\n\u201cIn terms of strategic direction, increasing productivity is the cornerstone. In practical terms, this means focusing on value addition as the guiding principle for all sectors including agriculture, manufacturing, solid minerals, digital services, tourism, hospitality, sports, and entertainment. In agriculture, for example, equal attention is given to primary production as well as other aspects of the value chain such as storage, transportation, processing, marketing, and exports.\u201d\n\nProf. Osinbajo added that Government worked closely with the private sector to ensure Nigeria benefits greatly from the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreements.\n\nIn the same vein, he noted that the private sector \u201cmust contribute to the articulation of the National Trade Strategy, provide support to our negotiators in AfCFTA processes while taking full advantage of the opportunities provided by this free trade area.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cthis government has always emphasised that the private sector has a key role to play in our efforts to build a more resilient and competitive economy. Private companies are engaged in design, construction, logistics and financial components of national infrastructural projects just as we are fully conscious that good infrastructure is vital to enable the private sector to be efficient and competitive.\n\n\u201cAs things stand, negotiations on the Rules of Origin which are very important for boosting local production are at about 87.65% complete with outstanding work of about 10% on textiles and 2% relating to automobiles. In services, 41 countries have made offers but which are still to be verified. The Phase 2 negotiations on Investment, Intellectual Property, Competition are at early stages while talks on Women and Youth in Trade and Digital Trade are yet to start.\u201d\n\nThe VP also highlighted the infrastructure development drive of the Buhari administration, including the Abuja-Kaduna railway, Lagos-Ibadan railway, and other major projects nearing completion such as the Second Niger Bridge, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Abuja-Kano Expressway, and the Abuja-Kaduna-Kano gas pipeline.\n\nProf. Osinbajo stated that the country\u2019s infrastructure will improve further when InfraCo, the N15 trillion infrastructure fund being set up in partnership with the private sector, fully takes off.\n\nSpeaking further on the Government\u2019s proactive steps in mitigating the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19, the Vice President noted the far-reaching impact of the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP) which helped Nigeria exit recession faster than most countries at the height of the global pandemic.\n\nHe also stated how the ESP helped in saving and creating jobs, with millions of Nigerians as beneficiaries of ESP components such as the MSMEs Survival Fund.\n\nHis words: \u201cthe resulting Economic Sustainability Plan emphasized rapid health interventions, keeping businesses going, creating and protecting jobs, boosting local production and providing social protection for the most vulnerable sections of society.\n\n\u201cThe ESP also included a suite of macroeconomic policies including fiscal grants, tax breaks, regulatory forbearance to banks as well as reduced interest and moratorium on CBN intervention facilities amongst other things.\n\n\u201cThese interventions paid off as we had a very short recession and we are now seeing a rebound in economic activity with GDP growth of 5.01% in the second quarter of this year and 4.03% in the third quarter.\u201d\n\nThe VP also stated the Federal Government\u2019s interventions in reducing the country\u2019s youth unemployment gap through job initiatives.\n\nThese include the N-Power scheme (where up to 1.5 million young Nigerians were recruited over two cohorts), and the Jubilee Fellows Programme \u2013 in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme, the European Union, and other partners \u2013 a one-year work placement scheme for 20,000 young Nigerians set to kick-off in January 2022.\n\nThe Vice President observed that \u201cwhile this was a scratch on the surface as well over two million young people enter into the workforce every year, there is no doubt that the Nigeria private sector has to thrive in order to create the number and kinds of jobs that we need but it is also important for the Nigerian youth to acquire the skills and knowledge of the workplace.\u201d\n\nThis is a major reason why Government is ramping up its efforts to prepare Nigeria\u2019s economy for the future by diversifying the economy, as well as creating a more enabling environment for the digital and creative sectors to thrive, the VP added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cFor instance, the Big Six Technology Companies Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and now Tesla, account for up to half of the value of the NASDAQ 100 and had nearly $1trillion in revenues in 2019. By contrast, Nigerian GDP in 2019 was just about $450billion. What this shows is that as a nation, we have to embrace technology and learn to use it for our own developmental purposes.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the reasons why the Advisory Group on Technology and Creativity which brings together public and private stakeholders articulated the need to strengthen the ecosystem of support to the digital and creative sectors.\n\n\u201cThis resulted in the conceptualization of the $600million investment in Digital and Creative Enterprises programme (i-DICE) with the African Development Bank which we hope will become operational early in 2022,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe Vice President added that even as the country adopts measures to cope with the fall-out of the COVID-19 pandemic, it also has \u201cto factor in the need to mitigate and adapt to climate change and the relentless march of the digital economy and the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\u201d",

          "text": "The president and founder of Maryam Abacha American University of Niger (MAAUN) and the Franco-British International University (FBIU) conglomerate, Prof. Adamu Abubakar Gwarzo, has urged Nigerian Universities, particularly those in the North, to embrace the culture of internationalisation.\n\nProf. Gwarzo said internationalisation of education was critical since it is concerned with the transmission of universally applicable knowledge, ideas, skills, talents and values.\n\nHe made this call in a speech at the convocation lecture and 10th year anniversary of Federal University, Dutsin-Ma, Katsina State, on Friday.\n\nProf. Gwarzo represented by Prof. Muhammad Sanusi Magaji Rano, the Dean of Postgraduate of Maryam Abacha American University of Niger Republic, said: \u201cHowever, I would like to encourage universities in Nigeria, particularly those in the north, to embrace the culture of internationalisation.\n\n\u201cThis is essential because internationalisation has become increasingly crucial in Education, which has been equated to an enterprise creating a plethora of high-quality worldwide marketable goods and services in recent years.\n\n\u201cAs a result, there is a need to develop an all-encompassing system that would fit the existing Education model in order to ensure that global standard practices are followed by the Nigerian educational institutions.\u201d\n\nProf Gwarzo also congratulated the management of Federal University Dutsin-Ma as it celebrates its 10th anniversary, saying the institution has achieved alot.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis institution has made tremendous progress in a number of areas since its inception in the year 2011.It should be recalled that the Federal University, Dutsin-ma was established, alongside eight other Federal Universities, as part of the Federal Government of Nigeria\u2019s initiatives to strengthen the country\u2019s knowledge base and broaden access to quality education, which is a central issue in the establishment of educational institutions in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Federal University, Dutsin-ma, like several other universities, has been working to solve the issue of limited admission slots set aside for qualified university candidates in northern Nigeria and the country as a whole. This is a welcome development,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nReiterating on internationalisation of education, Prof Gwarzo noted that it \u201cis critical since it is concerned with the transmission of universally applicable knowledge, ideas, skills, talents and values. It is a powerful tool for educational institutions to diversify their strategic goals. There is growing competition among the global higher education institutions to internationalize and Nigeria must not be left behind.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that, \u201cUniversities, as you are all aware, are institutions with dual national and international features. While owners and investors, structures, and organizations are always national, the substance and knowledge conveyed are universal and worldwide.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, emphasised that higher education should benefit individuals and society in many ways.\n\n\u201cIt creates competent and skilled manpower and career development.\n\nIt evolves and produces expertise through research and innovation. It produces equal opportunity and connect intellectuals of diverse academic background. It facilitates standards of education (through education and training),\u201d he stressed.\n\nProf Gwarzo further said that higher education also helps promote international collaboration, and strengthens global competitiveness, adding that the Federal University Dutsin-ma, like many other federal institutions in the country, has the potential to build worldwide connections and partnerships in order to develop a global presence in academia.\n\n\u201cSo I must disclose to you all here that Nigerian universities and other institutions of learning must collaborate with other regions of the globe to address global issues such as renewable energy, climate change, sustainable development and insecurity among other socio-economic challenges.\n\n\u201cInternationalisation for research and teaching capability, as well as information transfer, is one strategy to address these problems. In addition, recent educational reforms put in place by the federal government of Nigeria have boosted the capacity of university education in the country. So, in this regard, I am calling on all public and private institutions to embrace the modern trend of internationalization of universities and this should include the policies and procedures implemented by academic systems and organizations.\n\n\u201cInternationalisation has resulted in the establishment of affiliated campuses, collaboration, partnerships, foreign student programs, English-medium programs and degrees, and other efforts. In the worldwide higher education context, efforts to monitor international projects and maintain quality are crucial,\u201d he stated.",

The Party is deeply saddened by this latest orgy of violence visited on our people which led to the loss of several lives with many others maimed and unquantified property destroyed in its wake.\n\n\u201cIt is disheartening that this dastardly act came at a time when the Plateau State government has been working round the clock to ensure the restoration of permanent peace in the troubled community and the state at large. These couriers of death and agents of destruction who attack the people at will must be trailed, apprehended and brought to face the full wrath of the law. This latest attack should be seen by the security agencies as a serious wake-up call, especially the 3rd Armoured Division of the Nigerian Army where these incessant attacks are embarrassingly perpetrated in its backyard.\n\n\u201cThe APC in Plateau state calls for greater synergy between and amongst the various security outfits in the state who have been adequately supported and equipped by the state government to protect the lives and property of the people of the state. We call on the entire good and peace-loving people of the state to cooperate with the state government in its efforts to stem the tide of attacks by these unwanted and wicked elements who sneak in the dark of the night to terrorise our people. The party frowns at the blame game of some notable politicians from the state, who instead of cooperating to collectively proffer solutions to these sad occurrences, choose to always throw needless blame on the state government.\u201d\n\nAlso, Gyang who is the Senator representing the area, through Musa Ashoms, his Special Assistant,\n\nMedia and Protocol said, \u201cThe latest terror attack on Te\u2019egbe village is an ugly development and a setback to the peace that was returning to Plateau North Senatorial District.\u201d\n\nThe statement reads in part, \u201cSenator Gyang expresses concern that the very persons responsible for previous attacks on Rigwe land and other communities in Plateau North are the same merchants of the dead that visited Yep\u2019egbe with terror, killing 10 persons, leaving several others with gunshot injuries in addition to houses burned and valuable properties destroyed. The Senator submits that the terrorists have been emboldened to undertake repeated attacks due to the inability of the government to give clear and definite orders to Operation Safe Haven to decisively engage the terrorists to end the cycle of attacks on peace-loving citizens and communities in Plateau North.\n\n\u201cSenator Gyang condemns the dastardly attacks and calls on the Operation Safe Haven Commander to take all necessary steps to secure law-abiding citizens and ensure that those behind the Yep\u2019egbe attacks are apprehended to face justice. Meanwhile, Senator Gyang is placing a demand on the state government to distribute the Relief Materials that were released by NEMA under the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs a few weeks back to victims of previous attacks in Plateau North to serve the purpose for which the request was made.\u201d Vanguard\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

The declaration was even backed by the order of the Court, but as you can see even the international community did not recognise FG\u2019s declaration on IPOB.\n\n\u201cSo it has failed to be effective or to achieve the desired results.\n\n\u201cThey have not been banned from travelling to other countries, while their citizenship remains intact; it has not been denounced. \u201cSo what type of declaration is that?\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope that Nigerians will not take the herdsmen as terrorists, but should regard the criminality of the few among them against innocent people as acts of terrorism just as we see IPOB and their attacks on security agencies and other northern citizens as acts of terrorism.\n\n\u201cVery few herdsmen are bandits if you go through their population.\n\n\u201cI hope this declaration will not give the licence to people to be profiling herdsmen in general as terrorists and taking laws into their hands against them.\n\n\u201cIt will cause more mayhem. The declaration will not change anything, it will not change the dynamics. Already the military is engaging them.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t stop them from kidnappings and killings. The declaration will not end their aggression against the society.\n\n\u2018It is a socio-political problem\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Fulani banditry is a socio-economic problem. We have seen it, we interacted widely with them.\n\n\u201cWe told the federal government the way out. It can only be won through engagement, dialogue and justice.\n\n\u201cThat is why today there is relative peace in the Niger Delta because government have accepted the painful reality of rehabilitating and empowering them.\n\n\u201cThere has to be equitable distribution of wealth in Nigeria and justice for every one.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to accept it. Before the issue of banditry that now affects all of us, the Fulani have suffered so much.\n\n\u201cThey have lost their legitimate means of livelihood; I mean their cows through cattle rustling and extortion by security agencies.\n\n\u201cThat has to be addressed as a means of genuine reconciliation and integration.

WHO explains that the variant has been detected at faster rates than in previous surges in infection, suggesting it \u201cmay have a growth advantage\u201d.\n\nThe experts have asked countries to enhance surveillance and genome sequencing efforts to better understand the variant.\n\nThere are also a number of studies underway and the agency\u2019s technical advisory group, known by the acronym TAG-VE, will continue to evaluate this variant. WHO will communicate new findings to Member States and to the public as needed.\n\nOn Wednesday, WHO\u2019s COVID-19 technical lead, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, said the information about the now \u2018Omicron\u2019 variant is still limited.\n\n\u201cThere are fewer than 100 whole genome sequences that are available, we don\u2019t know very much about this yet. What we do know is that this variant has a large number of mutations, and the concern is that when you have so many mutations it can have an impact on how the virus behaves\u201d, she said during a Q&A on Twitter.\n\nDr. Van Kerkhove explained that researchers are currently trying to determine where the mutations are and what they potentially mean for diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.\n\n\u201cIt will take a few weeks for us to understand what impact this variant has, there\u2019s a lot of work that is underway\u201d, she added.\n\nEarlier today, the UN health agency urged all countries to adopt a risk-based and scientific approach to travel bans linked to the new variant identified in South Africa and Botswana.\n\nMr. Van Kerkhove thanked researchers from these countries for openly sharing information to the UN health agency.\n\n\u201cEveryone out there: do not discriminate against countries that share their findings openly\u201d, she urged, as countries such as Britain, France and Israel have moved to cancel direct flights from South Africa and surrounding nations.\n\nAccording to South African health authorities so far, fewer than 100 cases of the new variant have been confirmed, largely among young people who have the lowest vaccination rate in the country.\n\n\u201cCountries can do a lot already in terms of surveillance and sequencing and work together with the affected countries or globally and scientifically to fight this variant and understand more about it so that we know how to go about\u2026so at this point implementing travel measures is being cautioned against\u201d, WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier told journalists in Geneva.",

          "title": "Abuja-Kaduna railroad passengers as endangered species",
          "text": "At a time the federal government is fighting hard to win the war against insecurity, hoodlums suspected to be kidnappers have resolved to strike on the Abuja-Kaduna railroad attacking travellers. KEHINDE OSASONA in this report reflects on the recent attacks.\n\nAlthough the report of bomb explosions along the Abuja-Kaduna train routes was initially denied by officials of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), it is no longer news that a number of Abuja -bound passengers penultimate week were rattled after they got a dose of the nightmares usually experienced by victims of attacks on the Abuja-Kaduna highway in the past.\n\nThe incident, said to have occurred in the night, involved a train which was heading to Riggasa train station after taking off from the Idu station in Abuja around 8pm.\n\nBlueprint Weekend gathered that the passengers had barely settled down for the about one and a half hour journey when a loud bang suspected to be caused by an explosion device suddenly shut down the train engine. The bomb planted by suspected terrorists reportedly hit their train, forcing it to derail at a distance meters.\n\nImmediately after the explosion, the train air-conditioning and lights were put off. This was reported followed by a rain of bullets which shattered the driver\u2019s windscreen, just as the police escorts, who were outnumbered, could only provide little resistance.\n\nNRC\u2019s explanations\n\nWhile confirming the attack, the managing director of the NRC, Engr. Fidet Okhiria, said the explosives damaged the rail tracks somewhere between Dutse and Rijana, in the Kaduna section of the corridor.\n\n\u201cYes, there was an explosive on our rail track somewhere around Rijana and Dutse last night, and this damaged the tracks. He however confirmed to newsmen that efforts are currently ongoing to ensure that the train services along the Kaduna-Abuja route are fully restored. Okhiria nevertheless denied reports making the rounds that gunshots were aimed at the train driver. According to him, \u201cThere was nothing like that; it was only an explosive that went up on the track.\u201d\n\nAlso confirming the incident, one of the passengers, a former lawmaker who represented Kaduna South, Senator Shehu Sani, was quoted as saying that the bandits did not only attack, they also planted an explosive that damaged the rail track and shattered the windshield of the train engine. \u201cThe train nearly skidded off its track, and then we miraculously escaped,\u201d he said.\n\nSani said further that they equally opened fire, targeting the driver, and the tank around Dutse and Rijana stations.\n\nNo one ever had any premonition that the railway transportation could as well be a target by bandits when the President Muhammadu Buhari administration was flagging off the project, but the unthinkable happened.\n\nWhile carrying out the commissioning some years back, the President noted that the project would impact on the lives of the Abuja residents as well as Kaduna state.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am delighted to be here today to commission the Abuja \u2013 Kaduna railway track and flag-off the Abuja-Kaduna train services (Passengers & Freight) on Nigeria\u2019s first ever Standard Gauge Rail track to go into operation. This project was conceived by a previous administration, started by the last government and I am pleased to complete and commission it.\n\n\u201cIt is our vision and hopes that those good old days will soon be back with us and indeed in a more prosperous way with the restoration of the rail transport system which today\u2019s occasion symbolises.\n\n\u201cThe construction of the Abuja-Kaduna Standard Gauge rail track commenced in 2009 and happily, sixteen years after, we are on the threshold of presenting to Nigerians a Standard Gauge Railway Train Service that will be safe, fast and reliable.\n\n\u201cI wish to also reassure Nigerians that due attention will be placed on pursuing the 25-Year Strategic Railway Master Plan which is aimed at rehabilitating the existing 3,505km narrow gauge rail line and developing and constructing new standard gauge rail lines across the country.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate the symbolic return of rail service today I wish to reiterate the commitment of this Administration to pursue with greater vigour and determination rehabilitation and construction of other rail lines including the major Lagos-Calabar and Kano-Lagos lines. As we get down to work, I look forward to flagging off many more lines outlined in our transport policy programme.\u201d\n\nWhile sharing his experience, a commuter, Shuaib Gidado, told this reporter that despite the unfortunate incident, he would still stick to the railway means of transportation.\n\nAccording to him, the railway transportation, especially the new Abuja-Kaduna route, remains one of the best things that have happened to commuters plying the Abuja-Kaduna road and who now see it as their best alternative.\n\n\u201cConsidering nasty experiences on the Kaduna road where people again lost their lives recently, I still think it\u2019s the best and I will still ply it. Insecurity, explosion though becoming something else especially the explosion incident of last month, I hope something would be done to allay commuters fears,\u201d Gidado said.\n\nLikewise, another commuter who plies the Abuja-Kaduna road on a regular basis, Engr. Olabiyi Teniola, expressed concerns over the attacks and urged the government to ensure passengers\u2019 safety on the route. He also called the various security agencies to scale up their surveillance to stem the scourge.\n\n\u201cWe no longer feel safe. These bandits are becoming more daring. We can only hope and pray that the authorities would be proactive and checkmate activities of these people before they overrun Abuja.\n\n\u201cIs it that Nigerians are now at the mercy of these blood-thirsty gunmen? It is high time our government took the bull by the horns so that what happened some years back when bombers invaded Abuja will not repeat itself,\u201d Teniola said.\n\nFG\u2019s assurances\n\nBut allaying commuters fears after the incident, the federal government pledged its readiness to do the needful in order to protect the citizens.\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, gave the assurance during his visit to the site. According to him, the federal government was going to procure digital security system for regular monitoring of railway corridors to avert another incident track bombing.\n\nHe added that the government would in next to no time approve the installation of a digital security system to address future challenges of breach of security.\n\n\u201cWhat is significant is that the work was done by Nigerians in record time and by tomorrow (Saturday), we expect to run the first train.\n\n\u201cApart from this (Wednesday explosion), there has not been any security challenge before now. What this has done to us will fasten the procurement of the digital security system that we are trying to put in place. We took it to the cabinet two weeks ago, and it was returned. We will take it again to ensure we get approval so we can install it.\n\n\u201cThe essence of the security system is to enable us to know if there is an impact on the censor. We will try to get the police involved before we install the security system.\n\n\u201cI may not be happy that the security breach took place but what we have been able to show is that we actually have the capacity to fix our rail. The essence of this is that by the time we leave, we should start getting people who can construct our railways. What they (local engineers) have shown is that if they can fix this, they should be able to construct some kilometres of rail. But we have to test them gradually,\u201d he said.",

Foreign citizens will be banned from Canada if they have been to the seven nations in the past 14 days.\n\nThe Omicron variant was first reported to the WHO from South Africa on 24 November, and has since been identified in other countries.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s health ministry has criticised the rush to impose new travel restrictions, calling them \u201cdraconian\u201d, and contrary to WHO guidance.\n\nScientists say they still have much to learn about the virus\u2019s new mutations, and the WHO has said it will take a few weeks to understand the impact of the new variant, as experts work to determine how transmissible it is.\n\nThe WHO on Friday said preliminary evidence suggested the new variant carried a higher risk of reinfection than other variants.\n\nScientists have said it is the most heavily mutated version yet, which means Covid vaccines, which were designed using the original strain from Wuhan, China, may not be as effective.\n\nThe WHO says so far fewer than 100 sample sequences have been reported. Cases have mainly been confirmed in South Africa, but have also been detected in Hong Kong, Israel, Botswana and Belgium.\n\nMost of the cases in South Africa have been from its most populated province, Gauteng, of which Johannesburg is the capital city.\n\nThe WHO has warned against countries hastily imposing travel restrictions, saying they should look to a \u201crisk-based and scientific approach\u201d.\n\nSouth African Health Minister Joe Phaahla told reporters that the flight bans against the country were \u201cunjustified\u201d.\n\nBut health officials in the Netherlands warned that passengers on two KLM flights from South Africa to Amsterdam on Friday were likely infected. Tests were being done to determine whether it could be the new variant.\n\nPassengers travelling from Cape Town to Manchester via Amsterdam told the BBC that they were held on the tarmac at Schiphol Airport in the Dutch capital for four hours, before eventually disembarking to take PCR tests.\n\nMeanwhile, the flight bans threaten to separate families over the festive season.\n\nRuth Daines-Slack, 70, had booked to fly from Cape Town to the UK next week for Christmas and her mother\u2019s 100th birthday celebration. She told the BBC she is \u201cbeyond devastated\u201d that she will no longer be able to make the trip, adding that the UK\u2019s travel ban is a \u201cknee-jerk reaction\u201d.",
          "summary": "The US will restrict travel from South Africa and seven other southern African countries to try to contain a new coronavirus variant spreading there.\nThis follows a similar flight ban imposed by the EU and the UK.\nUS officials said flights from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi will be blocked, mirroring earlier moves taken by the EU.\nThe Omicron variant was first reported to the WHO from South Africa on 24 November, and has since been identified in other countries.\nMost of the cases in South Africa have been from its most populated province, Gauteng, of which Johannesburg is the capital city.",

          "text": "\u201cIn recognition of the role improved infrastructure could play in the development of our economy, along with the need to leverage private sector capital in funding the over N35 trillion deficit, which is the estimated amount required to build an efficient infrastructure ecosystem in Nigeria, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) working in partnership with critical stakeholders such as the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) and African Finance Corporation (AFC) set up Infracorp. Infracorp is expected to raise over N15 trillion to support investment in critical infrastructure in Nigeria.\n\nOn the exchange rate management, he added: \u201cAs a result of our demand management policy, the naira has remained largely stable around N411/US$1 at the I&E window particularly since the discontinuation of FX allocation to Bureau De Change operators along with the convergence between the CBN and NAFEX rates. Banks are now able to meet the demands of their customers seeking forex for SMEs, school fees, medical and PTAs, which has reduced the need of customers to rely on alternative providers of foreign exchange. Average daily Fx turnover at the I&E window is now over $250 million, up from $40 million in April 2020.\u201d\n\nOver the next two months, Infracorp will kick off its operations by targeting strategic infrastructure projects that would help catalyse further growth of our economy. Infracorp is expected to set the standard template that will help in enabling greater private sector funding for public infrastructure projects in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo far, N1 trillion has been provided as seed funds by the promoters to support the operations of Infracorp. We recently appointed four fund managers, and a Management Team has been selected to run and manage Infracorp.\n\nHe further noted that Nigeria\u2019s external reserves are supported by our demand management policy and that in addition to support from the successful issuance of the $4bn Eurobond and the IMF SDR, our external reserves today stands at over $41.4bn which is enough to support 9 months of imports.\n\nHe noted that this is just a morale booster for both foreign direct and portfolio investors willing to invest in the economy, but it provides significant fire power to support our domestic industries that need to import critical machines and equipment for domestic production and exports.\n\nFurthermore on his 2022 policy focus he added: \u201cI would like to state that notwithstanding these positive indicators, our economic growth remains fragile, as our unemployment and inflation rate remain at levels that are not very supportive of growth. Second, continued implementation of our intervention efforts would need to be undertaken to sustain the recovery efforts and stimulate further growth of the economy. Third, given population growth at about 2.7 per cent annually, it is important that we continue to deploy measures that will enable our economy to attain annual growth rates of over five per cent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough the pandemic we are aware that our policy responses are often more effective when we work with the private sector. For example, the CACOVID alliance played an instrumental role in reducing the negative effects of the pandemic, by providing palliative support to families affected by the virus and in rebuilding our healthcare institutions. \u201cLeveraging the strength of the private sector will be critical in mobilising funds that are needed toward building a more resilient and stronger economy. We intend to strengthen collaborations with the private sector in order to support investments in critical sectors such as infrastructure, and ICT, in addition to ongoing efforts to build a stronger agriculture and manufacturing base in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a result, all efforts in 2022 must be made to ensure that we maintain our focus on improving access to finance and credit for households and businesses, mobilising investment to boost domestic productivity, enabling faster growth of non-oil exports, and supporting employment generating activities,\u201d he added.\n\nNume Ekeghe",

          "text": "The World Trade Organization (WTO) became the first major diplomatic casualty of the new coronavirus variant on Friday when it postponed its first ministerial meeting in four years due to the deteriorating health situation.\n\nMinisters from WTO members were due to have gathered next week for a meeting widely seen as a test of the WTO\u2019s relevance.\n\nThe WTO said that its members had agreed late on Friday to postpone the ministerial conference after the new variant outbreak led to travel restrictions that would have prevented many ministers from reaching Geneva.\n\nNo new date has been set for a rescheduled meeting.\n\nThe World Health Organisation has classified the B.1.1.529variant detected in South Africa as a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d, saying it may spread more quickly than other forms of the virus. Scientists are also seeking to find out if it is vaccine-resistant.\n\nSwitzerland, home to the WTO, on Friday banned direct flights from South Africa and the surrounding region, and imposed test and quarantine requirements on travel from other countries, including Belgium, Hong Kong and Israel.\n\nThe Geneva-based trade body had planned a meeting in person, but the new restrictions meant delegations of large players such as South Africa and the Brussels-based European Commission would have been limited to a largely virtual presence.\n\nEven before the postponement the prospects were not bright.\n\nThe WTO has only managed one update of its global rules in its near 27-year history, the red tape-cutting Trade Facilitation Agreement, and its 164 members looked far from agreement in its most active talks \u2013 on curbing fishing subsidies and spreading COVID-19 vaccines more widely.\n\nIndia, South Africa and other developing countries are calling for a waiver of intellectual property (IP) rights for vaccines and other COVID-19 treatments. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday he supported a waiver for vaccines.\n\nWTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said the postponement did not mean negotiations should stop.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, delegations in Geneva should be fully empowered to close as many gaps as possible. This new variant reminds us once again of the urgency of the work we are charged with,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nSantiago Wills, the Colombian WTO ambassador who chairs the fishing subsidy talks, said the news was \u201cdeflating, to say the least\u201d, but pledged to keep working towards an agreement to save global fish stocks.",

One weapon was recovered, Andrews told reporters at a briefing afterward.\n\nA department store employee who was working at the time of shooting told WRAL-TV, based in nearby Raleigh, that he counted six gunshots that rang out through the mall, triggering a stampede of Black Friday shoppers running for the nearest exit.\n\n\u201cA lot of people started running my way, and once I heard all six rapidly, I started to run, too,\u201d he told the TV station.\n\nThe Streets at Southpoint mall was locked down and evacuated as law enforcement swept through the shopping center.\n\nA short time earlier across the country, security officer shot a man suspected of trying to steal merchandise from a Walmart store during an altercation in the eastern Washington town of Kennewick, police said.\n\nThe shooting occurred when the suspect, confronted as he was leaving the store, pointed a gun at the officer. The officer then drew his own weapon and opened fire at the suspect, who fled the scene but was arrested at a nearby home, according to police.\n\nThe suspect, taken to an area hospital for treatment of his wounds, was already wanted on nine outstanding warrants and now faces additional robbery and assault charges, police said in a statement.\n\nNo one else was injured at the Walmart.
