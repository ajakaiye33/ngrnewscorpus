          "text": "Members of a host community in Isoko land of Delta State have given a 14-day ultimatum to oil companies operating in the community to peacefully shutdown operations and begin to address their demands with immediate effect.\n\nThe youth group of the community, under the aegis of the United Coalition Front Emancipation Movement, who felt marginalised, said if the oil companies failed to accede to their requests, they would launch attacks on their installations in Isoko land.\n\nThis was contained in a statement issued by the group and signed by its spokesman, Mr Ogbu Ogbu, which was made available to journalists in Warri on Tuesday.\n\nThe group had last month threatened to launch coordinated attacks on oil and gas flow stations, pipelines, trunk line and other equipment if the companies refused to heed to their demands which included the engagement of Isoko youths into the onshore and offshore platforms of the oil companies.\n\nOther demands included the promotion of the few Isoko sons and daughters working with the companies into management positions, as well as intensive training of the people on various skills acquisition programmes.\n\nThe group also called for the establishment of an Isoko Ethnic Nationality Regional Development Commission, for the fast and efficient human capacity development of Isoko youths.\n\nThe statement from the aggrieved youths read in part, \u201cWe want the operators of OML 61, 30, 26 and 28 to peacefully shutdown operations in Isoko land, while our grievances are attended to in a round table discussion.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Petroleum Development Company, Nigeria Agip Oil Company, Heritage Energy, Shell Petroleum Development Company and First Hydro should peacefully shutdown their operations in Isoko and comply with our demands.\n\n\u201cOil and gas multinational companies and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation operating in Isoko land should heed to our warning and advice for a peaceful shutdown of operations till further notice.\n\n\u201cUCFEM will not be blamed for any action taken for the protection of her existence as a people and for the defence of Isoko land.\n\n\u201cTo this end, a 14-day ultimatum has been issued against the oil companies to comply with the peaceful shutdown of oil and gas operations in Isoko and the ultimatum comes into effect from April 11 till April 24, 2022.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Community Relations Officer of Heritage Energy, Mr Williams, stated, \u201cWe are not allowed to discuss issues like this with the press. We have our media consultant based in Lagos State who handles issues like this.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "FG, World bank-assisted solar system installation for 5m households begin in Abia",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Steve Oko\n\nThe World Bank in collaboration with the Federal Government through the Niger Delta Power Holding Company, NDPHC, has commenced the installation of solar systems in 5000 households in Abia.\n\nThe initiative was introduced to provide 24-hour uninterrupted solar power to 5 million households in Nigeria off the national grid, according to NDPHC representative, Mr Chinonso Ugwueke, an Engineer who led the team for the installation to Abia.\n\nHe said that the lawmaker representing Aba South State constituency in the Abia State House of Assembly, Hon. Obinna Ichita, who attracted the project to Abia had already paid for 3000 solar systems that would be installed in people\u2019s homes within his constituency free of charge.\n\nAddressing traditional rulers in Aba South, Mr Ibrahim Usman, the Regional Manager of A-Solar Systems, the firm in charge of the installations, said that the initiative was in furtherance of goal seven of the Sustainable Development Goal, SDG.\n\nHe said that the target was to provide affordable and accessible electricity off the national grid for rural and semi-urban communities.\n\nUsman said that apart from providing subsidized uninterrupted solar power to the people, 1000 youths from the constituency would be engaged in the installation and maintenance after free training by the firm.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Hon. Ichita said that renewable energy had the potential to meet the energy needs of rural communities, especially at a time the national grid had almost collapsed.\n\nHe said it would provide opportunity for \u201cunserved and underserved\u201d communities in his constituency to overcome their power challenge through solar energy.\n\nIchita said that renewable energy had the capacity to provide a constant power supply for households and businesses which would, in turn, boost socio-economic development in rural areas.\n\n\u201d When I discovered the opportunity through my contacts, I felt I should not waste time in bringing it down to my constituents considering the economic importance of Aba.\n\n\u201d The intention is to provide a 24-hour steady supply of power off and national grid using solar technology that is not only efficient but environmentally friendly.\n\n\u201d Besides constant power supply, 1000 youths will be taken off the street and employed along the solar technology value chain.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker explained that the World Bank in conjunction with the Central Bank, Rural Electrification Agency and other stakeholders were behind the project.\n\nHon. Ichita added that the constant power outages and collapse of the national grid underscored the necessity of the project.\n\nThe opposition lawmaker urged the State Government to key into the project and extend it to other parts of the state.\n\nIn a remark, the Chairman of Aba South Council of Traditional Rulers, HRM, Eze Ibe Enyeazu, expressed delight over the project, which he said was a huge relief to the power challenges of the people.\n\nAssuring that communities in the council would give maximum support for the success of the project, the monarch commended the lawmaker for the gesture which he said would end the power challenge of many households in rural communities.",

It is about 10.85kms.\n\n\u201cThis was a road awarded sometimes in 2010 during the time of late Hon. Sam Obi, but was abandoned over time and was later repudiated,\u201dhe said.\n\nAccording to him, Exco also, approved the construction of landing jetty at kolofiagbene in Bomadi, adding that Exco equally approved the construction of a new office accommodation for the State Civil Service Commission.\n\nHe stated that Exco approved the appointment of a Financial Adviser on a proposal which, according to him, is requesting the state government to be part of the establishment of a manufacturing facility that would be responsible for the coalition and production of nails.\n\nThe Commissioner disclosed that there is a factory sited at somewhere in Isele-Azagba, which has been in the business of producing nails, pointing out that the company wants to take advantage of the Free Trade Zone in Kwale.\n\nWhile saying that the company wants the government to provide other enabling environment, Aniagwu said \u201cwe are also considering that if it scales through, we would not hesitate to participate under Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement.\n\n\u201cSo, we have approved a Financial Adviser to advise the government on the viability of this particular investment.\n\n\u201cYou also do know that we will be hosting the National Sports Festival in November, this year hence, Exco has approved the upgrade of a number of sports facilities, including hostels to accommodate the athletes.\n\n\u201cWe have tried to situate some of the sports facilities in schools in order for these facilities to still be useful after the sports festival. Exco has approved the upgrade of a hockey pitch at Okpanam.\u201d\n\nOn why herdsmen were still moving round the state with their cattle after the anti-open grazing laws was signed into law, the Commissioner said the state government was finetunning its strategies to bring to an end such illegal act.\n\nHe, therefore, sued for the collaboration of all in fastracking development in urban and rural communities.",

          "title": "2023: Emir of Dutse endorses Amaechi for President",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Dirisu Yakubu\n\nThe aspiration of the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi for the Office of the President on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC, got a boost yesterday as the Emir of Dutse, Alhaji Nuhu Mohammadu Sanusi described him as the best man for the job.\n\nThe Emir who made the remarks at his Palace in Dutse, Jigawa State, Tuesday, said his convictions were predicated on the Minister\u2019s performances both as a former Governor and as a Minister.\n\nThe Emir said, \u201cHe is an honest man, and whatever you say about him, you cannot change the fact that he is an honest man. He is a confident person. Wherever you see him, you know he is the meaning of total confidence.\n\n\u201cThese are qualities of leadership. These are things that we need in a leader, especially today. He is resilient. If Amaechi wants to achieve something, by whatever means, he will find a way to get it done, because he is a communicator. This is why I have endorsed him. I have high regard for him and I have confidence in his executive capacity. He is fully competent, being a speaker twice. He is most qualified.\u201d\n\nThe first-class traditional ruler recalled that Amaechi as Governor of Rivers State fought insecurity to a standstill and also improved the fortunes of his people.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we are always carried away by tribal, political and other issues but here is a Nigerian that I know. Amaechi is a true Nigerian who is detribalized. He provided a place for Muslims to worship in Rivers state which I understand has been destroyed after he left. He endured all the humiliations targeted at making the Muslims feel unwanted in Port Harcourt, and I also know that God will reward him.\n\n\u201cIn this country, we are faced with distress, and part of it is by our own making, not the government. What are these issues? Job opportunities, fighting corruption, Infrastructural development and social vices such as armed robbery, banditry and so on. These are the problems that are facing our country today. My knowledge and understanding of this gentleman, Chief Rotimi Amaechi, Minister of Transportation is that he has what it takes to fight insurgency. He did mention that when he was governor, there was criminality and other vices and he was able to control it.\n\n\u201cI am sure he would do this better now if he becomes the President. With all the resources available, he would use it to fight insurgency and other vices that are affecting us, particularly here in the North.\n\n\u201cHe is a bridge-builder and he is a man who is always meeting people. About 16 years ago, this Council decided to adopt children from Rivers state, particularly from his local government area, Ikwerre. We adopted the 16 children, put them in school with my own children, most of them are graduates, some are married now, and when I told him, he was very grateful and I have high regard for him and I have confidence in his capabilities. He knows what to do, he is not a new hand, and he won\u2019t bother himself buying houses and building houses.\n\nHe continued: \u201cWhen I heard about the train going to Maradi, I called Amaechi to ask why the train was not passing through Dutse, and he told me that he would do something about it. And this gentleman, three months later was able to get the approval for Dutse to be included in the Kano-Maradi rail line. This is the Rotimi Amaechi that I know, and I hope you will come back like you brought Buhari two times here to campaign for him, we hope the next visit will be when you clinch the seat,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Transportation Minister Chibuike Amaechi said he was at the Emir\u2019s Palace to solicit the support of the Emir and people of Dutse and Jigawa state in the forthcoming APC Presidential primaries. Amaechi assured the Emir that if given the support, he would see to the commencement of the Kano-Maradi rail project which also goes through Dutse.\n\n\u201cWe have been friends since I was a governor and it continued till date. I have a lot of connections with Jigawa. Therefore, I will not commence my activity, my search to seek the support of Nigerians to vote for me to be the President without coming to Jigawa to see you and the people of Jigawa state support me,\u201d he said.",

One of the suggestions to make government take action was a three day strike which will lead to shutting down the economy in solidarity with the unions.\u201d\n\nAsked when the CWC meeting will be held, the source said no date has been fixe",

          "text": "The Delta State Branch of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights, CDHR, today said a majority of Nigeria\u2019s security personnel are into drug trafficking in the country.\n\nDelta State CDHR Chairman, Comrade A.P. Edariese made the statement during a chat with our correspondent shortly after the CDHR, in collaboration with the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, sensitized youths against drug abuse in Warri.\n\nHe said, \u201cMajority of our senior police officers, army officers, naval officers, airforce officers, customs officers, majority of them are into these. It is the one that\u2019s caught that is a criminal.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that embattled DCP Abba Kyari was used as a scapegoat, he said, \u201cIf a thorough investigation is allowed to be carried out, you will hardly find up to 40 percent of officers who are not involved in drugs.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNigerians have delight in becoming a force man, police top brass, an army officer, the navy and others. By that, they\u2019ve secured protection against arrest, against any form of justice against them. So, they use that acquired status to encourage drug trafficking.\n\n\u201cBecause they know if they load their vehicle with drugs, nobody will check them. They\u2019re even the major carriers.\n\n\u201cPoliticians who blare sirens when they\u2019re moving, they use their vehicle to carry drugs and when they want to discharge them, it is the youths that they use to discharge them who now see them and have a taste of it.\n\n\u201cIf drug abuse must be reduced,every sector of the country must have to purge themselves.\u201d\n\nEdariese appealed to Nigerian leaders and politicians to go back to the fear of God and the laws they enacted with a view to pondering its implications just as he lamented that the youths are also being used by politicians for drug trafficking.\n\nHe said drugs and poverty are the main influencers of insecurity in the nation today.\n\nHe added that youths become emboldened no matter the gravity of the crime either heinous or otherwise.\n\n\u201cWhen they take the drug, they don\u2019t even value human beings and so they can take lives at will because, at that stage of being drugged, they don\u2019t know the difference between human beings and an animal. So, they take pleasure in slaughtering human beings. And so, the insecurity is a product of drug abuse in our Nigerian youths. Moreover, poverty is also an influencer of drug abuse.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s situation does not allow a person to have what to do. Those who finished university, they have no jobs, those who learn skills have no money to establish themselves. They\u2019re roaming the streets.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re easily captured by peer groups who are criminals already and they become indoctrinated. When they take the drugs, they now know that committing crime is being celebrated in Nigeria more than being hard working.\u201d\n\nHe said for drug abuse to be eradicated in Nigeria, many sectors have to be purged.\n\nHe said the majority of the politicians are cultists saying they take drugs and they send the youths to procure the same for them.\n\n\u201cThey give them cover and in bringing them to them. The youths now know the use of the drugs and enter into using them.\n\n\u201cThose who do kidnapping at the point of kidnapping, they\u2019ve lost the human sense in them. So, even if it is their father they kidnap, they don\u2019t bother. These are some of the issues.\n\n\u201cFor drug abuse to be eliminated in our society, the politicians, those who are ruling us should go back to the drawing board and turn back from that filthy way,\u201d he said.\n\nEdariese said the programme is timely. He said the CDHR deem it necessary to be proactive to be the first of its kind throughout Nigeria.\n\nHe said they sensitized the youths who are the most affected to be beware and take care of all they do as it relates to drugs.\n\nHe stressed that the consequences of the effects of drug abuse are becoming more obvious and disturbing in society.\n\nWhile noting that the effects of drug abuse are physical, psychological, social and economic, Comrade Edariese said the consequences of the abuse have led to the brain, kidney, liver damage, hypertension, excessive heartbeats, chronic bleeding, damage to unborn babies, impaired vision, sleeplessness, anxiety, depression, Psychosis, impaired judgement, terrorism, loss of job, family disintegration, expulsion from school, delinquency, criminal offences and others.\n\nHe said some of the drugs commonly abused are cannabis(hemp), alcohol, cocaine, heroin, codeine, tramadol, inhalant methamphetamine etc.\n\nMeanwhile, the Delta State Command of the NDLEA has commended the CDHR for being the catalyst for holding its first sensitization on the newly launched War Against Drug Abuse, WADA in the Country.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari launched the WADA programme in 2021.",

We the patriotic elders\u2019 network perceive some of these words by the reverend as negatively inclined thoughts that are determined to upset and agitate the peace and unity of the nation.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria has been facing these difficult challenges for over 30 years, yet the reverend is keen on vocally, confidently voicing out his opinion by subjecting these problems to these recent years. These certain ideologies of his are backed by people with similar interests as him, who are inclined towards frightening and pushing others with less social or religious knowledge which in return intensifies the tension in the country.\n\n\u201cWithin our different social status in the country, be it a religious leader, politician, Business people, Government employees or learned individuals, we are collectively aware of the societal structure of the developed countries. Their societies are efficiently driven by social development, adequate security, trust, citizen responsibility, discipline and law & order.\u201d\n\nThe elders believe that rather than consistently criticizing the government, Kukah should champion more modified ways that Nigeria would get out of the woods it is in today.\n\n\u201cHowever, as a religious head, you occasionally perpetuate and magnify our problems to a certain exaggerated level that conveys a negative message which in return displays you as a trouble advocate.\n\n\u201cOur reasons, the Elders said are that You are consistently on a mission to spread out negativity, hopelessness, disunity, and pessimism towards the country.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has approved the release of 40,000 metric tons of various grains from the Strategic Grains Reserve (SGR) to cushion the effect of high food prices in the country.\n\nMinister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Abubakar Mahmud, said President Muhammadu Buhari gave the directive after he summoned him to the State House, Abuja.\n\nHe said the Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development Ministry would handle the distribution of 12,000 metric tons. He added that the same precess deployed during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 to distribute 70,000 metric tons of assorted food items across some states and the Federal Capital Territory would be used.\n\nHe said in compliance with the presidential directive, grains were readily available for immediate distribution.\n\nBriefing State House Correspondents of the meeting with Buhari said: \u201cHe actually directed and approved the release of grains from our strategic grain reserve by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.\n\n\u201cThis is to cushion the effect of some of the issues we are facing with high prices of commodities across the country and also to cushion these festivities; Ramadan, Easter, Salah so that there will be a little cushion for the people during these festivities.\u201d\n\nAsked the type of grains to be released and the locations of the reserved, Mahmud said: \u201cAssorted grains. Usually we have sorghum, maize, millet and the rest of them, we will be releasing an assortment of grains that are in our reserves.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

There\u2019s still food, and people are still cultivating in all parts of the country.\n\n\u201cSome of the areas where it has some security implication, yes, it may have a little drop, but government is doing everything humanly possible to make sure production continues in other parts and even areas where there are issues, the government is doing whatever it takes.\n\n\u201cLike in the Ministry of Agriculture, we have Agro Rangers that sometimes provide some kind of security cover that will make sure food production does not stop. I can assure you we don\u2019t have problems with food production at this point.\u201d\n\nAsked if there was a list of beneficiaries, he said: \u201cIf you remember very well, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. President also directed and approved the release of grains, the grains were released and distributed. So, those structures of distribution, both from the humanitarian and ministry of agriculture, the same structures that we used. However, whatever you do, take a look, and ask, is there any area for improvement? Is there any area that you can change and restructure? We\u2019ll take that into consideration and distribute the grains as was done in the past?\u201d\n\nOn allegations that the Federal Government gives more support to agriculture in the North than in the South, Mahmud said: \u201cYou talked about the government not giving adequate attention to agriculture in the South. No, that\u2019s not true. That\u2019s far from the truth. In the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, we have programmes, all kinds of programmes across the country; North, South and Central. So, this is not true.\u201d\n\nOn how the Russian invasion of Ukraine has affected the importation of wheat, he said: \u201cThe Russian/Ukraine conflict is an issue of concern. As a result of that, Mr. President has directed that we sit and discuss and not just the Ministry of Agriculture, but\n\nNational Agricultural Land Development Authority (NALDA), NCFI, all those that are concerned, the Central Bank. We have met about two to three times to discuss the issue of Ukraine. Nigeria imports grains and other agricultural input from Ukraine, we are making sure we look inwards and outwards to ensure this conflict does not affect our agricultural sector.\u201d",

          "text": "\u202278 given mass burial amid fear of further attacks\n\n\u2022Defend yourselves, ECWA charges Nigerians\n\nSeriki Adinoyi\n\n\n\nBloodthirsty terrorists have killed 80 persons and abducted 70 others after an invasion of some communities in Plateau State. The villages, which were attacked on Sunday, included Kukawa, Gyambawu, Dungur, Kyaram, Yelwa, Dadda, Wanka, Shuwaka, Gwammadaji, and Dadin Kowa.\n\nRegrettably, while terrorists soiled the state in blood and danger, Plateau State Governor, Mr. Simon Lalong, was busy in Abuja holding political meetings with a former Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Bola Tinubu, over the latter\u2019s presidential ambition. Observers said this was a reflection of the growing insensitivity of the country\u2019s political leaders.\n\nAs the security situation across the country continued to deteriorate, with lives and livelihoods being helplessly ruined, the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) charged Nigerians to defend themselves from attackers. The charge was contained in a communiqu\u00e9 by ECWA President, Rev. Stephen Panya, and General Secretary, Rev. Yunusa Nmadu, at the end of the 69th General Church Council meeting held at the church headquarters in Jos, Plateau State.\n\nLalong, it was gathered, was the only governor that attended the presidential declaration by Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Amaechi, on Saturday.\n\nAs the governor was attending meetings with Tinubu, alongside other governors, 78 victims of the terrorist attack on the villages in Kanam Local Government Area were being buried in mass graves in their respective communities amid wailing by loved ones and the villagers. Lalong sat pretty at Kebbi Governor\u2019s Lodge to listen to Tinubu speak on his presidential interest.\n\nSome of the residents of the communities, who escaped the attacks, expressed worries that terrorists now lived around them, and called on the government and security agencies to come to their rescue.\n\nOne resident, who preferred anonymity for security reasons, said, \u201cIt is sad that innocent persons were killed without any form of provocation. We no longer feel safe in our homes and communities. We appeal to President Muhammadu Buhari, Governor Simon Lalong, and security operatives to come to our rescue.\u201d\n\nThe villagers narrated that the terrorists invaded their communities on motor bikes in large numbers and shot sporadically, killing and maiming residents of seven communities.\n\nThough presence of security forces has increased, villagers were however seen fleeing the communities for fear of subsequent attacks.\n\nIndigenes in the villages that were attacked said they recovered over 80 corpses from the attacks, adding that more corpses were still being recovered from the neighbouring bushes.\n\nA source from the communities, Mr. Fanya Ali, said, 70 persons might have been abducted, as their whereabouts remained unknown. Ali added that at least 80 houses were burnt.\n\nAli said 36 persons were killed in Kukawa, 27 in Gyambau, 11 in Wanka, and eight in Kyaram. He added that the figures from the other villages were yet to be obtained.\n\nAccording to Ali, many of the injured victims have been admitted at Dengi General Hospital and Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH).\n\nAnother eyewitness, Sariki Bitrus, said many women and children were missing, fearing the terrorists may have abducted them. Bitrus lamented that the people were in dire need of assistance as they have been displaced from their homes.\n\nLamenting the attack, Plateau Elders Forum, in a statement signed by Mr. Jonathan Ishaku, said it was shocked by the heinous assault on the innocent people of Kanam Local Government Area.\n\nIshaku stated, \u201cJust within a week of our press release, in which we condemned terrorist attacks on Miango villages in Bassa Local Government Area and Rantis in Barkin Ladi Local Government Area, bandits have allegedly killed several persons, wounded many and abducted over 70 in Kanam Local Government Area yesterday.\n\n\u201cThis is again very sad and we strongly condemn it. This seeming escalation of violence on our communities further justifies the earlier call the Plateau Elders Forum made on the Plateau State Government, in conjunction with the security forces, to deal drastically with terrorists in the state.\n\n\u201cThe security forces should ensure the immediate rescue of all abducted persons.\u201d\n\nThe member representing Pankshin/Kanke/Kanam Federal Constituency of Plateau State in the House of Representatives, Mr. Yusuf Adamu Gagdi, described the attack as an annihilation scheme. Gagdi commiserated with the victims.\n\nThe lawmaker, who was in Madina for lesser Hajj, called for immediate military presence in the affected communities and those bordering them in order to arrest the surging activities of bandits in his constituency. He expressed worry over the federal government\u2019s negligence and failure to provide security for Plateau communities, despite intelligence reports by the Department of State Services (DSS) about the influx of criminal elements into the state and some neighbouring states.\n\nGagdi stated, \u201cThe federal government, which has exclusive control of security apparatus in the country, has woefully failed in its primary responsibility of protecting lives and property of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHe expressed outrage at the devastating state of security in the country, arguing that somebody has been negligent in the discharge of his duties to Nigerians. He maintained that it was high time the federal government owned up to its inability to discharge this sacrosanct duty it owed Nigerians.\n\nGagdi advised citizens within the boundary communities, particularly in Wase and Kanam local government areas of the state, to be on the alert, as fleeing bandits from Zamfara and other North-west states had been traced to camps within the forests in the local government areas.\n\nMeanwhile, the Plateau State government, in a statement yesterday warned that the state would not be a haven for terrorists and other criminals fleeing from other parts of the country. The statement quoted Lalong as urging the security agencies to go after the terrorists.\n\nThe statement signed by Lalong\u2019s media aide, Makut Macham, said the governor expressed regrets over the dastardly act, saying he has directed security forces to dominate the area after their initial response that put a stop to the carnage.\n\nIt said the State Security Council had adopted far-reaching measures to strengthen security by enhancing the capacity of the security agencies to respond to all situations that cause a breach of the peace in any part of the state.\n\nThe statement also said Lalong sympathised with the communities affected, and promised them justice, saying those behind the attacks would not be allowed to go without punishment. He directed the State Emergency Management Agency and the Peace Building Agency to immediately visit the affected areas, assess the situation, and provide relief as well as trauma management.\n\nThe governor added that the state had already approached the federal government for collaboration to deal with the terrorists hibernating in the general area, once and for all, to enable people go about their legitimate businesses without molestation and harassment.\n\nThe spokesman of the state Police Command, Mr. Ubah Gabriel, said the police could not confirm the figure of casualties at the moment. Gabriel said, \u201cOur men have been there since yesterday combing the forests around affected communities. I would give you the full details of the casualties as soon as get it.\u201d\n\nDefend Yourselves, ECWA Charges Nigerians\n\nAmid the deteriorating security situation across the country, the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) charged Nigerians to defend themselves from attackers. This was contained in a communiqu\u00e9 signed by ECWA President, Rev. Stephen Panya, and General Secretary, Rev. Yunusa Nmadu, at the end of the 69th General Church Council meeting held at the church headquarters in Jos, the Plateau State capital.\n\nOn the unremitting killings and abductions of citizens in Kaduna, Kebbi, Zanfara, Plateau, Niger and other states of the country, ECWA called on government to arrest the situation.\n\nIt decried the failure of government to carry out its constitutional responsibility of securing the lives and property of its citizens, despite the huge amounts being spent on security. ECWA called on all tiers of government to do all they could to secure the release of innocent citizens still being held by terrorists and bandits across Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the council, \u201cit is very worrisome that Nigeria today has continued to witness the increasing activities of radical Islamic terrorist groups, which include Fulani Jihadist militia, Boko Haram, ISWAP, and bandits terrorising the country under the watch of this government, and government is not doing enough to stop it, It\u2019s really unfortunate.\u201d\n\nIn the communiqu\u00e9, the church expressed worry over the deplorable condition of infrastructure in the country as well as forceful occupation of ancestral lands by terrorists. It called on government to ensure that Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) returned to their homes and given farming tools to enable them continue their occupations.\n\nThe council also called on government to intensify efforts towards salvaging Nigeria, adding that the rising wave of corruption and the near total collapse of the economy has left Nigerians struggling for survival.\n\nThe church called on the federal government and striking labour unions, especially the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and Non-academic Staff Union of Education and Associated Institutions (NASU), to put the interest of the nation first and resolve the industrial crisis as soon as possible.\n\nECWA expressed concern over the biting hunger among Nigerians due to the shortage of food supply as a result of insecurity that had paralysed the activities of farmers. It noted with concern the increasing rate of unemployment and called on members of the church to shun political apathy and actively join political parties of their choice to help in building the country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Blames difficult model adopted by DPR for slow progress\n\n\u2022$3bn oil theft in Niger Delta criminal, horrific, says Komolafe\n\n\u2022 Insists security of oil assets outside NUPRC\u2019s mandate\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Funmi Ogundare in Lagos\n\n\n\nAs Nigeria continues to struggle to increase its daily crude oil production, the Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) Mr. Gbenga Komolafe, yesterday said the agency was targeting the first half of 2022 for marginal field awardees to begin drilling in an effort to find their \u201cfirst oil.\u201d\n\nHe said this while speaking on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 monitored on ARISE News Channel.\n\nThe process which commenced in 2020 had been bogged down by bureaucratic challenges, meaning that the actual drilling for oil has yet to effectively take off over a year after the awardees were officially handed award certificates.\n\nOn May 30, 2021, the then Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) had announced the conclusion of the exercise, the first since 2003, with the presentation of letters to the bid winners in Abuja by the industry regulator.\n\nThe regulator had put up 57 marginal fields spanning land, swamp and offshore for lease, with 161 companies eventually shortlisted to advance to the final stage from 591 entities that applied for pre-qualification.\n\nThe Head of the DPR, which has now transformed into NUPRC, Sarki Auwalu, had at the time, stated that the exercise was worth roughly $500 million in signature bonuses.\n\nHowever, a number of the award winners, had decried the slow turn of events, stressing that they had continued to pay heavy interests on the loans that were borrowed to pay for the transactions, despite that the loans have been unproductive for over a year.\n\nBut Komolafe, while responding to a question regarding the issue of the 2020 marginal fields award, said although the commission inherited a difficult situation, it expects that by the first half (H1) of this year, all the issues would be sorted out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical because one of our cardinal objectives is to ensure that we increase the national oil production and of course, we realise that the fields will actually help in enhancing that.\n\n\u201cWe took the issue frontally. It\u2019s really been very challenging to handle the issue in the sense that the model used poses serious challenges to bringing the matter to an end quickly.\n\n\u201cBut I want to assure Nigerians and indeed the awardees that we have been able to, as I speak, tried to bring the issue to a manageable state and device a strategy for bringing the challenge to a close.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we have had over 80 per cent compliance in terms of payment. In fact, one of the challenges we\u2019ve had is that even in forming the SPVs , they are still having challenges working together because of the nature of the model used.\n\n\u201cBut by and large, I want to say that we as a commission, we will learn from this experience, and I want to assure Nigeria that the next marginal bid will definitely not be bogged down by these kind of challenges we experienced in managing the fallout of the 2020 marginal field.\n\n\u201cBefore the first half of the year, we want to see a situation where some of the awardees will be proceeding to field development plan. At the moment again, we have recorded close to 90 per cent of the co-awardees forming their SPV and at that stage, it is the very comfortable stage when the commission can go ahead to issue Petroleum Prospecting Licences (PPLs),\u201d he explained.\n\nKomolafe described the massive theft of crude oil in the Niger Delta as criminal and horrific, stating that while over $2 billion worth of oil was estimated to have been illegally siphoned in 2021, when added to the first quarter of 2022, it may have climbed beyond $3 billion.\n\nRecently, the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Godwin Emefiele, who spoke at the end of the 284th monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting in Abuja, had blamed the trend of oil theft for the inability of Nigeria to meet its oil production quota.\n\nDescribing the situation as unprecedented, he stated that the occurrence had had a debilitating effect on government revenue and accretion to reserves, adding that the global prices have gone up and are compounded by the shortage of supply of petroleum products.\n\nOn their part, the association of indigenous exploration and production companies, the Independent Petroleum Producers Group (IPPG) recently put it succinctly when it described the occurrence as an \u201cexistential threat.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman, IPPG, Mr. Abdulrasaq Isa, speaking at the 5th Nigeria International Energy Summit (NIES) had said the challenge should be tackled before it finally kills the sector.\n\nAlso, weeks ago, Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company (AEEPCO), operators of the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL) pipeline, threatened to exit the facility due to incessant vandalism, sabotage and outright theft.\n\nIn the same vein, THISDAY reported a Co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Seplat Energy Plc, Mr. Austin Avuru as recently calling for a state of emergency in the Nigerian oil and gas sector, revealing that up to 80 per cent of oil pumped in the country, particularly in the East, is stolen.\n\nAvuru\u2019s comments came days after a businessman and Chairman Heirs Holdings, Mr. Tony Elumelu, similarly bemoaned the worsening state of the industry, stressing that about 95 per cent of oil production does not get to the terminal.\n\nLast week, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, warned that Nigeria might go bankrupt if the trend is not checked.\n\nHe also raised concerns over the country\u2019s economic future, warning that Nigeria\u2019s debt to service revenue ratio might pose danger for decades to come.\n\nContinuing, Komolafe stated that it was not the duty of the commission to secure government oil and gas assets, saying the organisation does not, \u201cregulate\u201d criminal activities.\n\n\u201cThe commission does not regulate criminals, that\u2019s not the mandate of the agency. It does not actually extend to dealing with criminal. We do not have the abrasive or the coercive machinery to subdue criminals. Our mandate actually covers technical and commercial regulatory functions,\u201d he argued.\n\nKomolafe noted that whatever affects the oil sector affects the health of the entire nation, reiterating that the upstream and downstream parts of the industry are facing challenges at the moment.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re witnessing has reached a very alarming situation, a very horrific situation,\u201d he lamented.\n\nAccording to him, getting investors to put their hard-earned money into the sector has been very difficult with the existing harsh conditions , including the theft of the commodity by saboteurs. \u201cIt is worrisome due to the activities of these criminals,\u201d he lamented.\n\nBy rough estimates , the NUPRC had said that Nigeria lost more than 115,000 barrels per day (bpd) to oil theft and vandalism between January 2021 and February 2022.\n\nKomolafe reiterated that the NUPRC had established a panel to audit the activities of operators in the upstream sector to ascertain the actual volume of oil lost to the menace.\n\nThe commission\u2019s chief executive further pushed back on insinuations that the Timipre Sylva-led steering committee was slowing down work on the commencement of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), saying that the collaboration has been seamless.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022I\u2019ve insight to complete what APC has started, vice president declares\n\n\u2022TSG: It\u2019s a betrayal of trust\n\n\u2022APC Govs: We appreciate the devt\n\n\u2022Bagudu: APC may opt for consensus candidate for presidency\n\nDeji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja, Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi and Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\n\n\nObviously not expecting one of his political mentees to challenge him to a presidential contest, former Lagos State governor and frontline presidential hopeful, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, yesterday, denied Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as a political son, declaring he has no son grown enough to declare for president.\n\nBut Osinbajo, who announced his intention to succeed his current principal, President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, through a short video uploaded on various social media platforms, said his over seven years of working with Buhari had provided him requisite insights to complete what the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) had started.\n\nThe announcement came as the Tinubu Support Group (TSG) described Osinbajo\u2019s presidential declaration as a betrayal of trust.\n\nHowever, Chairman of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) and governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, described as a welcome development the fact that Osinbajo and Tinubu were seeking to be president of Nigeria. Bagudu said it was an indication of a robust democratic contest within a party that had endeared itself to Nigerians.\n\nThe PGF chairman also stated that APC might settle for the consensus method in the choice of its presidential candidate.\n\nTinubu met with about 12 APC governors at Kebbi State Governor\u2019s Lodge in Asokoro, Abuja, a few hours after the governors\u2019 meeting with Osinbajo at his official residence inside Aso Rock, at the start of the vice president\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nFielding questions from journalists after the meeting, an apparent knee-jerk response to the vice president\u2019s deft pioneering meeting with the APC governors, Tinubu denied Osinbajo outright.\n\nAsked about the declaration of the vice president, a development many of Tinubu\u2019s loyalists reckoned should not have happened, Tinubu declared, \u201cI don\u2019t have a son grown enough to declare\u201d for the office of president.\n\nThe APC leader, who said he met with the governors of his party to seek their support for his ambition, said, \u201cMy mission here is to seek collaboration, support and encouragement of my party, the APC, for my ambition to become the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as replacement for President Muhammadu Buhari after his tenure.\u201d\n\nTinubu\u2019s denial of his erstwhile political prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is a clear indication that the battle line is drawn between both men, and the battle may get more intense and messier in the period ahead.\n\nHowever, speaking earlier, Bagudu described the competitive situation in the party as a welcome development. He said Tinubu told the APC governors about his intention to vie for the presidency in 2023.\n\nBagudu said, \u201cAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, this morning, met members of the Progressive Governors Forum, where he stated what he has made public already \u2013 his intention to seek the office of the president come 2023, which he has already announced publicly. He briefed us on his reasons, his thinking and his message.\u201d\n\nBagudu said Tinubu acknowledged the role of the governors in the last convention of the party, where they helped to steady the party and produce a leadership accepted and widely acknowledged.\n\n\u201cWe appreciated his message and we will definitely discuss the message at one of our meetings,\u201d Bagudu added.\n\nAsked if Osinbajo and Tinubu\u2019s ambitions had put the governors in a tight corner, Bagudu said the governors appreciated the development, because it was an indication that the ruling party had endeared itself to Nigerians.\n\nHe stated, \u201cOn the contrary, we appreciate our party, because it has become a party that has endeared itself to Nigerians. We have many brilliant people in our party, some serving and some not serving.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have people in our party that express desire to lead the party into the highest office in an electoral contest shows how much this our party has resonated with Nigerians and our party members.\n\n\u201cFor us, it is a hallmark of success that people are showing interest, but at the end of the day, and because they are leaders of the party, they will always put the party\u2019s interest at heart.\u201d\n\nOn suggestions that APC might adopt a consensus candidate for the presidency, Bagudu stressed that the governors would always encourage the party to go for the best.\n\nHe said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget that in the 2015 presidential election primary, President Buhari contested against several others and it was a beautiful contest. There is nothing wrong. Members of the party always want to see consensus if it is possible, but we are a democratic party.\n\n\u201cIn our last convention, we had consensus in some of the offices and election in some others. There is always misrepresentation of consensus as if people are being snowballed into positions they would rather not take.\n\n\u201cAPC has done well as a party, President Buhari has led the party ably well and we believe strongly that come 2023, Nigerians will see another President of the APC extraction.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo officially declared his intention to run for president in 2023, yesterday, after meeting some APC governors at his official residence, Akinola Aguda House, within the precincts of the State House.\n\nIn the announcement video posted on his verified Twitter handle and other media platforms, including television, radio and social media platforms, Osinbajo promised to use his seven years insight and experience as the vice president to complete all that the Buhari-led APC government started at the centre since May 2015.\n\nAccording to him, if given the opportunity to lead Nigeria, his experience, insights and opportunities would be used for the benefit of Nigeria and Nigerians.\n\nHe claimed to have practically been to all the local governments in the country and had taken time to listen to the diverse experiences and yearnings of the people.\n\nVowing to transform the security architecture, agriculture and all other sectors for the betterment of the country, Osinbajo assured the citizens that he would build a Nigeria, where everywhere would be home for everyone.\n\nHe sought the support of all Nigerians to be their president in the next political dispensation.\n\nListing some of the challenges he intended to fix, if elected in 2023, the vice president said, \u201cIn this period of seven years, I have served the government in several capacities, and I have, at the direction of Mr. President, represented our country in sensitive high-level international engagements. If by the grace of God and the will of the people, I am given the opportunity, then, I believe that, first, we must complete what we have started:\n\n\u201cRadically transforming our security and intelligence architecture; completing the reform of our justice system, focusing on adequate remuneration and welfare of judicial personnel; ensuring justice for all and the observance of rule of law; rapidly advancing our infrastructure development, especially power, roads, railways and broadband connectivity.\n\n\u201cProviding an excellent environment for businesses to thrive, taking the agriculture revolution to the next level especially, mechanisation and developing the farm to table value chain, making sure that the government, its agencies and regulators serve the business community, creating a tech economy that will provide jobs for millions;\n\n\u201cEnhancing our Social Investment Programme to a full scale social welfare scheme, completing the promise of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty within this decade, completing the task of ensuring that all Nigerians, male and female, attend school, reforming our educational system for relevance to the challenges of this century.\n\n\u201cCompleting the task of universal health coverage for all, and strengthening the capacity of states and local governments to deliver on their respective mandates. Above all, front and centre of our efforts will be the provision of jobs and opportunities for our young people.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo added, \u201cWe will, working together, establish by the grace of God, the Nigeria of our dreams in a few short years. We will build on the foundation laid by our predecessors. We will need to move, with much speed, intentionality, and perseverance, towards the vision of a prosperous, stable, and secure nation. I am convinced beyond doubt, that, we have the creativity, the courage, the talent, and the resources to be the foremost black nation on earth.\n\n\u201cLet us now birth the expectations of greatness conceived generations before us. Let us build a Nigeria, where the man from Nnewi sees the man in Gusau as his brother; where the woman in Warri sees the woman in Jalingo as her sister; where the love of our nation burns alike in the hearts of boys and girls from Gboko to Yenogoa.\n\n\u201cWhere everywhere, in this land, is home for everyone, where our diversities, tribes and faiths unite, rather than divide us. Let our tribes become one tribe; the Nigerian tribe, where all are treated fairly, justly and with respect. Where all are given equal access to the abundant opportunities that God has bestowed on this nation. It\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Head of Media, Tinubu Support Group (TSG), Mr. Tosin Adeyanju, while reacting to Osinbajo\u2019s declaration, said, \u201cHis declaration is a welcome development but a betrayal of trust to the political family he belongs to. However, he does not portend any threat to our camp.\n\n\u201cOur eyes are on the ball and we are counting our numbers. Our consultation continues, as our principal is meeting with governors of the party.\u201d\n\nAdeyanju stressed that Osinbajo\u2019s declaration would further strengthen internal democracy as party members look forward to a transparent primary.\n\n\u201cWe are ready for primaries with any interested person, because our principal is a true democrat,\u201d he said\n\nGroup Commends Osinbajo for Declaring Presidential Bid\n\nA group, Osinbajo Volunteer Movement (OVM), commended the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, for making public his intention to contest for the position of president in 2023. The group said Osinbajo was the right man for the job.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the group, Comrade Kalid Ibrahim, spoke to newsmen in Bauchi yesterday, shortly after a rally held in honour of the vice president. The OVM spokesman recalled how the group had earlier called on Osinbajo to declare interest in the presidency, which he finally yielded to.\n\nHe said Nigeria needed a leader, who was strong physically and intellectually to tackle the many challenges facing the country.\n\nIbrahim stated, \u201cWe are very happy over the official declaration made by the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, to contest for the office of the president come 2023.We are supporting him, because he is mentally fit, has exceptional leadership qualities, and possesses the technical know-how to transform this nation\n\n\u201cThe vice president has been part of this government for the past seven years, he is not a novice when it comes to affairs of this country. He is conversant with challenges facing this country. We are expecting him to consolidate on the work already laid down by President Muhammadu Buhari. This is the reason we are registering our support for him.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo\u2019s Chances Bright, Tinubu Should Allow Him Grow, Says Abba-Aji\n\nFormer Presidential Liaison Officer to the National Assembly, Senator Muhammad Abba-Aji, described as bright the chances of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, following his declaration to contest the 2023 presidency.\n\nAbba-Aji, a member of the Progressive Consolidation Group (PCG), a pro-Osinbajo lobby group, was the liaison officer to the National Assembly during tenures of the late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua and former President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nHe applauded the spontaneous nationwide celebrations that greeted Osinbajo\u2019s declaration for the 2023 presidency.\n\nAbba-Aji stated, \u201cI have been in politics since the early 80s and I can tell you that the Nigerian electorate is now much wiser, much more discerning and sophisticated than what you had in the past. The spontaneous rallies are a show of strength, asserting the power of the real people and it is a strong pointer to Professor Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s very bright chances for ultimate electoral victory.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju is a great leader of our party and his role in bringing about an Osinbajo vice presidency has been vindicated, having performed creditably, impressing President Buhari and millions of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWhen you have brought a great idea, you should allow such to grow and Vice President Osinbajo\u2019s declaration for the 2023 presidency is a reflection of very sound growth and the next step is for Osinbajo to assume the presidency in 2023.\u201d\n\nAbba-Aji added that Osinbajo had impressed Nigerians with his performance during the periods he acted as president.\n\n\u201cHis chances are very bright in the view of most people that I have interacted with. He is better than anyone else but we are in a democracy and others also have a right to present themselves and increase the choices available to the electorate,\u201d he said.\n\nEkiti Group Endorses Osinbajo, Says VP Better Than Tinubu\n\nA group, Osinbajo Grassroots Organisation, has begun mobilisation in Ekiti State for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, saying he is better than other contestants vying for the All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket, including Bola Tinubu.\n\nTo mobilise for Osinbajo, the group, yesterday, marched across the streets of Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, where vehicular and human movements were disrupted for several hours.\n\nIn their hundreds, members of the group chanted solidarity songs in support of the vice president, and moved from the popular Fajuyi park through Ijigbo area to APC secretariat in Ajilosun area, where they were received by the party officials.\n\nAddressing the crowd, leader of the group and a former House of Assembly member, Hon Femi Adeleye, saluted the vice president for accepting to contest the 2023 presidential poll. Adeleye said Osinbajo\u2019s competence and capability stood him out among the aspirants jostling for the nation\u2019s number one seat.\n\nThe former lawmaker noted that Osinbajo had in the last seven years demonstrated unmatched loyalty to the president and the party, saying this has made him acceptable to all Nigerians across party lines.\n\nAccording to him, the group and other citizens of the state would commence massive mobilisation to ensure Osinbajo wins the ticket of the APC, saying with him as the candidate, the party would not lose the presidential election.\n\nHe called on the party under the chairmanship of Abdullahi Adamu to consider picking the vice president as the presidential candidate of APC by all options available to the party.\n\nAdeleye stated, \u201cWe have been pressurising him in the last few years for him to contest. We even decided if he doesn\u2019t declare this week, we would have gone to court to compel him. It is on record that no other vice president in the history of modern Nigeria has had such a crisis-free, corruption-free, robust working relationship with his principal like Professor Osinbajo.\n\n\u201cToday, in Nigeria, Professor Osinbajo\u2019s name is synonymous with loyalty, trust, competence, capacity and faithfulness. He is the one with most capable credentials and disposition of taking Nigeria to the Promised Land. He has long been nurtured for the leadership role of president.\u201d\n\nBagudu: APC may opt for consensus candidate for presidency\n\nChairman of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), and Kebbi State governor, Atiku Bagudu, on Monday said the All Progressive Congress (APC) does not rule out the possibility of a consensus candidate among its Presidential aspirants.\n\n\u201cWe always encourage our party to go for the best. Don\u2019t forget that in the 2015 presidential election primary, President Buhari contested along with several others and it was a beautiful contest.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong. Members of the party always want to see consensus if it is possible, but we are a democratic party.\n\n\u201cIn our last convention, we had consensus in some of the offices and election in some others. There is always misrepresentation of consensus as if people are being snowballed into positions they would rather not take.\n\n\u201cAPC has done well as a party, President Buhari has led the party ably well and we believe strongly that come 2023, Nigerians will see another President of the APC extraction.\u201d\n\nBagudu spoke after former Lagos State governor Bola Tinubu, a Presidential aspirant, met with APC Governors behind closed doors at the Kebbi Lodge, Abuja, hours after vice president, Yemi Osinbajo formally declared his interest to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nGovernors at the meeting with Tinubu included Nasir El-Rufai (Kaduna), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos) Umaru Ganduje (Kano), Atiku Bagudu (Kebbi), Mai Mala Buni (Yobe), Mohammed Badaru Abubakar (Jigawa) and Dapo Abiodun (Ogun).\n\nOthers were Abudlrazaq Abdulrahman (Kwara), Hope Uzondinma (Imo), Abdullahi Sule (Nasarawa) and Isiaka Oyetola (Osun).\n\nAsides from Tinubu and Osinbajo, Minister for Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, former Governors Orji Uzor Kalu and Rochas Okorocha and serving governors of Kogi and Ebonyi states, Yahaya Bello and Dave Umahi are also seeking the ruling party\u2019s ticket.\n\nBagudu explained that the race for the Presidential ticket among the aspirants is a positive one for the party.\n\n\u201cIn fact, in the contrary, we appreciate our party because it has become a party that has endeared itself to Nigerians. We have many brilliant people in our party, some serving and some not serving.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have people in our party that express desire to lead the party into the highest office in the electoral contest shows how much this our party has resonated with Nigerians and our party members.\n\n\u201cFor us, it is a hallmark of success that people are showing interest, but at the end of the day and because they are leaders of the party, they will always put the party\u2019s interest at heart.\n\nTinubu had told journalists that his meeting with the governors was to solicit their support for his ambition to be elected Nigeria president in 2023.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "The Teflon President With Nine Lives Is On His Way Out By Dr. Wumi Akintide",
          "text": "You probably know who I am talking about. The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump. Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives?\n\nNot by a long shot. The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.\n\nYou would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.\n\nWhat is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that. America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God\u2019s own country.\n\nIn cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.\n\nEven though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a \u201cdump.\u201d\n\nThe guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education. Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the \u201cC\u201d average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything. He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world. Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today. His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America\u2019s traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nDonald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined. He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House.\n\nThe one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin. He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years. He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen.\n\nThe Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House.\n\nEven though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.\n\nMy point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.\n\nIi is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year.\n\nIf Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life.\n\nI seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up. Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness. Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud. Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source.\n\nGerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.\n\nGeorge Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his \u201cread my lips\u201d pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.\n\nI gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America. Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America. Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by \u201cgrabbing their pussies\u201d because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder. He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan. Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again. Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years.\n\nRepublicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years.\n\nThey elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI. Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman\u2019s mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea.\n\nRepublicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin. He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way. Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders. They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East. Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor.\n\nThe list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less. Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as \u201cfake news\u201d disseminators.\n\nHe has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few.\n\nWhat atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed? The list is inexhaustible. The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do. Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it.\n\nIt is a complete outrage and totally incredible!\n\nI rest my case.\n\nDr. Wumi Akintide",

          "text": "\u201cThe future will have no pity for those men who, possessing the exceptional privilege of being able to speak words of truth to their oppressors, have taken refuge in an attitude of passivity, of mute indifference, and sometimes of cold complicity.\u201d\u2014Frantz Fanon.\n\nThe transmogrification of Nigeria into a captive state, a century-long process embarked upon prior to the fusion of the northern and southern protectorates appears to have reached its plastic point in recent years. In physics, the plastic point is one wherein an elastic wire would cease to return to its original length upon stretching. With the spate of unabated killings and stomach politicking, nationals await the miracle their leaders would deplore to remove Nigeria from the parlous position it currently occupies.\n\nFrom Nigeria down to Zimbabwe, India through Pakistan, the notoriety of the British never to forget to leave a problem in every country she colonized for them to chew until eternity continues to remain a formidable platform upon which the cracks in those nations manifest. Sadly for Africa, the actors who fought under the siege of Black Nationalism reclaimed their lands only to replace white supremacy with tribal bigotry, a volte-face amongst these scorched-earth creatures whose touted intelligence, sophistication and power of reasoning cease to function once the double-faced weaponry of religion and ethnicity is bandied right to their very faces!\n\nModiu Olaguro Their diverse nature, rich histories and alluring cultures\u2014powerful combos whose nuances ought to be recognised, respected and brought together to forge an indomitable front have but become the major fulcrum upon which all manner of division and hate is spewed, an unfortunate reality which signals to the correctness of the words of the black existentialist philosopher and pragmatic revolutionary, Frantz Fanon that \u201cnational consciousness is nothing but a crude, empty fragile shell. The cracks in it explain how easy it is for young independent countries to switch back from nation to ethnic group and from state to tribe\u2014a regression which is so terribly detrimental and prejudicial to the development of the nation and national unity.\u201d\n\nIt is this rapid switch to our parochial instincts that has reduced the country to a big-for-nothing giant, a condition exacerbated by our embrace of a \u201clootocratic\u201d form of government as against a flourishing one, with very little to show for the massive wealth buried beneath the soil, rarities on top of it and most damning, the brilliant ideas within the skull of the people. With a switch so inimical to national progress and the spirit of Pan Africanism, character, merit and justice have got to make way for federal character and all what's not, creating an atmosphere wherein persons whose belief system bars them from loving life deny others their fair share of it.\n\nWhile the masses keep bickering amongst themselves over the terror of the herdsmen, fellow nationals from northern Nigeria whose detest for criminality is an open book have since been in a fix over the questioning of their loyalty as they grapple with an emotional nation which has succeeded, to the dismay of logic and reason, at reducing the glaring failure of leadership and an over-centralization of security apparatuses to an act of ethnic expansionism! With this mindset, the masses deny themselves core sympathizers on the other side of the divide at best, and at worst, play into the hands of an overt bigot, whose trifling use of \u201cmy fellow citizens\u201d is at variance with his sectional outlook and a lack of appreciation of the richness in people beyond his parochial subconscious, with neither age nor ascension to the highest office to preside over the affairs of a multifarious nation having any effect on his person.\n\nWith Nigeria, one cannot be too surprised on the sound of a barrel or the sight of a club. But recent events, which culminated in the making of the middle belt into a vast morgue and the rest of the country, a hellish abode have further thrust the nation on the brink of collapse. These further reinforce my position that should Nigerians not wake up from their collective slumber by first recognizing that the only enemy they have got are the characters that make up the rank and file of the leadership cadre, redefine their country and situate their place in it, our slip into anomie would only intensify.\n\nA place to begin is the kind of country we all desire to live in. It is the propounding of such a vision that has made the American, America; the French, France; and the Russian, Russia; with these nations having sons and daughters who embody in totality, the aspirations and yearnings of their respective lands\u2014not hesitating whatsoever to live or die for their countries in the furtherance of such noble ideals.\n\nOne clarity in the Nigerian state is the rarity of statemen\u2014men and women whose duties lie, strictly, in the promotion and propagation of the common good. From the north down south, through the trenches of delta, the nation longs for a father. It is this absence of a national patriarch that has made way for all manner of charlatans and opportunists to abrogate such tasking responsibility to themselves, audacious among them being ex-president Obasanjo, the impish general whose continued relevance in the public space is tied to the chronic affliction of collective forgetfulness amongst the people on one side, and the very position the country occupies as a failed state on the other.\n\nWith the call for restructuring exceeding the desirable decibels since the days of the inept and corrupt administration of Goodluck Jonathan and raging with fire and brimstone since the pretentious and complicit presidency of Muhammadu Buhari, the debate on the sustainability of the Lugardian project has never been this visible on the spot. The nation more than ever needs brave men who are certain of their convictions to put forward viable alternatives and defend their arguments with uncommon bravado.\n\nRestructuring or otherwise, it would not require much from men with convictions to recognise that irrespective of the structure or system of government we adopt as a people, our entanglement with the hefty baggage of official corruption and treachery would remain until the masses realise their place within the space they call theirs, fashion their country in line with the vision so conceived and put structures in place for the sustenance and continuation of such.\n\nThe shirking away from this noble venture of statehood stands as the greatest stumbling block against our longing to make a nation from Nigeria, with everyone caught up in the web of hate and individualism while the unfortunate, albeit succinct words of the respected premier of the defunct western region, Chief Awolowo of Nigeria not being a country but a mere geographical expression continue to remain as the most fitting descriptor of our nation several decades later.\n\nUntil the masses themselves realise, paraphrasing Kwame Ture, that there is a higher law than the law of a hypocrite named Obasanjo, a higher law than the law of a bigot named Buhari, and a much higher one than those made by the tools in the national assembly, the leadership space would continue to remain an abode for self-acclaimed democrats whose motive for venturing into politics is strictly to steal, kill and destroy.\n\nWith 19% (16 million) of the total workforce unemployed and 21% (18 million) underemployed according to the Q3 2017 Employment By Sector Report of the National Bureau of Statistics; 1 in 5 children dying before the age of five according to the World Health Organisation and an unacceptable fatality rate amongst child bearers, Nigerians must stop being accomplices to the subjugation of their existence by their fellow citizens.\n\nGoing by the level of rot and the very fact that the nation keeps going adrift, hope appears to have eluded this generation. Will the people throw their hats in the ring to salvage the next?\n\nModiu Olaguro can be reached on [email protected]",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "MTN Nigeria, the Nigerian arm of Africa\u2019s largest telecom, today received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria to run a payment service bank.\n\nWith this approval, MTN Nigeria can provide virtually all the services offered by conventional commercial banks with the exception of granting credit and processing foreign exchange transactions.\n\nThis announcement follows a previous approval in principle granted in November 2021, to Airtel Africa Plc and MTN Nigeria Communications Plc to operate a payment service bank in the country. The final approval was subject to the fulfilment of certain standards of the conditions within six months. This hints that, while MTN has gotten its own approval, Airtel Nigeria could be getting its own soon.\n\nDespite being home to Africa\u2019s largest unbanked population, Nigeria has not witnessed the same exponential growth in mobile money adoption and lags behind its regional peers like Ghana and Kenya when it comes to penetration. In January, MTN revealed that MTN Nigeria\u2019s mobile money service had attracted 9.4 million active users since launching in August 2019.\n\nThis approval is expected to spur the adoption of mobile money in Nigeria as the use cases increase. The widespread coverage of MTN will help it serve people all over the country, especially in rural areas and also position the telecom giant as a competitor for the market share and earnings of commercial lenders.\n\nMTN Nigeria, which provides one-third of the MTN Group\u2019s sales, saw revenue climb to a record \u20a61.7 trillion ($3.4 billion) last year, with profit leaping 45.5% to \u20a6298.9 billion ($598 million). Mobile money is a growing contributor to MTN Nigeria\u2019s income, and it\u2019s expected that the new banking licence would allow the company to explore growth opportunities presented by the Nigeria\u2019s unbanked population.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

No God-fearing citizen can excuse and readily dismiss the gross incompetence and ineptitude of a ruling government that was exceptionally high on promises but abysmally low on deliverables and performances,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cNigeria deserves massive apologies from the APC apparatchiks who should be ashamed of the magnitude of damage they have wreaked on our long-suffering nation. No amount of fanciful diction, deceptive sophistry, pedantic casuistry or mendacious demagoguery can rescue them from the judgment of God for plunging our country and its people into unprecedented misery and penury.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working hard and praying that our esteemed Party, PDP, and its members, most especially our super delegates, would resist all temptations from highest bidders and put country above pecuniary expectations, and deem it fit to give me the ticket to represent our Party at the forthcoming 2023 General Elections. We must demonstrate to Nigerians, and the world at large, that we are ready to offer our people a fresh beginning in a new world order propelled by education and knowledge.\u201d\n\nThe Ovation Magazine boss urged PDP political gladiators and juggernauts to stop flexing their muscles against one another and think not just about redeeming the lost glory of the party, and country, but also give thought to providing succour and comfort to the teeming masses of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBecoming President of Nigeria should not be about the promotion and elevation of self as a result of previous lengthy political appointments. Getting to be Nigeria\u2019s President should be a matter of offering oneself humbly and honourably in order to serve our Fatherland to the best of our abilities,\u201d Momodu said.\n\n\u201cWhat Nigeria needs is a fresh leader, someone shorn of all the baggage, misadventure, mishaps and failures of the past. A charismatic leader and bridge-builder, with global experience and exposure, capable of assembling and commanding a combined and novel team of technocrats and politicians whose sole desire is to change their country for the better, rather than for self-aggrandisement and pillaging. This is the kind of President that is required to lead our country out of the drudgery and doldrums. I believe that I am that person and Leader.\n\n\u201cOur people truly have hope for a better future. They know that this will not come from a rehash or regurgitation of the same old wine in new bottles. They want real change. I have been a change agent most of my adult life. I believe that in the same vein, our reinvigorated Party should entrust me with the role of the change catalyst in Nigeria. I am new and untainted and primed for this task.

          "text": "The Senate, on Tuesday, received a request from President Muhammadu Buhari to approve adjustments to the 2022 fiscal framework on which the 2022 budget was predicated.\n\nThe request was contained in a letter dated April 5, 2022.\n\nThe letter was read during plenary by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan.\n\nPresident Buhari, in the letter, explained that an adjustment to the 2022 fiscal framework became imperative in view of new developments in both the global and domestic economies.\n\nAccording to him, the developments were occasioned by spikes in the market price of crude oil, which were a fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, there have been new developments both in the global economy as well as in the domestic economy which have necessitated the revision of the 2022 Fiscal Framework on which the 2022 Budget was based.\n\n\u201cThese developments include spikes in the market price of crude oil, aggravated by the Russian-Ukraine war, significantly lower oil production volume due principally to production shut-ins as a result of massive theft of crude oil between the production platforms and the terminals.\n\n\u201cThe decision to suspend the removal of Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) subsidy at a time when high crude oil prices have elevated the subsidy cost has significantly eroded government revenues,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, therefore, requested the upper chamber to approve an increase in the oil benchmark by US$11 per barrel, from US$62 per barrel to US$73 per barrel.\n\nThe President also sought a reduction in the projected oil production volume by 283,000 barrels per day, from 1.883 million barrels per day to 1.600 million barrels per day.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe also the chamber to approve an increase in the estimated provision for PMS subsidy for 2022 by N3.557 trillion, from N442.72 billion to N4.00 trillion.\n\nPresident Buhari, underscored the need cut in the provision for Federally funded upstream projects being implemented by N200 billion, from N352.80 billion to N152.80 billion.\n\nHe proposed an increase in the projection for Federal Government Independent Revenue by N400 billion; and an additional provision of N182.45 billion to cater for the needs of the Nigerian Police Force.\n\nHe added that, \u201cbased on the above adjustments, the Federation Account (Main Pool) revenue for the three tiers of government is projected to decline by N2.418 trillion, while FGN\u2019s share from the Account (net of transfer to the Federal Capital Territory and other statutory deductions) is projected to reduce by N1.173 trillion.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the amount available to fund the FGN Budget is projected to decline by N772.91 billion due to the increase in the projection for Independent Revenue (Operating Surplus Remittance) by N400 billion.\n\nHe explained further that Aggregate Expenditure is projected to increase by N192.52 billion, due to increase in personnel cost by N161.40 billion and other service wide votes by N21.05 billion (both for the Nigeria Police Force), additional domestic debt service provision of N76.13 billion, and net reductions in Statutory Transfers by N66.07 billion.\n\nGiving a breakdown, he said the net deductions would see a cut by N13.46 billion from N102.78 billion to N89.32 billion for NDDC; NEDC, by N6.30 billion from N48.08 billion to N41.78 billion; UBEC, by N23.16 billion from N112.29 billion to N89.13 billion; Basic Health Care Fund, by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion; and NASENI, by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion.\n\nThe President noted that the total budget deficit is projected to increase by N965.42 billion to N7.35 trillion, representing 3.99% of GDP.\n\nAccording to him, the incremental deficit will be financed by new borrowings from the domestic market.",

Anyone with information on his whereabouts is asked to call @NYPDTips at 1-800-577-TIPS\u201d, the NYPD tweeted.\n\nAt a press conference a reward of $50,000 was announced for information that could lead to his arrest.\n\nPolice said the perpetrator, who was seen wearing a gas mask and was believed to have acted alone, immediately fled.\n\nThe attack unfolded as a Manhattan-bound subway train on the N line of the underground rail system was pulling into a station in Brooklyn\u2019s Sunset Park neighbourhood.\n\nTen people were hit directly by gunfire, including five hospitalized in critical but stable condition, authorities said.\n\nSeven others were injured by shrapnel or otherwise hurt in the chaos as panicked riders fled the smoke-filled subway car, some collapsing to the pavement as they poured onto the platform of the 36th Street station.\n\nThe fire department said two of those hurt were treated at the scene.\n\nCNN, Fox News and various local media outlets reported that a U-Haul van that authorities were searching for in connection with the shooting had been located parked on a city street a few miles from the crime scene.\n\nNew York Police Department (NYPD) Commissioner Keechant Sewell said the shooting was not being investigated as an act of terrorism, though authorities would not rule anything out as a motive.\n\nSewell said the suspect was seen donning a gas mask in the train car as it was about to enter the station, then removed a canister from his bag and opened it.\n\n\u201cThe train at that time began to fill with smoke. He then opened fire, striking multiple people on the subway and in the platform,\u201d she added.\n\nNew York, America\u2019s most populous city, has seen a sharp rise in violent crime during the pandemic, including a string of seemingly random attacks on its subways.\n\nThe system is one of the world\u2019s oldest and most extensive.\n\nThe subway violence has included a number of attacks in which passengers have been pushed onto the tracks from platforms, including a Manhattan woman whose murder was seen as part of a surge in hate-driven attacks against Asian Americans.\n\nMayor Eric Adams, a former NYPD captain and Brooklyn borough president who took office in January, has vowed to improve subway safety by increasing police patrols and expanding outreach to the mentally ill.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nFamilies of passengers who were abducted in the Abuja-Kaduna train attack have issued a 72-hour ultimatum to the Federal Government to secure their release.\n\nThey gave the ultimatum on Monday after a meeting, stating that if the government fails to do so they will take a decision on how to rescue their relatives on their own.\n\nIt\u2019s been long weeks of torture and agonising moments for the families whose relatives were abducted when bandits attacked the Abuja-Kaduna-bound train weeks ago.\n\nThe attack which occurred on March 28 at Dutse forest in Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State left eight people killed and 26 others injured while scores of passengers went missing \u2013 suspected to have been abducted by the bandits.\n\nTwo weeks after the victims went missing, their families are hopeful of freedom from captivity, although they have refused to rule out the option of negotiating with the bandits.\n\n[READ ALSO] Kaduna Train Attack: Bandits Parade Kidnapped Victims Including Student\n\nThey have also held regular meetings with anticipated responses from the government but without such news coming yet, they turned to prayers to seek God\u2019s intervention in their predicament.\n\nThere has also been no word from the abductors.\n\nDr Abdulfatai Jimoh, who chairs the group of the relatives of the abducted persons, wants the government to dialogue with the bandits as they have demanded in a recent viral video.\n\nHe said this was necessary and not out of place since the government seemed incapacitated to protect the people.\n\n\u201cThe kidnappers said we should be ready that they would contact us, and we have not heard any communication from them since then,\u201d Jimoh said. \u201cSince this incident happened, we expected that by now, the government, the Nigerian Railway Corporation, and the Federal Ministry of Transportation, are supposed to have identified relatives of the victims to tell us what effort they are making or not to rescue our loved ones unhurt.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, the primary duty of any government is to protect the lives and property of citizens. We believe our government can do it and it\u2019s capable of doing it. Until a few days ago we had been expecting telephone calls from the abductors because that\u2019s what they promised us but when we saw the video, they made it very clear that they want to discuss with the government; that they have something with the government.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what they want from the government. But it\u2019s now an opportunity and a window for the government to rescue our loved ones by opening channel of communication with them (terrorists). This is not out of place. It is done anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nLiving Corpses?\n\nAccording to the families, the government owes the people the responsibility of ensuring their safety at all times, but authorities have continued to be nonchalant and insensitive to securing the release of their loved ones.\n\nThis has worsened their agony as they wonder why the Federal Ministry of Transportation and the Nigerian Railway Corporation have not reached out to them for updates on the efforts being made to ensure the kidnapped passengers return home unhurt.\n\nSome of them have become overwhelmed by their emotions as they appeal to the Federal Government to ensure the speedy rescue of the victims from the hands of their abductors.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what is between them but it is something that can be resolved in the interest of the lives of Nigerian citizens,\u201d Jimoh stated. \u201cLife is very sacred even if it is one life that\u2019s involved.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to Nigeria government to do everything within its powers and it is something that\u2019s not beyond the government to do. We are appealing to them to come out to open a channel of discussion with the bandits and get our loved ones out as quickly as possible.\n\n\u201cWe have been in serious anguish in the past 15 days. Many of us have not been sleeping, we have not been sleeping. We are like living corpses. We have decided collectively that we are giving the government 72 hours to do everything that\u2019s necessary to rescue our loved ones.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, and the nation\u2019s service chiefs had visited Kaduna to sympathise with the families and promised to ensure the return of the kidnapped persons, as well as apprehend and bring the bandits to justice.",

          "text": "Luka Modric turned the tie and Karim Benzema settled it as Real Madrid held off a sensational fightback from Chelsea on Tuesday to win an enthralling Champions League quarter-final 5-4 on aggregate.\n\nChelsea wiped out Madrid\u2019s 3-1 lead from the first leg in stunning fashion at the Santiago Bernabeu as Mason Mount, Antonio Rudiger and Timo Werner put Europe\u2019s reigning champions on the brink of a incredible victory.\n\nBut the 36-year-old Modric intervened with another moment of genius to add to the very best of his glittering career, a sumptuous pass with the outside of his right foot setting up Rodrygo to volley in and sending a nerve-shredding contest into extra time.\n\nAfter scoring a hat-trick at Stamford Bridge, Benzema then stepped forward to claim the winner, the Frenchman capitalising on a Rudiger slip to head in, a 3-2 defeat enough to see Madrid into the semi-finals.\n\nAt the final whistle, Modric and Benzema dropped to the floor, their combined 70 years of age belying another two vintage contributions that have dragged Real Madrid in sight of a 14th European Cup.\n\nThey will face either Manchester City or rivals Atletico Madrid in the last four.\n\nAfter being thrashed by Brentford and then outplayed by Madrid in the first leg last week, Chelsea came in rejuvenated after putting six past Southampton in the Premier League last weekend.\n\nThomas Tuchel said on Monday they would need a \u201cfantastic script\u201d to pull off this comeback and they certainly delivered that, their only failing an inability to prevent Modric and Benzema doing what they have done so many times before.\n\nMount\u2019s goal in the 15th minute set the tone, Madrid immediately consumed by tension and Chelsea given early hope.\n\nMateo Kovacic had been key in the build-up but it was Ruben Loftus-Cheek\u2019s quick pass into Werner that caught Madrid cold, the German steering the ball with his knee into the path of Mount, who advanced and fired past Courtois.\n\nFor 20 minutes, Chelsea were dictating, Madrid pegged back. Reece James was doing a fine job restricting Vinicius Junior, blocking Madrid\u2019s escape route.\n\nChelsea take command\n\nBenzema, Modric and Toni Kroos tried to wrestle back control but Chelsea\u2019s authority was even more pronounced early in the second half and within minutes they had a second, Rudiger rising high at the back post to head in from a corner.\n\nWith their lead gone, Madrid briefly exerted, the crowd coming into the contest. But Chelsea were celebrating a third when Marcos Alonso pivoted round Dani Carvajal\u2019s sliding tackle and slammed into the top corner.\n\nMadrid looked beaten, the stadium dead, but the referee was waiting. VAR spotted Alonso had controlled with his hand and when the decision was reversed, the Bernabeu erupted.\n\nWith 28 minutes left, the tie was back in the balance. Madrid had renewed impetus and almost scored, Benzema\u2019s looping header at the back post dropping onto the crossbar.\n\nBut it was brief, Chelsea coming again in the 73rd minute as Kovacic slid through Werner, who coolly slalomed past two sliding Madrid defenders and sent a deflected finish dribbling into the corner.\n\nA disappointed Kroos was taken off before a wild contest turned again on the moment of magic from Modric. With the outside of his foot, Modric stroked a 30-yard pass over to the right of the penalty area where Rodrygo, on as a substitute, volleyed in.\n\nChelsea looked the more likely to nick a late winner and nearly did, Kai Havertz nodding across the six-yard box but Christian Pulisic shot over.\n\nInto extra time and Madrid found another gear, Vinicius finally finding space to tear into. His floated cross might have been easily cleared by Rudiger but the defender slipped, giving Benzema just enough space to guide his header in.\n\nChelsea, so composed all night, suddenly looked ragged. Eduardo Camavinga fired over. Courtois Cruyff-turned around Havertz.\n\nBut they threw everything at Madrid in the final minutes, Courtois saving from Werner before Fede Valverde had to block a shot from Thiago Silva. Edouard Mendy went up for a final corner but it was cleared, Madrid holding on.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Nigeria and 12 other countries in Africa are yet to surpass 10 per cent full vaccination of their population against the COVID-19 pandemic, a report released by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has stated.\n\nCiting the World Health Organisation (WHO) statistics, OCHA stated: \u201cThirteen countries are yet to surpass 10 per cent of their population fully vaccinated including two of the most populous countries in the region (Nigeria and Democratic Republic of the Congo).\u201d\n\nAlthough the report did not list the other 11 countries besides Nigeria and DR Congo yet to surpass 10 per cent vaccination of their population, it noted that since the deployment of the multi-partner country support teams in January 2022, there had been good progress in vaccine absorption and uptake in the African region.\n\nAmong countries that reported an increase in vaccine uptake in February and March, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya and Ghana recorded the highest increase in vaccination coverage.\n\n\u201cIn February and March 2022, Ethiopia implemented the second round of a mass vaccination campaign, which further boosted COVID-19 vaccine coverage in the country, with increased numbers of people receiving their second dose, more people starting with their first dose, and increased uptake of booster doses.\n\n\u201cTwo countries \u2013 Seychelles and Mauritius, surpassed the target of 70 per cent of the population fully vaccinated by the end of December 2021. Four countries \u2013 Rwanda, Botswana, Cabo Verde and Mozambique \u2013 are on track to reach this target, having vaccinated between 40 per cent and 70 per cent of their population by the end of December 2021.\n\n\u201cHowever, challenges remain. In the African region, 12.8 per cent of the population were fully vaccinated as of 27th March, 2022 (10.2% at the end of February 2022), compared to 57.5 per cent globally.\n\n\u201cThirteen countries are yet to surpass 10 per cent of their population fully vaccinated including two of the most populous countries in the Region (Nigeria and Democratic Republic of the Congo),\u201d the report stated.\n\nIt added that the COVAX Facility continues to be the leading source of vaccines delivered in the region, accounting for 68 per cent of doses received.\n\nBut the report stressed that the absorption rate of the vaccines received remained at sub-optimal level, with only 54.9 per cent of doses administered of the quantity received.\n\nIt noted that 24 countries out of 46 (52 per cent) had administered fewer than 50 per cent of doses received, adding that vaccine doses administered increased by 23 per cent in February 2022 compared to January 2022, but in March 2022 the number of vaccine doses administered decreased by 35 per cent.\n\nIt noted that on the average, 8,271,347 doses were administered per week in March 2022 compared to 12, 734,357 doses per week in February 2022.\n\nAccording to the report, Sub-Saharan African region needs a twelve-fold increase in the weekly number of doses to be administered from April 2022 to June 2022 to continue to move towards 70 per cent target.\n\nIt further stated that 31 countries out of 46 had reported expired doses, noting that the percentage of expired doses of all doses received was 1.7 per cent among the 31 countries and 0.9 per cent in the African region overall.\n\n\u201cAs a result of mass vaccination campaigns, nine countries out of the 20 priority countries in the WHO African Region recorded an increase in doses administered in February 2022 (Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, GuineaBissau, Madagascar, South Sudan, Ghana, Uganda and United Republic of Tanzania).\n\n\u201cHowever, only three have continued to record increased vaccine uptake in March 2022 (Ghana, Cameroon and South Sudan) in addition to Mozambique, Mali and Burundi. This shows that it is necessary to keep up the momentum in vaccine uptake between mass vaccination campaigns.\n\n\u201cIt is critical for countries to intensify activities aimed at promoting continued use of health facility vaccination sites, as well as implement the provider-initiated vaccination approach in health facilities. In January 2022, WHO, UNICEF and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance launched the COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership (CoVDP) as an inter-agency initiative.\n\n\u201cThis will build on existing resources globally, regionally and in-country in order to accelerate vaccination coverage in those countries most in need of support. CoVDP complies with the principles of one country team, one plan, one budget and one support team.\n\n\u201cIn March 2022, in-depth country calls were held with Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo, Burkina Faso, and Sierra Leone to discuss issues around urgent funding requests, and identify sources of funding, enhance operational planning and improve vaccination service delivery.\n\n\u201cThe first quarter of 2022 has shown improvements in vaccine uptake and coverage across the Region, which is benefiting from the deployment of the WHO AFRO multi-partner country support teams, which started in January 2022.\n\n\u201cAlthough challenges remain, this initiative, along with CoVDP, promises to continue to improve vaccine absorption and uptake and move more countries in the Region closer to the 70 per cent target,\u201d the report stated.",

Don\u2019t forget that in the 2015 presidential election primary, President Buhari contested along with several others and it was a beautiful contest.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong. Members of the party always want to see consensus if it is possible, but we are a democratic party.\n\n\u201cIn our last convention, we had consensus in some of the offices and election in some others. There is always misrepresentation of consensus as if people are being snowballed into positions they would rather not take.\n\n\u201cAPC has done well as a party, President Buhari has led the party ably well and we believe strongly that come 2023, Nigerians will see another President of the APC extraction.\u201d\n\nBagudu spoke after former Lagos State governor Bola Tinubu, a Presidential aspirant, met with APC Governors behind closed doors at the Kebbi Lodge, Abuja, hours after vice president, Yemi Osinbajo formally declared his interest to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nGovernors at the meeting with Tinubu included Nasir El-Rufai (Kaduna), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos) Umaru Ganduje (Kano), Atiku Bagudu (Kebbi), Mai Mala Buni (Yobe), Mohammed Badaru Abubakar (Jigawa) and Dapo Abiodun (Ogun).\n\nOthers were Abudlrazaq Abdulrahman (Kwara), Hope Uzondinma (Imo), Abdullahi Sule (Nasarawa) and Isiaka Oyetola (Osun).\n\nAsides from Tinubu and Osinbajo, Minister for Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, former Governors Orji Uzor Kalu and Rochas Okorocha and serving governors of Kogi and Ebonyi states, Yahaya Bello and Dave Umahi are also seeking the ruling party\u2019s ticket.\n\nBagudu explained that the race for the Presidential ticket among the aspirants is a positive one for the party.\n\n\u201cIn fact, in the contrary, we appreciate our party because it has become a party that has endeared itself to Nigerians. We have many brilliant people in our party, some serving and some not serving.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have people in our party that express desire to lead the party into the highest office in the electoral contest shows how much this our party has resonated with Nigerians and our party members.\n\n\u201cFor us, it is a hallmark of success that people are showing interest, but at the end of the day and because they are leaders of the party, they will always put the party\u2019s interest at heart.\n\nTinubu had told journalists that his meeting with the governors was to solicit their support for his ambition to be elected Nigeria president in 2023.",
