          "title": "[SPONSORED] 62year old Lagos woman Reveals Eye treatment Remedy that Reverses Glaucoma, Cataracts and Improves Vision without surgery or eyedrops",
          "text": "Glaucoma. Cataracts. Blurry vision. Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Myopia. If not detected and treated early, these are vision problems in the elderly that could lead to partial or complete vision loss.\n\nI understand how it feels because I was once in your shoes. My name is Mrs. Damilola, and for several years, I used to battle eye problems that made me had blurry, unclear and poor vision.\n\nAfter trying several eye drops and glasses for over 3 years, I noticed that instead of improving, my eye condition had worsened.\n\nAfter an eye exam, I was diagnosed with glaucoma in the right eye.\n\nYou see, when patients are diagnosed with glaucoma, one of the most common treatment options is a prescription eye drop medication that lowers eye pressure, which prevents damage to the optic nerve and helps to preserve vision.\n\nSeveral types of drugs lower pressure.\n\nThe choice depends on a lot of factors, including the type of glaucoma, its severity, the pressure goals the doctor wants to reach, and the patient\u2019s other medical problems.\n\nFor my own case, the doctors recommended eye drops, drugs and even eye surgery.\n\nEye surgery which was the best long term treatment was really expensive, and even comes with its own side effects after several months or years.\n\nSo, I decided to start using eye drops just so I could manage to see because at this point, I was literally going blind.\n\nYou see, the problem with eye drops is that most of them came with serious side effects, so one has to continue changing them until you see the most suitable one.\n\nSadly, within few months I used about 4 eye drops.\n\nWhile for over the counter eye drugs, they take almost forever to work and give you perfect eye\u2026 so you keep on spending and spending on the drugs for several years.\n\nSo, I decided to start searching for an alternative solution, something herbal that comes with no side effects and will naturally reverse glaucoma, cataracts, near-sightedness, and other severe eye problems.\n\nBut the entire situation changed when I came in contact with an old time friend, Uwem, he used to work in a particular eye clinic in Abuja .\n\nWe have been friends since our NYSC days for over 7years till date. Although, it has been a long time we spoke because he relocated to Canada to continue his profession.\n\nWe started talking as usual, and he asked me about my eye condition, if it has improved for better.\n\nI explained how I was already tired of looking for solution to the eye problem, and how I have spent lots of money on drugs, supplements, eye drops and glasses, desperately looking for solution but without any improvement, instead I was almost getting blind instead!\n\nHe explained that most people wearing eye glasses suffer from myopia (nearsightedness), glaucoma and cataract.\n\nHe later explained that there is permanent cure for most of the eye problems, and natural remedy that helps treat and reverse glaucoma, cataract, myopia and other severe eye problems.\n\nMost of these cases he has handled in the eye specialist clinic he works with in canada, and his patients improved their eyesight, and they never had to wear glasses or go for expensive eye surgery again.\n\nBut sadly, the solution is very rare to find because its imported, specially for Eye clinics in the USA, UK, Canada and some developing African countries as well.\n\nThat was when he introduced me to a special herbal tea that have been in existence for several years, that help cures severe eye problems, reverse cataract, glaucoma and myopia.\n\nAt first, I was shocked and surprised. But he told me the exact plant extracts contained inside the herbal tea, and how they improves overall eyesight health and restores vision.\n\nI quickly pleaded with him to help me send a complete supply of the herbal tea. The next morning, I quickly sent the money to him.\n\nAfter about a week, the complete supply of the herbal tea was delivered to me.\n\nImmediately, I started it using it as prescribed (serving size of 1 tea bag in morning, and 1 tea bag in the evening).\n\nTo my surprise, in less than 2 weeks of using it, it was almost like a miracle cure to my eyesight problem and it helped improve my vision.\n\nMy eyes became crystal clear, my vision was never blurry again, and I started to feel that my glaucoma was gone.\n\nTo ensure it was really effective, I had to give the same herbal tea to about 2 of my colleagues in a different branch office, and some of my relatives using spectacles\u2026 just to confirm if it could help them improve their eye health and cure eye problems.\n\nWithin 30 days or less of using it, all of them came back to testify that this herbal tea helped them improve their eyesight and cure eye problems like cataracts, glaucoma, near-sightedness, hyperopia, and blurry vision, and they didn\u2019t have to continue wearing glasses anymore.\n\nTo ensure that this solution really works, I went to my eye doctor, just to be completely sure be about it.\n\nAfter several eye exams, he confirmed that my eye was much better than before, and that the herbal tea also contained some ingredients that are very rare to find, but are highly effective in improving eyesight naturally.\n\nWithout wasting time, let me introduce you to the Herbal Remedy that Has Helped me and over 642 Nigerian men and women Improve Eyesight, vision and PROVEN to cure Severe Eye Problems\u2026\n\n\u201cEye Restore Tea\u201d\n\nEye Restore Tea is a herbal remedy formulated to treat and permanently cure all kinds of eye problems such as glaucoma, myopia, hyperopia, cataracts and lot more\u2026\n\nIt helps restore your eyesight, promotes eye health and improves vision.\n\nEye Restore Tea is made up of finely blended plant herbal extracts such as bilberry extract, chrysanthemum, chinese wolfberry, cassia seed and green tea.\n\nA pack of eye restore tea contains 20 tea bags, which you use daily, morning and evening.\n\nThe best part is that the Eye Restore tea is purely herbal, comes without any side effect and curative for the treatment of most eye problems.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s largest city, Lagos, is home to more than 22 million people. This is more than New York or London combined. As Nigerians and foreigners move to the city for business and other reasons, the city\u2019s population grows by 77 people every hour. As the city grows, so does the demand for housing.\n\nMixta Africa, a leading real estate development company in Africa launched a new community called Lagos New Town on the 28th June 2021.\n\nLagos New Town is one of the fastest growing areas in Lagos, located in a serene environment far removed from the hustle and bustle of the city. This area represents a unique investment opportunity for residential and commercial property development.\n\nIn this new community, there are already several neighbourhoods you might be familiar with such as Lakowe Lakes Golf and Country Estate, Beechwood Estate, Adiva and Townsville. It is no secret that it is fast becoming a prime location for real estate investors, families and commercial entities.\n\n\u201cNot many people realize the extent of the challenge we have in the city of Lagos. If you look at the last 60 years, the population of the city has grown by over 2,000%\u201d said Mixta Africa CEO, Mr Deji Alli\n\n\u201cFor us, we\u2019ve taken all of these on board and we think that new communities are required. At the centre of that is the need to provide infrastructure to make such communities function the way existing communities do not.\u201d\n\nReal estate investing is still the smartest and most reliable way to accumulate wealth that can last generations for the smart investor, regardless of changes in modern trends.\n\nThis new community is estimated to host over 200,000 people and is a dream come true for its residents who get to enjoy state-of-the art facilities, world-class hospitality, recreational centres, serene environment and an 18-hole championship golf course.\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Mrs Rolake Akinkugbe-Filani said \u201cIf you think about our slogan of building communities, it is really about creating a lifestyle that people can relate to and how we do that is we develop cities that have the full spectrum of infrastructure and amenities that allow you to live, work and play in the city you live in\u201d\n\n\u201cOur signature affordable housing project, Beechwood Park, is a community of more than 500 bungalows and affordable homes which we sold out and are very proud of. We just recently launched phase 2 of that project.\u201d\n\nCommerce is also set to increase significantly with the allocation of specific areas of bulk lands varying from 2500, 5000 and 10,000 sqm available for light industrial work and warehousing. These serviced plots of land, known as Commercial New Town Plots, are strategically located close to the Lekki Free Trade Zone. Mixta Africa is also heavily investing in concrete roads durable enough for heavy-duty trucks.\n\nTheir vision to become Africa\u2019s foremost real estate developer is no easy feat but with the launch of this community, they are well on their way to achieving it.\n\nMixta Africa is known for leading the transformation of African cities by creating communities with sophisticated infrastructure and modern amenities, enhancing lifestyle and quality living, at affordable prices.\n\nThey provide modern urban infrastructure and affordable housing solutions on the continent which plays a substantial role in the growth and development of the local economies.\n\nThey have successfully executed many impactful projects in 8 countries across Africa with full operations in Nigeria, Senegal, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Morocco, and Tunisia but projects in Mauritania, Algeria and Egypt.\n\nFor more information, visit their website at lagosnewtown.mixtafrica.com or follow them on instagram at @mixtafrica",

          "text": "Lee Evans: Caption: Lee Evans, Ron Freeman, Vince Mathews, and Larry James on the podium to receive their Gold medals at the 1968 Olympics.\n\nThink about it: in what other sphere of human activity is there a level playing field for competition, considering the way the world is designed and constructed to function by the Super Powers throughout history, other than sports? Think about it.\n\nThat\u2019s why in 2021, 205 athletes from countries can assemble in one place, eat, sleep and drink together, and then compete, without a whisper of any of the intractable crisis that is ravaging the world rearing their ugly heads.\n\nFor the entire two-week duration of the Tokyo Olympics where all of humanity were gathered in peace and friendship, all conflicts on earth receded to the background, all differences wet into hibernation, and the rest of the world tuned in to watch Whites, Reds, and Blacks kiss, hug and embrace despite fierce competitions against each other on the levelling fields.\n\nThat\u2019s why the late sage, Dr Nelson Mandela, famously said:\n\n\u201cSport has the power to change the world\u201d.\n\nIt was not a flimsy speech by one of the most respected men in human history. It was a simple message but loaded with deep meaning. That\u2019s why the world is still missing its essence and practical application.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Nelson Mandela gave several speeches carved on marble stones, but some are less quoted than the others, including this one:\n\n\u201cThe world will not respect Africa until Nigeria earns that respect. The Black people of the world need Nigeria to be great, as a source of pride and confidence\u201d.\n\nThe big question is: Why would he single out Nigeria? \u2018Pride and confidence\u2019 from one of the most vilified Black nations on earth?\n\nProfessor Patrick Loch Otieno Lumumba is also a world-renowned Kenyan scholar, lawyer and political activist. His speeches have become a rich source of inspiration for all Africans. Like Nelson Mandela, one of his less-known speeches, not often quoted for obvious reasons, makes \u2018Nigeria\u2019 a point of reference.\n\nHear him:\n\n\u201cNigeria has shortchanged Africa. Nigeria is Africa. If you want any of the best men and women anywhere in the world, and you go to the UK, who are the doctors there? It is Nigerians and Ghanaians and the history of other Africans. You go to the USA, the great man who performed an operation in Utera was a Nigerian. In any area you go to, you find Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe day Nigerians resolve that \u2018we are going to make Africa great, that is the day Africa is going to rise again. I am appealing to you Nigerians, wherever you are, wake up, because the day you wake up, Africa will never remain the same again\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou are punching below your weight; you cannot afford to be grouped among the lightweights while you are Super heavyweights\u201d.\n\nAgain, why does Nigeria stand between the emancipation or not of the Black race?\n\nI have been thinking about all these things for a while.\n\nThen, early this week I had a conversation with my friend based in Guinea. He is a global sports icon, a true legend of Track and Field athletics, a two-time Olympian with Gold and Bronze medals, one of 4 African-American athletes that wore black berets and raised their clenched fists in the traditional Black Power Salute when they mounted the podium to receive their Gold medals for winning the 4 x 400 metres relay and for breaking the world record in the process at the Mexico Olympics in 1968.\n\nAfter that he became a USA Track and Field ambassador and a Hall of Famer, coach and consultant in America and in several European countries before settling down in the past two decades, in the small West African country of Guinea, one of the poorest countries on the planet, to find interpretation and purpose for his life by returning to his original roots, and impacting the lives of his brethren in Africa.\n\nLet me apologize to him for taking literary license by recalling and now publishing bits and pieces of our private conversation as we discussed the future of sport in Africa, and how sport can be strategically deployed to change lives, through recreation and education for the girl-child (an area of particular interest to him) in the continent.\n\nHis words remained like a song in my ears, playing over and over again in my head for a long time after our conversation, and would not go away until I put them down in writing, as much as I could recall and as close as possible to what he actually said. Only after that did my troubled spirit rest.\n\nHe has not read what I wrote but, shortly putting this to bed, I finally secured his permission to quote him. That\u2019s what I am now doing, putting his words in parenthesis only because they are not verbatim quotes.\n\nAs I write these down, I am still stunned, even now, by the depth of his conviction and the pain sipping out of his words like a sore thumb.\n\nRon Freeman had only ever visited Nigeria once when he came with the Chicago Olympics bid committee.\n\nGoogle his name and read a whole book about this incredible but quiet man, who continues to do great things for the youths in Guinea without any expectation of credit or publicity for his works.\n\nBut why join Nelson Mandela and Patrick Lumumba in using Nigeria as a reference point for the struggle for the emancipation of all Black persons on earth?.\n\nRead his long \u2018epistle\u2019 to all Black persons on earth:\n\nMy pain that I find here in Africa is that Africans do not know their history. It is a shame. Black people are the only race in the World that do not relate to their history and their roots. Everywhere people know their history and relate to it. Not Africans.\n\nTake Blacks in America. Ask them where they come from. They will tell you they are Americans. They do not connect with their origin. They are the only race in America that does that.\n\nTake a Jewish child. He knows and connects completely with his origins in Israel. Take a Chinese, take an Indian, or any White person. It is the same thing. Take anybody but the Blacks In America, they know and will relate with their basic origin. Black Americans do not all accept they are Africans. 90% of them would never accept that fact.\n\nThe tragedy is that in Africa, Africans also do not relate with Black Americans. Take me, I have been in Africa for this long, the people still do not accept me as having come from here, and that I am really one of them.\n\nTake Lee (Evans). He gave his life to serve in Nigeria. They never fully accepted him. See how he was treated. Nigeria had the greatest athletics coach in the world amongst them for so long and they never accepted him. If Lee was in the Nigerian athletics team to Tokyo, it would have been a different story. See what he did every time he worked in the team and around Nigeria. He would have made sure things worked, and the athletes would have been some of the best in the world. He did it in 1976. And in 1984, and even after. Check with all the athletes that ever worked with Lee. He was there in Nigeria (at different times) for decades. Nigerians never saw him as one of them, so for long spells, he wasted. Here was a man who loved Nigeria passionately, even more than the Nigerians themselves.\n\nYet, DNA tests confirm that we have the same blood. We are brothers and sisters for God\u2019s sake, blood relations. Slavery has affected the minds of Blacks in the US. They do not even love each other. Blacks do not love Blacks.\n\nMeanwhile, colonialism messed up the minds of Africans. I am in Africa. Despite everything I have done, they do not accept me as one of them. They still see me as a foreigner. America is not my root.\n\nNow, think of it. The greatest people in the world are Blacks. They are Nigerians. Check and see the most intelligent people in the world, the list of best physicians, the best chess player, the best engineers, the highest number of PhD holders in America, they are Nigerians. Nigeria is the most intelligent country in the world. And the greatest Blacks. It is Nigeria.\n\nALSO READ: National Stadium Lagos: From Sports City to ghost city\n\nJust find a way to stop the corruption, stop the damage being done by the politicians, by Boko Haram, and several other groups fighting all over that country, and you have the greatest country in the world. Nigeria is the leader in everything \u2013 leading Mathematician, leading this, leading that. Everywhere, in every profession in the world, you find them.\n\nThe bad things about them that the world hears always are only about 10% of who they really are. The good things that constitute 90% are not told and are wasting assets. Nobody is connecting Nigeria with those great things being done by Nigerians all over the world. All these Boko Haram and agitating groups are distracting the country from assuming its rightful place as leader of the Black race in the world.\n\nTake athletics. It is in the blood of every Nigerian.\n\nImagine, if money is provided, the athletes eat well and are comfortable, they have facilities to train here at home, bring the best Black African-Americans here to train them, keep them here. You will have the greatest country in the world in sports.\n\nYou have the template of sports development in Nigeria already. In 1976 the world saw it at the Montreal Olympics in Canada. Nigeria had some of the best boxers, athletes, footballers, and so on, going to the Olympics. They had the template. They had Lee Evans, Ron Davis, Archie Moore, and so on. That\u2019s the template. To keep the athletes at home, make them very happy, bring your American brothers and sisters here to train them. Success will change the perception of Nigeria in the world. Sport is in their blood.\n\nAfrica cannot get better until we get rid of the bad influences like corruption, poverty, bad politics, and things like that.\n\nCan you imagine it? If Black African Americans should wake up one day and accept Africa as their home? Can you imagine if Black African Americans are accepted here in Africa as their brothers and sisters, and given land to resettle and contribute to the social and economic development of the communities?\n\nA Jew from anywhere in the world that goes back to Israel is accepted and given a place they can call their home. I am waiting for that day to come in Africa.\n\nI am looking for a home. I shall find it in Africa. When I do, I shall then find my way there.\n\nThese are words from the deepest part of the conviction, from a human soul, expressed painfully and candidly, capturing what every Black person on earth, with their ancestry traced to the African continent, should make their holy grail.\n\nRon, by the way, has tested his DNA and the tests confirm that the blood running through his veins is 83% African, and 41% of that is Nigerian!\n\nOn deeper reflection of what Ron told me, even if little of it is completely new, I became convinced that I have been on the right path in my humble previous assessment of the situation of the Black race on earth.\n\nThe references to Nigeria are strategic and very important. What Nigeria represents in the community of Blacks on earth speaks volumes. Nigeria is the most vilified Black country on earth. That too is understandable. It is one of the richest, the largest and the most populated Black nation on earth, all 250 million of them, strong, loud, educated and not completely \u2018corrupted\u2019 by colonialism before Independence came. Southern Nigeria also was a large source of slaves forcefully exported to the Caribbean Islands, Brazil, Cuba, the United States, Europe, and so on.\n\nSo, Professor Patrick Lumumba was on point when he also said:\n\n\u201c You cannot remain a slave forever. We have conquered the mountain of political freedom; we must now conquer the mountain of economic freedom\u201d.\n\nHow do you do that?\n\nThe Black person must earn respect and be filled with confidence to begin the journey of emancipation and equality in this world. He must compete and earn that respect. The only field where he can do so for now and succeed is on the level playing ground of global sport. When he can win against the rest of the world he will become armed with respect.\n\nTo gain the confidence he needs a united front. To achieve this he needs a platform to assemble, discuss, plan and strategise. The common thread running through all his race is culture, a deep-rooted culture that continues to sustain despite centuries of oppression, suppression, slavery, colonialism, racism, and so on.\n\nThe Blacks of this world had the perfect platform and opportunity to jump-start an authentic process of re-setting the buttons of a global Black cultural renaissance in Nigeria. Using her resources, Nigeria organized the largest assembly of Black and African people on earth at the Second Black and African Festival of the Arts and Culture in 1977. It was the perfect platform, with an intellectual colloquium to boot, to congregate on a regular basis to plan and move with one voice in the gradual unshackling from all forms of enslavement including economic. The Black race must re-open that chapter again but do it differently.\n\nWe spent an hour and a half talking. Ron blew my mind with some fundamental truths.\n\nRon Freedom is preparing to leave Guinea soon, having laid a good and, hopefully, a sustainable foundation. He intends to pay a penultimate visit to the country that adopted his ancestors again before returning to settle finally in one of the East African countries (his preference of where to spend the rest of his life in Africa).\n\nLike his friends, late Lee Evans, Ron Davis, Oliver Johnson, and a whole army of other African Americans waiting for the opportunity and circumstances that would bring them home to Africa, Ron Freeman will finally return to Africa in fulfilment of his greatest wish.\n\nThe interesting development is that I am a part of some work that has started in a few African countries involving great legends of African sport driving a new mission. Our blood brothers and sisters in the Diaspora, desirous to have a relationship with their roots, will find new welcoming settlements and people that will welcome them everywhere they choose to live on the African continent, where they will be appreciated, loved, and can live and invest in peace, and can contribute maximally to development of the communities, and where, in the evening of their lives, they can rest in perfect peace with their ancestors.\n\nThere is such a place already waiting for them in Nigeria. It is in Wasimi.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

He ostensibly remained on the university campus until late in the evening during which time he met up with Mr. Waheed Majekodunmi.\n\n\u201cThe duo were said to have hobnobbed at the University Senior Staff Club until past 8pm in the evening after which they left together through the Iba Gate of the University for their destinations.\n\n\u201cUnable to get vehicles at the school junction as it was late in the day, the duo were said to have trekked several metres away from the gate ostensibly in search of a vehicle.\n\n\u201cThey were attacked by men of the underworld, dispossessed of their valuables and shot. The staff escaped with gunshot wounds and got helped by passersby to a nearby hospital.

          "text": "By Vincent Kalu and Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nAgainst the admonition by Katsina State governor, Bello Masari to his citizens to acquire arms to defend themselves, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), the Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE), the Southern Kaduna People\u2019s Union (SOKAPU) and the Indigenous Igbo Youth Congress (IIYC), have said the Yoruba Nation activist, Sunday Adeyemo, otherwise known as Igboho, and IPOB leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu have been vindicated for their efforts in defending their regions from bandits, kidnappers, killer herders and other criminals.\n\nSecretary-General of Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE), Dr. Kunle Olajide, said the statements by Minister of Defence, Gen Bashir Magashi (Retd), and Governor Aminu Masari on self-defence have justified the actions of agitators for self-determination. Chief Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Igboho, is a prominent member of the Ilana Omo Oodua, championing self-determination for Yoruba nation.\n\nSaid he: \u201cThe comments by Gen Magashi and Governor Masari are by far more harmful to this nation than what Igboho would do. Igboho has not even defended himself. He has not raised arms against this country and he has not incited anybody to take up arms.\n\n\u201cIf you have the Number One citizen of a state, calling on people to breach and violate the law of the country, which forbids anybody to possess guns without licence or police permit, then there is no more hope. So, for a governor from the president\u2019s state calling on the people to defend themselves, is an admittance of government failure completely,\u201d the YCE said.\n\nLeader of Yoruba self-determination group, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO), Prof Banji Akintoye, who spoke through the Communications Manager of IOO, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye, said statements have vindicated Yoruba nation activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, fondly called Sunday Igboho, and the self-determination groups that have been agitating for Yoruba nation.\n\nSaid he: \u201cWith the statements made by Masari and the earlier one made by the Defence Minister, people can now see that the Nigerian government has been speaking with both sides of their mouth. They said we should defend ourselves. And it is not a crime for you to defend yourself, when your life is in danger.\n\n\u201cBut when you defend yourself, the Nigerian government will arrest you and charge you for conspiracy, murder, illegal possession of firearms and so on. But those people that came to attack you, rape your women and girls, kill you and so on, you will not hear anything about them.\n\n\u201cIgboho never killed anyone. He never shot a gun. He never destroyed any property. He uses native intelligence to drive out the people tormenting, terrorising and oppressing his people. They want to criminalise Igboho, but they will fail. We are happy that Igboho is in a protective custody. By God\u2019s grace, he will be a free man.\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of time, the collective will of the people will triumph. The people of Yorubaland will triumph and we shall have our own nation peacefully.\u201d\n\nIPOB, in a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, noted that the call by the governor has vindicated Kanu, who has been consistently advising Nigerian and particularly Igbo to defend themselves against the Fulani terrorists, \u201cour leader is a man who saw tomorrow, everything he said has fully happened.\n\n\u201cThe politically correct South East governors and political elite should stop living in the past. They had better woken from their slumber and decode the obvious signals of the call by Masari.\u201d\n\nPresident of the Indigenous Igbo Youth Congress (IIYC), Chief John Mayor Echefu, said the IPOB leader saw ahead of tomorrow and warned his people of the danger that would befall them in the hands of the Fulani herdsmen, but the governors and other leaders betrayed him. He regretted that if a Southern leader had called for citizens to start bearing arms, there would have been uproar from the security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Defence has called for self defence; he told Nigerians openly that they should defend themselves because government could no longer do that. The Emir of Zauzau called his subjects to defend themselves, and IPOB set up Eastern Security Network to defend their area, but they want to kill their leader,\u201d he noted.\n\nAlso speaking, President of Southern Kaduna People\u2019s Union (SOKAPU), Jonathan Asake, said, the statement has already vindicated Kanu and Igboho, who want to defend their areas against Fulani militia attacks.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis comment coming from Governor Masari is a welcome development and indicate two things.\n\n\u201cFirstly, that the government of the day cannot defend Nigerians and they should admit that and allow Nigerians to defend themselves and even support and empower Nigerians across the country to defend themselves if they are not part of this problem. \u201cSecondly, it shows that Igboho in the South-West and Nnamdi Kanu in the South-East have been vindicated over their agitations. Their long-standing agitation to defend their people has made a statement that they foresaw this thing long time ago. I\u2019m not surprised that many other communities in many states have come to the same conclusion,\u201d he said.",
          "summary": "Chief Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Igboho, is a prominent member of the Ilana Omo Oodua, championing self-determination for Yoruba nation.\nSaid he: \u201cThe comments by Gen Magashi and Governor Masari are by far more harmful to this nation than what Igboho would do.\nHe said: \u201cThis comment coming from Governor Masari is a welcome development and indicate two things.\n\u201cFirstly, that the government of the day cannot defend Nigerians and they should admit that and allow Nigerians to defend themselves and even support and empower Nigerians across the country to defend themselves if they are not part of this problem.\n\u201cSecondly, it shows that Igboho in the South-West and Nnamdi Kanu in the South-East have been vindicated over their agitations.",

          "title": "PIA: N\u2019Delta communities may head to court",
          "text": "By Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa and Ben Dunno, Warri\n\nAs mixed reactions pour in over the President Buhari\u2019s recent signing into law of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), communities in Niger Delta region are weighing the option of going to court to challenge some controversial clauses in the Act which they considered to be inimical to the peace and progress of the region.\n\nApart from the three percent derivation which they want increased to five per cent, others include the one which says: \u201cfor a community to benefit from the three percent, there must be no pipeline vandalisation and oil theft\u201d and another which they think mandates the oil companies to take all decisions about the Host Communities Trust Fund, on behalf of the oil-producing communities.\n\nThe PIA has already caused division in the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC). While some members of the executive arm want a decisive action, the Senate arm is not interested in further agitation. The national spokesman, Ebilade Erekefe, declared President Muhammadu Buhari and Minister of State for Petroluem, Timipre Sylva, persona non grata in the Niger Delta region.\n\nHe accused them of being insensitive to the plight of the Niger Delta people and threatened that they would be greeted with boos and jeers anytime they come to the Niger Delta region. Disagreeing with his stance, however, the Speaker, IYC, Digimie Eldred Pogoyo urged security agencies to investigate the threat against President Buhari and Sylva by Erekefe.\n\nPogoyo who would want all agitations against the PIA to cease said the people should focus on the positive side of the law. According to him, Sylva as Minister of State has brought more development to the region more than previous ministers that have come from the region.\n\nThe Vice-Chairman of the Ijaw National Congress (INC), Chief Nengi James, who feared that the signing of the PIA could ignite anger across the Ijaw land, explained that the major problem was the lack of coordination between the people and the representatives at the National Assembly on one hand and the lack of enthusiasm by some governors on the other hand.\n\n\u201cThe people are also having mixed feelings because even if the money in increased to the percentage the people demanded, there is this fear the money if given to the governor may not even reach the host communities. The governors can collect the money and ensure that not one per cent gets to communities that produce oil but expended on communities without oil,\u201d he said.\n\nKing Bubaraye Dakolo, Adaga IV, Ibenenaowei of Ekpetiama Kingdom wants Niger Delta lawyers to head to court over the Act. Dakolo , author of \u201cThe Ri ddle of the Oil Thief\u201d and brother to Capt Perebo Dakolo, executed for his involvement in the Gideon Orkar Coup of 1990, sees the PIA as an aberration as it seeks to put a yoke on oil producing communities. According to him it is different from the one initiated, years ago.\n\n\u201cIt seeks to criminalise the people of the Niger Delta by including in its provision that for a community to benefit from the three per cent, there must be no pipeline vandalization and oil theft,\u201d he said. \u201cPutting this around the neck of oil communities is stigmatization. For over 20 years, the federal government has been fighting oil theft and they have not been able to stop it. Now, how do they expect communities that are not trained to be able to do so? The law is criminal, and most unfortunate. The SANs in the Niger Delta region should go to court and challenge it.\u201d\n\nEric Omare, President of Ijaw Youth Council, noted that there was supposed to be enthusiasm among the communities over the signing of the Bill into law but the reverse is the case. \u201cThe PIA is supposed to create a conducive environment for investors to invest but with the anger in host communities that cannot happen.\u201d\n\nThe Act is breeding disaffection, said Ken Henshaw, Executive Director, \u201cWe the People, warned. Accusing the PIA of treating oil producing communities like the subjects of oil companies by empowering these companies to take all decisions about the Host Communities Trust and Fund on behalf of oil producing communities, he urged them to challenge the provisions of the Act in the Supreme Court.\n\nA statement signed by Hon. Ken Robinson, its National Publicity Secretary, Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), decried the implementation of 3 percent allocation conceded to oil producing communities, and called for its upward review.\n\n\u201cThis PIB falls way short of the expectations of the Oil and Gas Producing Communities, that bear the brunt of unconscionable industry operations,\u201d it noted. \u201c\n\nWhat this act signifies is an unequivocal message to the Niger Delta people that how they feel and what they say, do not count, at all, in the schemes of the Nigerian Project\n\nThat\u2019s insensitive, abominable and unacceptable to the good people of the Niger Delta, the critical economic nexus of the entire Nigerian territory. The Niger Delta people will speak, shortly, after full consultations, on this callous act, on the best legal and political response\u201d.\n\nBut in his own reaction, President, National Coalition of Niger Delta Ex-Agitators (NCNDE-A) General Eshanekpe Isreal, Aka Akpodoro, commended President Buhari for having the political will to sign the bill into law after over a decade of its politicization on the floor of the National Assembly.\n\nHe urged the stakeholders in the oil bearing communities across the states to ensure that the allocation from the 3percent conceded to them in the PIA is properly utilized for the purpose of both human and infrastructural development so as to positively impact the lives of the people. He appealed to state government, National Assembly members as well as their counterparts in the state assemblies to liaise with various host communities constituted authorities saddled with the responsibility of disbursing the funds to effectively use the money to better the lots of their people.",

          "title": "You want to get a visa? These simple steps might lead to success",
          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nAttending a visa interview is usually laced with anxiety, especially for first time applicants. However, this anxiety could be doused if some simple tips are adhered to. A visa denial could be emotionally troubling, especially when the applicant is due to attend an urgent business meeting, funeral of a loved one, graduation or wedding ceremony of one\u2019s offspring, among others. Ideally, there are no fast rules to getting a visa, other than the applicant getting himself/herself acquainted with the basic requirements of the country they intend to visit.\n\nOften times, applicants apply the generic rule in either preparing for interview or presenting their documents. This is a major blunder, as each country has its own set of distinct immigration rules, which if not adhered to at the point of filling an application form, automatically reduces the chances of getting a visa. One major mistake that applicants should be wary of is applying for or paying for the wrong category of visa. There are various categories of visas ranging from; immigrant to non-immigrant visa, work visa, study visa, exchange visitor visa, business/conference visa, and the B1/B2 (visitor visa).\n\nOthers are; I visa (Journalist and Media), religious worker visa, transit/ship crew visa, domestic employee visa. For the United States, the most common and popular of its entire visa category is the B1/B2. The B-1/B-2- visitor visa is for people travelling to the United States temporarily for business (B-1), for pleasure or for medical treatment (B-2). Generally, the B-1 visa is for travellers consulting with business associates, attending scientific, educational, professional or business conventions/conferences, settling an estate or negotiating contracts. The B-2 visa is for travel that is recreational in nature, including tourism, visits with friends or relatives, medical treatment and activities of a fraternal, social or service nature. Often, the B-1 and B-2 visas are combined and issued as one visa: the B-1/B-2.\n\nWhile most countries in the European Union territory/Schengen, Canada, South Africa among others do not require applicants to be physically present for a visa interview, the United States of America (USA) does. Responding to Saturday Sun inquiry, Mrs. Aderonke Adenrele Fatomi, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Voxron Travels, a firm that specialises in visa and travel advisory services, said research has proven that poor documentation and incorrect information by applicants remained reasons for the upsurge in visa denials. She added that one needs not be a millionaire to secure a visa, contrary to misconceptions making the rounds, adding than an applicant\u2019s statement of account must run in a logical manner; meaning that inflow and outflow on such accounts must be in good standing. She further explained that applicants should avoid the lodgement of bulk funds that cannot be defended into an account, warning that such transaction could raise a red flag\n\nBelow are a few tips that could guide applicants in the process leading to their visa interview or preparing their application documents. This list is not exhaustive as applicants are equally expected to carry out further research in order to be successful.\n\nOne: Avoid forged documents\n\nEither you are attending an interview in person or submitting your documents at a visa application centre, avoid the presentation of forged documents. Submission of forged documents has been on the rise lately and all embassies/consulate frown at such development.\n\nThe use of forged/cloned documents could lead to a visa ban of up to 10 years or more, depending on the decision of the consular.\n\nTwo: Say it as it is\n\nDo not try to impress the consular in anyway because majority of them are experienced, having served in various countries and could easily tell when an applicant is trying to impress them, leading to telling lies. If you do not have answer to a question, simply say so, instead of making inaccurate guesses and outright lies that put you on the spotlight.\n\nTelling lies either in your application or during a live interview session will only reduce your chances of getting the live. Most consulars prefer you tell them the truth even if you as the applicant consider your chances slim.\n\nThree: Get your documents right\n\nLike it was pointed out earlier, there are no fast rules to visa application process, as the documents from one country to another differ. However, there are basic documents that cut across. Pay the right application fee in relation to the visa class/category you are applying for. Fill the right application form. Schedule a visa appointment where necessary and get the right specification of the passport photograph.\n\nUsing a poor quality photograph with the wrong dimension could put your application at risk. Ensure the validity of your travel passport is at least six months. Also include the evidence of your visa application fee in your application package. For all visa classes, include in your documents or go to the interview with all relevant certificates from high school to university level, marriage certificate, family photographs, pay slips, ID card, letter of employment/ last promotion, bank statement, among others.\n\nFour: Steer clear of fraudulent agents\n\nThe quest for economic migration has led to an upswing in the cases of visa fraud. A majority of unsuspecting applicants have fallen prey to the fraudulent activities of some agents who parade false claims, thereby duping unsuspecting members of the public.\n\nThe requirements for a visa application are clear and can be obtained from the website of the various embassies and consulates. The use of an agent does not automatically guarantee the issuance of a visa because it has been discovered that in some cases, the applicants are even more knowledgeable than the so called agents. For the United States, information relating to the various visa categories could be viewed via; www.ustraveldocs.com while that of the United Kingdom could be seen via;www.gov.uk\n\nFive: Consular expectation\n\nThe applicant must be able to prove to the consular/interviewing officer that the purpose of the trip is what is stated in the application. He/she must equally convince the officer that there is a strong tie that would compel him to return to his country at the expiration of such trip. Often times, most applicants fail to demonstrate this, leading to a visa denial. For instance, a denial under section 214(b) of the U.S immigration and Nationality Act means that an applicant is not able to demonstrate that the intended activities in the U.S would be consistent with the classification of the non immigrant visa for which they applied.\n\nSix: Don\u2019t be late\n\nThe embassy or consulate will tell you the exact date and time of your interview. If you get there late or unprepared, you will leave the official with a negative impression of you, and that might ultimately hurt your visa application.\n\nIndeed, tardiness on the interview day creates a negative impression of the applicant in the mind of the official. Instead, try to arrive at the embassy or consulate where your interview will take place at least a few minutes earlier.\n\nThis will help you calm yourself down and relax when giving your answers to the interview questions. Also, make sure to leave home early enough, counting the traffic jam. The embassy or consulate will tell you the exact date and time of your interview. If you\u2019re late, in some cases, you may have to reschedule the appointment and pay a fresh application fee.\n\nSeven: Don\u2019t give out unnecessary information\n\nIf you have been asked a question, make sure to understand it well. Exaggerated answers and not required explanations are not supposed to be given at visa interviews. The visa official is not interested in losing a day hearing everything about you \u2013 unneeded and irrelevant information. The official only wants to get specific and clear information that he directly asks you.\n\nAvoid losing a sense of your talk, by trying to impress the visa official with too much of the talk. In its place, keep your answer short, simple and assessable, by holding the regular flow of the interview. Remember that the interview should be natural and with no need for imposing moments.\n\nEight: Keep nervousness away\n\nWhat destroys your answers during the interview, is appearing there full of nervousness. Even though your visa application and supporting documents as well as your physical appearance are as they should, a bad energy, nervousness, over-confidence might destroy your interview. Speaking too much of your successes, shaky noise, pointing yourself or the official with a finger, unstable eye contact and other negative gesticulations because of the anxiety you experience in the interview can cause the official to end it fast.\n\nTo avoid such an uninvited situation, it is suggested you relax and calm your nerves early enough before the interview. Try to not overstate the interview concern, instead, consider it an approachable meeting.\n\nNine: Avoid disagreeing with the visa official\n\nArguing with the visa official during the interview session is another reason the entire visa interview session might go wrong. An increased tone of voice or a bad approach towards the visa official only shows you are a destructive individual that does not have respect for the authority that the representative of the diplomatic office enjoys. In its place, in case you have any objection about what the official says, use a very sophisticated language and a calm tone of voice when clarifying the exploratory issue.",

          "title": "FG: We\u2019re Not Prosecuting Repentant Terrorists in Line with Global Practices",
          "text": "*Says stories of planning to recruit them into Army false, demoralising\n\n*Nigeria getting closer to an agreement with Twitter\n\nCharles Ajunwa\n\nThe federal government yesterday said the demand by some Nigerians for the prosecution of repentant Boko Haram fighters rather than granting them amnesty, was against global best practices, and that it would not accept such call.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed stated this yesterday in Washington, U.S.A., during his engagement with global media outlets, think-tanks and influencers.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cI personally spoke to the military authority before I left Nigeria and they said what they were doing was what the global practice dictates about soldiers that surrendered; that they should be treated as prisoners of war.\n\n\u201cYou cannot just shoot them because there are international conventions that give rights also to prisoners of war. What the military is doing is that, when they surrender, they profile them to ensure that they are genuine and reintegrate them into the society,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed also said government will not recruit the repentant Boko Haram fighters, who have been surrendering to the military, into the Nigerian Army as being rumoured in some quarters.\n\nThe minister described the claim as \u201cfalse and demoralising\u201d, adding: \u201cfifth columnists and naysayers to stop spewing negative and false narratives around Boko Haram members who are surrendering in droves in the North-East.\u201d\n\nHe said it was unfortunate and inconceivable that some Nigerians would be going about such fake news.\n\nNo fewer than 1,000 Boko Haram fighters and their families had handed themselves over to Army units in recent weeks in the southern Borno towns of Konduga, Bama, and Mafa.\n\nThe minister also berated those alleging that the surrendered insurgents were not actual Boko Haram fighters and that if they were, they should be shot rather than granted amnesty.\n\nMohammed said rather than changing the narratives, President Muhammadu Buhari and the military should be respectfully commended for their resourcefulness and doggedness respectively, in the fight against insurgency.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe fact that we are witnessing insurgents submitting in droves calls for commendation of our military for their doggedness.\n\n\u201cWe must not forget that two months ago, Nigerians were putting pressure on the President to recruit mercenaries to fight the war against terror because they said we were losing the war.\n\n\u201cThe President, however, remained focused and confident in his belief in the Nigerian military that they have what it takes to defeat the insurgents. We thank God that Mr. President today has been proven right.\n\n\u201cWe were able to achieve this, largely because of the leadership of Mr. President in providing the wherewithal continually to the military and ensuring that their fighting morale is sustained by way of welfare packages.\u201d\n\nMohammed also said that the situation in Afghanistan was not the same as in Nigeria because there was no time in Nigeria that the military had engaged repentant militants.\n\nFor those yet to surrendered, the minister said the military would not rest on its oars but continue to pursue Boko Haram and ISWAP members until they could no longer be harmful to Nigerians.\n\nFG Getting Closer to an Agreement with Twitter\n\nIn a related development, the federal government says Twitter has agreed to seven out of the 10 demands it made to lift the suspension on the social media platform in Nigeria.\n\nThe Information Minister also disclosed this yesterday during his engagement with global media outlets, think-tanks and influencers.\n\nThe government on June 4 announced the indefinite suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe government had said the reason for the suspension was because of the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\n\u201cWe believe that even the other three outstanding demands, are not really about whether they agreed or not but about timing and scheduling,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe adds: \u201cThat is what gave me the confidence that we are getting nearer to an agreement. As recently as last week, we exchanged correspondence with Twitter, and when I left home a few days ago, we were expecting a reply from them.\n\n\u201cIt is left with Twitter to respond to grey areas that we asked them to look into. We are not inflexible in our negotiation with Twitter because we recognise both the positive and negative aspects of the social media.\u201d\n\nThe minister said, among the demands made to Twitter, was for the platform to register as a Nigerian company, pay taxes from revenue made from the country and ensure that harmful contents were regulated.\n\nHe said the Twitter ban was effective in the country because less harmful contents had been seen on social media since then.\n\nAccording to him, other social media platforms have also been more conscious and alert to injurious contents likely to threaten national security.\n\nThe minister added that from the talks with Twitter, when the platform resumes operations in the country, it would not be business as usual.\n\n\u2018Terrorism Has No Boundary\u2019\n\nAt another forum in Germany yesterday with global media outlets, think tanks and influencers, the Minister of Information declared that terrorism had no boundary and that no part of the world is safe if it is allowed to thrive.\n\nHe underscored the need for the developed world to see terrorism as a global threat, saying: \u201cTerrorism is global and has no boundary. For the world to be saved, every corner of the world must be saved.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cWe can see from the example of the US, where Taliban takes over Afghanistan, a pointer to how difficult it is to fight terrorism driven by ideology.\n\n\u201cThe western world should look into helping developing nations like Nigeria in developing their infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThis will help to create employment and quality livelihood that will make it difficult for an ideological group like Boko Haram to recruit the youths.\u201d\n\nThe minister called for the support of the US and other countries in Nigeria\u2019s fight against the Boko Haram, adding that global support would go a long way in stamping out the menace.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Bichi is a subset of the entire Kano State, look at the economy and the activities that have happened in Bichi today by virtue of Mr. President\u2019s son\u2019s wedding to Sarkin Bichi\u2019s daughter. So if we can look beyond this country to foster unity, all the governors are here, from even different parties, PDP governors are here, APC governors came. So, there are some things that can bind us together in this country. So if we focus on what will bind us the country will be better and things will be easy for us.\n\n\u201cEven with the issue of security, we all went to Bichi and everything went well and peacefully. Tomorrow it can be anywhere else in the country.\u201d\n\nAlso at the event were former President Goodluck Jonathan, former Vice President Abubarkar Atiku, and a former president of Niger Republic, Mahamadou Issoufou.\n\nOthers were the Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari; Secretary to the Federal Government, Boss Mustapha and IGP Usman Baba Alkali.\n\nThe President\u2019s delegation had the Minister of Agriculture, Sabo Nanono; Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika; Minister of Defense, Bashir Magashi; and Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Hussein Adamu.\n\nOther distinguished personalities at the event were the Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje; Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal; Adamawa States Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri; Governor Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State; Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State; Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State; Minister of Interior, Ra\u2019uf Aregbesola and Senate President, Ahmed Lawal.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Mele Kyari: It\u2019s huge victory for Nigeria, NPDC will use it to bolster production\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nThe Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has hailed the recent Appeal Court judgment affirming its ownership of the Oil Mining License 11 (OML 11), describing it as a huge victory for Nigeria and the beginning of moves to address decades of restiveness in the host community.\n\nOML 11 is in Ogoniland, Rivers State, South-eastern Niger Delta and contains 33 oil and gas fields.\n\nThe Appeal Court sitting in Abuja had on Monday upturned the August 23, 2019 ruling of the Federal High Court, Abuja which held that the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) was entitled to the renewal of the lease on OML 11.\n\nIn the ruling, the Appellate Court held that the minister of petroleum resources \u201chas the discretion whether or not to renew the OML 11 Lease in favour of SPDC.\u201d\n\nThe Court further held that the Minister rightly exercised his discretion in awarding the OML 11 Lease to NPDC, a subsidiary of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nA statement yesterday by the Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division of the NNPC, Garba Deen Muhammad, quoted the NNPC Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, as saying \u201cthe ruling has paved the way for the NPDC to lead a formidable OML 11 team towards bolstering productivity in a responsible, efficient, environmentally friendly, and sustainable manner.\u201d\n\nKyari adds: \u201cAccordingly, resumption of operations on OML 11 will demonstrate the NPDC\u2019s full commitment to develop and add value to its communities and the nation as a whole.\n\n\u201cWe now have an opportunity to reconstruct a new beginning on OML 11, driven by global best practices and a social contract that would put the people and environment of the Niger Delta above pecuniary considerations.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge victory for the government and people of Nigeria as we now have the impetus to responsibly unlock the oil and gas reserves the block offers for the benefit of all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe statement further explained that efforts by the NPDC to take over the assets and operations were in full gear, adding that the company \u201cis working closely with all stakeholders and partners to achieve the new vision of responsible, smart engineering and environmental sustainability that the federal government has endorsed for OML 11.\u201d\n\nThe NNPC GMD stated that the NPDC \u201cwill pursue promotion of clean energy via its gas production with prospects of gas-to-power initiatives to light up opportunities in the region,\u201d and provide the much deserved industrialization.\n\nThe statement noted that the environment would be a top priority for NPDC\u2019s operations, as well as implementation of a robust host community engagement strategy to address subsisting issues, while agreeing to a transparent engagement model going forward.\n\nThe NNPC cautioned against any further legal challenge by the SPDC, stressing that it was about time Nigeria derived the benefit of the OML11 after over three decades.\n\n\u201cIt is time to roll back the decades of despair and destruction with the emphatic Appeal Court ruling. It is time to unlock opportunities for economic development in the region.\n\n\u201cIn the light of their inability to work on the Ogoni region of the block for over 30 years and the new beginning this judgement presents, further legal action by Shell will not only be futile, it would be depriving Nigeria of an opportunity to make meaningful gains from OML 11 when the nation needs all the revenue it can get to move Nigeria forward,\u201d the GMD said.\n\nThe NNPC, the NPDC is now set to begin oil production activities at OML 11, after years of dispute over the asset.\n\nThough, a Joint Venture (JV), Shell had not produced a drop of crude oil from Ogoniland for several years and that partners were not earning revenue as a result of the development.\n\nIn 2019, President Muhammadu Buhari ordered the NNPC, through the NPDC to take over the operatorship of the asset from SPDC.\n\nAt the time, a letter signed by the late Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, urged the national oil company to take charge not later than April 30, 2019 \u201cand ensure smooth re-entry given the delicate situation in Ogoniland.\u201d\n\nOML 11 remains one of the most important oil blocks in Nigeria. Located in a swampy terrain, it has Port Harcourt in the northwest of the block, while the major yard and logistics base at Onne is sited by the Bonny River.\n\nWhile the NNPC will take over the operatorship of the facility, it was however learnt that it will not affect the joint ownership arrangement of the block by four partners.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "National Assembly members are bracing for a face-off with their principal officers after finding out they had been grossly cheated in the sharing of a multimillion-dollar bribe to ensure the passage of the new Petroleum Industry Act.\n\nThree senators and two House members confirmed to The Peoples Gazette following an initial tip-off that least $10 million was paid in cash to the federal lawmakers to help accelerate the passage of the bill despite pervasive opposition to a clause that granted only three percent of upstream oil companies\u2019 operating income to host communities.\n\nSpeaker Femi Gbajabiamiala, Senate President Ahmad Lawan\n\nSpecifically, the newspaper reported that the lawmakers are fuming over what one of them termed as \u201cgreedy misconduct\u201d of Senate President Ahmad Lawan and Speaker Femi Gbajabiamiala, who were accused of taking $2 million each in cash bribes to push the bill through despite protests from host communities.\n\nSaharaReporters had exclusively reported earlier today (Friday) that the chief pricinpal lawmaker in the Upper Chamber, Lawan and his counterpart in the Lower Chamber, Gbajabiamila were paid in dollars (millions of naira) to guarantee the passage of the controversial Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) recently signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nA top source told SaharaReporters that other federal lawmakers \u2013senators and House of Representatives' members \u2013also received bribes in dollars to ensure the passage of the bill.\n\n\"Lawan was paid $2 million (N823 million) while Gbajabiamila was paid $1.5 million (N617 million) as bribes,\" the source said.\n\nThe payment of the monies was said to have been facilitated by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva.\n\n\"Each senator was paid $20, 000 (N8.2 million) while members of the lower chamber (House of Representatives) were paid $5, 000 (N2 million) each,\" the source added.\n\nHowever, the newspaper revealed that a Nigerian billionaire, probably of the largest contemporary stake in the oil and gas industry was said to have provided $2 million alone.\n\nOther firms and individuals in the oil and gas industry provided the remaining $8 million. The Gazette could not publicly identify the Billionaire.\n\n\u201cThe Senate President received $2 million and the Speaker received $2 million. Their greedy misconduct was recently exposed to us and we will seriously take up the matter when we resume from the annual recess next month,\u201d a senator, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid charges of breach of privilege, said.\n\n\u201cFrom what I can volunteer, many senators were given $20,000 before and after the PIB was passed, depending on their availability,\u201d the senator said.\n\nAnother lawmaker furious about the affair admitted to The Gazette that he received $5,000, but said he didn\u2019t know it was part of a multimillion-dollar payout to lawmakers to pass the bill.\n\nThe lawmaker said, \u201cThey gave me $5,000 and said it was for us to buy biscuits for our children for labouring day and night to get the bill to the stage of passage,\u201d the lawmaker said under anonymity. \u201cTo God, I did not know that it was about $10 million that they received and some crooks calling themselves leaders got $2 million each for themselves.\n\n\u201cWe will protest the matter after our break because some people have to realise that they don\u2019t have two heads and we have to fight for our rights and privileges as members of the National Assembly,\u201d the lawmaker added. \u201cEach one of us is representing a constituency and that makes us all equal because no one at the National Assembly is representing more than one constituency.\u201d\n\nHost communities, largely of the oil-rich Niger-Delta region, had criticised that 3% is inadequate to address decaded of environmental degradation and neglect inflicted on traditional settlers. The communities said they would accept at least 10 per cent, even though the administration initially proposed five per cent.\n\nBut the state-operated Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and other operators dug their heels in, saying any sharing formular that offers more than 3% to host communities will cut too deep into their revenue margins and drive away potential investors in the country\u2019s wobbling oil sector.\n\nNotwitthsatnding the standoff at rowdy and inconclusive sessions at the Chambers, lawmakers last month finally passed the Petroleum Industry Bill that sought to repackage the sector and restructure the NNPC as a commercial enterprise rather than a federal charter. Buhari signed the bill into law this week despite the controversies surrounding the meagre three per cent equity stake for host communities.\n\nIt was learnt that lawmakers accepted cash inducements to pass the bill, which was proposed by Buhari\u2019s government. Lawmakers said the cash logistics was coordinated by state petroleum minister Timipre Sylva and Senator Albert Akpan (PDP-Akwa Ibom).\n\nA senator revealed to The Gazette that Mr Akpan sent one of his aides to deliver $20,000 to him at his office.\n\n\u201cHe (Mr Akpan) sent a woman from his office to give me $20,000. They said the money came from people who have investments in the oil and gas and they wanted to appreciate us for our dedication in seeing the bill through after so many years of failed efforts,\u201d the senator said.\n\nAnother lawmaker who confirmed the bribery said it was a serious scandal waiting to explode because a lawmaker had already mentioned the matter in the House' WhatsApp group weeks ago.\n\n\u201cA lawmaker protested the sharing formula but no one responded or engaged him in the House' WhatsApp group,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cSo I fear that many colleagues are angry about the whole thing.\u201d\n\nA lawmaker said the unrest could easily have been avoided had the leaders properly conducted themselves in handling the largesse.\n\n\u201cIt is common across the world for lawmakers to be offered gratification,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cBut it has to be equitably distributed so that no one feels cheated or left out.\u201d",

          "title": "IDP Chronicles: Niger widows beg to survive after gruesome killing of their husbands",
          "text": "In northern Nigeria, repeated attacks by bandits have displaced several families, and women are among the worst hit. With little support available, many of the widows now depend on handouts to survive and feed their children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHalima Yusuf, a 30-year-old widow and mother of four, is from Kushaku, a village close to Erena town in Shiroro LGA of Niger state.\n\nWhen Kushaku came under attack, residents were forced to flee to safer areas. Some fled to the bushes, hiding behind huge rocks and thick grasses, but Halima and her husband, Lawal, resettled in Erena \u2014 a place they considered relatively peaceful.\n\nBut that peace did not last for long.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne Friday in April 2021, the bandits stormed their new home in Erena around 2am. They invaded several houses in the town and forcefully dragged residents outside. Some were tied to trees while others were beaten to a pulp.\n\nHalima, who was heavily pregnant at the time, said her children were shivering with fear while the bandits wreaked havoc and eventually killed her husband.\n\n\u201cThe bandits walked to my husband who was tied to a tree, pointing their monstrous weapon at him,\u201d she recounted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey told him they were ordered to kill him if they found him. I looked at him weeping silently, his eye was already covered with fear. So, he tried to untie the rope when they entered other houses to extort them, but when he eventually did and stood up to run, we heard a terrifying gunshot and before I could blink an eye, my husband was already lying helplessly on the ground.\n\n\u201cLawal was a good husband. He catered for all our needs, ensured we always had food to eat and we never lacked anything.\u201d\n\nAfter killing Halima\u2019s husband, the bandits moved to other houses to loot and destroy. She used the opportunity to flee into the bush with her children, where they hid behind a rock.\n\n\u201cI hid behind that rock for hours. When I was sure they had left, I asked my children to wait for me and I quickly ran to where my husband was lying dead,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Halima, three young girls were raped that day, while six others got kidnapped. Two of them have been released but the remaining four are still in captivity, she said.\n\nHalima explained that she may never be able to forget the memory of her husband\u2019s killing.\n\n\u201cI can never forget that Friday, the day I lost my husband,\u201d she said, crying.\n\nLife as a widow\n\nAfter the tragedy, Halima took her children to an internally displaced persons (IDP) camp at Central Primary School Erena. While there, she welcomed her new child \u2014 a baby boy. They lived there for two months until the floods came and they, again, had to relocate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe inclement situation in the school forced her to return to the house where her husband was murdered \u2014 where she, daily, relives the horrific events of that Friday in April.\n\nTo survive and feed her children, Halima says she leaves the house every day to seek handouts and sometimes goes from door to door to beg for food. Her children have also dropped out of school.\n\n\u201cI usually stay by the roadside hoping to get some money when the hunger gets intense. I didn\u2019t want the neighbours, people around who give us food, to get tired of us. So, I tried to find my way sometimes,\u201d she said.\n\nFrom farming to begging\n\nRabi Abdullahi, 25, said her husband, with whom she has four children, was killed in Kushaku during an attack in 2020. She said the bandits broke down doors and windows, after which they violently assembled the occupants outside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy husband did not come out, he hid behind the door to the room. He must have thought it was safe. They shot him immediately they discovered him hiding behind the door,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey killed my husband before my eyes, I saw him fading in and out of consciousness, I saw him dying.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rabi, she ran to the bush where she lived with the children for many weeks and only returned to Kushaku when there was relative peace. But when the attacks became repeated, she was forced to relocate to Erena.\n\nUnlike Halima, who was a full housewife, Rabi was a farmer but now has to beg for alms to provide for her children.\n\n\u201cBack then in Kushaku, I used to farm very well. Sometimes, I helped my husband on his farm but we can no longer go to our farms because we don\u2019t want to return as corpses,\u201d she said.\n\nPersistent violent attacks coupled with threats and fear of more have turned Kushaku into a desolate community as most of the residents have fled.\n\n\u201cAs I talk to you now, there is currently nobody in the town, even the district head had deserted the town,\u201d Rabi added.\n\nScared to farm, nothing to eat\n\nHalima Gunduma was widowed after her husband was killed on a farm where he was working to bring home food for their seven children.\n\n\u201cThe bandits had warned people from Kushaku against being seen on the farms but people kept going because they needed to eat,\u201d she said.\n\nSince his death, Gunduma dreads going to any farm, and as a result, she is unable to provide for her children. Hunger has now turned them into beggars, she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to die and leave my children behind in this unfair world,\u201d she lamented.\n\nShe said the community once took N4 million to the bandits as payment for peace and to allow them to go to the farms, but despite assurances that they will stop attacking them, they keep coming back, each time leaving more destruction in their wake.\n\nWith farming \u2014 the only source of livelihood for most Kushaku women \u2014 no longer an option, they have resorted to begging on the streets of Erena.\n\n\u201cMallama, for the sake of Allah and his messenger, help us. Tell the governor to help us, relate our sufferings to him. Tell him hunger is killing us slowly, tell him we don\u2019t have anywhere to run to and our children have all dropped out of schools, tell him\u2026\u201d Gunduma wept bitterly.",

          "text": "The federal ministry of communications and digital economy says it generated N1.054 trillion as revenue for the federal government in two years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsa Pantami, minister of communications and digital economy, spoke during the virtual inauguration of the 12th batch of the digital economy projects at the Digital Economy Complex, Mbora, Abuja.\n\nPantami said the communications and digital economy sector played a huge role in lifting the country out of recession, with ICT recording the highest growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cThe initiatives of the ministry are geared towards supporting the federal government in its 3 main focus areas- economy, security and anti-corruption,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur activities in the communications and digital economy sector have greatly enhanced the economy of Nigeria. For example, the sector played a pivotal role in lifting the Nigerian economy out of recession, with the ICT sector recording the highest growth rate in the 4th Quarter of 2020 (14.70%), as reported by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and stated by Mr. President.\n\n\u201cThis growth rate was the only double-digit growth rate and it exceeded the aggregate growth rates of all the 2nd to the 7th fastest growing sectors. The ICT sector also had the highest growth rate in the year 2020 and the 1st Quarter of 2021.\n\n\u201cIt is also noteworthy that the telecommunications sub-sector grew at 15.90% and this was its highest growth rate over the past decade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the ministry and its parastatals have generated over N1 trillion for the federal government in less than 2 years, this translates to an average of about N44 Billion every month or over N1.4 Billion every day.\u201d\n\nPantami added that about N360 billion of the revenue was largely from Spectrum, allocated by the National Frequency Management Council (NFMC), under the chairmanship of the minister, to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) for commercial purposes.\n\nHe added that over N600 billion was paid by ICT companies to the account of the federal government through the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS).\n\n\u201cFurthermore, over ninety four billion naira *N94,000,000,000) was generated for the federal government and approved by the national assembly in line with relevant laws, as part of the 2020 appropriation for personnel, capital projects, capacity building, interventions, etc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe IT Projects Clearance Programme also saved over Five Billion Naira (N5,478,007,325.23) for the federal government.\u201d\n\nPantami noted that the statistics and figures discussed earlier were generated from the various reports submitted by the ministry and parastatals, as part of his supervision.\n\nHe commended the CEOs of all the parastatals under the ministry for their commitment and urged them to redouble their efforts in developing Nigeria\u2019s digital economy.\n\nPantami also encouraged all the host communities and beneficiaries of the ministry\u2019s projects and programmes to ensure that they take full advantage of the facilities and skills for the benefit of their communities and the nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe digital economy projects inaugurated include the e-Accessibility Centre in Bauchi State Orphans and Vulnerable School, Bauchi; the Digital Economy Centre and e-Learning Facility at Ogba Grammar School, Lagos; the Digital Economy Centre and e-Learning Facility at St Paul Secondary School, Eke, Enugu.\n\nThe Digital Economy Centre and e-Learning Facility at the Federal Character Commission, Abuja; the Emergency Communications Centre at Leko Abdulrahman Hospital, Daura; the e-Accessibility Centre at the Alderstown Schools for the Deaf, Warri; and the Virtual Examination Centre, at the College of Education, Argungu, Kebbi State.",

          "text": "The federal ministry of communications and digital economy says it generated N1.054 trillion as revenue for the federal government in two years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsa Pantami, minister of communications and digital economy, spoke during the virtual inauguration of the 12th batch of the digital economy projects at the Digital Economy Complex, Mbora, Abuja.\n\nPantami said the communications and digital economy sector played a huge role in lifting the country out of recession, with ICT recording the highest growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cThe initiatives of the ministry are geared towards supporting the federal government in its 3 main focus areas- economy, security and anti-corruption,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur activities in the communications and digital economy sector have greatly enhanced the economy of Nigeria. For example, the sector played a pivotal role in lifting the Nigerian economy out of recession, with the ICT sector recording the highest growth rate in the 4th Quarter of 2020 (14.70%), as reported by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and stated by Mr. President.\n\n\u201cThis growth rate was the only double-digit growth rate and it exceeded the aggregate growth rates of all the 2nd to the 7th fastest growing sectors. The ICT sector also had the highest growth rate in the year 2020 and the 1st Quarter of 2021.\n\n\u201cIt is also noteworthy that the telecommunications sub-sector grew at 15.90% and this was its highest growth rate over the past decade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the ministry and its parastatals have generated over N1 trillion for the federal government in less than 2 years, this translates to an average of about N44 Billion every month or over N1.4 Billion every day.\u201d\n\nPantami added that about N360 billion of the revenue was largely from Spectrum, allocated by the National Frequency Management Council (NFMC), under the chairmanship of the minister, to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) for commercial purposes.\n\nHe added that over N600 billion was paid by ICT companies to the account of the federal government through the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS).\n\n\u201cFurthermore, over ninety four billion naira *N94,000,000,000) was generated for the federal government and approved by the national assembly in line with relevant laws, as part of the 2020 appropriation for personnel, capital projects, capacity building, interventions, etc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe IT Projects Clearance Programme also saved over Five Billion Naira (N5,478,007,325.23) for the federal government.\u201d\n\nPantami noted that the statistics and figures discussed earlier were generated from the various reports submitted by the ministry and parastatals, as part of his supervision.\n\nHe commended the CEOs of all the parastatals under the ministry for their commitment and urged them to redouble their efforts in developing Nigeria\u2019s digital economy.\n\nPantami also encouraged all the host communities and beneficiaries of the ministry\u2019s projects and programmes to ensure that they take full advantage of the facilities and skills for the benefit of their communities and the nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe digital economy projects inaugurated include the e-Accessibility Centre in Bauchi State Orphans and Vulnerable School, Bauchi; the Digital Economy Centre and e-Learning Facility at Ogba Grammar School, Lagos; the Digital Economy Centre and e-Learning Facility at St Paul Secondary School, Eke, Enugu.\n\nThe Digital Economy Centre and e-Learning Facility at the Federal Character Commission, Abuja; the Emergency Communications Centre at Leko Abdulrahman Hospital, Daura; the e-Accessibility Centre at the Alderstown Schools for the Deaf, Warri; and the Virtual Examination Centre, at the College of Education, Argungu, Kebbi State.",

          "title": "Explained: Can the Nigerian government really spy on your WhatsApp messages?",
          "text": "Barely a month after blocking access to Twitter, the Nigerian government allocated \u20a61.93 billion ($4.6 million) to the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) for a \u201cWhatsApp Intercept Solution\u201d.\n\nAn interception solution for WhatsApp would allow an external party (the government, in this case) to access, monitor, or block communications (calls and chats) carried out by users via the app.\n\nThe move is reportedly aimed at protecting Nigeria from cybercrime and terrorism perpetrated through such messaging platforms. However, it is seen by media stakeholders and activists as yet another attempt to restrict civil liberties.\n\nHowever, some uncertainty hangs over how Nigerian authorities plan to go about intercepting WhatsApp, particularly because the platform uses end-to-end encryption for its messages. TechCabal examines the possibility of such interception and technical intricacies involved.\n\nWhat is end-to-end encryption?\n\nEnd-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a technology that ensures chats can only be read by the sender and recipient and not intercepted by a middleman. Messages are scrambled when they leave the sender\u2019s device and can be decoded only by the recipient\u2019s device.\n\nWhatsApp uses the popular Signal encryption protocol that involves exchanging unique security keys that are verified between users, to avoid any kind of interception by a middle person.\n\nWhatever is said between users with WhatsApp is guaranteed to be private during transmission.\n\nAccording to a cybersecurity expert who spoke on the condition of anonymity, intercepting this flow of messages during transit across the internet is near-impossible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just impossible. The government would have to force every WhatsApp user in Nigeria to use a particular security key,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if somehow it\u2019s pulled off and some messages are accessed, the encryption makes it much harder, if not impossible, to read them.\u201d\n\nHowever, an interception is possible if there\u2019s a vulnerability in the implementation of the encryption system and that\u2019s one problem with WhatsApp\u2019s security.\n\nBreaking down the WhatsApp encryption\n\nOn WhatsApp, new encryption keys are generated for users who log in with a new device, and messages that were in transit to them while offline get re-encrypted and resent automatically.\n\nThe sender does not get an opportunity to stop the messages from being resent nor to verify the recipient.\n\nBy forcing users to change security keys without informing them, WhatsApp\u2019s encryption can be circumvented and a third party could spy on messages without the app knowing, a security researcher found in 2017.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIn a situation where a WhatsApp user\u2019s sim card was stolen and put in another phone, this re-encryption of messages could allow a third party to intercept and read previously undelivered chats.\n\nBut the security threats from the design, which is meant to make WhatsApp more convenient to use, are small and unlikely to affect most users. In most cases, it would work for potential targeting of individuals, and not mass surveillance, like the Nigerian government probably intends to do.\n\nTo fix the issue, a sender can activate security notification settings in the WhatsApp app and would be informed whenever the recipient\u2019s key changes.\n\nOpen the app and go to the Settings menu. In there, click Account and then Security. The page has just one option: \u201cShow Security Notifications\u201d \u2013 turn on that option and the app will send an alert every time the security key changes.\n\nStorage loopholes\n\nThere are also vulnerabilities with how WhatsApp messages are stored, which could be exploited by hackers.\n\nWhatsApp chats are saved in four locations, from where data can be retrieved later. These include the phone memories of both the sender and receiver, WhatsApp\u2019s server, and on the cloud, depending on if a user allowed it in the app\u2019s settings.\n\nSpyware dropped on the phone of either the sender or receiver could read the messages before they are encrypted or after they are decrypted. On a few occasions, hackers and government agencies have been alleged to use spyware for decrypted messages on targeted phones.\n\nAn instance is the hacking of several WhatsApp accounts in 2019 by the Pegasus remote surveillance software made by Israel-based cyber tech firm, NSO. Ex-Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, saw his phone hacked in 2018 after receiving a WhatsApp message purportedly sent by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe cloud backup of messages can also be hacked. In the case of WhatsApp, users get the option to back up chats to Google Drive or iCloud but the copies aren\u2019t protected by the end-to-end encryption. Hence, an attacker could access old chats if they hack into a cloud storage account.\n\nOn national security grounds, the Nigerian government could approach WhatsApp to request access to certain information stored on its servers but not chats because that violates privacy laws, the expert said.\n\nChat platforms often don\u2019t store messages on their servers. WhatsApp claims it only does so if chats cannot be delivered immediately \u2013 for example, in instances where the receiver is offline, the sender\u2019s messages are kept on the server for 30 days. Once they\u2019re delivered, Whatsapp deletes the messages from the server.\n\nWhatsApp has repeatedly said that with end-to-end encryption, only both parties in the conversation and nobody in between, not even the company itself, can decode what\u2019s sent. Thus, it has often expressed helplessness to law enforcement agencies pressing for access to private messages, in countries like India.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhatsApp Messenger enjoys a reputation of confidentiality but even encryption has its vulnerabilities.\n\nIn theory, any device or service is susceptible to hackers, but encryption technology offers protection in most cases and WhatsApp is often quick to issue updates including security fixes.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the Nigerian government intends to go about tracking WhatsApp messages after earmarking billions of naira for the said interception solution.\n\nWith over 90 million Nigerian users per data from Statista, WhatsApp is the most popular social media platform used in the country. Any attempt to tamper with the application would thus affect a massive number of people.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Meet Regina Honu, a Ghanaian software developer teaching thousands of girls to code",
          "text": "Choosing the name of her company was the easiest aspect of Regina Honu\u2019s journey.\n\nIt only took her a few hours to connect the dots. She wanted her business to be unique; the word unique in Ghanaian language Twi translated to Soronko, so she named her company Soronko Academy \u2014 the first coding and human-centred design school for children and young adults in West Africa.\n\n\u201cSome people take days to pick their company name, I tell entrepreneurs that they\u2019re majoring in the minor. I say pick what you like and keep it moving, you can build a brand on it,\u201d she said over a call.\n\nAlmost ten years after she made that decision, Soronko Academy has trained over 20,000 young people in Ghana and Burkina Faso and connected about 5,000 of them to job opportunities. She\u2019s won multiple awards from brands such as Coca Cola and CNN for her contribution to tech in Ghana and Africa. She\u2019s also a Mandela Washington Fellow and an Ashoka Fellow.\n\nBut the road to starting Soronko Academy was paved with many obstacles and difficult decisions. She has worked at two major banks in Ghana as the only woman in the IT department, participated in a reality show and even almost joined Microsoft but turned back to pursue her dream of ensuring that young ladies have access to the same opportunities that she did while growing up.\n\nPlaying PAC-man, flying with rockets and ending up in the Kitchen\n\nHonu grew up in the 90s, a time where there were only a few reputable careers that people could explore. At the age of 12, she wanted to be a doctor until her father brought home a personal computer (PC). She mostly played PAC-man on it, which sparked her interest in computer science and inspired her to want to create her own game.\n\nA few months later, she watched a movie about a man being able to fly with a rocket strapped to his back. So she decided she was going to build her own rocket. To show how determined she was to make this a reality, she sketched a rocket and showed it to her teacher who quickly downplayed her ambition.\n\n\u201cHe said it\u2019s impossible, girls don\u2019t build rockets and I\u2019ll end up in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nThat experience made her shelve her ambition to build rockets and detest the fact that people always told her what she could do based on her gender. From then on she decided to become a computer scientist \u2014 the only one in her class with such ambition.\n\nFailure is not final\n\nIn her first year in senior secondary school, Honu had her first taste of failure during an Inter-school quiz competition. She missed a question in the final causing the school to not clinch the winning spot.\n\n\u201cI told myself I wasn\u2019t going to try anything again, I\u2019m a failure in life.\u201d\n\nThe experience left a sour taste in her mouth but being one of the brightest in her school meant that when another competition came along she was selected to represent her school. This time she was determined to go all out and win.\n\nIn order to impress the judges, she went as far as learning some Latin. Fortunately, she ended up winning the competition. This win was a huge confidence booster and a reminder that failure is not final.\n\nThe best part about winning the competition was that it gave her the opportunity to spend one year in Norway on a school exchange program.\n\nA year in Norway\n\nAt the age of 16, Honu had her first exposure to a different culture. She continued as a science student but quickly found out that things were different in Norway. The focus in her new school was more on comprehension but she was used to memorizing and regurgitating information without necessarily understanding it.\n\n\u201cI found out that I didn\u2019t understand anything. I could draw a very complex electrical circuit but if you give me two wires and a bulb to connect, I\u2019ll be lost.\u201d\n\nIn Norway the mode of training was different; students had access to formula books and calculators. All they had to do was understand how to apply the formula. She was initially lost but soon found her feet as she adapted to the more practical learning style.\n\nOutside of schooling, she learnt how to ride a bicycle, rollerblade and climb mountains. She even got a taste of activism by joining a protest. The experience taught her that she could do more than she thought she could.\n\n\u201cI think that Norwegian experience has shaped the way I am. People always ask me, were you born and raised in Ghana you seem different. I came back with a different way of thinking. \u201c\n\nGetting into University\n\nWhen it was time to choose where to get her first degree, there was some dispute between whether she should school abroad or remain in Ghana. Her mother opted for the former while she wanted the latter.\n\nFor Honu, she had lived abroad and wasn\u2019t fascinated by the idea. She was also concerned about the prospects of travelling out and not returning. She didn\u2019t want to be part of the brain drain phenomenon.\n\nHonu won the dispute but was faced with one more challenge. She wanted to study computer science but wasn\u2019t impressed by the fact that courses being taught in the universities in Ghana weren\u2019t evolving quickly.\n\n\n\nIt seemed like she\u2019ll have to concede to her mum until her dad spotted an advert in the newspaper for Ashesi University, a new school that was recruiting its first set of students. Asheshi promised its future students a world-class education with an up-to-date curriculum.\n\nConversation between Regina Honu and students of Ashesi University during a visit. Photo Credit: Ashesi Unversity\n\n\u201cI remember at that time, Ashesi was just a house at Labone. I walked in and saw that the university was a house but it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, she got into Ashesi to study computer science. At that time the total population of the school was 30 students, with 14 of them in the computer science program.\n\nAmerican futurist, Alvin Toffler is credited with saying that the illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn. Honu definitely agrees with this quote as she spent her first year at Ashesi unlearning many of the wrong ideas she had.\n\nGoing through University wasn\u2019t without its own struggles. In her second year, she found visual basics difficult to understand and considered switching to a business major.\n\nBut on her way to the dean\u2019s office she had a rethink.\n\n\u201cI asked myself, \u2018Is this how I\u2019m going to give up?\u2019 I decided to give it one more shot. I immersed myself in work. They\u2019ll give us group assignments and I will do it myself. I carried the load on my head, I was doing all the work and it became easy for me.\u201d\n\nIn her third year, she got her first internship at a software company. At this company, the stamina she had built for solving difficult problems came in handy, as Ashesi students were expected to go above and beyond.\n\n\u201cThere were times when my boss would give me tasks and I wouldn\u2019t understand it or know what to do but how would I say \u2018excuse me, sir, they didn\u2019t teach us that in class.\u2019 So I\u2019ll take out time to understand the question first before even trying to answer it, then go on to solve it.\u201d\n\nAfter the internship, she was retained by the company while still in school. This experience was her first taste of independence as she had moved on from relying on her dad who was giving her pocket money.\n\nWelcome to the Corporate world\n\nAfter school, she returned to work for the software company briefly before joining Zenith bank.\n\nTwo things attracted her to the bank: an increase in the pay and the expectation that because the bank closed to customers by 5 pm, the workers also closed at that time. But upon joining the bank she found out that the latter was not the case.\n\nShe quickly excelled on the job and became popular after she built an intranet system for the bank. She was responsible for re-engineering the bank\u2019s IT products used in Lagos for Ghana.\n\nBeing the only female in the IT department at the bank came with its own challenges. During meetings the men on the team tried to apportion the job of taking minutes or getting refreshments to her. She grew a thick skin to ward off such stereotypical remarks. She also had to learn to work with her male colleagues without bruising their egos.\n\n\u201cThe male ego is very interesting, if we\u2019re all working on a problem and I arrive at the solution first, I can\u2019t announce it because it\u2019ll come off as a show-off. I had to learn to bring everyone to my way of thinking and then have us arrive at the solution together.\u201d\n\nEveryone in the department got promoted\n\nHaving proved herself on the job, she decided to apply for an opening for the role of head of electronic banking \u2014 naturally, she expected to get the job. At the interview, she noticed something was off, the interviewer first verified she was in the right place and then went on to ask her non-work related questions.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t give me the benefit of doubt. He felt that I couldn\u2019t be the head of electronic banking. I was devastated.\u201d\n\nWhile sharing her awkward interview experience with a colleague, she mentioned her grade level at the bank. It was then she learnt that her colleagues were on higher grades than her and she was the lowest paid in the department.\n\n\u201cI was the lowest-paid not because I was female but because I didn\u2019t know how to negotiate. They don\u2019t tell women on the continent how to negotiate, you don\u2019t ask for more. While growing up, you take what you\u2019re given, smile and say thank you. There\u2019s nothing like asking for more. That\u2019s insolent behaviour.\u201d\n\nArmed with this information, she requested to be promoted to a particular grade or she\u2019ll resign. Her request was granted but ironically, her colleagues were also promoted to make it seem like a general department-wide promotion.\n\nThe Apprentice Africa\n\nIn the midst of all this, she took unpaid leave to participate in a reality TV show The Apprentice Africa; for her, it was an opportunity to get an MBA training. She didn\u2019t win the competition but it equipped her with a valuable understanding of business concepts and showed her a glimpse of how reality TV shows work.\n\n\u201cI was a resource person but I didn\u2019t assert myself, I was a bit shy. The thing with reality TV is that they create characters. They only edit it and show places of you behaving in a particular way. If you\u2019re loud, they show that, if you\u2019re quiet that\u2019s what they show.\u201d\n\nThe participants of The Apprentice Africa. Don\u2019t bother looking for Regina Honu, she\u2019s not in this picture.\n\nUpon leaving the show, she remembers that one of the crew persons walked up to her and said she\u2019ll be a great team player but not a leader.\n\n\u201cI was like hmm, maybe it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nShe got an offer to work for Bank PHB, headline sponsor of the show, but couldn\u2019t imagine living in the fast-paced Lagos, so she returned back to Ghana.\n\nSame experience at another bank and turning away from a job at Microsoft\n\nShe eventually left Zenith bank for Fidelity bank, a Ghanaian Bank. And it was the same experience all over again.\n\nIt was at this point that the idea to start her own company came but she shelved it at first.\n\n\u201cI always say I put a snooze button on my dream.

I never saw myself that way.\u201d\n\nWhile at the bank, she got an opportunity to interview at Microsoft. She went through the process and got to travel to Seattle at Microsoft head office. While waiting for her turn, she made up her mind that she\u2019ll return to Ghana to build something.\n\nResigning from her Job\n\nThe morning of the day Honu resigned from her job, she didn\u2019t know it would happen. She was used to a certain comfortable life, earning a decent salary, but she wasn\u2019t happy.\n\n\u201cI told my friends that I wanted to resign and they were like no, it\u2019s a bad idea, don\u2019t be stupid. Bonus is coming. I just had that feeling that if I didn\u2019t do it that day. I won\u2019t have the courage to do that again.\u201d\n\nSo she took the jump, resigned, bought a computer and desktop to start training kids.\n\nShe also decided to move back to her parent\u2019s house to reduce costs and increase her runway. That was the start of Soronko Academy.\n\nRegina working with some students at Soronko Academy\n\nFinding the right kind of love\n\nAfter calling off a three-year-long relationship with a guy, who was putting up with her. Honu wasn\u2019t sure she might find the right man and was ready to make peace with that.\n\n\u201cHe felt that as soon as he put a ring on it, I\u2019ll start behaving like a typical Ghanaian woman. I remember attending a particular event where everyone kept coming to me and it was as if he was invisible. He was so angry. I started seeing that he couldn\u2019t deal with a woman who would outshine him.\u201d\n\nShe eventually met her husband on an interview set, a South African who was on holiday in Ghana. In 2015, they got married.\n\nRichard and Regina Honu on their wedding day. Photo Credit: Regina Honu\n\n\u201cI always advise women that who we marry is important, it makes a difference. The fact that my husband is supportive allows me to be different.\u201d\n\nThese days she spends her free time with her husband and daughter.\n\n10 years and counting\n\nIt\u2019s been almost 10 years since Honu started Soronko Academy, for her there\u2019s still so much more to do. She\u2019s looking to get a bigger space in order to accommodate more women and run a residential program.\n\nThese days her number one pet peeve is people asking her to do something else, that\u2019s she has done enough.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now doing some programs in the other Ghanaian regions and some women don\u2019t have an idea of what an email address is. So we still have a long way to go, we shouldn\u2019t count the minorities and privileged as progress.\u201d\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria has just frozen the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove and Chaka for the next six months.\n\nAccording to The Whistler, the Federal High Court in Abuja has granted an exparte motion which sought temporary freezing of bank accounts belonging to these online investment and trading platforms where Nigerians are transacting business online.\n\nThe motion was filed by Chief Micheal Kaase Aondoakaa, SAN, on behalf of the Central Bank Of Nigeria Governor for the purpose of probing the financial activities of these four fintech companies in Nigeria.\n\nThe CBN alleged that Rise Vest Technologies Limited, Bamboo Systems Technology Limited, Chaka Technologies Limited and Trove Technologies Limited were complicit in operating without license as asset management companies \u201cand utilizing FX sourced from the Nigerian FX market for purchasing foreign bonds/shares in contravention of the CBN circular referenced TED/FEM/FPC/GEN/01/012, dated July 01, 2015.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor told Justice Ahmed Mohammed that the foreign exchange deals done with the defendants were making the Naira weaker to the United States dollars, hence, the need to block 15 of their accounts for about 180 days.\n\nNotably, all four companies affected by this action have gotten licenses from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate as digital platforms for buying and selling stocks.\n\nIn response to this announcement, Risevest\u2019s CEO Eke Eleanya Urum and Bamboo have come out on Twitter (that\u2019s banned) to assure users of Risevest that trading activities will continue as usual and the issue will be sorted out with the regulators.\n\nHey guys, in respect to the most recent news regarding @Risevest and our FX dealings, rest assured all user investments and funds are safely managed, funding and withdrawals will continue to be processed as normal and all our US operations are intact. \u2014 Indaboski of Investing \ud83d\ude80 (@eldivyn) August 17, 2021\n\nHi everyone, we\u2019re aware of the recent reports about us. Our legal and government relations teams are looking into it but we thought it was important to let you know that your money remains safe with Bamboo and will always be readily accessible. \u2014 Bamboo (@investbamboo) August 17, 2021\n\nSo far none of the affected companies has come out to refute this claim. This action comes on the back of the recent move by the CBN to stop the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country, and a restriction on these platforms for not being duly registered in April.\n\nAccording to a source from one of the affected companies, they lost a lot of users and deposits after the April announcement. It took a lot of explaining and convincing to get users to trust that their money was safe and the activities of the fintech platform is legal. This recent announcement would cause massive reputational damage.\n\nTechCabal has reached out to the affected fintech companies and is awaiting their comments.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last year, the Nigerian tech industry has been the recipient of seemingly damaging policies, from the crypto ban to NIPOST\u2019s reversed regulations to the Lagos okada ban.\n\nA few days ago, rumours of an intended amendment to the National Information and Technology Development Agency (NITDA) Act 2007 circulated on social media.\n\nIt finally gained traction when a link to the leaked bill was released, and several screenshots of supposedly alarming provisions began to float all over social media.\n\nWhat is in the leaked bill, and how different is it from the subsisting Act? Does NITDA have new powers? Who does this affect? We took a fine-tooth comb through its hairs and found some surprising information.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is NITDA?\n\nNITDA is the agency tasked with creating a framework for the planning, research, development, standardisation, application, coordination, monitoring, evaluation and regulation of Information Technology practices in Nigeria.\n\nThe Agency is currently under the purview of the Ministry of Information and Digital Economy. As part of its mandate, it provides regulations regarding data protection, registration of domination names, IT Clearance, among others.\n\nWhat powers does NITDA have?\n\nUnder the current Act, the Agency itself has no powers. On the other hand, NITDA\u2019s Board is clothed with five powers, none containing any hint of these new powers.\n\nWhat the Agency does have is a host of functions which increase from 14 to 24 in the leaked bill.\n\nIf this proposed bill is anything to go by, NITDA appears to be gearing up for a more active, albeit forceful reign.\n\nHas the bill been passed?\n\nNo, it has not. The National Assembly (NASS) has not received the bill as of yet.\n\nHowever, In March 2021, Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi, the Agency\u2019s DG, \u201cpresented a proposal for the realignment of \u2018NITDA Act 2007\u2019 with the tenets and ideals of Digital Economy Policy of the current administration, and indeed, the 4th Industrial Revolution before the relevant committees of both chambers of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nWho leaked the NITDA bill?\n\nThere is currently no accurate information as to who leaked the bill. It began circulating on social media, and conversations sprung up in dismay, anger, and disappointment. So far, attention has been paid to the provisions in Sections 6, 13, 20, and 27 as they seem to question the importance of ease of doing business to the government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2019, Nigeria ranked 131 out of 190 countries on the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business Index 2020 \u2014 measures the ease of doing business through a comparative assessment of regulatory environments.\n\nWhat does the new bill contain?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA first glance at the leaked bill reveals several new sections, one of which \u2014 Section 6 \u2014is proposing new powers be given to the Agency.\n\nAmong these worrying provisions is a new subsection which gives the Agency the power to \u201center premises, inspect, seize, seal, detain and impose administrative sanctions on erring persons and companies who contravene any provision of the Act subject to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nNITDA will also have the power to \u201cfix licencing and authorisation charges, collect fees and penalties as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions under this Act.\u201d\n\nThis bill would also introduce a new regime of licences and penalties.\n\nSection 20 would give NITDA power to issue regulations regarding licences and authorisations for operators in the information technology and digital economy sector \u2014 which the Agency is to determine.\n\nThese licences are classified into three categories: Product Licence, Service Provider Licence, and Platform Provider Licence.\n\nWith the number of licence regimes which Nigerian startups currently have to subscribe to, is there a possibility that there would be duplicity?\n\nAway from licences, we come to penalties.\n\nWhat are these penalties, and who do they affect?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Daniel Bone from\n\nIf the leaked bill is to be believed, Section 13 says individuals found guilty of failing to comply with NITDA\u2019s rules would be fined not less than \u20a63 million ($7,283.82) or face one-year imprisonment, or both.\n\nOn the other hand, corporate bodies, if found guilty, would be liable to a fine of not less than \u20a630 million ($72,832.21). The \u2018principal officers\u2019 of the companies might also be imprisoned for two years or more.\n\nReferencing its proposed search powers, individuals or corporations that contravene the provision would be fined not less than \u20a63 million ($7,283.82) and \u20a630 million ($72,832.21), respectively. Prison terms range from a year to two for individuals and members within a corporate body.\n\nSurprisingly, there seems to be an error on offences with no penalties under the Act. In a preceding subsection, the leaked bill proposes a fine not exceeding \u20a630,000,000 ($72,832.21).\n\nOn the same subject, in a directly succeeding paragraph, it then provides for fines not exceeding \u20a63,000,000 ($7,283.82) and \u20a65,000,000 ($12,138.87) for first and subsequent offenders, respectively.\n\nWhat else is different in this bill?\n\nA good starting point is the penalties placed on offences. Under the current Act, first-time offenders are liable to at least one year imprisonment or a fine of \u20a6200,000 ($485.55), or both.\n\nFor subsequent offenders they are liable to at least two years imprisonment, a fine of \u20a6500,000 ($1,213.89), or both.\n\nThe leaked bill suggests an expansion of these penalties and no longer requires NITDA to collaborate with the Standards Organisation of Nigeria to enforce its regulations.\n\nOther new provisions include a broadened section on the functions of the Minister of Information and Digital Economy, new sections on administrative redress processes, rulemaking processes, and the establishment of a Digital Infrastructure and Service Provision Company \u2014 Galaxy Backbone\n\nWhat is Galaxy Backbone?\n\nA look at the provision regarding the establishment of Galaxy Backbone reveals an interesting angle. One of the members of the Board is to be a representative of the Jigawa State Government.\n\nA look at Galaxy Backbone\u2019s website reveals no connection to the Jigawa State Government. It is an information technology and shared service provider wholly owned by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nAfter a more in-depth search, the name Galaxy Information Technology and Telecommunication (GITT) cropped up. The company, which provides a wide range of communication services, was founded by Ibrahim Saminu Turaki, former Governor of Jigawa State, in 2001.\n\nWhile the names are somewhat similar, there is seemingly no connection between the two companies.\n\nHowever, several tweets by different Twitter users suggest a relationship between the two companies.\n\nGalaxy Information Technology and Telecommunications Limited started as a Dutse-based ISP in 2001 and morphed into what is now Galaxy Backbone. The Federal Government and Jigawa State Government co-owned 51% while private stakeholders held 49%.\n\n\n\n*waltzes back to vacation mode* \u2014 'Gb\u00e9nga \u1e62\u1eb9\u0300san (@gbengasesan) August 16, 2021\n\nTech-wise, Jigawa state was ahead of its time. As far back as the early 2000s, Dutse, Hadejia and parts of Kazaure had metro Wifi.\n\n\n\nThey setup Galaxy Backbone, which OBJ was so impressed with that he told them they HAD to sell it to the FG (and in return, FG will host and use\u2026 \u2014 SuperSanusi (@supersanusi) August 17, 2021\n\nWhat is the National Information Technology Development Fund\n\n\n\n\n\n1st Image: Current Act, 2nd Image: Leaked Bill\n\nA major sticking point has been the NITDA fund as contained in the leaked bill.\n\nThe fund is to be financed in four specific ways. The first is a levy of 1% of the profit before tax of companies and enterprises contained in the Third Schedule of the bill with an annual turnover of \u20a6100,000,000 ($242,777.37) and above, which is tax-deductible.\n\nOther avenues include gifts, endowments, and grants-in-aid.\n\nIntriguingly, this is unchanged from the current Act. Several questions arise. Is NITDA implementing it currently? Are there issues with the current execution strategy? How does it plan to implement this?\n\nThe expanded powers of the Agency in Section 6 and the provision of penalties \u2014 not currently contained in the NITDA Act \u2014 suggest an answer.\n\nOther provisions such as the need for a pre-action notice, tax exemptions, and limitations to suits, uses of the fund remain unchanged\n\nWhich companies will pay the levy?\n\nUnder the current Act, the companies are:\n\nGSM Service Providers and all Telecommunications companies;\n\nCyber Companies and Internet Provider;\n\nPensions Managers and pension-related companies\n\nBanks and other Financial Institution\n\nInsurance Companies\n\nAs contained in the leaked bill, these companies are\n\nmobile and fixed telecommunications companies,\n\ninformation technology, e-commerce companies,\n\ndigital platform operators and providers,\n\nforeign digital platforms targeting the Nigerian market,\n\npensions managers and pension-related companies,\n\nbanks, financial institutions and companies providing financial services using information technology tools,\n\ninsurance companies, and\n\nsuch other companies and enterprises as determined by regulations from time to time by the Agency.\n\nEssentially, startups or companies in the above list will be affected if this bill is passed into law.\n\nThe way forward\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese draconian rules, if this exact bill is eventually submitted and passed into law by the National Assembly, could spell hard times for the Nigerian startup scene.\n\nThis is coming at a time when the Nigerian Startup Bill \u2014 a joint initiative by Nigeria\u2019s tech startup ecosystem and the Presidency to harness the potential of the digital economy through co-created regulations \u2014 is being prepared to be placed before NASS.\n\nAs contained on the website, \u201cThe Bill will ensure that Nigeria\u2019s laws and regulations are friendly, clear, planned and work for the tech ecosystem. This, we believe, will contribute to the creation of an enabling environment for growth, attraction and protection of investment in tech startups.\u201d\n\nIs there a possibility that the Nigerian Startup Bill might be declared dead on arrival if the leaked NITDA bill is published?\n\nIn July 2021, Flutterwave announced the appointment of a Regulatory and Government Relations Officer. Chances are, we may see this trend continue, with startups and companies taking pre-emptive steps to engage the government.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nRecently, Shalom Jare Ventures Limited wrote petitions to the Edo State Government, Inspector-General of Police in Abuja and Commissioner of Police in Edo over alleged land grabbing, malicious damage and robbery by suspected banditry squad of Ovbokhan Igbinovia, the Ohen of Okhuoromi Village, demanding for investigation and prosecution of the alleged culprits. The petitions which dated 17th August, 2021; May 27th, 2021 and May 17th, 2021 and signed by Efosa Aguebor (Operation Manager, Shalom Jare) and O.A Otamere Esq, Counsel to the claimants respectively, were titled \u201cReport of Land grabbing, malicious damage and robbery by banditry squad of Ovbokhan Igbinovia, the Ohen of Okhuoromi: Request for investigation and prosecution of culprits; Re: Bandits in our clients farmland in Edo State: Request for urgent arrest of leaders of the group and Complaints of threat of violence, malicious damage to property, assault/harassment of farmers and malicious damage to palm crops: Request to invite culprits for interrogation and removal of caravan placed on the frontage of the plot of Shalom Jare Ventures Ltd\u201d The company claimed that the alleged actions of Okhuoromi has violated the Enrolment Of Order Motion Exparte in Suit No. B/407/18, dated 17th, May, 2021 and issued by the presiding judge, Justice M.O. Ighodalo (now deceased), hence, the recent protest by the company.\n\nBut in a swift reaction, a Legal luminary clears air on the controversies surrounding the recent allegations of land grabbing levelled against the Ohen Ovbokhan Igbinovia of Okhuoromi Village in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. In this encounter with Idahosa Moses and Oise Monday, Prince Peter Uwadiae, Esq, Counsel to Ohen Ovbokhan and Okhuoromi, submits from the points of law, why those alleging should not be taken seriously.\n\nExcerpt:\n\nIndeed, the law that creates a court also encapsulates or embedded that same court with the authority to punish anybody that infrared on the authority and jurisdiction of the court. What I mean by this is that, assuming without considering that there is a violation of the court order, the court has the mechanism to discipline anybody that has contempted it.This particular issue is very disturbing that Shalom Jare Ventures Limited would hold anybody from Okhuoromi responsible or said to had been in breached of any order of court. Let me just quickly say this, the hostility between Okhuoromi and Shalom Jare started in 2018. Prior to 2018, in 2017 particularly on the 4th of January, 2017. After His Royal Majesty, the Oba of Benin had adjudicated over the matter between Okhuoromi, Egbirhe and Akuse, he delegated his functionaries to go and demarcate the boundary between Okhuoromi and Aruogba on one part, and Okhuoromi and Egbirhe on the other part.\n\nThe day the representatives of His Royal Majesty went to carry out that boundary demarcations, person\u2019s from Okhuoromi, Egbirhe and Aruogba were there present. It was the Oba\u2019s representatives that created the boundaries between Aruogba and Okhuoromi and Okhuoromi and Egbirhe. From that 4th of January, 2017, the portion of the land has been adjudged to be that of Okhuoromi and Okhuoromi took possession of that part of Land from that particular day. But, for the avoidance of doubt, there was no work of Shalom Jare going-on on this part of the land and not even a single Palm tree was being harvested by them. It was a bush and palm trees that were unproduced were in the area.\n\nFrom the day Okhuoromi took over the portion of the land, there was no problem until sometime in 2018 , after a year and six months that Shalom Jare went to file action in court and it is a law that when a particular claimant approach a court and file for an interim injunction, the court has not had the opportunity of hearing the other party, the court may grant an interim injunction. But in our law too, that interim injunction is to last only for 14 days. When they got the interim injunction in 2018, we have not been served with any court process. Eventually, we were served with the processes filed in court and we filed our defense. When we filed our defense, the Judge that was handling the issue that time, Late Justice Ighodalo, said that from the processes filed by the defendants, there was no need to continue with interlocutories. The court did not considered their interlocutory injunction. By the application of the law, from that moment, the interim injunction which they are parading up till today ceases to exist; ( It dies a natural death).\n\nAssuming without considering that it did no die 14 days after it grant, it dies when the court refused to grant the interlocutory injunction. From that moment, there was no inhibition of any kind because, before the hostilities even started, Okhuoromi were already in possession of the land. By the operation of the law, even if there is an interim injunction or interlocutory injunction and the status quo ante belon is to be maintained. What is the status quo ante belon as at the time hostility started? It shows or suffice to say that the status quo ante belon before hostility started is what was in existence before the case was filed in court. As at 2018 when Shalom Jare filed their action in court, this portion of land was already being in possession of Okhuoromi for over a year and six months following the demarcation done by HRM\n\nAgain, the law is also very clear that when a judge that granted an injunction or any order ceases to be the judge presiding over that matter, every order granted by him ceases to exist because the case is starting De Novo. There are Appeal and Supreme Courts authorities on it. Ngige Vs Obi is one of the cases, that once there is a change of a judge hearing a matter and the case starts De Novo and being held by another judge, every order granted by the previous judge ceases to exist. So, what Shalom Jare is still parading as an order has ceased to exist with the demise of the judge that granted it. Assuming it did not ceases to exist after 14 days, there is no interlocutory order granted by the court.\n\nNow as we stand, this case is pending in court and between the time that Justce Ighodalo died and the case was re-assigned to another judge, there was nothing whatsoever stopping Okhuoromi from taken over possession of what has been rightly adjudged to be their own. However, let me quickly say this, the case is pending in court, it has not been adjudged to be property of Shalom Jare by any court of competent jurisdiction. They filed the matter in court and they are aware that the matter that is still pending in court has been fixed for October this year for hearing.\n\nBesides that, there is a judgement from a court of competent jurisdiction that was delivered by the former Chief Judge of Edo State, Honourable Justice Esther Edigin rtd. And what the former CJ said in that judgement is that the Judgement of HRM which was the traditional Arbitration that looks into such cases prevails and still prevail up till now. If the judgment of the Oba that says a particular piece of land is that of Okhuoromi, that same judgement has been reaffirmed by a court of competent jurisdiction, who is now in contempt? Is it Shalom Jare or Okhuoromi? I will venture to say that Shalom Jare does not have any claim to that land.\n\nFunny enough, while the case that led to the judgment of rtd Justice Edigin was pending , their own case was also pending. And I told the court then that this their claimed land is a fraction, an integral part of the case pending before the then CJ. The court advised Shalom Jare that look, there is a case pending that is more elaborate, embracing this particular land in another court. Why don\u2019t you (Shalom Jare) withdraw yours and join this particular case that is pending in court 1 then. Other persons that have similar cases withdrew their own. A Senior Advocate of Nigeria , Dan Okoh, SAN, was doing a case for Eboigbe Ages Water in another court and when he got to know that this particular court that is handling this particular case was all embracing and pending before Court 1, he withdrew his case in court 10 and filed a joinder and joined the case that was more embracing. And the case was holistically heard. But that advise was not taken by Shalom Jare.\n\nNow, there is a judgement that deals with the entire land including this their land in dispute then. Again, assuming without preempting the judgment because it subjundice of the court in charge of this matter, I want to also say this, they have been written petitions to the police and we have gone to the police and let the police know that once a case is pending in the court, it is subjundice and the police do not have the right to investigate a case that a court of competent jurisdiction is handling. Assuming without considering that there was an order of court that has not been obeyed, is it not the same court that granted the order that should punish for it? Does the police have the right to now go and be investigating a case that the Court is handling? That is the big question!\n\nI do not expect a lawyer worth it salt to tell the police to come and intervene in a matter that is subjundice. It is an aberration, unheard of, unethical and very shameful for that to happen. I watch their protest on Television, and the persons who were even demonstrating are not Shalom Jare Ventures, but representatives of Shalom Jare. And what Shalom Jare is even saying you is that, I mean by their pleading they are not even in occupation of the land in dispute. They rented the place out to somebody and yet you filed an action as a company. Now the area they said their business is, from a reliable source, they have sold a lager potion of it allegedly to a company who have even gone into demolishing the place. I will want journalists to visit the area in question wether there is any human activities on the entire land including the one they bought from Aruogba.\n\nSo, it is very disturbing, most embarrassing, illegal and shameful on the part of these persons who do not want to respect the law. They want to take the law unto them and be the judge in their own case. A case that is pending in court, you claim that the land is your own whereas you have filed an action in court for the court to determine the ownership. The court has not pronounced on it. Whereas there is also subsisting judgment that encompassed the entire land. The people that have the judgment are not shouting, they are still saying okay we will follow you to the end of the case you have filed in court. I will say that these people should know what to do and do it in a civilised way. We are not in a lawless society and they can not resort to self help when they have already submitted to the jurisdiction of a court. That is my position.\n\n...",

          "text": "Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, has berated President Muhammadu Buhari over his latest move to create grazing reserves for Fulani herdsmen across the country.\n\nBuhari had on Thursday, announced the approval for a committee to review \u2018with dispatch\u2019 the 368 grazing sites across 25 states in the country, a move that has been opposed by many Nigerians.\n\nReacting to the decision in a statement through his spokesman Terver Akase on Friday, Ortom said it has now become clear that the presidency wants to plunge the country into avoidable crisis.\n\n\u201cWe were shocked and disappointed to read a statement from the Presidency indicating that President Muhammadu Buhari has approved recommendations of a committee to review \u2018with dispatch,\u2019 368 grazing sites, across 25 states in the country, to determine the levels of encroachment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn a country where insecurity has reached an all-time high with hundreds being killed by armed herdsmen, bandits and other terrorists, the Presidency is only bordered about animals and their safety and is deploying all machinery and arsenals of government to impose grazing reserves and cattle routes on Nigerians. This is unacceptable!\n\n\u201cIt is now clear that the presidency wants to plunge the country into avoidable crisis. Otherwise, what is the justification for President Buhari\u2019s insistence that grazing reserves be established across the country when Nigerians have openly kicked against the policy and have embraced ranching in place of open grazing?\u201d\n\nThe statement noted that millions of Nigerians have been displaced following attacks by armed herders and are currently suffering in IDP camps, stressing that Benue state for instance has over 1.5 million displaced people with thousands living in camps and many more forced to flee their ancestral lands to stay under dehumanizing conditions in open fields.\n\nIt added, \u201cThe Buhari administration does not seem to be worried about the food crisis already ravaging the country. Farmers have been chased into IDP camps by herders and children are dying of starvation, yet what is more important to their President is the well being of cows.\n\n\u201cWe expected the pitiable condition of the displaced people to be the preoccupation of the President whom they voted in 2015 and 2019. It is unfortunate that the people\u2019s love, trust and votes for Mr President are being rewarded with hate, cruelty and dictatorial policies aimed at grabbing their lands to donate to herders and cows.\n\n\u201cWhat is the difference between the Buhari administration\u2019s approach to insecurity and the Taliban agenda in Afghanistan? It is now evident that the government at the centre prioritizes the welfare of cattle over human beings and is bent on taking Nigeria back to the precolonial era. The country has been turned to a cow republic by the present administration.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government introduced the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) and Nigerians accepted the policy. Why has the Buhari administration dumped the programme and opted for grazing reserves and cattle routes?\n\n\u201cGovernor Samuel Ortom has repeatedly stated that there is no land for grazing reserves or cattle routes in Benue State. Though the Federal Government craftily concealed the names of states where Mr President has ordered that grazing reserves be foisted on the people, we wish to categorically state that no part of Benue will be allocated for grazing reserves or cattle routes!\n\n\u201cIf President Buhari must actualize his cattle agenda in Benue State, he should be ready to kill all of us! We know that grazing reserves and cattle routes are the only project that the President has for Nigeria, but Benue is not interested in such a project.\u201d",

We will and our generations unborn will remain grateful to him for this historic and memorable signing of the Petroleum Industry Bill into law.\n\n\u201cWe really appreciate his sincere love for our region as seen in his influence on the National Assembly to ensure the holistic and robust debate and also inclusion of all stakeholders in the process of passing the PIB into law.\n\n\u201cIt is also gratifying to state at this juncture that President Buhari being a man with a human heart went on to rewrite the wrongs done to our region and to reposition it for a new beginning of development. This is what our own son and brother former president Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, a son of the region, could not do.\n\n\u201cJonathan, whom we had hope on as Commander-in-Chief for six years and Diezani Allison Madueke was minister of petroleum and daughter of the region could not pass the PIB into law despite that the PDP was in majority in the National Assembly, to alleviate suffering of the people.\n\n\u201cThis is a beginning, and instead of fighting over this we should commend the President for his magnanimity, and other prominent leaders who have played a very critical roles to ensure passage and signing off the bill into law, these include the minister of state for petroleum and also the deputy president of the senate.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to state here that it is unbecoming of Chief EK Clark and his PANDEF for unnecessary and unguarded utterances on the pages of newspapers and television stations over the PIB and pressure mounted on President Buhari, why is it that Clarke and his group never came up with PANDEF to mount pressure on Jonathan to pass PIB into law, and where was Seriake Dickson who was in House of Reps and was later Governor of Bayelsa State for eight years and only Ijaw speaking governor to rally round to ensure the PIB was passed into law by Jonathan but only now is using disparaging comments on Chief Timipre Sylva?\n\n\u201cThe RNDA which is agitating for the overall development of the Niger Delta region condemns in totality PANDEF\u2019s position for attacking and criticizing Mr President for assenting to the PIB over the 3% per cent for the oil producing communities.\n\n\u201cWe want to use this medium to warn trouble makers in the region trying to use this PIB 3% per cent issue to cause problem in the creeks to quickly retrace their steps now and withdraw from whatever useless and meaningless threat statements declared before now.\u201d",

          "text": "Despite Nigerians\u2019 opposition, the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government\u2019s determination on carving up grazing routes and reserves for herdsmen across 25 states is a final offensive on the people, according to Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State.\n\nNEWS DIRECT reports that Ortom asked in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary Terver Akase in Makurdi, \u201cWhat is the difference between the Buhari administration\u2019s approach to insecurity and the Taliban agenda in Afghanistan?\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, August 19, the President approved suggestions from a commission to investigate 368 grazing locations across 25 states \u201cwith dispatch\u201d to \u201cindicate the degree of encroachment.\u201d\n\nThe Governor described the Presidency\u2019s announcement as shocking and disheartening, noting that it was evident that the Presidency sought to throw the country into an unneeded crisis.\n\nThis, he claims, is because Buhari had no rationale for insisting on building cattle reserves and channels, which went against widely established ranching policy.\n\nOrtom, in the statement, said, \u201cmillions of Nigerians have been displaced following attacks by armed herders and are currently suffering in IDP camps. Benue State for instance has over 1.5 million displaced people with thousands living in camps and many more forced to flee their ancestral lands to stay under dehumanizing conditions in open fields.\n\n\u201cThe Buhari administration does not seem to be worried about the food crisis already ravaging the country. Farmers have been chased into IDP camps by herders and children are dying of starvation in addition to being denied education, yet what is more important to the President is the wellbeing of cows.\n\n\u201cWe expected the pitiable condition of the displaced people to be the preoccupation of the President whom they voted in 2015 and 2019. It is unfortunate that the people\u2019s genuine show of love, trust and votes for the President are being rewarded with hate, cruelty and dictatorial policies aimed at grabbing their lands to donate to herders and cows.\u201d\n\nThe Benue governor maintained that it was now evident that Buhari prioritizes the welfare of cattle over human beings and is bent on taking Nigeria back to the precolonial era with some snippets of a society where in the words of Thomas Hobbes, life has become \u2018solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\u2019.\n\nHe lamented that the country has been turned to a cow republic by the Buhari administration where basic principles of equality, justice, fairness and equity which engender peace and suppress anarchy are now non-existent.\n\nOrtom said, \u201cPresident Buhari has refused to prove wrong, those who accuse him of being a Fulani President. He has instead proven that he indeed belongs to somebody. But Buhari is not the first Fulani man to be President of this country.\n\n\u201cNigeria had Presidents Shehu Shagari and Umaru Yar\u2019Adua who were also of Fulani ethnicity; but were Presidents for all Nigerians and treated citizens of this country fairly and equitably.\n\n\u201cOur country has never been more divided on ethnic lines and sentiments as it is under President Buhari who was thought to be the most prepared to lead the country at this time. Under President Shagari and President Yar\u2019Adua, Nigerians were not chided by a horde of presidential spokesmen and social media hirelings for simply expressing their views on government policies.\u201d",

          "text": "Samuel Kyaahu, 46, lives in a makeshift tent with his wife and three children. It is from the confines of that small space that they find ways to navigate uncertainty and adapt to a new normal.\n\nFour years ago, they were displaced from their village in Torkula along with many others and fled to the Mbawa Internally Displaced Peoples Camp in Daudu \u2013 a satellite town along the Makurdi-Lafia highway.\n\nThe camp, provided by international NGO Medecins Sans Frontiers, has tents for over 10,000 internally displaced persons, a health centre, and access to water and sanitation services, among other things.\n\nREAD ALSO: The Devastating Flood That Left Taraba Residents In Distress\n\nBut it is not home.\n\nThe IDPs want to return to the homes they were forced to flee and need the help of the government to rebuild, resettle and plan for a better future.\n\n\u201cI have three children here with me and they do not go to school. They are here suffering with me. I think tomorrow will be worse than this,\u201d Samuel says, expressing fears for his children\u2019s future under the circumstances.\n\nSamuel and his family are not alone in this appeal. Comfort Bako who is pregnant with her 7th child says there is nowhere like home, if only security is assured.\n\n\u201cIf the government can help us to stop the fight so that everyone can go back to their homes and work, we will be able to struggle as we were doing before to get something to take care of the children,\u201d she says in pidgin English.\n\nAt the camp, there are many weary faces \u2013 from the aged to distressed mothers; all worrying about what to eat with their families and how to educate their children, a situation that gets tougher with each passing day.\n\nFeeding is a major challenge for the IDPs. Due to the large population at the camp, the government\u2019s food supplies are never enough. To supplement this, some of the IDPs resort to cooking almost-spoiled or perishing food items sourced from dealers in the local market.\n\n\u201cFor the issue of food, the government is trying,\u201d says Camp Manager Comfort Alugah. \u201cBut the government cannot satisfy everybody.\u201d\n\nMrs Alugah attributes the challenge to the population at the camp which she put at 43,344.\n\nIn terms of health care, the Mbawa IDP camp has a maternal and child health clinic operated by Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF).\n\nThe clinic has been providing care for the babies delivered in the camp and their mothers, with assistance from the Benue State Ministry of Health, ensuring safe delivery after months of antenatal services.\n\nInterventions by the MSF at the camp also include the provision of emergency primary health care, emergency water and sanitation services, and shelter.\n\n\u201cWe have also recently included programmes of reproductive health, and sexual and gender-based violence response,\u201d says Project Coordinator MSF, Benue State, Prosper Ndumuraro.\n\nMSF, which provides such medical intervention across the state, says the IDPs are doing better than when they first came to the camp but a lot more needs to be done.\n\nThe IDPs, while grateful to be alive, will rather bring up their families in their own homes, hence the continuous appeal for government to hasten the resettlement plans.\n\nAn overwhelming task\n\nFor some close observers of the attacks and violence that has displaced a multitude of people in Benue State, going home at this moment is like returning to a den of hungry lions. Many of the IDPs such as Comfort Bako believe the violence has to stop for them to return home and have any shot at a positive future.\n\nGovernor Samuel Ortom is also worried about the plight of the IDPs and the continuing attacks.\n\n\u201cWe never envisaged that we will have 500 IDPs (in Benue) and then it (the figure) will rise to over 1.5 million and we are still counting,\u201d the governor lamented when he visited and IDP camp in Ortese, last week.\n\nWith over a million people now displaced in the state, satisfying the needs of the IDPs have become \u201cextremely difficult\u201d, says the governor, who has called government at all levels to close ranks and provide for the huge number of displaced persons.\n\nWithin the past decade, hundreds of people have fled from attacks, attributed to armed herdsmen, on n rural farming communities within Benue State and are taking refuge in various official and unofficial camps, many with just mosquito nets as shelter.\n\nInterventions from the government and support from humanitarian non-governmental organizations have gone a long way in helping the IDPs combat ailments, diseases, hunger, starvation and a dearth of water supply.\n\nWithin the duration of their stay in different camps, many IDPs have been exposed to new study programs and skill acquisition exercises, however, for many of these individuals, there is still something that leaves them unfulfilled \u2013 they miss their homes.\n\nThrough thick and thin, the IDPs of Benue have a burning desire to return home and the big questions is who will make that possible.",

          "text": "Twice in 10 years, Efrain Soto\u2019s life was shattered in landmine explosions in violence-wracked Colombia. The first one robbed him of his eye, the second one killed his brother.\n\nThe number of landmine victims is rising in Colombia, as guerrilla violence continues despite a 2016 peace accord meant to end decades of armed conflict.\n\nIn the Catatumbo region in northern Colombia, on the border with Venezuela, the sight of people dying or suffering terrible wounds from mines is all too familiar.\n\nSince the explosions, Soto has had a nervous breakdown and seizures.\n\nFor the past eight years, he has been taking medication to help with the psychological trauma, but he is still so distressed that even walking to a nearby village terrifies him.\n\n\u201cI want to cry, I want to run, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d said Soto.\n\nWhile the government has signed a historic peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) to end a long-running civil war, it did not rid the country of guerrillas and violence.\n\nTerritories rife with illegal coca plantations, where the FARC once held sway, are now infested with leftist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries and armed drug traffickers laying landmines indiscriminately.\n\nThe number of people killed or wounded by mines is increasing, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nIn 2020, there were 389 blast victims, compared to 57 in 2017.\n\nDuring the first six months of this year alone, 263 people, including 21 children, were killed or maimed.\n\n\u2013 Lost hope \u2013\n\nIn 2011, Soto was talking to his wife on his mobile phone just yards (meters) from his house when he was shaken by an explosion.\n\nBlood started pouring from his eye.\n\nRelatives made a makeshift stretcher and hammock to take Soto, who is over 6 feet 3 inches (1.94 meters) tall, on a five-hour trek along countryside trails to bring him to a hospital in the regional center of Cucuta, where he spent four months in treatment.\n\nIn April of last year, Soto\u2019s 41-year-old brother Carlos accidentally set off another landmine, and the ordeal was repeated.\n\n\u201cRunning away, looking for the hammock, rushing to the village again, and he was bleeding,\u201d Soto recalled.\n\nWhen Carlos arrived at the village of Tibu, still some ways away from Cucuta, \u201chis lips were purple\u201d and he died, Soto said.\n\nSince the peace deal, Colombia has de-mined 448 out of its 1,122 municipalities, but there are 137 that \u201cdo not have the necessary conditions\u201d to be rendered safe, said the office of Colombia\u2019s High Commissioner for Peace.\n\nCatatumbo is in that group, with violence an ongoing scourge in the area.\n\nNo sooner had Soto overcome his grief from his brother\u2019s death, he was randomly shot in the stomach and spent another month in hospital in Cucuta.\n\nSoto says he has lost hope of seeing peace in Colombia.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Phantom limb\u2019 \u2013\n\nIn April, Ivan Rodriguez was cutting down a tree when he heard a blast and was engulfed by \u201csmoke and earth.\u201d\n\nThe 24-year-old managed to stay \u201cconscious\u201d and \u201ccalm\u201d during the near three hours it took him to reach a hospital.\n\nRodriguez lost his right foot and came close to having his injured arm amputated.\n\nWith little medical supervision, he is now recovering at home with help from his wife and five-year-old son.\n\nRodriguez is suffering from a phantom limb, a condition in which a person vividly perceives and feels pain from a lost limb.\n\nHe hopes to get a \u201cprosthesis to be able to walk\u201d and play football again.\n\nHis 23-year-old wife, Paola Acuna, marvels at his bravery.\n\n\u201cRather than us giving him strength, he gives a lot to us,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the same anymore,\u201d explained Rodriguez. \u201cBut I try to keep going because why make yourself feel even worse when you know the foot won\u2019t grow back.\u201d\n\nWith over 2,200 dead and more than 8,000 wounded between 1999 and 2017, according to watchdog Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor, Colombia is one of the countries worst affected by landmines after Syria and Afghanistan.",

          "text": "As Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, Islamist groups waging insurgencies in Africa were quick to celebrate.\n\n\u201cGod is great,\u201d a media outlet linked to Somalia\u2019s al-Shabab wrote in response to the takeover.\n\nElsewhere, the leader of al-Qaeda affiliate Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) used his first public message since 2019 to congratulate the Taliban.\n\n\u201cWe are winning,\u201d Iyad Ag Ghaly said, drawing comparisons between the withdrawal of foreign troops in Afghanistan and France\u2019s decision to reduce its military presence in West Africa\u2019s Sahel region.\n\nAnd it is not just Africa\u2019s Islamist fighters who have been seeing parallels with Afghanistan.\n\nFrom Somalia in the east to Nigeria in the west, newspapers have published articles and citizens have taken to social media to share their concerns.\n\nIf a wake-up call was needed for African governments heavily reliant on foreign support in their fight against Islamist insurgents, then the Taliban\u2019s seizure of Afghanistan is likely to be it.\n\nSince 2012, Mali \u2013 one of Africa\u2019s biggest countries \u2013 has been battling various jihadist groups in its northern and central regions.\n\nIt has had to rely on French troops and UN peacekeepers to keep the militants from taking control.\n\nHowever, the presence of soldiers from the former colonial power has been unpopular with some Malians, as well as some in France.\n\nIn June, France announced the drawdown of its forces, reducing their numbers to 2,500-3,000 by early next year.\n\nThere is concern that Malian troops, who are often poorly trained and ill-equipped, will not be able to contain Islamist groups.\n\nChildren seat by their shelter in Goudebou, a camp that welcomes more than 11,000 Malian refugees in northern Burkina Faso, on International Refugee Day on June 20, 2021.\n\n\u201cMany people are afraid because the situation is likely to be the same [as Afghanistan],\u201d says Bouraima Guindo, editor-in-chief of Mali\u2019s Le Pays newspaper.\n\n\u201cThe presence of those foreign soldiers is very necessary because if they leave tomorrow, the situation will be more dangerous.\u201d\n\nLike other publications in Mali, Le Pays has called on the country\u2019s leaders to do more to strengthen its armed forces.\n\nThere is also concern in Somalia, which has drawn some of the strongest comparisons to Afghanistan.\n\nSomalia suffered state collapse and decades of civil war before an insurgency by the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Shabab group began in the mid-2000s.\n\nThe internationally backed government has struggled to regain control of much of the country and is reliant on African Union troops operating under a UN Security Council mandate.\n\nThe goal has been to uproot the militants while giving the government time to build institutions.\n\nBut as in Afghanistan, there have been widespread accusations of corruption. There have also been clashes in the capital this year over delayed elections, which saw parts of the security forces turn on each other.\n\nThese issues have raised doubts over Somalia\u2019s state-building project.\n\nIlham Gassar, a political advisor to the UN mission in Somalia, says international partners had been focusing on destroying al-Shabab, not developing a strong state.\n\n\u201cThe focus was never to make the average Somali\u2019s life better and to create systems of sustainability,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Somali government was meant to take the lead on security operations by the end of this year, but that looks unlikely due to questions over the army\u2019s capability.\n\nSamira Gaid, head of Somali security think-tank Hiraal Institute, says Somali forces are even less prepared to halt a potential militant offensive than those in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cSomali security forces have not received 0.005% of what the Afghan security forces have received,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cTangible support towards the rebuilding of the Somali security forces has been minimal. Somalia is still under an arms embargo, so we are unable to purchase the type of weaponry that Afghanistan had.\u201d\n\nBut even in Somalia the focus has shifted to how and when to end foreign assistance.\n\nThe EU has already started cutting back its funding, and the government is running out of time to get itself ready to be self-sufficient.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, Islamist movements in Africa have flourished in countries where they have been able to capitalise on weak state institutions, a lack of services like education and healthcare, and issues with poverty.\n\nThese factors led to the emergence of insurgents in Mozambique\u2019s Cabo Delgado region, and were used by groups in West Africa as a way to recruit fighters and gain public support.\n\nIn some cases, insurgents have stepped in to provide services and better justice in communities, which has helped them gain legitimacy.\n\nFrance is reducing its military presence in Africa\u2019s Sahel region.\n\nThere is a general acceptance across Africa that military operations will not be enough to eradicate violent extremism and that more needs to be done to find political solutions \u2013 perhaps even negotiating with insurgents.\n\nBut security expert Fulan Nasrullah says it would be a shock if any of the Islamist groups in West Africa were to capture a state and hold it.\n\n\u201cPeople should not interpret Africa or every other jihadi Islamist group through the prism of what just happened in Afghanistan \u2013 the contexts are different but there are a few similarities,\u201d he says.\n\nThe groups fighting in West Africa are not a cohesive force like the Taliban, they are a mixture of various militias, whose goals sometimes align but not always and increasingly the global contest between IS and al-Qaeda has seen their affiliates fighting each other.\n\nWest Africa\u2019s Islamist groups \u201cexist in a climate where the state is weak, but they are weaker than the weak states\u201d, Mr Nasrullah says.\n\nIt is too soon to know how developments in Afghanistan might affect policy in Africa. But the conversation has begun on how to ensure a better exit for foreign powers.\n\nComfort Ero, from the International Crisis Group think-tank, says there are \u201cimmediate lessons\u201d to be learned.\n\nShe says there is a \u201cperennial problem of governments mired in corruption, heavily dependent on foreign/external support, with little or sometimes flimsy legitimacy at home, so that when international support is withdrawn, what we are left with are artificial states unable to extend their remit\u201d.\n\nAmid the shocking scenes of people trying to flee Afghanistan, Ms Gaid says she believes there would be a \u201cpause on the part of international partners\u201d to ensure there were not similar situations in countries like Somalia.\n\n\u201cIt will be more staggered, and they will be more deliberate about an eventual exit,\u201d she says.\n\nBBC",

          "title": "In Kabul, A Fearful Wait for US to Deliver on Evacuation Vow",
          "text": "Tens of thousands of people in Afghanistan waited nervously on Saturday to see whether the United States would deliver on President Joe Biden\u2019s new pledge to evacuate all Americans and all Afghans who aided the war effort, as U.S. helicopters plucked people from locations beyond the teeming, chaotic Kabul airport and its Taliban checkpoints.\n\nTime is running out ahead of Biden\u2019s Aug. 31 deadline to withdraw most remaining U.S. troops, and the president on Friday night did not commit to extending it. He faces growing criticism as videos depict pandemonium and occasional violence outside the airport, and as vulnerable Afghans who fear the Taliban\u2019s retaliation send desperate pleas not to be left behind.\n\nThe Gulf nation of Bahrain on Saturday announced it was allowing flights to use its transit facilities for the evacuation, an option that should ease pressure after the U.S. faced issues Friday with its facilities at Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar rapidly filling up. The backlog forced flights from the Kabul international airport to stop for several hours.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates, meanwhile, said Saturday it would host up to 5,000 Afghans \u201cprior to their departure to other countries.\u201d\n\nTens of thousands of Afghan translators and others, and their close family members, seek evacuation after the Taliban\u2019s shockingly swift takeover of Afghanistan in a little over a week\u2019s time. The fall of Kabul marked the final chapter of America\u2019s longest war, which began after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.\n\nOn Friday, a defense official said about 5,700 people, including about 250 Americans, were flown out of Kabul aboard 16 C-17 transport planes, guarded by a temporary U.S. military deployment that\u2019s building to 6,000 troops. On each of the previous two days, about 2,000 people were airlifted.\n\nOfficials also confirmed that U.S. military helicopters flew beyond the Kabul airport to scoop up 169 Americans seeking to evacuate. No one knows how many U.S. citizens remain in Afghanistan, but estimates have ranged as high as 15,000.\n\nSo far, 13 countries have agreed to host at-risk Afghans at least temporarily, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. Another 12 have agreed to serve as transit points for evacuees, including Americans and others. About 300 evacuees arrived Friday night from Qatar at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany, one transit point for people being taken to the U.S., the American military said.\n\nBut the growing question for many other Afghans is, where will they finally call home? Already, European leaders who fear a repeat of the 2015 migration crisis are signaling that fleeing Afghans who didn\u2019t help Western forces during the war should stay in neighboring countries instead. The desperate scenes of people clinging to aircraft taking off from Kabul\u2019s airport have only deepened Europe\u2019s anxiety.\n\nRemaining in Afghanistan means adapting to life under the Taliban, who say they seek an \u201cinclusive, Islamic\u201d government, offer full amnesty to those who worked for the U.S. and the Western-backed government and claim they have become more moderate since they last held power from 1996 to 2001. They say they\u2019ll honor women\u2019s rights within the norms of Islamic law, without elaborating.\n\nBut many Afghans fear a return to the Taliban\u2019s harsh rule in the late 1990s, when the group barred women from attending school or working outside the home, banned television and music, chopped off the hands of suspected thieves and held public executions.",
